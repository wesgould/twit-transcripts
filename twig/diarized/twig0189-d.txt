And get this kids.  Get this kids, both of them, widescreen HD.  Now we've done this in very different ways.  Oh, it just went black.  Oh, that was me, okay.  My eyes are failing.  Gina is on a Mac mini with a dedicated cable modem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you do look fabulous.  Which I know is an oxymoron,  but I mean dedicated in my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody else is using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff is on Fios, right?  At his house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fios is on my Chromebook Pixel,  my older Chromebook Pixel.  What a great camera.  In Ubuntu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's running Kruton and Ubuntu.  And so he's running Linux Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can switch back and forth with two keys  between Chrome OS and Linux OS  where I'm in the land of the lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We just taught him how to use U name.  And in order to do this, he has to use true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He installed Linux on the Chromebook.  Like this is amazing.  I'm so impressed.  I don't mean to sound patronizing or you know,  but like for a guy who accidentally  mutes himself on Skype.  You know, this is pretty impressive.  Sorry.  Oh my God.  No, Jeff, I love you.  I love you to death.  No, I'm so impressed that you installed  that you installed Ubuntu on your Chromebook.  I'm blown away impressed.  You've earned many nerd points.  I gotta give credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gotta give credit because the,  what the Chrome guys did,  this is a Google guys did Kruton.  And all you do is go into Shell,  you type in one command, you sit back.  That's it.  They did it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really glad that's so simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brad Linder's article at lilliputing.com  is the article you followed.  And it does make it very straightforward.  He also talks about putting Android jelly bean on there.  And it turns out because of the bios,  you can boot to anything on a USB key.  So any x86 OS would work.  I guess you'd have to have the drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is true of the Pixel,  not of the other Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Right.  This is something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now me and Leo are dying for a Pixel.  I bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see, you made fun of me.  You did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We mocked you.  And now I'm like, I'm so close to ordering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's because Gina, the thing is,  this is a progression and I've got to write this up.  I've got to write, but if I hadn't been on the Chromebook  for three months using it  and doing really well,  fixed a few problems, doing really well, liking it.  But Leo's right.  It's a netbook.  It's kind of crappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The screen's not great.  The keyboard's not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it worked for me.  But I was really happy in Chrome  because it was easy and direct  and everything I needed to do was there.  And so I was already sold then on Chrome.  Right.  And I was wishing for a slightly better machine.  Well, the slightly better machine didn't come along.  The killer better machine came along.  And I debated, and as I'd said on the show before,  I went to the store and I debated and debated and debated  and Google sent me heroin and a needle  by sending me the machine.  First one's free, Jeff.  And so using it for a while, you just get so,  you first get hooked on the quality of the machine.  The keyboard is pure butter.  I wish I could think as fast as I can type now.  The screen is magnificent.  The type on it is just beautiful  for my old alien eyes.  It's wonderful.  You know, it's just solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what's interesting about Chrome OS on that?  It's running out of RAM.  The entire OS is in memory.  So it really is super, and you have an SSD,  but I mean, that's not even, I mean, it's running out of RAM.  That's pretty amazing.  Four gigs of RAM, right?  Two gigs on the old Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and two gigs on the old Chromebook  was not nearly enough and it would dump pages.  My fear of running Linux on this is that it's gonna take up  too much RAM and make it dump pages on the Chrome side.  But it's only gonna use.  No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, you're using the same kernel.  All you're doing is installing  the GNU stuff on top of it.  Okay.  So it shouldn't be any, it shouldn't, right?  Gina, I don't think it should make any difference.  Linux is very lightweight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  64 gigabytes SSD as well.  That's a bigger drive than I would have expected for  a cloud computer. And a terabyte,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a terabyte of drive, Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's 64 on the LTE version 32 on the WiFi version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right, and you have the LTE version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This leads into the story  that we're gonna be doing shortly,  but it's important too that I think that it shows  the wisdom of Chrome as an operating system  and this kind of machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think Google expects many people to buy this  because it's really expensive.  In fact, as the one I bought, which is the same as yours,  is almost $1,600 after tax.  You have higher tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and I'm not suggesting for a second  this is a mass machine, it's not.  But what it does, and this is a proof of concept.  Right.  About the Chrome operating system.  And it says that you really can,  I can use this machine fully.  The only need I have for my Mac still,  even with the cheap one, was Skype.  We've now solved that.  And the occasional formatting,  I've got to do a Microsoft Word  because some bozo wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I do admit that having Linux in there  makes it a lot more compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  Because now I can put in other applications here.  I can do other things.  Now it helps, this is where it's really not mass.  You know, you've got to be a Linux geek to do that,  but it still shows for the geek world.  And this makes this a very enviable machine now, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So does any of the touch stuff work in Linux?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, probably not.  That's an interesting question.  Although how long before somebody does some patching  to make that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It recognizes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It only recognizes the touch?  Yes.  Does it recognize the touch as a tap?  So you can tap on icons and you went through  and it launches?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  So I heard a rumor somewhere,  I don't know, it may have been in the chat room last week  that someone said something about how like  the Pixel seems to be the machine  that Google sort of made for Googlers.  And apparently Googlers in-house use the Pixel  and dual boot GooOS,  GooGoos, which is basically a Google specific  Linux distro.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it sounds like this is what Googlers are using in-house.  So, you know, it might be right  that this isn't about Mass Appeal.  This is just about, hey, we made ourselves an amazing laptop  and we're just making it available for the super fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's, but it's putting a stake,  a flag in the sand saying Chrome OS is an effective OS.  And if you, the real problem, you know,  I played with the Samsung for a week to review it  from before you buy, which I did yesterday.  And that's where my eyes were open.  I said, you know, actually 90% of what I do,  maybe 99% of what I do is fine.  Exactly.  It's just crappy hardware.  That's the whole point.  Right.  And so, and I tried photo editing.  There's a few things.  So I should emphasize, this is a huge luxury computer  for somebody who already has a real computer.  Yes.  It is, you know, for me, it couldn't be my only computer  because I need to do Lightroom.  I need to do, you know, there's stuff I do on a computer  that I cannot do on Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  I could probably buy a mini for the monitor I have now.  Yeah, there you go.  If I didn't, if my laptop broke, right?  If my MacBook broke.  I could buy that.  If I were willing to do Windows,  there's a lot of cheap stuff I could buy.  Right.  And the main machine.  We're not at the point where this is the only machine.  That would be a little too nerve wracking.  Well, then that's kind of my point,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which makes this at $1,600 a luxury.  250 bucks for a Samsung.  I think Google is, means, well,  it's kind of a disposable computer.  And that's certainly how Google's selling it  with the dog and everything.  Yeah.  In the ads.  But I don't, I wonder why, and I bet you this will happen.  There's not a middle of the road,  a six or $700 decent quality computer running Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was in the sense that the prior Samsungs  were 500 bucks, but they weren't decent enough.  They weren't good enough.  Price was too high on those.  They had to push the price down.  They knew it.  They've got, yeah, you're right.  They've got to come in with a $700 machine  that's a solid, simple laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, I bought the LTE version.  We'll see.  I'm thinking I could probably use it as my,  I have a computer, right now I'm using a Windows machine,  but a dedicated show computer.  And one thing I did learn from using Windows 8  on this machine is that touch is great on a show computer  because I can pinch and zoom  and it's just a really natural way to do stuff  on a computer that I'm using for the show.  And so, the ability to do this is fabulous.  I mean, that's just really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, anytime you're presenting or teaching.  Yes.  Yeah, the touch makes a lot of sense on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I do want a touch screen.  So the Pixel might be a good choice.  It has HDMI out, which we require  for putting it up on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't forget when you get it,  you don't get the touch unless you go into the Chrome flags  and enable that, it's still attached.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that weird that it's not enabled by default?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's just still testing it.  Yeah.  But this all goes, may I leap to the point,  I think is our first story today.  To me, this all goes to the fact that Andy Rubin is out  as the head of Android and Sundar Pichai,  who was the head of Chrome is now the head of both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sundar, the guy who has been advocating Chrome OS for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've been complaining on the show for years  that why do they have the two OSes?  This doesn't make any sense.  What the heck's going on here, right?  And now for the first time,  I think we see that Chrome was able to come into its own  and that's what the Pixel really proves,  is this is not a toy, this is real.  It's a vision for computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about the shuffle at the top.  Big, big story with Andy Rubin out at Android.  Huge story. Still on Google.  Well, okay, well, let's talk about it,  but we're gonna take a break.  This is This Week in Google  and boy do we have the story of the week this week.  Just broke by the way, literally just a few hours ago,  so we're still digesting it, but we'll talk about it.  Andy Rubin out at Android.  Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis,  our show today brought to you by Podio.  O-D-O-Do, O-P-O-D-O-Do.  I am really, we're using Podio  in some many interesting ways here now at Twitter.  P-O-D-I-O, and still I have a hard time  exactly describing what Podio is.  It's a way to bring together all the different pieces  of a project or all the different members of a team  into one workspace that does not abandon  how you currently work.  So when you set up your Podio account,  by the way, it's free to do so, podiopodio.com.  You can log into Google, LinkedIn,  all your different ways you work.  Bring in your teams from your corporate email,  all of that stuff.  You're not abandoning Google Drive.  For instance, we keep all our docs here at Twitter  on Google Drive.  Works fine.  What it does is it combines Google Drive, Gmail,  all the ways you work into a single workspace.  And then you create workspaces based on what you wanna do,  and they have a huge variety  of different workspaces available.  It is a way to get your work into a single space  that gets the job done,  brings the team together.  It's just phenomenal.  Works with all of the, it's just,  the only way you can really understand how this works  is to try it.  So the good news is it costs you nothing.  It's not a free trial, it's free.  podio.com.  Set it up today, do create that workspace,  invite your team in there, and just start using it.  And I think you'll immediately see,  it's got this, kind of like the social media stream.  So you can see what people are,  they call it the activity stream.  There's nothing going on in this new one,  so let me go back to the employee network and you can see.  So there's all these activities going on.  You can see what people are doing.  You can see how they're working.  I wanna, I've been planning to do this  editorial advisory board,  invite people into that to help us out.  There are huge, huge number of apps, free apps.  You can build your own, of course,  but many have done so in every area,  accounting, advertising, creative arts,  and entertainment, education, fashion.  And these apps, pre-built or built by podio users,  give you a huge variety of things.  Yeah, galleries.  Are you a photographer?  Are you an artist?  Do you work with galleries?  Keep track of the galleries you work with.  This should give you some idea  of the kinds of things you can do.  Try it free, podio, legal practice management.  FreshBooks works with it, fundraising, venture capital,  manages investor relationships when raising money.  Are you in a startup?  You gotta use podios.  Get started now with it,  because then it makes it so much easier  when the time comes, when it starts to get complex.  Are you in real estate, property management, brokerage?  These are my managed properties,  tracks payments and commissions, leads.  Oh, it's great for people in sales.  We use it for our sales team.  podio.com, try it today free,  but do make sure you create that first workspace.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I ask Jeff one quick question  about the Pixel before we go on to the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Welcome to This Week in Pixel.  In Pixel.  I'm going to do hip-mo time.  We're hip-mo-tized, that didn't take any time.  Get out your credit card.  I already did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is more just a used question.  So I've got some travel coming up,  and I was actually thinking about  getting sort of a new travel computer.  I was thinking about a MacBook Air,  so I know you got the LTE version of the Pixel,  so you have connectivity wherever you go.  When you travel, when you're out for the day or on the road,  are you taking the Pixel with you?  Are you taking a tablet with you?  I see that it's like three and a half pounds,  which seems pretty light.  My MacBook Pro is like five pounds, and I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is under three.  This Acer, I know you probably wouldn't get  a Windows machine, but look how thin and light that is.  That's the comparison, an under three pounds.  This is the kind of thing you can carry into your arm  like a pad of paper, and that's what I'm looking for.  Now, the battery life on the Pixel is disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, but it hasn't been that bad.  I think if you do video on it, it's gonna be killer.  The answer, well, Gina, let me ask you a two-part answer.  The first part is that I started carrying  the $249 Samsung with me as a rule and on trips,  and it worked.  The only key is you've gotta remember  to open the mail app, the Chrome app,  as opposed to the mail webpage,  before you get on the plane and make sure  that it's synced to your mail before you get on the plane.  There's like an offline app that you can use.  So you have your offline, right.  There's an offline app, it's just easy,  and they've just redesigned it,  and you might love it, you might not.  The other thing is that the drive stuff syncs constantly,  so that's okay.  So that was the important first thing.  Then, yeah, it's a little heavier than that machine was,  but it's still light,  and it's what I travel with all the time.  And I didn't have LTE on that one, obviously.  I had my MiFi with me if I needed that.  Right.  I carry a Nexus 7 still primarily for,  because I have to ride trains.  Yeah, it's a reed.  Well, on the subway, I'll read,  or at night when I'm pissed off  and have had it with the world,  I'll watch Breaking Bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that'll make you pissed off with the world.  Yeah.  Okay, okay.  Are you Breaking Bad, Jeff?  I think you already broke bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a little heavier than your Chromebook,  but it is your travel machine.  It is your travel laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have this little, I have this Merce.  Oh, that's good.  It doesn't fit in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  You would want something to carry it in,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would imagine. Oh, it doesn't fit in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, so instead I have this Uniqlo.  Oh, yeah.  You guys don't have Uniqlo yet.  It's the coolest store.  It's the coolest store, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just New York?  Is it just New York?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so far in the US, yeah.  San Francisco soon.  Uniqlo is a huge Japanese, it's the Ikea of clothes.  It's absolutely amazing.  U-N-I-Q-L-O.  Yes, it's wonderful.  They are online.  They have this incredibly, incredibly light,  that's recent, down and it's all kinds of,  anyway, so I got a briefcase there for 30 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that it was all like,  I thought that it was winter jackets.  For some reason, that was my impression.  That it was all winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only in the winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought, but now that I'm looking at the site,  it's all kinds of clothes.  Okay, we don't have to talk about fashion.  That was all I wanted to ask.  We can move on to the big, the top story this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  NYCMD, NYCMD doctor says that  he takes his Pixel to work and it lasts from nine to five  as long as he keeps it at 40% brightness, no video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, yeah, I mean, I have a feeling  you'll be getting one, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thinking about, I'm trying to visualize myself  at Google I.O.  Do I want a MacBook Air?  Or do I want to be sitting in the audience with a Pixel?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll be getting one at Google I.O.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think?  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Google, you could just give us one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just the Pixel.  Last year, this last year at Davos,  I was thinking about getting a phone or not.  Well, maybe they're gonna get one out.  I don't know.  They didn't even show up at Davos.  So you can't count that chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, Google Now, this is another story later.  We'll get to the Andy Rubin story, I promise.  But Google Now is probably gonna be on that thing soon.  And that, believe it or not, as small as that sounds,  that was another deciding factor for me.  I love that idea.  Notifications from Google Now on your computer is cool.  Notifications you control, yes.  Yeah.  And somebody said, you know what should happen?  Google Now should realize you're about to board a plane  and download your mail in the background.  Ooh, yes.  Yes.  And I bet it will at some point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Yeah, right, because Google Now right now  detects if you're near an airport  and you've got a ticket confirmation, email and Gmail,  it will automatically bring up your barcode to scan in.  So that doesn't seem so crazy  that would auto download your email in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this gets us back to the story  is that Google Now, in a sense,  is the first bridge from Android to Chrome and back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're starting to see a really interesting landscape,  which is, okay, so Andy Rubin,  who has been leading the Android project at Google  since day one, did they not get-  He's hired for it.  He was hired for it.  Yeah, they brought him, I believe.  He created it.  Yeah, he was acquired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His company was acquired, was it not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so Open Handset Alliance is Andy Rubin.  Andy Rubin is Open Handset Alliance.  They say he stepped down.  He was CEO at Danger and then Android.  I mean, this guy is the guy.  He's the guy.  He's the guy.  He is Mr. Android.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my question is, what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you look at the letter from Larry-  Yeah, and no one really knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no answer.  Oh, sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was saying, if you look at the letter from Larry,  you see a lot of praise for Andy,  not in the kind of, that was nice,  but we're glad he's gone way,  really praising him for his vision.  And at the end, Larry says,  I can't wait for your next moonshot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently he's going to be working on the Google moonshot.  Well, moonshots.  10 years, 10, look at it,  a decade Andy Rubin worked on Android,  a decade of his life.  So maybe he's tired.  Maybe he's ready to move on, but I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think this is an endorsement of Sundar  and Chrome as an OS and as a vision,  and that that's the umbrella.  And he made a tough decision that gets in there.  I don't think it's anything against Andy Rubin.  He's done a magnificent job.  But look at Vic.  Vic, right, was all Android  and then went on to Chrome,  which is a high priority for Google.  There is life after life in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the announcement makes it sound  like it was Andy's decision.  Andy is staying within Google.  Just says Andy's decided it's time to hand over the reins  and start a new chapter at Google.  I mean, I know this is all sort of like CEO-  I don't buy it.  You don't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Larry is very good.  And it's very, it's a,  this is a very hard decision for a CEO to make.  Yes.  But I think that he is thinking on a grand strategic scale.  And there is, there's huge significance  in Sundar Pichai taking the role.  And I think that Larry made a strategic decision  and went to Andy and said, look it,  I don't think Andy will be there in six months,  but he probably said, look it,  you could do anything you want at Google,  but what you're not gonna be doing  is running Android after next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the question, isn't it?  What is going on?  There's a reason you put the Chrome OS guy  in charge of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why?  Forget the guys, forget the guys for a second.  You're putting Chrome OS, right,  which we thought was the also ran.  What he's saying is Chrome OS is the strategic future,  that this is the future of computing,  this is the way we're gonna go.  And Android is a part of that vision.  And then when you make that decision,  that's what forces the personnel decision.  I don't imagine, especially at this high level  of strategic level, you don't just say,  I like Sundar better than Andy.  That's not what this is going on.  What if this is somebody who has strategy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you would know, because you are the expert,  what would Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, stop.  But what if all along you've had this horse race  between two OSs?  Because we did wonder why two OSs?  You had this horse race between two OSs,  and this is the declaration, Chrome OS won.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?  It wins the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you don't put it on phones.  You don't put it on phones though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, but this is where you go back to Google now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you say is that there is a computer strategy  that says that everything operates in the web or apps,  and that there's a mushing of lines, right?  I mean, all this, this is not mobile.  This is couch.  So there's a line that goes from laptops to tablets  to mobile devices that blurs utterly.  You're gonna find four inch, five inch, seven inch,  eight inch, nine inch, 10 inch, 12 inch, 13 inch screens.  Where's the line?  Right?  So yeah, there's an operating system question,  but basically what it comes down to  is that I'm using apps to find the lines  that are in the web.  But basically what it comes down to  is that I'm using apps inside Chrome.  I'm using apps inside Android.  It's not gonna be hard to start to regularize those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chrome OS did not win, you guys.  No one uses Chrome OS.  It doesn't make sense.  A lot of people use Chrome.  Lots of people use Chrome, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and by the way, he runs Chrome as well as Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right, he runs Chrome, exactly, which is both.  And Chrome runs on Android.  I mean, like the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it possible that they,  okay, here's the other take on it.  They found something better for Andy to do,  that Android is done.  It's cooked, and maybe we said,  you know what, this guy, brilliant, home run, moonshot.  Let's put him-  Glass for you, baby.  Yeah, maybe put him in glass.  Maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's what I was thinking.  I mean, this whole, you know,  that Andy started something so ambitious,  and it was such a huge deal  that he decided to start Android,  and this is what this, hey, Andy, more moonshots, please.  They wanna put him on something.  He spent 10 years working on Android,  which according to Malcolm Gladwell,  means that Andy's fully baked.  It is now pretty much the best in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, he's got his 10,000 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got his 10,000 hours, right?  They're saying, you know,  we want you to work on something even more ambitious.  You know, Android's fully baked.  It's hugely successful.  It's on track.  We know where that's going.  We have the personnel support it.  We're good.  The Android ecosystem is firmly in place.  Now we wanna put you on something  that's risky and big and ambitious and unproven,  because you've proven that you can do that, right?  So I think putting him on glass  or some other Google X project kind of makes sense.  All right, let's parse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the chat says Andy Rubin's letter to the partners  just went up on the verge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, let's see it.  You'll see it in the chat.  But let's start.  We will start by parsing Larry Page's announcement,  because that's where we're gonna see,  well, I think what Larry is thinking  if we read between the lines.  Sergey and I first heard about Android back in 2004  when Andy Rubin came to visit us.  He believed that aligning standards around an open source OS  would drive innovation across the mobile industry.  He was right, was he not?  Most people thought he was nuts.  Fast forward today,  the pace of innovation has never been greater.  Android is the most used mobile operating system  in the world.  Extraordinary progress, decades work,  having exceeded even the crazy ambitious goals  we dreamed of for Android  and with a really strong leadership and team in place,  Andy has decided it's time to hand over the reins  and start a new chapter at Google.  You're right.  This could be CEO talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We might as well have been guessing  who'd be the next pope, but we know that now.  Yeah, it is as crazy as that.  We don't know anything.  We're just speculating like everybody else, but that's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's read the letter.  "'Dear friends,' writes Andy Rubin.  "'In November of 2007, we announced the Open Handset Alliance,  "'34 founding members today.  "'I'm grateful to the over 85 OHA members.  "'Android ecosystem, tremendous growth, volume and variety.'  "'He says 750 million compatible devices.'"  Wow.  That's a good number.  And it's almost as many as Facebook users.  "'At its core, Android has always been a...'  And Facebook's free.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Facebook's free.  Facebook's free.  750 million bought things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but it is free to the manufacturer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  "'At its core, Android has always been about openness.  "'The idea that a thousand brains are better than one.  "'Just as the ecosystem has grown,  "'so has our team at Google.  "'I'm proud.  "'Look at last year.  "'Lean and Bech's released Jelly Bean, Google Now, Google Play.  "'Success of Android going forward.  "'Soon, our Pachai will lead Android,  "'in addition to his existing work with Chrome and apps.'"  Which makes me think that this is a placeholder, right?  Maybe there's somebody coming along for Android.  Hiroshi Lockheimer, well, many of you already know well,  and the rest of the Android leadership team  will work closely with all of our partners.  I'm an entrepreneur at heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.  That's the key phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and now is the right time for me  to start a new chapter within Google.  He is an entrepreneur.  He was at Apple, he was at Danger,  which made the sidekick, which was amazing,  but didn't catch on.  Then he started Android in 2003  as a startup bought by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People like him are interested in the early stage  of a big idea.  That's what gets their motivation going.  That's what lights their fire.  That's what this sounds like to me.  It sounds like this is about, look, I put in 10 years.  We've reached, we've been more successful  than I ever thought we could be.  We've got a great team.  They don't need me anymore.  I've got another itch to scratch.  So I'm gonna go do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So go back to what Larry says about Sundar then.  Are there any signals about,  if you think this is a placeholder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, let's see.  Going forward, Sundar Pachai will lead Android,  says Larry Page,  in addition to his existing work.  Sundar has a talent for creating products  that are technically excellent, yet easy to lose.  I'm sorry, use.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Freudian slip.  He loves a big bet.  Take Chrome, for example.  In 2008, people asked,  does the world really need another browser today?  I know Sundar will do a tremendous job  of doubling down on Android.  You know, in some ways, Google has lost control of Android.  Android is in many ways  not really a Google product anymore, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true. Or brand.  And you see companies like Samsung and HTC  co-opting Google, I mean Android.  The Open Handset Alliance is fractious and problematic.  I wonder maybe if they feel like,  yeah, Android's great,  but it's no longer within our control  in the same way that Chrome OS, Chrome,  and other products that we make are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you think about it,  Chrome is a similar structure to Android, right?  It is.  Chrome is based on an open source project,  the Chromium project, right?  But you don't see the same sort of fragmentation  or forking or, you know,  has a company taken the Chromium project  and rebranded it as a different browser?  No, I mean, the Chrome brand is extremely strong.  Look at all the forks for-  Or I don't know if you can make the same argument.  Yeah, look at all the forks for Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God, I mean, Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the Kindle.  Didn't even mention it.  Well, really, the Kindle is the big one.  No, but yeah, but then there's the Asian,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's tons of Asian forks as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, on kind of low-  Low-end hardware.  Because people want to be able to, yeah,  ship low-end hardware that's running a free operating system  and not paying licensing costs and all that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.  I'm not a Kremlinologist, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to know what he's going to work on.  That's the big question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be interesting,  because you've got a superstar here.  There's no doubt about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it seems very clear, he's staying at Google.  So normally, an entrepreneur kind of gets that itch.  So many times we hear the stories of Googlers  who leave to do their own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My first thought was that this is a victory for Chrome  and Chrome OS, but now I'm going to step back.  I don't think it is.  I think you're right, Gina.  I think Andy is an entrepreneur  and he wants to go to the next thing.  This is an established product now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also think that, okay, victory is too strong,  but I think that if we had bet a year ago,  I bet we all would have bet  that Chrome OS would eventually disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, that they would give Andy Chrome and everything else,  not the other way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think what this says in part  is that Chrome as a architectural vision doesn't disappear,  that it's fundamental.  It's not going to become a huge product or anything like that,  but it's fundamental that building applications  within Chrome is the architectural key,  and HTML5 is the architectural key to Google's success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just hasn't taken off though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I know that's the problem.  That's what I need to work on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chrome apps have just not taken off.  Certainly not the way that Android apps have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree, but if you, and the truth is that I use Gmail  not in a Chrome app, I use Gmail as HTML5.  So I'm not saying Chrome apps per se.  What I'm saying though is that things built  within the browser, and that's key.  Now I'm saying this at the same time,  of course, that Android has tons and tons and tons of apps.  But if you look at, I mean, I think the place to look  is the success of Gmail and Google Calendar  and that kind of stuff and how those operate together.  And there's gonna be some regularization of that.  So I don't think Chrome won,  but I also don't think Chrome lost.  I think Chrome survives as an element  of a larger strategy that we can't see yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  It's great stuff.  I love, these are the kinds of stories,  as a tech journalist, you just can't wait.  And I don't know, I don't know what's going on.  I have no idea.  I thought I might, but now after looking at all the threads,  it's very hard to figure out.  But we will watch with great interest  to see where Andy Rubin goes next.  Somebody in the chat room says,  well, no, he's just gonna go swimming  in his pool of Google cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's just hope that he's not sticking around in Google  because he's waiting on options or something.  Let's hope he's sticking around at Google  because he wants to do something else at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, by the way, this is kind of interesting too,  is that if you looked at like Marissa,  that was about a kind of administrative need,  becoming higher and higher and higher VP.  And Andy, he doesn't wanna run stuff  about an entrepreneurial innovative need to create something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, cause he's running a big division at Google  and he doesn't wanna do that, I don't think.  He wants to, I'm thinking you put them on glass maybe,  or maybe there's something, what's next after glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the thing that could be something next after glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I think it's what's next after glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, right, it seems like he's definitely gonna be  on some sort of new mobile technology, right?  I mean, doesn't it seem like, it would surprise me  if he was leaving mobile entirely.  What about cars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you can't, if Larry Page comes to you and says,  Andy, you did a great job and Android's mature,  you're probably bored, we're thinking of brain implants.  And we think you're the guy to lead the charge.  If you're Andy Rubin, would you not jump?  Now, by the way, Rubin is a big robotics freak.  His whole house is roboticized, you know.  If you're gonna-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're gonna get into robots, Andy Rubin's your guy,  I just figured it out, Google robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your own personal Google bot  that'll just index your home, like a Roomba.  It'll just sort of go around your home, index everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's a long-term strategy, obviously.  But I'm gonna see if I can find this article.  I remember reading a profile of Andy Rubin.  Everything in his house is roboticized.  Actual androids.  Actual androids.  Actual androids.  We figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm off to work on actual androids.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if that had been in his statement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, if Larry Page comes to you and says,  Andy, we wanna do robots, would you like to lead that?  And you're not gonna say no?  You're gonna say, yeah, hell yeah.  Well, can we call it iRobot?  Oh no, that's taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actual androids.  You don't say how much money do I get  because I've already got God's money.  No, he doesn't need money.  How much money are you gonna invest in this project?  And can you get more investment in this pie in the sky,  wacky big thing than you could get from damn VCs now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I gotta find this profile of Andy Rubin.  Here it is.  It's from the New York Times, 2007.  iRobot, the man behind the Google phone.  A retinal scanner emitting a blue glow  monitors the entrance to Andy Rubin's home  in the foothills overlooking Silicon Valley.  If the scanner recognizes you,  the door unlocks automatically.  Those forced to use the doorbell are greeted  with another technological marvel.  A robotic arm inside the glass foyer grips a mallet  that strikes a large gong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, I didn't realize that this was gonna be like weird.  I like the retina scan, but the mallet and the gong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he was, but before he did sidekick,  before he did danger, he did, he had a robot,  a robot startup.  I'm thinking that's it.  Look at if you're Google, isn't robots,  isn't that an area you wanna explore?  I love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actual androids it is, I'm sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actual androids, we figured it out.  Andy, call us.  We're gonna take a break when we come back.  We got the change log and lots more.  You're watching This Week in Google  with Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis,  and our favorite law firm that's not a law firm,  LegalZoom.com.  It's not a law firm.  It gets your legal stuff done at a much lower cost.  It's a self-help legal services.  If you've been waiting to, I don't know,  are you sitting on a business?  You gotta have an incorporation or a document or an LLC,  but guess what?  An LLC is 99 bucks at LegalZoom.com.  Forming your business the right way can save you big  and it makes sure your liability is protected.  Certainly what I did,  and you know that LLC we formed for Twit in 2005,  still good.  I have a law firm now at great expense.  It's perfectly fine to start with LegalZoom.com.  It's a great way to get it done.  Can also help with trademarks.  I did the same thing,  trademarked Twit and the logo, copyrights, patents,  NDAs and more.  What about your home life, your family?  Make sure they're protected too.  Protect your family and your assets with the LegalZoom will,  just $69.  They can do legal trusts or living trusts too.  If you don't have a will,  it's up to the government and the courts to decide  what happens with your babies and your assets.  You gotta do this.  First thing I did when we had kids, of course.  In the past 12 years,  over 2 million Americans have used LegalZoom for LLCs,  wills, trusts, trademarks and more.  And you know they've added this feature since I used them,  which I really like.  You can get help from an attorney at LegalZoom.com.  They've got the LegalZoom legal plan network.  They've got pre-negotiated prices.  So the fees are much more affordable.  As you go through the LegalZoom questionnaire,  if you find there's,  like for instance, this was a question I had,  where should I incorporate?  Delaware, California?  We ended up using Delaware.  I wish I'd had the help of an attorney  to talk about the pros and cons on that.  And by the way, you can look at unedited customer reviews  and online profiles so you make sure  you got the attorney that's right for you.  And again, a pre-negotiated price.  Attorneys can cost a lot.  LegalZoom makes it affordable  to get exactly the legal help you need.  Start your business, protect your family today.  LegalZoom.com, not a law firm,  self-help services at your specific direction.  Or you can speak to a legal plan attorney  and get your questions answered, get ongoing advice.  We just wanna get a little plug for Twig  when you use LegalZoom.  So if you will use the offer code TWIG  when you sign up at LegalZoom,  we'll give you 10 bucks off.  Just need a little thank you.  10 bucks, buy yourself a cup of coffee.  LegalZoom.com, use the offer code TWIG,  let them know you heard it about it here.  And we thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, break out the trumpets.  It's time for the Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.  And Gina Cipani has what's new at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Short Change Log this week, three quick things.  First one, the app that we, that I love on Android,  I've been running for a while, Field Trip,  is now available for iOS.  Field Trip is the app that kinda runs  in the background on your phone.  It triangulates your position via cell phone towers  and it lets you know if you get close  to something interesting.  Local businesses, historical facts,  landmarks, art and culture.  I've been using Field Trip for a while and I really like it.  It's a little bit of a battery drain  and at first it was a little noisy,  but you can configure what kind of alerts that you see  or you don't.  And in fact, it's funny, I turned on the Field Trip,  Ingress layer and I went to the post office,  which I like never do, but I had to mail a package.  And suddenly my phone started making this crazy sound  that I realized that it was telling me,  Field Trip was telling me that Ingress,  this was a portal that they had captured.  So Field Trip on iOS, grab it on iOS now,  it's in the iTunes store.  The Gmail mobile web app got a redesign on Android,  Blackberry or Kindle Fire.  Basically last November,  and we talked about this on the show,  also in the changelog,  Google announced a redesign for the Gmail mobile web app  on the iPad and iOS.  It was a nice redesign.  It added icon images and conversations,  you could see your friends' faces,  some Google calendar integration,  where you could RSVP directly from a message,  multi-account support.  Well, that redesign has now come to Android  and Blackberry, Kindle Fire, really,  any phone running a good browser.  And that's rolling out this week.  And finally, Google Public Alerts,  which you can check out at google.org,  google.org, not .com, slash public alerts.  That launched in the US a while back,  but it's now available for Japan,  because Japan has lots of earthquakes and tsunami warnings.  So if you go to google.org slash public alerts,  you can check out public alerts near you,  or if you type in Japan,  you can see them also in Japan now,  and you can translate as well.  Those public alerts about earthquakes and tsunamis  and that kind of, those kinds of events,  show up both in Google search, Google Now,  and Google Maps when you search  for kind of relevant keywords now.  So that's for US and Japan.  And that's all I got today, for changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Play the things.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will never cease to be delighted by the bumpers.  Never, I love it.  It makes me so happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're so simply amused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's something about horns and timpani, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ruffles and flourishes.  Google IOs sold out in 48 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  48 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  48 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  48 minutes, which was longer than last year.  I think last year was like 20 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it was bigger this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if,  I actually don't know if Google released the official number,  but that's what those who are watching it very closely  and timing it are saying, 48 minutes.  I think it took that long.  Are you all going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going.  You're going as press though.  I am going as press, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't wait in line with the unwashed masses.  Some of the reasons it took 48 minutes  is because there were some Google wallet slowdowns.  In fact, a lot of people-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think Ruben can fix that in his spare time?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's really why it took long.  And probably everybody who wanted a ticket  was on within the first minute or two.  And then it was just waiting for wallet to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I saw complaints from people who thought  that they were there to get it.  Same as with the phones.  Oh yeah, I got it.  I'm in.  And then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Seth Weintraub writing in 9to5 Google.  He tried it within the first minute of availability,  got this page and said, things are really busy.  We're assigning tickets as they become available.  We'll keep trying to get you a ticket for up to six minutes.  And then he said, five minutes later, try again.  We couldn't find you a ticket,  but there still might be tickets left.  He tried four times again and didn't get in.  So it's a tough event to get into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this.  Don't do any of the following.  They'll decrease your chances of getting a ticket.  Refresh this page, try to register in a new tab,  hammer the JavaScript endpoints using the JS console.  It's very much a developer conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's gotta be really challenging  to have some sort of system that these guys,  these developers won't hack at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please don't hammer our JavaScript endpoints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We know you know how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to demonstrate your abilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll get you a ticket sooner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please don't pwn us, please.  Anyway, yeah, we'll be covering it.  What day of the week is it?  It's March?  No, it's, what is it?  May. June.  I can't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's May 15th, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what days that is though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it, I believe it's a Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is Wednesday.  Oh, maybe we could do Twig from there.  I'm gonna be in Rio myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was thinking that I would come up on Tuesday  and do all that Android in studio  and then come up for Twig like I did last year.  Or maybe we'll do Twig there.  You wanna do Twig live?  Or we could do Twig live from there.  That'd be fantastic.  I would like to do that.  I would be there and available for whatever we wanna do.  And then the keynote on the second day will be Thursday.  So I don't know if we can figure out  how we wanna cover that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's do Twig there because the show before  it is security now, somebody else can do that.  Cause that's just Steve talking the whole time anyway.  I just sit there and eat lunch.  And then the show after know how,  I just get in the way, slow them down,  ask them questions, make it harder.  So I could, we could just go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Triangulation there.  Maybe we could book a triangulation guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  It's not know how, it's triangulation.  Oh yeah, we'll get a triangulation guest there.  I'll interview Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Through that.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's done.  Perfect.  Yeah, that'd be great.  I would love to do Twig from Moscone.  Okay, deal.  Or whatever we can get in the environs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what we need to do, and Chad,  we'll get some help for you.  But what we need to do is get set up some interviews  and people we can talk to.  Instead of doing a Twig like this,  but we'll just do, Gina and I'll just go boom, boom, boom,  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,  and talk to all the people who are there  talking about their new products and stuff.  Yeah.  That sounds like fun.  Sounds like a lot of fun.  I'll bring the coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Deal.  Cupcakes.  Did we get a media pass, I should say,  before I say this.  I know that we have a contact.  I haven't talked to you yet.  I'm sure I got a media pass.  I didn't, I don't know.  But I'm sure I did.  And if not, I would just say, I don't need to go in.  Isn't there like a keynote?  We got, oh, there's like four days of keynotes.  That's right, I forgot about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's three days.  I think there's a keynote the first day and the second day.  Yeah.  I know, I think Jason Howell got a press pass.  Oh, good.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  So I'm sure you'll be able to.  We'll figure it out.  I'll get in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure you'll get in, Leo.  So we'll cover the keynote and then we'll do Twig.  Fantastic.  Perfect.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of being pwned, you know what wasn't pwned  at the PonyM3 Hacker Conference?  The Chromebook.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every other operating system got hacked.  This is the pwned-own event that they do  in Vancouver every year.  They're unbelievable.  Everything else got hacked.  But the high-end Chromebook Pixel,  no, wait a minute, what did they use?  Did they use, I'm looking here.  Anyway, whatever they were using was not hacked.  Survived all attempts to hack it.  I can't remember that ever happening for any other OS.  That's one of the reasons I think I kind of,  I'm a little bit more sold on Chromebook.  Especially a cheap Chromebook.  You could use that for banking,  for anything you wanted to be secure,  and just know that that's safe,  and then use your Windows machine for everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they didn't have any winning entries,  but I think they had some entries,  and they said we're evaluating some work  that may qualify as partial credit.  So I'm not sure what the guidelines are  for a winning entry,  but it sounds like there are lots of attempts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google had a prize fund of $3.14159 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know this has had some people really trying hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $110,000 for a browser,  a system-level compromising guest mode,  or as a logged-in user delivered via web page.  $150,000 for a compromise with device persistence,  guest to guest with interim reboot delivered via web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean that's a year's salary for a developer.  It's a lot of money.  A young developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were going against the base Wi-Fi model  of the Samsung Chromebook,  using the latest stable version of Chrome OS.  You could use any of the installed software,  including kernel and drivers.  No winning entry.  Wow.  Okay, so Pwn2Own is actually finishing up today, I think.  So this was Pwnium 3, which was a Chromium Pwn,  and then Pwn2Own does the other operating systems.  During day one of the event,  all browsers except Safari proved vulnerable to attacks,  but only because no one attacked Safari.  And apparently there was a Chrome browser issue,  which was fixed.  During day two, Adobe Reader, Flash, and Java  also were compromised.  Makes you wonder.  So congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it make you nervous?  What does it make you wonder?  Does it make you nervous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know what happens is,  and I bet you the reason nobody attacks Safari  is because what's the guy who attacks Safari every year?  He always has a package of stuff.  And then he went to work for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he's like, they took him off the playing field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so everybody else figured,  well, we're not gonna do that.  No, it just means that everything has these zero day flaws.  In fact, it's really quite impressive  that nobody could crack the Chrome OS.  That's kind of unheard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is, and it's better that they're holding events,  inviting people to do it.  You bet, and giving money.  Giving money, yeah, exactly.  Which is the exact opposite of the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  most companies operate, which is,  I don't wanna know, no.  Don't tell me.  Right.  I don't wanna know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what's amazing too is when you go into dev mode  on the Chromebook, of course it says,  no more verification.  Right, that's what turns off, so you can have.  And that only emphasizes to you  how safe you are the rest of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It makes me think that this pixel will be something  that I will probably use, and the nice thing,  LastPass is installed on it.  It's easy to log in all my financial stuff.  It's really easy.  I like it.  So, remember Microsoft got dinged a little bit,  $732 million last week, because they accidentally  took off the browser ballot on Windows installs in Europe.  That was in February 2011,  and it wasn't until mid-2012, 18 months later,  the EU said, hey, didn't you say you were gonna,  what happened to the browser ballot?  Microsoft said, whoa, why did that happen?  Well, now, according to the Financial Times,  it was Google and Opera that informed the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scruge-old, eh?  I gave you a scruge-old.  $732 million worth, of course it would be,  because in fact, it was, I don't know if it was Google,  but it was definitely Opera that demanded  this browser ballot, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes sense.  I mean, you know, it directly affects  the number of active users that they have.  Yeah.  So, Microsoft got dinged for $730 million,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and Google got dinged this week for $7 million.  Who did?  Google did, because of the street view settlement with-  Oh yeah, they admitted it.  We violated your privacy, they said.  Well, yeah, I have a little rant, and I wrote a post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rant away, wait a minute, don't we have a little something?  We'll play it after your rant.  Yeah, we'll play it after.  Start the rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, the New York Times, which you think would know better,  has this ridiculous story.  Page one, upper right, the biggest thing,  in which they say that, let me pull it up here,  so I can have a full rant.  I just had a shit, because it's absolutely one-sided,  complete techno-bias.  It says that, and I'm not gonna be able to find it,  because it's buried with the pope.  I'm gonna-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The pope did not get buried, the story got buried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The story got buried, the story got buried.  So, it said, the headline said,  pardon me one second here,  Google concedes drive-by prying violated privacy.  Now, the verb pry infers intent.  There was a curiosity involved,  that Google wanted to know these things,  he tried to know these things, so that's wrong.  So, then it goes on, and let's remember, everybody,  this was data that was in open, public Wi-Fis,  Google was an absolute idiot to have saved it,  because there was no value in it whatsoever,  it was just random-  It was bits and pieces, it was random.  Well, you drove by, even Germany  closed its case on this thing, even Germany did,  but these attorney generals went up,  but then the times said,  the leads said that Google,  pardon me for looking away from the computer here,  was casually scooped up passwords,  email, and other personal information  from unsuspecting computer users,  and later said that for years,  the company has secretly collected personal information,  email, medical, and financial records, and passwords,  not to mention your strategy for a farm bill,  as it cruised by.  It was data scooping for millions  of unencrypted wireless networks,  this is all the New York Times talking.  And then it goes on, the worst of it to me,  is they say that privacy advocates and Google critics,  the only people he talked to, by the way,  characterized the overall agreement as a breakthrough  for a company they say had become, and I quote here,  a serial violator of privacy.  Come on, come on, Facebook, maybe,  but there's no link to this horrible rap sheet  of everything bad Google's done.  It's ridiculous, and all the Times talked to  were the standard characters who hate Google,  and they said, well, we're going to have to  get rid of Scott Cleland and Mark Rottenberg,  and the attorney general went after him.  It was just nothing else, and so it leads to this panic.  So I got a call today from a CNN producer who said,  oh, so there's Google Award on this thing.  There's a growing big concern about privacy, right?  And I stopped myself from going on,  I stopped myself from a BBC moment,  and I just said to her on the phone,  this is not a story.  Well, well, people are concerned.  I said, well, isn't there a growing concern?  I said, not among the people,  only among desperate cable news producers.  Ooh!  And I just finally said, listen,  I'm not sure what I said, well, but isn't it a story?  I like Street View 2, is it a story?  I said, no, it's not a story.  I said goodbye, and just hung up.  Yeah, that's appropriate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not only do they, and this is David Streitfeld,  although I doubt he wrote the headline,  but not only do they say Google concedes  the drive by prying violated privacy,  but underneath it, what do they have?  A picture of Sergey Brin wearing glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing in the story.  Now they're trying to tie this to glass,  which is my other rant of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The face of like data, of recording, of watching, right?  The Borg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so they're saying this is gonna have an impact  on that, well, which is just ridiculous.  And I had a fit last week.  I wrote a whole post on Buzz Machine under this,  and on Medium is where I wrote it,  where you can make fun of me for writing on Medium,  it looks pretty.  Just getting sick of the techno panic over glass,  that before it's even out, before it's even used,  people are having fits in media about this horrible danger.  Then there was this ridiculous story this week  of the dive bar in Seattle that banned Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was a good move on their part.  They got a lot of headlines as if it was meaningful  in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They admitted that, right?  But there are 8,000 media stories in Google News  carrying this junk, this crap,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which I can say in America.  Whoever their publicist is, that was a stroke of genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It kinda was.  Totally cashed in on the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not gonna allow glass in our bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even though they record their patrons.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, I believe that they have cameras at the bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only we can have cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure.  That's pretty funny.  Oh, they do, they do.  This is my rant of the week is techno panic  and how media play in techno panic, and I've had it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's our Jeff Jarvis rant, I'm stalling,  of the week.  Jeff Jarvis, ladies and gentlemen.  That's what, Matt Weiner, what is his name?  Matt Weiner?  Jesse, Jesse Weiner.  Jesse Weiner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jesse.  Thank you, Jesse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Jesse.  We need video to go with that.  I know, I need to.  I'm thinking a pink Jeff Jarvis  with steam coming out of his ears.  Yeah, if you could just give us a face of just anger.  Yeah, okay.  Capture that, kids.  Perfect.  Now steam coming, maybe little horns, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, am I pink this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you look, this Linux stuff is really looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't tell you because the green is drained out of me.  The green is one quarter inch above the rest of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You, I tell you, you look marvelous in Linux.  Very flattering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Open source, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Source, babe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we even care that Google showed a hacked speaking shoe  at South by Southwest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we're talking about publicity stunts.  They said it's a marketing guy who did it.  It's not a product.  It's not, they're not making a talking shoe.  Hey, let me ask you this.  Did either of you feel deprived  by not being at South by Southwest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean, not really.  My co-founder, Anil Dash, he did a keynote interview  with Dennis Crowley at Foursquare  and I would have liked to have seen that.  That would have been cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they were supposed to live stream it,  but I just couldn't find the link.  I looked and looked and looked and couldn't see it.  Otherwise, no, I mean, I just,  I kept reading headlines about how people,  my friends were basically celebrating  not being at South by this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Almost everybody just said, it's a great party.  Wish you were here.  If you could only get into the path party,  you'd be really enjoying yourself right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw a couple of vines, a sixth street.  You know, it wasn't, you know, it didn't feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you what I would have liked to go to.  The glass panel.  Oh yeah, we should talk about that.  And there was a search panel.  So I didn't, so fill us in, Gina.  What do they talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think it's Timothy Jordan was his name.  One of the product managers on Google Glass  did a demo of Glass showing off some of the first apps  that we've actually seen running on Glass.  New York Times, Gmail, Evernote and Path,  which is kind of interesting.  So we talked about this on all about Android last night.  So in New York Times, for example,  if you kind of do the look up into the right head gesture,  you could see New York Times breaking news headlines  or images.  I think that's really distracting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to see newspaper headlines  while I'm walking down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to tell you, I agree with you.  I think the Times is kind of the least interesting.  Well, look at the headline there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's from eight hours ago.  That's the last thing I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I just don't think that should be coming out  of the corner of my eye.  I'm not sure I want to be reading my email  as I walk down the street.  And if I'm going to read my email,  do I really want to read it on glasses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but this is what I really liked  about the way they presented this  is that they presented a lot of the design guidelines.  So with Gmail, for example, you have to subscribe  to your Gmail in order to see your mail.  And you could subscribe to just your important label.  So it sounds like you have a lot of control  over what gets pushed to you and what doesn't.  And some of the design guidelines,  the guidelines that they're giving developers  is that the information that you push to the glass,  to the heads-up display has to be timely.  It has to be kind of minimalistic.  It has to be important enough.  It has to matter at that sort of,  within that context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seems really distracting.  I know Leo, in our Google Plus group,  Grant Jalinas Brown, I think the name is,  I can't read, is it types with tiny in Linux,  had a great idea and said,  just when you start thinking about other things,  if you're a presenter on stage and your notes come up there.  Yeah, that's fine.  That's perfect, right?  That's fine.  Things like that, right?  I can see these kinds of uses where it's actually useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some narrow uses,  but I don't think it's a general.  You know, I don't,  Google Now would be cool to have Google Now  in my field of vision.  I don't want Twitter in there.  Twitter, no.  I don't want email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want any of that noise from Earth.  Right, that's noise.  I want things that are actually gonna matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now would be okay if it said,  or maybe Field Trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I definitely want my text messages in Google Glass.  I do not want to pull out my phone,  look at my text messages.  I would definitely want that.  Another interesting example that they showed off  for the South by Southwest presentation  was a skitch in Evernote.  So you can have the glasses on.  Say you're in a meeting and you have the glasses on.  You snap a picture with Glass and you share it to skitch.  And then on your tablet, you can annotate that image  and share it and save it to Evernote, for example.  So I really liked the idea of just being able  to snap pictures quickly and share them out  to Google Plus or skitch.  Text messages make a lot of sense.  Navigation makes a ton of sense, right?  I mean, navigation only makes sense  in the context of a heads-up display, right?  I'm always looking down at my phone  while I'm driving to look at directions,  even though I shouldn't admit that.  But Glass would have that kind of right  in a field division.  So I agree.  The New York Times example, I didn't think was a good one.  I think that subscribing to Gmail important messages,  being able to reply, being able to compose an email,  I might do that.  Or compose a text message, I might do that.  I can imagine-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think also, Gina,  I can imagine a case where you take a photo  and you want to share it.  My baby is so cute that you could do that in audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I can imagine being with the baby and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you could even do gestures to crop it  or things like that and out it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I can imagine hanging out with the baby,  excuse me, putting the baby down and being like,  email grandma, take a picture, email grandma.  That's something that's super, super, super useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you have to say, OK, Glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, OK, Glass.  It sounds like it's to activate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I prefer it to be, yo, Glass.  I'm sure you could change it to anything you want.  I'm sure you can, yeah.  Yo, Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not a big Path, the fact that I'm not,  I don't use Path.  Is Path something that you'd be interested in, Leo,  on Glass? No, I mean, I use Path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Path, but again, that's not,  you come up with a couple of scenarios that I like.  I like the Nav while I'm driving,  although I bet you many states pass laws  against wearing Glass while driving, but-  Yeah, you're probably right.  I bet Nav, but Nav would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about biking or walking?  Nav?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I fell off my bike the other day  and I didn't even have anything on,  so I think it's probably dangerous for me  to be doing anything but paying attention to the road.  Sorry, Leo.  I did, I sprained my ankle and my wrist.  Oh.  And contusions all up and down my body.  Oh, sorry.  And that was all because I was,  I just missed, it was, and it was,  but this reminded me that biking  is actually a fairly dangerous activity  and you probably should be paying attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to what you're doing.  Right, OK, walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Walking, yeah, although

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to walk a lot of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm totally in the floor

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I'm going to go in the sinkholes.  If I was a Google I.O. or if I was a South by Southwest,  I would love for Glass to be like,  hey, two of your friends are in the bar up the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I can say, you know what?  We won't really know until we wear them.  I just fear that this,  that those apps that I saw there did not make me say,  gosh, I can't wait to get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  I think they were bad choices.  I think they were plain to the big players now  and I think they were entirely new people  who figure out how to use Glass well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they've got partners,  but are they the right partners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's so funny.  The New York Times is so desperate  to figure out what the hell's next after newspapers  that they're even willing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you seen the Google poems?  This is funny.  This is on Reddit.  By the way, coming up in just a few minutes,  we're going to speak to Reddit founder,  Steve Huffman on triangulation.  So it's r slash Google poems  and I guess they're using the autocomplete.  So here's one.  I am sad.  I am sad in Spanish.  I am sad in French.  I am sad all the time.  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hipsters, hipsters Tumblr, hipsters in Detroit,  hipsters on food stamps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's one for yoga, yoginis.  Yoga is my health insurance.  Yoga is my religion.  Yoga is my only exercise.  Yoga is my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For those of you who are listening and not watching.  What the hell is this?  Right, these are autocomplete.  The Google search box is autocomplete suggestions  for particular words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's one for Game of Thrones fans.  Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're not a fan of Game of Thrones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that was completely meaningless.  Do you like corgis?  So you type in my corgi is,  you can actually do this at home.  Type in my corgi is, my corgi is overweight.  My corgi is limping.  My corgi is fat.  My corgi is satanic.  These are all at Reddit slash r slash Google poems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you interview the Reddit co-founder,  are you gonna ask about the troll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should, shouldn't I?  I will, yes.  I shall.  I shall.  He's still there, right?  What are you doing?  My Leo is ignoring me.  My Leo man is ignoring me.  My Leo man is mad at me.  My Leo man is ignoring me, help.  Chad just wrote that poem.  Why did you start typing my Leo man?  I didn't, it auto-completed.  Just from my Leo?  Yeah, is space.  Why is my Leo man ignoring me?  Sastrology.com.  Sastrology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want sastrology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my, it took me a second.  Is the sign, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where the hell are you?  Where the hell are my keys?  Where the hell are my Cheetos?  Where the hell are you when I need you?  Cry sometimes I.  Sometimes I get a good feeling.  Sometimes I get a feeling.  Sometimes in April, sometimes I cry.  They tend to be sad.  Don't know why.  Okay, we should wrap it up.  Any other last chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you got a funny,  I think it's funny for just 30 seconds.  The Eric Schmidt book trailer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have it right here, should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the audio is what's funny.  It actually gets fairly dystopian toward the end  about all the things that go bad in the world,  but then it's still a good thing, the internet,  but just the voice on it just amuses me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a YouTube video you can watch for yourself.  Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen,  The New Digital Age with special announcer coming April 23rd.  Oh, is that me?  Yeah.  Gosh dang it.  Okay, here, wait, let me try it again.  I'm gonna disconnect.  Try to grab it.  Reconnect, because it's kind of nice.  You know what this sounds like?  Sounds like our announcer, sounds like Jim Cutler.  I wonder if he did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, thunder, lightning, very, very frightening.  Five billion new people will connect to the internet  in the next decade.  Oh my God.  And with this mass adoption,  the world's population will, in one generation,  have gone from having virtually no access  to unfiltered information  to accessing all of the world's information  through a device that fits in the palm of the hand.  What's more extraordinary is that most of these people  are coming online. I don't think this is official,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by the way.  I think this is done by The Draw Shop, which does like,  they do awesome whiteboard videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those general electric movies we used to watch  when you and I were in school.  Yeah, they do, yeah.  Our friend Zink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In parts of the world  ridden with the greatest number of challenges,  where autocracy is already the dominant governance model  for the physical world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Autonomy, what?  Autocracy is the government,  is the dominant governance model for the physical world.  It gets quite dystopian.  I don't think this is official.  I think this is just a promotional vehicle  for somebody else.  Like these guys who do these whiteboard videos.  That's a big thing right now.  If you're an artist, kids, just thinking,  if you can draw quickly, think on your feet,  there's a real need for people to sketch  strange cartoons at events.  Oh, it's very Davos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is he?  They love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that me?  No, that was me.  I was trying to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As is another one.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I swear to God, every conference now,  they've got a guy doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I actually have one from when I did my book  at Republican before I wrote it,  that has a big penis on it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  No, yeah, when I was at LeWeb,  when I was speaking at LeWeb,  they did one of me interviewing Kevin Rose.  Are you okay, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to take one moment here, Leo,  since I think that the chat room would thank me for this,  and I think that the plus world will thank me for this.  But since you are being known as so anti-Google+,  isn't it interesting that Facebook just copied the heck?  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did.  They did.  But now I can make the case that it isn't Google+,  it's just big pictures.  That we are living in a visual world,  and Facebook recognized that.  Oh, I finally got it.  Hallelujah.  I'm gonna join Julio, Nick, and 16 others  to get less clutter, more stories,  and a fresh new look in my newsfeed.  I just got it, I'm so excited, take a look, it says.  Or you can press the button that says not ready yet.  New, your choice of feeds.  Stick to the same newsfeed you're used to  with none of the stuff you wanna read,  or,  or click the link to all friends following groups,  most recent photos, games, music, et cetera, et cetera.  It's easier to get around,  visit other parts of Facebook,  and chat with friends all from one place.  That's straight out of the mobile, by the way.  That's the mobile app.  If you ever need help, use our help.  The idea that I'm gonna interrupt somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and have them chat with me at any moment.  Yeah, I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's an article from Atlantic Monthly,  if you wear Google's new glasses, you are an asshole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's good.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you feel like the more visual newsfeed is the thing  that sort of differentiates Facebook and Google Plus  from Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although Twitter's doing inline images now, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're doing inline images, but it's not even close.  Everything is sort of subservient to the 440 characters,  like the tweet, the text of the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really a little bothering me.  We just talked about this One ID, and I went to oneid.com,  and all of a sudden I'm seeing, on Security Now,  I'd never heard of this company before.  Maybe it's a coinkydink, but for some reason,  I'm seeing One ID and One ID ad, it looks like,  although it doesn't say it's an ad,  and I certainly didn't like them on Facebook  in my Facebook stream, and that's a little odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder how they know that,  that I just visited them.  But it is a little Google Plus-y,  but I don't think you could really say this is Google Plus.  This is the move towards much more visual streams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw a side-by-side, I forget who did it,  but a side-by-side of two of the same posts,  and they were exactly the same.  Really?  The photography, the spacing, everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.  And I don't know, maybe it's just me when I post there,  but I still get far more conversation,  better conversation on Google Plus  than I ever get on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The quality's better.  The number of comments is not.  It's the quality, though.  Which is what you'd expect.  But you'd expect that.  I mean, Facebook is everybody.  Google Plus is just the few nerds who even heard of it.  Now, if you do the photo stream, this is nothing but photos.  It is really beautiful.  I mean, that's big images, big fat photos.  So, I don't know.  I don't think this is Google Plus.  I just think this is where everything's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The pope's first tweet.  Habemus papam franciscum.  We have a pope.  His name is Francis.  Thank God I studied Latin in grade school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, oh, wait a minute.  The new pope is Father Guido Sarducci.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought he looked familiar.  All right.  Pope jokes.  Pope jokes.  No more pope jokes.  Facebook redesign.  Do you not like it?  Do you not want it?  Do you hate it?  It's just you'd say it looks like Google Plus.  Yeah, it's fine.  I think it looks nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems pretty plussy.  I haven't gotten it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just got it as we speak.  So, I will give you more of an opinion, more informed opinion  as I use it.  OK, I think we got everything important.  Yeah.  Chad Hurley might start a YouTube competitor.  I don't know if that's the case.  Collaborative.  Collaborative.  Sounds like it could be something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I miss that Twitter's API keys for its official apps  had been shared on GitHub.  And there you go.  Interesting.  Here's how to get around the restrictions, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, yeah, really.  Just go to GitHub.  Everything's on GitHub.  I love that GitHub resume.  Are you going to do that as a tool?  Can I show that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, sure, I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GitHub.com slash resume slash, or no, just your name, right?  GitHub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a resume.GitHub.com, yeah.  And then, yeah, I think you just slash your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you've been using GitHub as Gina Trapani has,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have.  You will have a, oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There isn't a GitHub.  It didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's resume.GitHub.com slash question mark.  And then you just slash question mark, Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, let's do that.  And then it builds a passionate GitHub user.  It builds a resume automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but based on your repositories  and does what you worked on when and what percentages  and languages you write in.  Isn't that cool?  It's pretty nice.  This is actually isn't, I thought  it was an official GitHub thing.  It isn't.  It's an app that a developer wrote.  Oh, cool.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break.  We come back with our tool tip number of the week,  Jeff and Gina.  And then, of course, stay tuned to triangulation  right afterwards with the Reddit founder, Steve Huffman.  But first, a word from Squarespace.com.  If it's time to create a website,  it's time to take a look at Squarespace.com.  I know there are a lot of choices for web hosting,  but very few combine great web hosting with superb content  management system to give you everything  you need to create an amazing website.  And they give you a free 14-day trial with 24-7 support.  You don't need a credit card.  You can see all the different templates.  You can even, because they have API support for importing  from Blogger, WordPress, TypePad, and exporting too.  And when I see import and export, I mean everything.  Not just your content, but all the links, all the SEO  is preserved, all the images are preserved.  Even the comments are preserved.  So everything is moved over.  So what you should do is go to Squarespace.com,  play with it a little bit, import your stuff,  see what your site would look like at Squarespace.  Lots of great stuff.  Now, if you're a developer, their developer platform  is second to none.  You don't need to know CSS or HTML.  It supports Git, by the way, and kittens, apparently.  But if you do, you can incorporate those  into your Squarespace site.  Actually, really, the advantage of Squarespace for normal people  is you can get a great-looking, unique site  without knowing all that stuff.  But the best part is the price is right.  When you buy a year plan, it's as little as $8 a month.  The unlimited plan, $16 a month, billed annually,  you get unlimited pages, galleries, blogs, bandwidth.  You never get a bandwidth bill.  If you suddenly get popular, no problem.  And by the way, even if everybody in the world  goes to your site, Squarespace can take it.  I've never been able to bring a Squarespace site down.  We bring down sites every single day, not Squarespace.  Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors,  and now they've added commerce.  And I think this is so, so cool, a very flexible e-commerce  solution for both physical and digital goods.  So you could sell music CDs or MP3s.  You could sell hardcover books or e-books,  a single interface for order management,  for tracking orders, providing customer email updates,  printing shipping labels, adding coupons.  Yes, coupons.  And all of this included everything unlimited,  $24 a month billed annually.  $30 a month, month to month.  Unbelievable.  And of course, the mobile experience is fantastic,  even with e-commerce.  They will even calculate tax and shipping automatically.  And that's the price.  Squarespace does not take a cut from your commerce.  That's your site, not theirs.  I want you to try it.  Free Squarespace.com.  If you decide to buy, you could take 10% off  your first purchase with any new account  by using our offer code TWIG and the number  three for the month three for March.  TWIG3squarespace.com.  Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.  She's muted.  Hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, karma's a bitch.  Karma is a bitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, you're doing really good for somebody who  mutes herself automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh, girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just didn't want you to all hear me slurping ice  tea during the sponsor reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just teasing you.  I mute myself.  I wouldn't mute myself if I could.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well deserved.  It's true.  I will never make fun of Jeff for muting himself ever again.  He's sticking out his tongue.  He's sticking out his tongue.  I'm glad.  I'm actually glad that that happened.  Feels very good about that.  Oh, dear.  God got me.  Tip of the week this week, just a quick one.  This comes from Lifehacker.  If you ever need to figure out how to do something  with the Google app, which you often do,  sometimes it's like, how do I forward my Gmail?  How do I set up two step off?  How do I set up multiple accounts sign in?  Well, Google Search has that site operator  where you can narrow search results to a particular site.  So Lifehacker suggests if you want  to search Google's official support pages for questions  about those types of things, just use the site  colon support.google.com operator when you search.  You can even narrow it down even further.  Most of Google's answer pages are  in the format of support.google.com  slash something slash answer.  So you can even use the nerds who like regexes  and that kind of thing.  You can use a wild card.  So you can do site colon support.google.com slash star  slash answer and then put in your search term.  And that will return all the pages  which are at that address.  So testing it out, I'm just doing site colon support.google.com  and then search for something like forward Gmail.  And you can get all the kind of official help pages  on how to forward mail to another account  or set up your forwarding options  or set up another reply to address.  So I love that site colon operator  to kind of narrow results.  And I know exactly what site I'm looking for something in.  But it really is helpful if you just  want to just look in Google official support pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cool.  I didn't know you could do that.  That's really great.  That's your tip.  Jeff has a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the talk I wish I'd heard at Southwest  was Uri Milner, investor in Facebook and other places,  being interviewed.  And according to the report in Vanity Fair,  when question time came, questions from Twitter,  someone asked whether, well, IBM had been around  for 100 years.  What companies would be around for 100 years?  And he listed three.  He said Google, Wikipedia, and Facebook.  The latter of which, of course, he invested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think?  Google, Wikipedia, Facebook.  100 years is a long time.  Long time.  I don't know if anything that we know and love  will be around in 100 years, including New York City.  So I don't know.  Do you think maybe?  I don't know.  That's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like it's just like too early to predict.  People ask me that all the time.  What companies do I think are going to be around?  It's like they've only been around for maybe 10 years  so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I almost certainly say Facebook will not.  I think Facebook won't be around 10 years.  Google, probably not either.  Wikipedia, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wikipedia has a good shot, right?  It's a nonprofit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's the repository of all knowledge,  which can only get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the Library of Congress archiving Wikipedia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that I know of.  It's a question I'm not sure of.  Archive.org is, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It seems like Wikipedia has the best shot out of those three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree.  I mean, Encyclopedia Britannica, how long did that last?  How long did the OED last?  Facebook, no way.  Facebook's the MySpace of...  I think he kind of had to say Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because he invested in it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yuri, we got you.  You're on to you, Yuri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when I got the Chromebook, I started playing with apps.  Because that's all you can do, right, is these apps.  And so I'm just playing with them.  And this was one of the things that convinced me  that there really is quite a bit you can do with apps.  And some of them are kind of fun.  This is a really strange one.  It's called the Email Game from Baden.  Have you seen this?  No.  Makes doing email a game.  You've got a little timer running.  And you've got a little happy face.  If you reply or arch...  If everything you do, you could see it'll improve.  I'm going to delete that.  So and the timer runs.  You have 45 seconds to do this.  Oh, I should reply to this one.  Oh, gosh.  Time's running out.  And my happy face is showing.  So it does 25 conversations at a time.  And you got to do all 25 in a limited amount of time,  like five minutes.  And it's just a way to kind of get you to power through email.  And if you are one of those people that falls  for crap like this, which I am, it makes email fun again.  Because it wasn't really for some time.  What's it called?  It's called the Email Game.  It's on the web store, B-A-Y-D-I-N.com.  They use your Google Mail.  I've been having fun browsing through the web store.  There's really a lot of stuff in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of it is, let's be honest, is a link to HTML5.  Yeah, it's just a web page.  Like the note program we all use.  It's just that.  Everyone notices that.  By the way, when you get the Pixel,  when you're in the midst of you thanking me for inspiring you  to do this, Netflix looks great on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tried Netflix even on the Samsung, the ARM-based Samsung.  And it works really well.  Really?  Yeah.  That's new.  Yeah, they just added the capability of running an ARM.  So that's another one.  I don't really watch Netflix on a computer very much.  But it's impressive that you can do that.  And yes, I imagine it looks amazing.  Screen is just the standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, Gina.  Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys are killing me here.  You're killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just did my taxes.  Baby doesn't need shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, baby needs nothing except a Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Baby needs daycare so I can go to the Samsung event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Baby needs daycare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm looking at the world clocks on my Chromebook.  And it seems that it's 7, 12 AM in Tokyo,  which means we're way late.  So let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's so many silly things you can get on this.  I just love this.  I just think it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What time is it in New Delhi now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes, because that's where you will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I doubt that I'm going to be up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see.  New Delhi.  It is 3 42 AM.  Yeah, I don't think so, guys.  Can't get you up at 2 in the morning to do this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You will.  Your head will fall forward and you will break your brand  new keyboard.  We don't want that to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's exactly the opposite, though, isn't it?  Plus half an hour.  It's exactly the opposite of California time.  Plus half an hour.  Which is the weirdest thing.  It is weird.  Jeff Jarvis, so you will be here next week, though.  You're not going to New Delhi yet.  We got a new deli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I'm at full disclosure.  It's an event that's done by Google and the Guardian.  So I'm going to trip over.  No payment, but a trip over on Google.  So, you know, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You probably get free go go internet, too.  Actually, you do.  You get 12 free go go internet sessions on your Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I will.  But I never fly on airlines that have go go.  So I know it sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff is the author of Public Parts.  What would Google do?  He is a blogger at Buzz Machine dot com.  And he looks fabulous in Linux.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing that it's really a huge upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now we know we just give everybody a pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, they like that.  Jadina says, yes, yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm saying that on my brand new Mac Mini here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you look pretty good, too, I must say.  It's a big improvement.  I am so happy.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The work that Chad did, everybody had to help me out.  Getting it sorted out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were committed to making Gina look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I use the LTE on the.  No, but we'll try that for one show.  How much how many how many how many gigs would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then Jeff can submit the expense report for the.  Right.  For the Verizon bill that month.
