Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was that we just blew apparently the default transition is an explosion  About you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know what it's appropriate because we've been talking about  deconstructing the media but in the before the show began and I'm sure we'll talk a little bit about that this show normally is about  well  Actually nominally is about Google and the cloud but it's normally about whatever we want to talk about and since  We have great journalists here. It's always the case that we kind of talk about journalism a little bit actually  Let's kick things off with contributor  Which is an interesting plan that Google has for removing ads from some blogs for a fee and  I I have to feel like this is an experiment  What is going on Jeff? I don't so the idea is but you pay a sliding scale between one and three dollars a month and  certain sites onion the onion mashable

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  In

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imager wiki how I don't know where they why they picked these  Will will get the chance to remove ads put them a pixel pattern in their place. Yeah, just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I talked to a Google person about this before launched and  She said they chose  Sites that don't get a huge amount of traffic because they wanted to sort of experiment and iterate and I said well  Why would you pick Mashable then it gets like 50 million unique visitors a month or something?  but I guess they wanted to pick one big one and then a bunch of smaller ones actually Imager gets quite a lot of  traffic too, but  It feels to me like just another one of those kind of experiments that they're trying to sort of you know to help publishers  Out of bed and I'm assuming they realize that for lots of smaller publishers  AdSense basically is chicken feed. And so I assume they're trying to think of some new ways for  To help them out it I don't feel like I think it's it's a noble gesture and it's kind of a tip jar  Sort of model. I just I don't really see a whole lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doing it. I I think it's a stop  I I think that you know, you've seen Google and you know, god bless them trying to do things  But but I think that the things they've tried to do are are trivial  They've tried to do micro paper before I don't believe in micro payments. They tried to help people rethink the story that didn't work very well  And now they're doing this is not gonna be a salvation  Google should bring us bring best strategy its best technologists to this effort if they care about news  I was at news Geist  I think I mentioned a week ago and  We have session on what what should Google do what could Google do for news and there are bigger strategic things  They could enable embeddable articles. They could enable  Even streams. There's all kinds of other things they could do. This is cute, but a distraction not really worth the effort. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if you combine this with the Google music key the move to  Allow people to pay for YouTube music videos and remove the ads  Is that a completely unrelated thing? No, it's no I think it's  Do you I think it might be a response to though to people who say and  And a lot of people say this including Google competitors  Well, Google just is using you, you know, you're the product  and so  Is it could this be Google's way of saying? Well, what if we try try it so that you're not the product? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think the readers put up or shut up. Yeah, you keep complaining then. Okay, you you can you can pay  More

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think it is a bit of a I mean maybe  Sop is a little it's a little harsh, but I do think you know, it's another one of those kind of little  Experiments they try like the survey wall where you know you instead of having a paywall  You could ask people to answer a few questions that apparently lots of sites are using it  Whether they're generating a lot of revenue or not. I I don't know. I doubt it but I still  In a way, it's worthwhile  I mean, I don't see why I kind of like the fact that they're at least experimenting with this stuff  This feels very much like what readability tried to do when they although they went about it in a completely different way  But they tried to do kind of micro  Tip jar style payments didn't work Google at least has the scale that it could theoretically do that. It's to me  I don't know whether enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That this is not even if this works  Beyond everyone's wildest imagination is successful. It is no salvation  No, I go back to say that what Google should be doing. I think is bringing  If they care about news they can say listen, we don't get one news. Don't give a damn what happens happens  But but that's not what they do. They they hold news guys  They're in trouble with publishers in Germany, which we'll talk about later  They do care to some extent and I think they got to bring their best brains here and and and minor ways to help them use  functionality better or to create  Things like this. I just don't think of the are bringing full Google horsepower to this question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and if I'm a one of these sites what I might do is just say well  I could also just crowdfund go to patreon or somewhere  Yeah, and control my destiny get rid of Google ads if that's what my readers want. I could do that  And you'd make more money when you Google at Google. Yeah, you don't make much in that sense. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you're not gonna make much on contributor  but at the same time I do sort of feel like  You know, they take they get a lot of crap for stuff they do and at least they're trying the the  Trying to find new ways to help publishers who don't want to you know  Just do crowdfunding or don't want can't run their own paywall because they don't have the you know  They don't have the manpower the resources  But it's probably not I agree with Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not gonna amount to much at the end of the day is YouTube music key some that seems to be something a little bit  First of all, they're putting more horses behind it  This isn't an experiment. This is this is the real deal. Although it isn't beta if you have but if you have Google play music already  You'll have music key. Oh, there's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sites that there's gonna be a mondo paywall and then everybody shares revenue from that and in some countries  The dream is it'll be a tax fee like the BBC  But the problem is music is a unique property and information is not yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I don't think I mean I think there's probably more YouTube  creators who will be able to make you know a significant or  Nominal map from this more so than websites that publish news content. Is that the next step for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I Susan Wojcicki the  extend the  model to YouTube content itself  besides music I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't see why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of indicated she might she's thinking about it right other alternative ways to monetize

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Netflix yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say I continually when I don't consume a lot of content on YouTube  but my kids do and their friends do and  Friends kids do and every time I run into somebody they tell me about some YouTube  Star who I have literally never right who has 50 million subscribers  right and they you know unbox makeup or something or they  Talk about kids toys or they and it's you've never heard of them and they have more subscribers than half of the TV network  Channels that you have heard of it's a mind-boggling sort of every time it it strikes me when I have these conversations  I think this is it's pretty amazing in a way that some  Woman who we don't even know her name  lives in somewhere in Florida and makes  15 million dollars a year talking about kids toys on YouTube yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Michelle fan who is the makeup the the YouTube star does makeup tips  But I think a lot of her money she makes selling subscriptions to a monthly makeup sampler mailer, so this is a pro  I'm not sure you know I  Nobody reveals how much they make on YouTube exactly so you never you're always speculating on  Right but it seems like her model is actually kind of sensible  Which is you get some money from YouTube, but you also view it as a promotional vehicle for other enterprises  It seems like the people were making money with the exception of PewDiePie and a few of the really big stars most of their  significant portion of money comes from other sources that  YouTube fosters

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you look at and so good example of what you're talking about. I'm trying to remember the  girl's name  Zoe  something and she's a  YouTube star and is now I guess writing a book or publishing a book that book is gonna be a number one bestseller  Like literally as soon as she said yeah that she was writing book right because she already has this built-in community of millions of  Desperate fans right you know so that book is gonna  Fly off the shelves or whatever virtual shit  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  feel like one of the things  Susan Wojcicki is gonna have to fight and one of the things YouTube is gonna have to fight is  The realization by the vast majority of youtubers that they are not gonna make much money  And that they are gonna need to figure out something else if you know these there's this dream of being Michael Jordan  But but most of them don't get to be play the NBA and it's I think even a smaller percentage they get to make a lot  Of money on YouTube and YouTube makes a lot of money on the long tail  Of people who are not making money, but YouTube is and I feel like it's a point  There's gonna be a come-to-Jesus moment for YouTube where they're gonna have to provide some way for these people to make money or lose them  Well, they're just in it. I went to the opening of their studio in New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're investing a tremendous amount and trying to get people to make content  They've got to do a better job and probably what they have to do is reduce Google share  To increase the size of the network and of course it's not the only revenue stream for a lot of these people as you just said  The musicians have tours but then Jack Conti wrote a great piece on medium of  Pumple moose  Natalie dawn and patreon fame I put it on the rundown at the very bottom under  Numbers, but you're welcome to take it and  talked about the tour that he and Natalie just had and what they lost in the end and  It's we had Pumple moose in here. I think the world of them Jack

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who learned a lot by becoming a YouTube star?  Who learned a lot by becoming a YouTube star  And they made money they were they did Chevy ads and stuff, but he founded patreon for that very reason  so they did a 28 day tour and I remember they were when Jack and  Natalie Natalie were here. They talked about this and they said in fact, I said come back promote the tour 24 shows three 23 cities  They sold a hundred thousand dollars in tickets  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think they made about that revenue was a hundred and forty something and they lost  But they lost money  Seventeen million or seventeen thousand sir. They lost money on the tour

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it says they could have gone out as a duo  But they that was what they wanted to do. They want you know any and he says well, I'm not complaining  I'm really very lucky we get to make a living from music  He says right out what they pay themselves in stipends from what they do the rest they invest back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very detailed breakdown this is really really I wish everybody would do this because I think it would then be what we don't have  Is this information?  About YouTube. I wish people would do the same thing for you to maybe YouTube prevents them from doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know and to be fair what what they said was they saw this as an investment  You know, they knew they weren't gonna make right right?  They knew they were gonna make money, but this was a way of getting their  Themselves and their music and their name and so on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it because because we always say well, they don't make money on selling albums anymore, but they make money on selling tickets  so now they go out they make money on selling tickets and  Try to make money on selling albums and they'll make it up with volume, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vicious to be fair every rock band in history lost money in it on a tour or two  Because they this stuff is very easy to lose money on if you're if you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  extraordinarily careful usually expensive, yeah, and and actually Bob left sets whose hilarious to read at  All the time about left this letter is so great  Yeah  Wrote a letter about Pumplemooze and about this piece and I thought he was overly harsh  Because I don't think they were writing it to say oh poor us. We're not making money  They they distinctly didn't say that right but his point was  Basically, you know  You're on your own. You don't  If you decide to do these tours you then you know  You have to either do them in a way that makes money or accept the fact that they're not gonna make money  It's not it's you can't blame anyone else for the fact that people don't come to your shows or don't buy your stuff lately

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been binge reading rock and roll biographies and Graham Nash  writes about  Crosby stills in Nash tour that I think David Crosby called the tour from hell  I can't remember what he called it, but they were all the tour they were all they lost a ton of money and the record  Putting a record company into this mix. Is it gonna make things better for Pumplemooze?  It's just gonna make one more one more company sucking profits out of it  This is how it's hard to do. It always has been hard to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And  In fact that they came that close to breaking even I thought was a success like that  They did a pretty good job, you know for people who've never put together a nationwide tour before that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did it all on their own. Mm-hmm pretty amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it shows you I thought he he made a point part way down  That you know  Which I thought was the sort of optimistic way of looking and what we're talking about them  The industry has expanded in such a massive way there, you know, there's there's a whole middle  Category now of groups that can  Maybe not become super famous or super rich  But can actually make a living doing the things they want to do and connecting with their fans without the label  That's so sure. They're not gonna be Britney Spears, but they're but they can at least do it that literally wasn't possible before

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a whole chain of value and creativity. I think I mentioned this room before I've been involved in this world economic forum  project on post copyright  and in that chain of value we need more ways to  Recognize the creation value like creating audiences and remixing and adding in and more ways to extract value like getting data about your  audience and being able to sell tickets and things  It's gonna have to be a new mix we figure out and again, I want to make a point  To talk about it when it comes to a creative unique  entertaining entity like a singer or movie or a novel is  A very different from the model of an information based  Industry like like news, but we've conflated the two because we think they're all storytellers and they all  You know have attention and they all have time but they're they're incredibly different model  They need to be incredibly different business models and on both sides  They're disrupted and they need to reinvent themselves. Although I think there is some overlap

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean someone like Andrew Sullivan, for example and the daily dish to me  I wrote a whole column comparing him to Amanda Palmer  Because to me the sort of model that they're both pursuing is is fundamentally identical. I'm I'm a musician  I'm a columnist style blogger writer  But I have a community of fans who who adore me or hate me or some combination thereof and  Interfaceted with me and want to come to things that I'm involved with or want to buy things that are related to me  That you know one is  Talking about politics and one is  Music but but the sort of approach to that to the community and how you derive value from that that personal relationship is very similar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You actually just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And  It doesn't hold to me to go to straight news to find out what the grand jury was in person is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but it to me it it reinforces the need for  Sort of not pure personality, but a personal voice in a personal perspective  Is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, if you can really do it and do it well  But to have the 87th take on the same news  We already know and to say my value is to add a little personality to that that goes in real real fast  Do I say that in a place where we're not doing reporting right now? We're just  Thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing I like about Andrew's model and and  Amanda Palmer's model is it is just them and their fans  So that that was why Andrew wanted to do the sort of direct crowdfunding or paywall or whatever  You want to call it? He wanted it to just be him and his audience or readers or community  That's all that matters. No one else is involved in that relationship. So there's no intermediary  There's no you know, and there weren't even any advertisers to begin with just him and in and his community  Yeah, and if he serves them he wins and if he doesn't see doing well  Yeah, he's making a million dollars. That's well. Yeah, that's pretty good. I mean, he's got a team  You know, it's not just him, but I still think that's that's a substantial amount of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is and is is this so okay, so how does  What does this mean for?  Others is this model he had a Andrew Sullivan had quite a following to begin with he did he did  That seems to be a big part of this, right? It does

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, although one of the guys that I'm interested in is Ben Thompson who I wrote about love Ben recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but super smart guy. Mm-hmm. His blog is great. That's by the way, you know, and I've been that's a you  I'm glad you brought him up because here's a guy who didn't have a following exactly but because he's so smart  People like us we've had him on Twitter many times  People like you a lot of people talk about him  Because he's so smart. So it's possible. Yeah not to start without a following  But you have to be exceptional if you're gonna do that. Well, I do what you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is you still end up in what I would say is a blockbuster economy?  You can support a certain number of stars you and  Thompson fine, but there's only so much it's harder and harder and harder in an abundant world to get up to that top level  Where you can make it work now, it's always it's been true  How many musicians have there been and how many have been supported how many so always been that way? That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a better word this is better than the blockbuster I think you can have  More smaller successes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, and I think Ben is a great example of that Ben is a perfect example of  Kevin Kelly's thousand true fans when I spoke to him recently he had

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just crossed that threshold. So he's revenue comes not from advertising but from selling a newsletter zero advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so just the newsletter just access to his forums  I think there's advertising on the podcast or there will be but he gives away a huge amount of content on his site  This is free, right? And so he's that right? He's making on a on his sort of run rate right now  He is making a living for himself  From a thousand true fans. So that's the potential

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So at ten dollars a month a hundred dollars a year to subscribe to his daily newsletter. So it's very affordable  I'll compare that to Jessica lessons the information which is $400 a year 400 bucks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And and so is he making a killing? No, is he hugely wealthy? No, but he's a guy  He's making a living and he is one guy. There's no one else. Yeah, so  What has enabled him to do that is the web and social media and all the tools  you know cloud tools and all the things that have allowed startups to  To grow and and prosper with lower costs just barriers to entry are a lot lower  everyone is not going to be able to do that, but your ability to do that is is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Far greater than it used to be. It's kind is it kind of a meritocracy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. I think so. I mean Ben Thompson before he started writing his blog  Maybe a few people knew him because he was a PM at Apple or Google or whatever  But he was virtually unknown and then he started writing smart  Analysis of tech topics and there's always gonna be a hunger for that  He's made it harder for the next person to try and do the same thing  Because now he's kind of yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To me it's there's a real close parallel to the music industry where the era of the platinum artist making hundreds of millions of dollars  Is over or maybe not but it's it's less important and what that does mean is that many more artists  Even Pomfremus can make a living doing what they're doing. And I think that's preferable  To me that's preferable to the other way of doing things but  Regardless of whether it's preferable or not. It's kind of where we're headed  I think the only real concern was that no one would make a living

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. I  Know when I when I first wrote about I don't know if it was banner  But I mentioned the thousand true fans idea and I got an email  From someone a musician who had been inspired by Kevin Kelly's post which was years ago now  And he said that he was  Effectively doing that the only thing he pointed out was that it's a lot of work  It's a lot more work than just getting signed by a label and they send you checks and you have a handler who takes you  around places and  Whatever like you have to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right exactly  Your point a minute ago is there are more people who can be the independent and scraped by a living with really hard work  Than there were people who could make a living in music before how hard do you think Taylor Swift works these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, I think she works pretty hard  Yeah, and she has all the benefits of a major label  managers  Social media managers, no doubt, but to be really a success these days. I don't care who you are  I think you need to work really hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I would agree that that you know, we've still got the big heads. We've still got Taylor Swift  We've still got you know, big artists seem to be going  Yeah, no, but there's more room in between exactly, you know in between them and the sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Starving artist at the bottom you don't have to get the label the record label deal  You know listen reading really enjoyed  Keith Richards book life and  And he says we were all struggling, you know in England to get that record deal. That was all we live for every moment  That's what we live for because that's the only path to success now. There are many paths to success. That's good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely. In fact, you could argue Amanda Palmer by telling her record label  Lost and doing what she wanted to is far better off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the dress dolls were kind of an arty an arty group, right? I mean they weren't they weren't ever gonna be platinum

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no  No, and she has a book out now about just this model about about about giving people the opportunity to give

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I have to say there is no one path and I love that and everybody's writing the book  Well, this is how I did and the truth is what's great is  There are as many paths now as there are people and that's how it's supposed to be that's how it should be  It means there's opportunity. It doesn't mean you don't get you don't have to work hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amen, but it also the generosity of Jack Conti and Amanda Palmer in sharing how they do it and sharing what they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it? I think and that's what bothers me a little bit about YouTube is it's such a black box  I'm glad to see Jack Conti giving, you know, giving us the info and that's what we do here at Twitter  And I think that's the ethos and it's important because it's not look Twitter is no model for anybody except me  But I think it's good for people to see the inside guts of it so that they can think about their model

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm, but there are lessons there. There are even if you don't replicate what quick does. Hello, Jason Calacanis  There are lessons and models in what you do and people can can steal the best of it for this right for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and there are good  I mean Amanda Palmer has talked about some of the difficult parts of her model  You know, she she got a lot of criticism for her tour  Inviting people up to play and not paying them that turned into a big deal  She talked about that quite openly. She talked about where the money went  She you know, I think you if you once you kind of make that leap to crowdfunding or having your fans support you  it's incumbent on you to  To talk to them in and sort of you know be open about trans  Discuss those things. Yeah transparency. I would argue that now everybody is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dependent on their community  Yeah, that's pretty much the way it's always been but we just didn't know it and you cannot hide and transparency is good  Well, I just read an article  This was on slate about poor Jennifer Lawrence who is her  Career is mirroring Katniss's career in the Hunger Games kind of the involuntary, you know, I didn't  She didn't know what she signed up for. She said I knew that the paparazzi be annoying  I didn't know they'd be terrifying and  And you know and then some people make it she's she's making it because she is able to somehow survive all the attention the scrutiny  the terrifying events and be an interesting human  I maybe she's not authentic. She feels very authentic  And and that's gonna be going forward. I don't care if you're in the old, you know blockbuster movie model or in your in the modern  Community funded, you know independent artist model that's gonna be going forward. I think a requirement  That's why Taylor Swift has to work her butt off  Because she's posting on Instagram and tweeting and she's out there and then I think the old invisible stars are not gonna make it anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think Jeff and I definitely agree I think we agree that media companies of all kinds  Have to in and in fact  Journalists, I think have to be much more  Aware of the relationship that they have. Yes with the readers  If if they have one and if they don't have one they should get one get one soon. It's super important

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is the lesson, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's that's Matthew your book should be there any my book should be there any day and that's exactly what I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Relationship based model. Yeah, right. I think there's a there's a one common thread in all these different models. It's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And and I know you know this sort of ties into what we were talking about with  Facebook and how media companies and individuals even are are kind of relying on these  platforms to do a lot of the work for them and to sort of reach a  Community and I've had people say well what so what should you do if you're a media company and  Facebook basically controls how people see your content and you have no  Say over how that happens or even any understanding of how it happens and my only response has been  You have to be able to give your readers and your community something that Facebook cannot  Facebook can give them a link Facebook can give them lots of other stuff  But Facebook can't give them what you can give them which is a personal connection with them and and other ways of kind of  Pursuing that relationship apart from just clicking on things on the internet Facebook is one instance though of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whole lot of copyright has broken apart patents were breaking  The things that we used in the past traditionally to protect a creator and to guarantee them a revenue stream  Those things don't work anymore and and modern things like Facebook are they're ultimately going to break  So it all comes down to building a community  You're in relationship with and that will transcend these other broken models like copyright and Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think that you know when I work for a newspaper the model was if you were a person like me  Was get X or Y job with X or Y publication and then you're you're sad  Yeah, you know you have a platform you have a distribution channel that you control  You just get to say whatever you want the end then you just cash your checks and go home  And that just doesn't work anymore. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Find this exciting. It's always disruption. You know this kind of disruptions always tough on people  But I just I think that that ultimately this is I hope this is leading to what we thought the internet would be all about  Which is democratizing media and giving everybody an opportunity

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I celebrate. Yes, and this is you know listen definitely the first newspapers  Came in 1605 sorry breaking game got a time guys 150 years eventually the Gutenberg press and  The first ones all failed they didn't have a business model. They didn't know what they were doing  It was hard newspapers fell by the wayside one after another after another and then figure it out  And then in long came the steam press which helped a lot, but it took time to get the models  It took time to figure it out. We're nowhere near. Yeah, we should know no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean the consumer web you know is is barely  What 20 years old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you expect it'll change again, I  Think it is still change. It's gonna constantly change  I mean is it fair to say that building community is a will be always a key

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Authenticity I think it will be because I mean Amanda talks about this all the time  She was a busker before she started right you know being a professional musician  Busking has been around you know probably since streets were invented  And so that you know that's the original model you play and people throw things in your case  It's you just have now you the street is infinitely long, and you can theoretically reach lots of people  There's also lots of other people doing the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, she was what she was a bride  Boston she'd stand on a box  She was a robot bride and would bend down and yeah  I mean she's the her TED talk is a great introduction to that and I would like to say

That's what she wants to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the other part of it. You have to be true to yourself  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's authenticity. I guess I have also tried that by the way that but nobody wanted to paint you

Transcript:  Yeah  Show today brought to you one more with Matthew  I love getting Matthew Ingram and Jeff Jarvis on and I apologize for those of you who are tuning in for  information about the latest Nexus phone because  Whenever we get these two together we're gonna talk about stuff like this, but I you know I think if we do add value  It's not regurgitating the latest news stories, but it's doing the deep thought stuff where we kind of  think about what it means and what it means for us and  You know for all of us and and I think that that stuff's important and then to that the extent that we do that  I think we create original content, so please forgive us I  Want to talk about shoes  Shoes make the man you know dad always told me that I said always get a shoe shine before you go to a meeting and  nowadays  You watch you look at people there all we're all wearing sneakers. Here's an opportunity to stand out with some great-looking  Beautiful shoes that will make you look stylish  Sarah Lane was telling me yesterday on iPad today that or actually because I was money that  Guys women look at your shoes, and they judge you by the shoes you wear so how about Jack?  Erwin.com some beautiful shoes from Jack Erwin these are these are my new shoes from Jack Erwin now  What's great about these these are shoes that would normally cost you?  800 to a thousand dollars in a store because it's all Italian leather and  It's handmade and these are handmade in Spain  These are works of art. They're gorgeous shoes the kind of shoes when you see somebody walk down the street  And you go that you actually notice those are nice shoes  Look closely at the finish the soles  The upper hand-stitched leather the quality is there and Jack Erwin is disrupting the men's shoe industry by creating a luxury brand  But at non luxury prices  That's because they cut out the retailers and they sell directly to you shipping is free returns are free  In fact when you buy at Jack Erwin, and I encourage you to go to Jack Erwin comm slash twit for our holiday picks  I do when you choose the size  Subtract one full size from your shoe size to order  So if you wear a size 10 buy the size 9 because Jack Erwin doesn't skimp  They don't skip on the size I wear normally I wear a nine I got eight and a half's  They're beautiful. Look at these. These are the ones I can't wait to wear  To the holiday parties. These are wingtips  Beautiful shoes again the leather soles and every Jack Erwin pair of shoes comes with a nice shoe bag for travel some extra insoles as  well and and we're talking prices that are  One quarter to one-third as much as the high quality fine men's stores that you'd go to you go into Barney's you're gonna spend  A lot more than if you go to Jack Erwin comm of course many of us can't even get to Barney's  Buying shoes should be fun. The experience should be memorable. The quality should be right. Oh  I'm sorry. I can't stop smelling these they smell so good. That's cuz nobody's worn them. I these I'm saving  Look at these boots, I love these chase boots  On the website here. Those look so nice. I  Didn't I wasn't sure I don't know if I'm a boot man. I but I think you know, look at the suede. I  Just love these Jack Erwin comm slash twit offerings are limited and they change frequently  So if you see a pair you want buy them don't wait, trust me  They won't be there long. They these are all in limited supply, but that's how what they get the price down  That's how they get the quality up and I want you to try them right now Jack Erwin comm  slash twit j a c k e r w i n  Jack Erwin comm slash  twit I can't wait  To go to the holiday party our twit holiday party in my Jack Erwin shoes  We thank them for their support of twig  We we're happy to say that Apple has buried the hatchet  Apple had purchased along with the Erickson  Sony a  Couple of Microsoft had purchased the Nortel patents Apple put two point six billion dollars  into those patents  They're their consortium outbid Google and paid four and a half billion a few years ago for the patents and then  The partners Microsoft and Apple formed a company called Rockstar up your way in Canada  Actually, I think they're on the west coast  And all they were at what we call euphemistically a non-practicing entity  And not that means a patent troll my friends in the October last year Rockstar suit Google  handset manufacturers like HTC and Samsung  Android handset saying that they had infringed seven Nortel patents actually in the case of a Google all related to search engine technology  Google and Rockstar have settled and I have a feeling that  Rockstar is also settled with the handset makers including Samsung. This is Apple finally saying okay  Enough of the thermonuclear war  It's done and I think this is very very good news Cisco is signed a term sheet with Rockstar  It looks like we looks like it's we don't know what the settlement was though, right?  Not for Google for Cisco we think it was fairly hefty because they said they they're they're taking a hundred and eighty eight million dollar charge  But I don't know if there is any  money changing hands for these other ones I  Think it's often thought that just Apple lost its either lost its stomach for the lawsuits or maybe more likely realized it was hurting Apple  The lawsuits were revealing stuff about Apple that they didn't want to have revealed  And and they weren't winning outright and even in the Samsung case. They didn't get the money they wanted  So I think that's what's partly happening is that these companies are seeing this is bad for business all of this patent trolling

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm glad to see somebody making some money off Nortel networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a Canadian company is that why the rock stars in Canada? Yeah. Yeah Nortel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nortel was huge. Oh, I used to have a Nortel phone  Yeah, it was a gigantic part of the Canadian  economy  Flamed out in spectacular fashion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Phones have been to Canada over the long term now Blackberry and brought Nortel. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Nortel definitely had like Nortel labs did some of the early groundbreaking work on  networks and  sorts of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not that it's not that those patents weren't real  No, no, they were definitely real. Yeah, it's just that I believe Apple and Microsoft  Were using a manic competitively they were trying to put other companies out of business  Not the same thing in the other direction, by the way, right? Everybody does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nuclear war just stop now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for us end users  Because so much money of is poured into this litigation instead of into innovation

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's lots of you know, you can it's hard to sort of argue based on what hasn't been created  But you can certainly imagine lots of interesting  Things someone owned a huge ton of allegedly related patents, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I think there's startups that die stillborn all the time  Because people realize that they would be sued out of existence and they just say you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're not gonna do we're not going there and for a long time when I was writing about tech companies and stocks and as investments  Advisors were telling companies look you have to get you have to have something proprietary  That is patentable right has been patented or you have to buy something just so that you can wave it around  Defensively, you know, yeah defensively exactly. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where was it? What was that article as I reading about Apple with?  Lawyers would come to you know, the engineers and say okay. What have you done today? And then the engineer would say well  I did this. Oh, that's patentable. What else and they would just they would be filing patents on everything. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's patentable  It's because and I hope that this happens too is it's because of these process patents and these software patents that don't have anything  to do with physical  Machines. Yeah, they're an abomination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, usa  King of the united states you'll get  Well  to be honest to be fair we did this to uh  The left did it. Yeah king of the united states asked google who is king of the united states and they will inform you  this is funny because  This is actually a knowledge graph that refers back to the search engine land article about  How to google bomb the google bomb?  Google bomb. Yeah, so it's just so it was minor. That's bizarre  All hail king barack obama emperor of the united states  Says bright bard and they said it enough. I guess  That google said, okay  But for some reason  When I get this story from a mediaite  It's got a picture of darren wilson next to it. So i'm now really confused about what's going on. That is confusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, so google bombing still exists. Yeah, that's all  What are you gonna do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's hey, that's interesting the second I just learned something this second link on my when I did that search was prince henry of prussia  Uh, who apparently was at one point suggested as candidate for king of the us. Oh, well, so there's a little history for you there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  google fiber if you're lucky enough to have it  in austin in austin in austin  you dogs you  Will be 70 a month for the gigabit service, but they're the basic service leo  This is the amazing part to me there. It will there be five megabit per second five one basic service for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Free, you'll pay a three dollar build fee and then you'll be on the internet for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's aimed straight at dsl providers because five one is kind of a typical dsl speed. Yeah  Yeah for which they charge 20 to 40 dollars a month. So free

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says there's a construction fee of 300 bucks set up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know amortize that over a couple of years and then and then it's free from then on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It goes to google's business model the more you use the internet the more google makes full stop. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now 70 will get you a terabyte of cloud storage  One gigabit service 130 dollars a month  You will get tv channels as well and a dvr that record up to eight shows at once. I imagine it's a cloud dvr  So  It started in kansas city a lot of fanfare provo utah austin. They're planning to go to phoenix  Arizona and nashville tennessee. Do you think this is now a business for google that maybe they're going to roll this out everywhere  I know at first it was just to to rattle the cages of the  isps

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a bit of a run-in like a business feels like this is growing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't see why they wouldn't roll it out. I mean if it's that would make me happy  If it's getting more people online and right they've got the capital

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a capital intensive for the bill, but lord knows they've got the capital  It's a way to put it to work and they get the they get a higher dividend than anybody else because you're using the internet  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, that's they have a business model around this that makes sense  Compared to t-mobile  Who does the the more use the internet the more they don't like that  They have been reducing if you've if you went over your cat to stop  They would they've been reducing you to 128 kilobits or even 64 kilobits  Unless you ran a speed test and then say oh speed test quick turn it up. You're kidding. You're kidding me. No, no, that's  It's not legal anymore. They they're now gonna have to tell you  the federal communications commission investigated and they  They made t-mobile the t-mobile was agreed that they will actually send text messages to customers  It will tell them exactly what's happening and that their speed is, you know has been reduced because they exceeded caps  So they wouldn't tell people well the worst no not only would they not tell them but they would lie they would they would  They would turn it up on the speed test

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mind-boggling that sounds like a serious company. It's fine to do the right thing and make a whole big marketing push about how worthy  Uncarrier that's a very carrier move

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and they are also they exempt some streaming music services from download caps from data limits  Uh, that's that's that fast lane prioritization. We've been talking about  One of them by the way google music and the other xbox music  Music  See this is one where you go and soundcloud too as well, uh, this is where you go god. Well, that's great  But it's not really great because if you're not google or xbox or soundcloud  You're screwed. It's anti-competitive  actually, they now do 27 streaming services, so  Maybe the goal is to sell more t-mobile  You know accounts than to actually make money off of these guys pandora rhapsody iheart radio itunes  Samsung has something called milk i've never heard of  Very poor name by the way  Oh, yeah, i've got the milk services  slacker spotify groove shark ardeo  Uh, there are now 14 new services including xbox as we mentioned google play soundcloud  Radio tunes digitally imported fit radio fresco radio jazz radio live 365  Mad genius radio radio pup radio.com rock radio and seven. I think you could probably say that this is no longer  It's pretty clear. This is in the way to make  You know to do fast lane prioritization, but really it's just to make t-mobile more desirable  right  If you if you let everybody in on this then you're not really choosing winners and losers  And at&t does the same thing by the way  um  But yeah, so from now on if you're see I I am a t-mobile customer and you know what they say and I ask them again  And again unlimited. Yeah, it's unlimited truly unlimited. Yes, truly unlimited  Well, it is except that after a certain point they throttle you to 64 kilobits, right?  Right, that's not limiting it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, it sort of feels like it is though. It feels like you don't want to use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When i've had it happen a couple of times have you and it is I mean, it's practically unusable. Yeah  It's like 2g like maybe technically it falls into the uh category of well, we're still giving you data, but it's like you're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was the limit that you crossed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because i'm on the i'm on the 30 plan. Oh, you have that low low, which is five gigs of data a month  Okay, and then once you pass that then you get throttled down. Okay, and uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, five is right in that area where you probably hover around five, but sometimes yeah exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It hasn't you know, i've had that that plan for a while now probably a little more than a year and I think it's  Happened to me twice  So but you this is why they told you that  Yeah, I mean they tell you right out that you know, it's unlimited but after you pass five gigs  You're going to be throttled down to slower speeds. So I mean the 70

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's 70 80 a month and they say no, no, it's unlimited. So i'm not going to get throttled  I've never been throttled. So I don't know. I bet you will though. I bet I will I bet they're I bet unlimited

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was actually a court case in in canada rogers communications who I use or robbers as I like to call them  They actually went to courts  And got a decision that said they could call something unlimited even if it wasn't actually unlimited

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rogers is the worst. That's right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, stand on the shoulders of giants. I guess so the story starts with the uh,  Kind of I don't think a serious  plan, but uh europe  the european parliament  Somebody there suggested it turns out that somebody  Might be a lawyer for some of the big german publishers  Like what is it springer  Springer action sprayers  Uh proposed that google should be broken up into smaller companies  I have to be fair. I have no power to do that. They can't do that, but I have to be fair  I often said I wish google weren't in the content business with youtube  I wish google were in the flight business with ita it kind of muddles the muddies the waters if they're a search engine  That they also own some of the results that they will turn up. I understand the concern about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I get that much but but it's also it is an absurd thing and it's purely political  yeah, and even the the new head of the um,  Uh of digital for the eu said this ain't happening  He said that would be an action for a planned economy not a market economy and he's been trying to  hit the drum drum beats against google, but it's gotten absurd in europe and I wrote a  3 000 word essay warnings folks a 3 000 word essay on leistung schutz and such and um  the backstory here is that I went to the frankfurter augerman at zyton which has been the leader of  Technopanic, uh, they wouldn't run it, but my good friends at the site, which is a far better newspaper. Anyway, it's been online  Uh did run it in german and in english both links are on the run down. Yeah  So it's just kind of my what I said was that I think that europe is becoming a hostile environment for technology  You add up all the things we've talked about on the show in germany plus  the spanish link tax plus the right to be forgotten plus the eu on um  You know these these efforts to force the eu into  Breaking up google, uh who the hell would go invest in europe. So I go on about that  Um, I go on about um, techno panic you've heard that should go before but then at the end I do  Criticize google for saying I don't think they've done enough  Uh, they need to they even though they they legally do what's right about taxes. They gotta solve that  They haven't been open enough about the nsa  um  Even if I believe them that they're not cooperating they still need to be more open  They should be investing more in technology companies in europe to create a technology environment there  They should be doing as we discussed earlier real things to try to fix and help the news business not necessarily incumbents  But but but news as society  uh, and I and what I hope for is a return to kind of the wonder of the old days of  Of world's fairs and such um, but  Uh, I just I just see that, you know, it's all added up in europe and it's a pretty frightening picture  But you get right down to it  And so this is an effort to bring it all into one place if you really have nothing to do after dinner tomorrow at thanksgiving

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We want to get naps. This is the way fix your mic. I think we're using your laptop mic  Pope francis agrees with you. Did you know that he addressed the european parliament?

Transcript:  I mean, that's the biggest issue though with the whole right to be forgotten. It sounds like a great idea  But then who decides?  Who has the right to be forgotten and who doesn't right who decides what things deserve to be forgotten  Then you have some sort of  antiquated court system deciding  This needs to be forgotten, but this doesn't need to be forgotten. It's it's first court system, Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two minutes after the show ends I the doorbell rings and there's my nexus 6  I came back on on on the chat before leo had run off and I and I couldn't get the phone call to work  So I was using my old phone to show opening the new phone. Well, what do you think?  Should I get one problem? I had was my my wonderful wonderful car holder thing  Uh was too small. Yeah  Luckily, this is the plus size  Uh, so I went and got a new one of those. Uh, yeah, it's big battery life is fine  I think it's better engineering things like bluetooth. It didn't work so well. My one plus one are working beautifully  Serene is gorgeous  Camera's very good. I think yeah good. Yeah  Lollipop is uh working well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll show you uh  Some pictures, uh, I haven't taken a lot of pictures. I've only had it for a few days  Uh, it is a what is it 13 megapixels. I believe so. Yeah, um, let me uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so that was my criticism with the nexus 4 was the camera was just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, this is well if that's what you're comparing it to it's much better than that. The question is how it compares to  Let's see all photos how it compares to the galaxy note 4 which has an excellent  camera or the droid turbo it's better than the  Here's a here's a daylight picture, I think the colors are very accurate the detail is excellent  um  I think it's a good camera the camera app is  Uh, well, here's one thing that it is pure lollipop pure google and it is there  Many of the moto x features are not on there. So  Um, that's I mean if you like the the moto x always listening on all that you can't read change the phrase  It has to be okay followed by google  Um, oh even when I did that it went off  I don't I because kevin tofu

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our mobile guy was saying he just bought the moto x and he  Because he's gotten so addicted to the motorola stuff. Well, I have to the assist stuff that he just uses it all the time  Especially in the car or you know, but this is a much better screen a bigger screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a comparison of the of the two of the three actually the original moto x on the left  The 2014 moto x in the middle and you can see how much bigger  The nexus 6 is it's it's uh, significantly bigger. It also lacks some of the beauty of the moto x design  But it's a better battery life. It's 25 60 by 14 40 screen. So the screen is amazingly  Uh crisp I like the real estate. You like the real estate jeff. I mean you're not usually using such a giant phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, I like it one plus one was it was it's wider than one plus one it takes that little bit of use  But my old old eyes, uh, no, I I like it. I'm I'm still using my nexus 7  And if you compare the size of the two pretty close hugely different. No, it's that's big. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See though. Oh, there we go. Here's a low light photo. This will give you an example  This is in a darkened restaurant. I think it's very good. Yeah, that's pretty good. I think it's very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, this is michael's birthday party in a mexican restaurant. Can you put it in your pocket jeff? Yeah, I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I can it just hangs out a little more than than a regular phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's as tall as the one plus one was I wish the battery life were as good as the one plus one  That's my only uh really but I have have you had a problem yet?  Yeah, it doesn't go all day but I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wanted to go from when I unplug and actually by the way having wireless charging is very nice  But I wanted to go from when I unplug  At um at 7 a.m  To when I go back to bed at 10 or 11 and it doesn't do that. In fact, this is a particularly bad  day here, uh  I unplugged about 8 30 and uh, it's supposed to go to midnight  Um, I guess maybe i'll get i'll get a full day out of it. Yeah, really i've i've never got a full day  Yeah, I don't find that. Yeah, that's I never get past dinner if this went as long as one plus one  And if it had I know it's a pure google experience, so it's not going to have the moto stuff, but I love that moto stuff  You know the flipping your wrist to launch the camera and knowing when you're driving knowing when you're sleeping  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I well I can't said he uses he uses the voice activation all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I changed mine to help me obi-wan Kenobi which  Meant that it didn't go off by accident. This one goes off right more by accident  Yeah, someone sitting next to you can say, okay google and well you do  Okay. Now one thing lollipop does let you do is train for your voice. Oh it does. Okay. Yeah, that's new  Um, jason, you just got it. So you can't really just got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, I got the uh the white variant which could be why I ordered day one and only just got it this morning  Yeah, um pretty sure it was the white 64 gig

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is a 32 gig and uh, it has more free space after the operating system than any other  32 gig phone i've used including the moto x's  So I have had no trouble with lack of space on this at all and there's no card slot  No card slot. No removable battery  You know  This is kind of I I liken it to the it's the iphone of android phones  It's it's kind of pure and beautiful and simple  Doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but it it feels elegant and nice in the hand I think and uh,  Um, you know, it's kind of a pure android experience like the iphone might be a pure ios experience not that there's a choice  um, I actually uh  I like the I feel like this is kind of elegant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do like it is I like it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  So with 32 gigs, I think I had 27 free I had a lot  Which was nice because that means um, you know, I I put audio a lot of audio books on here and some music  And I take a lot of pictures. So  Anyway, yeah, so we all have our nexus 6. What do you use right now a nexus 5 matthew?  I've got the 4 believe it or not. Yeah, so you're due  Yeah, i'm definitely do. Yeah, i'm trying to decide the other one to consider is the is basically the galaxy note 4  Really? Yeah, that's because she says removable battery. It has sd card  Really a good arguably the best android camera  And um, and they didn't cruft it up as much as they have in the past

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  However, it is not a pure google experience by any means. Yeah, that's why I went with the nexus. I wanted  Pure google. I didn't want a lot of crap. You should get this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, or or if you're thinking about the moto x they're actually uh, they announced that they're gonna have a sale on cyber monday through motorola site  Yeah, 140 off and unlocked moto x which brings it like 350 or something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is 50 awesome for that or one penny if you go to verizon and get it subsidized so it's free on verizon  basically  Our uh our picks of the week coming up  In just a bit by the way, ifixit gave it a very high repairability score  They said if you can pry it apart the nexus 6 you need a spudger  But once you get into it, it's very it was something like 18 screws or something. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said it's very tedious 21 screws or 21 unscrew all the screws. Yeah, however  You know, I'd take that over glue any day

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really  Everybody says you if you want battery life get the sony z3 the xperia z3  Because it's got remarkable battery life and it's a 1080p screen. That's part of the reason. Yeah  I did not like the z2 that much. I've heard great things about the z3. I know I might have to get one  I'd have to get one just to just to test it  But that moto x at 350 bucks, that's a good deal  Our show today brought to you by fresh books.com.

Geeks beware geeks bearing gifts  Reimagining news just kind of what we were talking about at the beginning of the show  Really a must read if you're interested in the future of journalism. Thank you very much jeff. Thanks much. Take care  Matthew what have you been using anything you want to tell us about lately that you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, i've actually been using google's inbox for a little while me too  What do you think?  Well, I have to say i'm I like it  I like it a lot more on mobile than I do on the desktop desktop and maybe that's deliberate  I mean, maybe that's kind of what they were going for. It's the it's really easy to  To swipe through things and and mark a whole bunch of things that's done  With the check mark, which I really like so, you know, I don't scroll through  35 kind of email newslettery things I just archive them all  Instantly and I like the ability to pin things and to to set time  Um, you know say remind me tomorrow about this thing because I know i'm going to need to know about it  But it doesn't have to clutter up your inbox. I think it's  I have some issues with the ui. I don't really like  the colors and the sort of  Some of that stuff, but I the functionally I I really like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like it's early early early days on this  It's the first app that's ever got me to inbox zero ever ever ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So for that i'm very grateful. See i'm kind of ocd about that. I reach inbox zero all the time  not every day, but  I I have to uh, I actually was talking with craig newmark about this believe it or not  When I was in san francisco, we had coffee and and he admitted that he was sort of ocd about email as well  And I I have friends who are the opposite like they have 25 000 messages in their inbox. That was me  and so I I can't even conceive of that like if I have anything more than  A page I start to get anxious  So inbox is a great way of dealing with it. It makes it a lot easier

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like these previews  You can see them on the screen if you're watching the video that if it's a youtube video  You can actually play it in the mail. Yeah  If you want to track a package you just tap the link  If you want to view the map you just tap the link. I find this very  Uh elegant and simple well done. It's there's a lot missing. I would love to see there's no signatures  it's kind of a little bit of a missing piece, but  You know, there's I would love to see uh encryption  Or some sign some form of signing because I really like to sign, you know  You do a digital signing in my email so people know it came from me  A few things like that, but boy I tell you I think they got the right thing you you can um, you can delay an email  Till another time but you can also delay an email to another place. Did you know that is that something they added?  I didn't know that. Yeah, so look so here i'll show you. Um, here's a email from john c devorek saying I should sue  the washington times for their  new news  Podcast because it's t wt  Um, so I can snooze this so I click the little uh clock and I can you know, there's some pre-baked things later today  Tomorrow next week someday. That's a getting things done thing where you just put it off kind of interesting  But you can also pick it you can pick a place pick a place  So for instance, I could say, you know, i'm going to handle that when I get home  Right and I could put my home address in there and all this email would disappear  Until my phone sensed that I was home and then it would say okay and it would show up again in the inbox  That's very useful. Yeah  I feel like uh, I would like to see faster iteration on this  But I I you get the feeling this is a fairly serious enterprise for google. So I i'm sure we will see improvements  And it's a cool feature. Yeah  Isn't that neat? It's kind of like reminders  That's another day

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead. Yeah, I was gonna say they do the the sort of sorting is quite good  Yes, so, you know all travel related stuff is in one that's pretty smart like the the three tabs in gmail  I didn't find was granular enough and they've done a good job of kind of categorizing things and you can add your own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, um, I have for instance email from twit is its own mailbox so I can you know, go through those very quickly  Archive them instantly. Yeah. Yeah, throw them away right away. Yeah  Yeah, I highly recommend it and I think it's getting easier to get  Uh invited to a lot of us  Inbox users have received new emails  New invites I should say so I know friends. I didn't actually get invites

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For I guess maybe they have a time limit where you have to use it a certain amount before you get invites  Because I once I got it. I said, oh hey  Let me know if you want me to invite you but I didn't get invites for about a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have to make sure you're serious. Yeah  Exactly had to use it, but I like it. Yeah, very happy with it. Um, I have to say i've gone back  Uh to using agent and we've mentioned this before and i'm sure you have on all about android  But I was saying I don't have the moto x  Uh features on my nexus 6 but you know agent adds most of those features and does not seem to hurt the battery life too badly. I  I  I didn't agent so agent is really great  Um on moto x, you know, you know, it's situational awareness  So it knows when you're you set your sleep times for instance, and it will it will make sure it doesn't disturb you  That's the simplest one  Um, this does something that actually google now does which is records your parking spots based on  um bluetooth and motion or bluetooth or motion, but if you're in a meeting as I am right now  And so it'll take your calendar. This is what the moto x does. It'll refuse calls  It'll send a text you have your choices  You can say who can ring you who can vibrate you or you can say if you wish i'll send a text saying i'm in a meeting  Right now  Actually, I say i'm on the air right now  But if it's urgent text me urgent the word urgent and then agent the next time you call will let you through  um, it also knows when you're driving and will read you text this is most of the  capability of uh moto x is uh, what do they call call that situational awareness is what I call it  Um, and I so I like that a lot and agent is free. No  No, that's the thing is it is built in the moto x but this will give you a lot of those features  And I and it also has a nice widget which I use where if i'm in a meeting I can tap the widget  Uh, you know if it doesn't know that i'm in meeting I tap the widget and it puts it me in meeting mode message agent  Will continue to run until you manually stop it meeting agent. I should say so that's agent. It's a free program  Somebody told me about I know jason knows it. I love it
