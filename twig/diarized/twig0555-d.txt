This week in Google, the show where we talk about  the latest from the Googleverse, the Facebookverse,  the Twitterverse, and everything else  that we want to talk about,  because it's really a show for Jeff and Gina,  Gina, Jeff and Stacey.  And if Gina were here, Gina,  to talk about whatever is on our minds.  Gina, Stacey's predecessor, the great Gina Trapani,  who was our-  The old prior girlfriend problem.  Yeah, prior girlfriend, prior co-host, our founding member.  You know what I'm doing?  I'm a little nostalgic right now because tomorrow,  I think, will be the 15th anniversary  of the very first twit episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh wow, congratulations, Leo and Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we're having a 15th, you see the bugs on the screen,  that we are having a 15th anniversary.  We've been doing this for 15 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm bringing back-  Okay, that's enough, goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I had this kind of fantasy, as one does at four  in the morning, of on Sunday,  we're doing the 15th anniversary show,  and it's a reprise of the original show  with Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, and Robert Heron.  Same four people.  And I had this fantasy at the end saying,  well, that's it, see ya, hope you have a good life, bye bye.  That will not happen, I will assure you.  We're going to keep on going.  15 years, congratulations, Leo.  Congratulations, amazing.  Pretty proud of that.  One of the longest running podcasts.  Is there anything that's been running longer  than our twit show?  I don't think so.  Everybody, I'm in the big studio, but it's kind of weird.  I feel like I'm surrounded by bank robbers  because everybody's wearing masks now.  Sonoma County, the county we're in,  has announced starting tomorrow  that everyone outside of their home  must wear a mask at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was just like New York.  Is that what it is in New York now?  That he just agreed today.  We did it yesterday.  Our president in absentia, yes.  Governor Cuomo?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think that's interesting.  So the challenge is, if I have a mask on,  I don't think you can hear me quite as well.  So I don't know what we're going to do.  If everybody else is wearing masks, and nobody,  and we've set this up so that nobody ever uses  the places that I broadcast from,  either my office or here, nobody comes over,  nobody moves anything, nobody touches anything.  This microphone is presumably contaminated.  This computer, this mouse, this keyboard,  but nobody's allowed to touch it, ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all have Leo cooties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they stay, Jeff's 20 feet away from me,  with a mask on.  So I guess we'll be all right.  Technically, I'm supposed to wear a mask,  but I think given that we've taken-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What Cuomo ruled is that in cases  where you cannot social distance,  which is six feet, you put the mask on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was a little more draconian.  They say you should always have it on.  So, and then there's, yeah, the issue,  where do people get masks?  That's why I am embarking on my sewing adventure,  which I'm quite enjoying.  I realized all of those t-shirts,  you know how it is, Jeff, over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of t-shirts.  You know, Leo, I think swag bags would make a better filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently they do.  The best, somewhere I read, I don't know if it's true,  that the best material is blown polypropylene,  the kind of material used in reusable grocery bags.  It's kind of a plasticky feeling.  But you can't breathe through it.  Apparently those are the best, that's the best material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife got vacuum cleaner bags.  Yeah, I have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, those are bad,  because don't they have fiberglass in them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay, I was like, no, no, don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The New York Times recommended EnviroCare,  which is what I got.  And I'm sorry if you have, I can't, I got some,  I got the most obscure vacuum I could find.  So I didn't want to deprive anybody  of actual vacuum cleaner bags.  But I only bought one set of 10,  but I'm gonna use those as interchangeable filters  in my masks.  My mother said, you should sign the masks.  You could sell them as a designer.  They're gonna have company logos,  but not the whole thing.  It'll just be like, you know, itter.  And I'll do it at an angle.  So you'll know, it looks familiar,  but you won't know what it is.  Because it's all those old t-shirts I'm cutting up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the, I'm gonna put this in the chat.  Oh no, I don't wanna do that.  The guy who cuts my hair.  Yeah, what's he doing?  I'll show you, he's cutting hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How is he cutting hair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in the video?  Without sound down, there's no sound.  Good, I don't need sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's-  I put it in the-  Let's roll the tape.  Here's the guy who cuts Jeff's hair.  Oh my God.  This is James.  This is actually your guy?  This is my guy, this is my guy.  Jeff, do you see my screen?  There it is.  So James Vigliotti in Warren, New Jersey,  hair studio 101.  He's in a tent.  I've never seen a standing tent.  I haven't either, I'm trying to figure out how that works.  And then he's cut holes in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did he build a tent?  Cause they sell those kind of tents  for like changing at the beach, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably what it is.  Really, oh.  So you sit in front of him,  he reaches his hands wearing gloves through the tent,  he's wearing a mask and the tent protects you  from most of the fibers,  and that looks like a pretty good way of doing it.  There might be a little leakage.  I'll have to get one of these for my hair cutter.  Sure would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'm getting tempted.  So I have a beard trimmer, right?  With various settings.  Yeah.  I'm just wondering if I just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried to convince Andrew to do a buzz.  I was like, just buzz it off.  It's gonna grow back by the time you're in-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a new sponsor coming.  You perhaps heard of manscaping.  And they sent me one of their manscapers.  You're not supposed to use it anywhere above the waist,  but I think I could.  It might look like a giant testicle, but other than that,  no, my hair, I'm gonna be able to do a man bun.  I'm going all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting there.  I'm getting there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going all the way.  Gonna have a ponytail, baby.  That is-  Me too.  I don't know what's gonna happen.  Your hair is shorter than mine right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, the back is horrendous.  I'm like, ugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you do?  Lisa has mentioned that in a couple of weeks,  everybody's gonna know what everybody's real hair color is.  Yeah.  This is mine.  You can't get, well, see, you're good.  I thought it was blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought your real hair color was blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I took the blue out,  although they did some brown dye over it,  so now it's kind of green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really hate it when you, yeah,  if you don't get the chemicals just right,  it can really fry your hair.  Google has launched a journalist,  this is following in Facebook's footsteps,  a journalism emergency relief fund to support local news.  Jeff, good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not, I'm trying to keep straight all of this.  So it's both the Google News Initiative and Google.org.  So Google.org gave directly to an effort at Columbia  and international journalism, something or other.  I'm forgetting suddenly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was part of the 800 million they committed,  which was mostly ad breaks, ad deals,  but still some of it was actual cash.  This one, so Google has not detailed  the exact size of the fund.  This is from nine to five Google,  but earlier this month committed six and a half million  to fact checking efforts related to COVID-19.  Applications today will open for local news operations.  They'll close April 29th.  Reproval will happen on a rolling basis.  They'll ask for basic information, overall organizations,  and how the funds will be spent.  It's available for publications all over the world,  Asia, Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa,  North America, and Latin America,  but not for any Antarctic newspapers.  It is.  At a higher level, Google requires that funding goes  toward quote, original news for local communities  during this time of crisis, not for instance,  lifestyle sports, although I think sourdough recipes  probably would qualify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so, because everybody's doing them.  Everybody's doing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, there is now the sourdough backlash.  Did you read that?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did, that's silly.  People have been baking and being all fancy  about their sourdough forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but a lot of us, because we're stuck at home,  bread is a little hard to come by, have taken it up again.  But then there are people saying,  if I have one more sourdough, anything, I'm gonna just.  I love sourdough, love sourdough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I made sourdough waffles today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?  I made sourdough pancakes last week.  They were fabulous.  Because one of the problems with sourdough,  as you feed it, it grows, right, Stacey?  And you get more.  Oh yeah.  There's more every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Notice everybody, he asked Stacey,  he knows I don't know crap.  You don't make sourdough, I could tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're just a sour puss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We haven't had, we're a case of you.  Hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And suddenly it's like the Cuomo's.  It's like.  That is the funniest thing to watch Governor Andrew Cuomo  on his brother, Chris Cuomo's CNN show.  They are just, they're awful.  Confused the hell out of Europeans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, isn't this an ethical violation of ethics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, CNN for years did not allow that.  They would, on Chris's morning show apparently,  which I never watched,  but apparently he would have to step aside  and let another anchor do the interview  when Governor Cuomo was on.  I think in that case, they're right.  But in this case.  Now it's a different matter.  Chris Cuomo himself has COVID-19.  He's doing his show isolated in the basement.  It's actually been pretty dramatic  watching his ups and downs.  He's had some, he's not.  How's he doing lately, do you know?  He seems to be getting a little better.  I watched last night.  You know, there's a test,  I guess if you go off the NSAIDs,  go off the aspirin or the ibuprofen or the Tylenol,  if you can stay fever free for 72 hours,  you're considered, I don't know if cured is right,  but you're considered on the road to recovery.  And he said he tried that and he didn't make it.  He got a fever in the last 10 hours of the 72.  So he's still sick.  It's rough stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is rough, rough stuff.  I'm finding out people I didn't know had it.  Oh really?  Yeah, a lot.  They're just suddenly, oh yeah, you didn't know?  Someone had three horrible weeks.  Well, it isn't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like how did I not talk to a friend  for three horrible weeks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It isn't, and it isn't always horrible.  We still don't know if my son had it.  Came back from Bali on the 28th,  got sick, went into self-quarantine,  got sick a week later.  So that sounds like to me it's not a cold,  you would have gotten that quicker, right?  But his symptoms sounded like a cold.  He did have a dry cough, did not have a fever.  He had a bad headache.  He had muscle aches and was weak.  So he had some, but not all of the symptoms.  He has mostly recovered now.  I think he's fully recovered now.  But we could never get him tested.  Thank goodness, thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, how did he get home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He got a mostly empty flight,  mostly empty flight through Tokyo on United.  Oh, oh.  Wasn't too expensive.  I think they're really cheap now.  Not bad.  They've gotten a lot cheaper now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to find here.  So one of my favorite, so I have my,  I'm gonna plug my Twitter list, my COVID Twitter list.  bit.ly slash COVID Twitter list,  where I have more than 500 epidemiologists,  virologists, infectious disease physicians,  frontline doctors, researchers, NGOs,  and a few, a smattering, a soup soul of journalists.  So anyway, in my list today, I've got my favorites.  I've got a lot of favorites.  And one of them, Andy Slavitt.  So Andy was  a former  ex-Obama healthcare head.  And he's very outspoken and very smart.  So he went out for a field trip today  and got a, just to see what it was gonna be like  to get an antibody test.  He had no antibodies because he hasn't been sick.  It cost $99 from some company that was just doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Blood test?  Yeah, I think so.  So this is, yeah,  because that's the only place the antibodies live  is in your bloodstream.  This is,  something people have talked about as being the next step,  but you have to draw blood.  And so a home test, as a diabetic,  I have no trouble pricking my finger,  getting a drop of blood, putting it on a test strip,  which is what the process is.  So I could do it easily,  but I don't imagine if you've never done that,  it's something you would know how to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I grew up with a diabetic, so I'm used to watching it.  And yeah, no problem here.  It's not painful, it's not hard, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they have the automatic injection things  where you just go, thwk, and then you tap it?  Or do you have to actually prick yourself  with your own pin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would imagine that the kit would include a thwk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, the thwkers are very easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So our last cat was diabetic in her last year.  So we had to do blood sugars like three times a day  for the cat.  So I'm used to thwking cat ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are breaking Jeff Jarvis's four basic editing rules  for the crisis.  Because we're pretending to be experts when we're not.  We're just repeating information we've heard somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was an interesting case.  So the New York Times had a story about a sloppy lab  in Wuhan, could this have had an effect, and da, da, da.  I saw that.  And I watched my virologist and epidemiologist  and infectious diseases experts in my Twitter list.  Just all of a sudden as one,  they will rise and go nuts over reporting.  And so they went nuts over this,  and they were right, I think,  because it was raising suspicion and hackles  that wasn't legit.  And they didn't talk to, it was a story about virology,  and they didn't talk to a virologist.  That's rule one.  If a story, according to Jeff Jarvis,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if a story involves virology,  demand the reporter talk with, cite, and listen  to a virologist, ditto epidemiology,  and that's rule two and rule three,  don't assign political reporters to science stories.  Anything, unfortunately, I mean,  here we are talking about virology,  what masks work and what you should prick yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, I am not a virologist, y'all.  I don't think either of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, none of us are.  So we'll stop now with the advice.  Nobody knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And rule five, rule five,  do not show Jeff his tweets in dark mode.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just looks so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People.  I don't know, it hurts my eyes if it's white,  if it's light mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Slavitt says, just for further information,  that there's a wild west of unapproved antibody tests.  The FDA approvals are hard to get.  He went to see what the experience was  and see what the positive rate was.  And so the issue is gonna be pretty soon  as people are gonna insist that they have a piece of paper  say, I got the antibodies, I'm safe, I'm okay.  And we'll see what happens with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's gonna create, I'm very curious  if we end up creating incentives over the next few months  for people who are immune, if they are indeed immune,  to go out into the world and have benefits,  which would increase the incentives  for people to go out and try to get sick  so they can go out and continue working.  Oh, that would be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although for somebody like my son, by the way,  we still don't know only an antibody test will show,  but if he's hoping he was sick,  because it was mild, he survived.  Oh yeah, no, if he's going through it.  And now he would be golden, right?  Imagine, there's a guy who just got out of college.  What's he gonna do?  Door dash.  Yeah, he can work in an Amazon fulfillment center.  But I imagine if you're provably immune,  which again, by the way,  just because having the antibodies  does not mean necessarily you're immune.  I don't know what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't know now how long,  they don't know if there's still a viral load,  there's all kinds of things they do not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't know a lot.  We don't know nothing.  But I mean, he's thinking, I'm gonna be golden.  I can get all kinds of jobs.  Henry Badnews, you probably end up working in a hospital.  Okay, moving on.  Let's talk about the Google and Apple initiative,  because I think that's very interesting.  But I'm gonna preface that with some information  from an actual security expert, our own Steve Gibson,  who spent some time on the show yesterday  talking about this.  And he was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rule six, if you're gonna do Australian security,  talk to Steve Gibson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, at least get a Steve Gibson stake on it.  A very interesting idea.  So just the reason why Apple and Google are doing this.  Well, first of all, and I think Steve said this,  and I agree with him, it's nice to see,  or maybe it was somebody on Twitter,  but it was nice to see tech companies  more than giving money, writing a check, helping journalism,  do something actually within their sphere of ability  and skill.  Use their magic for good.  Yeah.  So as everybody knows,  Google and Apple have a considerable location information.  Your iPhone and your Android phone,  both could be used as trackers.  But there are huge privacy concerns doing that.  So Google and Apple,  also having lots of experience  with protecting privacy and security,  got together and created an API,  Application Programming Interface,  that could be used by apps from health authorities  to help in this post-shelter-in-place world  where it's very important,  once you've detected somebody has COVID-19,  to trace their contacts so they can all be quarantined.  Contact tracing, this is called,  it's part of a containment strategy.  So they proposed a method to preserve privacy,  but still have this work automatically.  First of all, they propose it to be opt-in.  Of course, once they've created this API,  there's no way they can insist on it being opt-in.  They will-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not true, actually.  They can control who has access to the API  once they create it,  especially because it's at the OS level  that they're going to be doing this.  That's true.  So they could say to developers,  if you are not a health, I don't know if they will,  but they could actually say,  yeah, you don't have access to this API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, go on. That's a good point.  Yeah, so they're going to push out next month  to all Android phones.  Google's going to do that through the Google Play Store,  and it will be automatic,  and you won't have a choice about that.  It will be through Play Services?  Play Services, I mean, that's right.  Sorry, sorry, Leo.  Good correction.  No, no, no, good correction.  You have Play Services  because you have the Play Store on there.  The point being, it's not an app download.  It's going to just be pushed out as part of services.  It will be a new service, in effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you talked briefly about location,  but this doesn't actually use location,  and that's what makes it privacy-protecting.  It uses Bluetooth,  and it's basically using the Bluetooth network  to ascribe tokens to people.  They're not linking it to the location information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although that is a point of contention,  which we'll get to in a second.  Apple will also be pushing it out mid-month, mid-May,  to their iPhones,  and then presumably somebody can write an application.  Both Apple and Google say eventually  they will write an application.  The way it works, each device, your device,  will every morning, in the beginning of the day,  create a token that is uniquely identifiable to your device.  And then every 10 minutes,  no, I'm sorry, every 15,  actually what it really technically is,  is between every 10 and 20 minutes,  roughly 15 minutes,  it will generate an additional token using Bluetooth LE.  When you come near another device running this API,  which is presumably every smartphone,  you will exchange these tokens.  So that person will have your token,  which has in it, built into it, effectively,  the time of day that you guys were within  30 feet of each other.  If you test positive, at that point,  you push a button on the phone,  or maybe more likely to prevent pranking,  after you get the test, you'll get a QR code,  you'll scan on the phone, or something of that nature.  Ah, okay, thank you, that makes sense.  That's important because they don't want people  just to say, yeah, positive.  So you'll have somewhat verified way  with a health provider to say I'm positive.  Then your phone will take all of the identifiers  of the people you've run into over the last,  I don't know what the period of time is,  but something like-  14 days.  14 days, that long?  I believe so, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It needs to be.  You could be asymptomatic that long.  You could be- You could be asymptomatic.  Degus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so 14 days.  Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic.  Yeah, so for whatever period of time you were contagious  prior to your test, and those tokens will then be used  to send a ping to all of those people's phones saying,  you, without any names, naming no names,  you ran into somebody who's COVID positive,  you need to quarantine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You won't know when and you won't know where.  Right.  You'll just know that you passed.  The other angle of this too, and Stacey,  that I remember reading, but I didn't understand,  your own token changes at some regular rate, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, your token changes.  Everybody's token changes every-  Every 10 to 20 minutes.  Day?  Is it 10 to 20 minutes?  Well, you have two tokens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have your daily token, which is daily, 24 hours,  and you have a 10 to 15 minute token.  That token is important that that changed  because that's how you know you ran into somebody,  because you got to have those tokens match  so that you go, oh yeah, that's the person I was talking to  at that time of day.  Right.  Yeah, 14 days.  It says so right there.  You got it, 14 day temporary store.  So a number of people, including Moxie Marlinspike,  have raised issues, some of which have been,  like the prank issue that we just talked about,  have been shot down by Apple and subsequent white papers.  There is some concern that this system  could be used by ad tech,  that it could be, you know, surreptitiously,  that there might have to be  some personally identifiable information  at some point exchanged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the issues that this has is  when you test positive and you say that,  you have to put a lock on that token.  So then you're, sorry, you are now linking  your magical token, basically,  that no one knows is associated with you,  with all of these other tokens.  So it's theoretical that you could go back  and figure out who that person is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's tied to, and this is,  Moxie mentions this, so does Steve Gibson,  already the MAC address of your device  is rotated every 15 minutes on your phone,  or I don't know what the time period is,  roughly every hour or whatever.  It's rotated on your phone to avoid this,  precisely this tracking.  If you had the same MAC address broadcast via Bluetooth LE,  then stores would say, oh, here comes Leo.  But you can't because it's not the same  MAC address every time.  Oh, I didn't know that.  So I will say, I didn't know that either.  Apple pioneered that, yeah,  I think it's a really good technique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think actually the bigger danger  is not hacking or even ad tech,  but it's people twofold.  One, for this to be useful, lots of people have to use it.  Even in Singapore, the people using the contact tracing app  is not super high.  I think it was less than 20%, and that's Singapore.  But also, right now, the way it's engineered,  and they could fix this, because it is using RSSI,  so signal strength, or because, I'm sorry,  it's just using a binary on-off  as opposed to something like RSSI.  What happens is you don't actually know,  if I passed within 30 feet of someone,  I'm probably not in an outside.  There's a lot of false positives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's a lot of false positives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you could fix that, because with signal strength,  you can say I spent 30 minutes in the same vicinity,  like 30 feet away, and I could even say  as simple as I was five feet away from someone who's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  covered positive. So ScooterX says it is using RSSI,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is the signal strength.  But they're not putting that into any sort of score  that helps you understand.  I guess, yes, that's how you would track is using RSSI.  But it's not-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, one of Steve's points was that you can presume  Apple and Google have thought of all of the things  that you and I are going to think of  and have built that into the spec.  But who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But some of those things are hard.  Like calculating, so yes, calculating how long  someone's been there plus how close they were,  that takes a little bit of computing power.  I mean, that's the kind of stuff that's happening  on your phone all the time.  And that's why your cellular modem eats up power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's not promote that,  because I don't want people to have any reason  not to put it on their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the trade-off is if you,  the more accurate you make this,  the more battery consumption it's probably going to consume.  Let's not promote that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because I don't want to give people any reason  not to do this.  And I had a little fit with Ali Velshi,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who I would consider a friend,  because he did the usual, uh-oh tech  and brings on the privacy police.  And well, but I don't have Bluetooth on my phone  because out of privacy.  I said, come on, man, priorities, priorities.  But Stacey, to answer your question,  to add to your question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scan results, I'm reading the white paper from Apple.  Scan results shall be timestamped  and RSSI captured per advertisement.  So they are going to use signal strength to,  otherwise you get way too many false positives.  Philip?  Scanning interval and windows shall have sufficient coverage  to discover nearby contact detection advertisers,  service advertisers within five minutes.  It doesn't say anything about distance so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it doesn't say they're using that data  to actually tell someone,  they're not saying how they use that data.  They're just saying they use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't-  Well, they might later on.  I'm just, this is one part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I added something to the chat that kind of addresses too,  that part of the issue here is,  one of the big fights in the science world,  which I only observed, I'm not a scientist, I don't know,  is aerosolization.  Is this germ aerosolized?  That is to say, snot has gravity, it's heavy,  it goes only so far and it goes down.  Aerosolization is it's still light  and it can travel farther or longer and stay in the air.  And you can, which means you don't necessarily  have to have been near someone for a long time,  they could have moved on.  And interestingly, this paper I just put up in the chat  that was linked to by Eric Topol,  who's one of the people I trust, a physician and author,  says that talking can be as bad as coughing  and volume of speech can make it worse.  So people like me who are allowed are more dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, also, and I've heard this also,  that if you spend 10 minutes sitting across  from somebody talking, that is much more of a problem  than if you walk by them.  And I don't know if what provenance is built into this,  system, I'm sure it is, but I don't know what it is  that would determine the length of time that your contact,  not just distance, but how long you spent with this person.  All of that's relevant.  They're just trying to increase,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's the same as my wife going into the store.  We've decreased our contact with other people hugely,  but all it takes is one.  So just you have fewer ones.  And in this case, certain number of people  aren't gonna use this and it's gonna be false in some cases.  Okay, so this is a reducing.  This reduces some cases.  Yeah, you wanna get your R-naught down.  If you get the R-naught down below one,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doesn't have to be perfect.  It has to be below one to eliminate the virus.  As long as each person is infecting one or fewer people,  you don't have the geometric growth  that we have right now that's problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So.  And my stupid way to put it, it's like fuzzy logic.  You're close enough, right?  You may not be exact, you don't need to be exact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In other words, if it's good, that's good.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  So Steve's basic point was having read all the white papers  and digested all the information  that he feels this is a very good system.  Yay.  And it's effective and it is sufficiently private.  And that's what I would expect from both Google and Apple  is something like that.  There is this issue of if it's voluntary.  Now it doesn't, I mean, honestly,  it doesn't have to be voluntary.  If the government decides to put out an app and say,  you must download it and use it.  And if we see your phone doesn't have it,  we're gonna have the right to check it.  There's nothing to say that that can't happen.  So just because Google and Apple say it's voluntary  doesn't mean it will always be voluntary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let me understand something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But also I want to say one more thing.  I think people will do it.  I think people will do it.  Look at, it's not 100%,  but look how much compliance you're getting right now  in an extremely painful way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what, Leo?  Here you've got a couple of things working.  You've got anti-tech and anti-big company  and privacy fetishism and moral panic.  No, I don't think so.  Having an influence.  I think people will do it.  You're gonna have some number of people.  Sure.  For God's sakes, people who won't vaccinate  their children against disease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have people going to parties, of course.  In church.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do think it will be harder to get people to adopt this  than to adopt social distancing.  Really? Because you find it,  yes, because social distancing.  It's easier to say no.  Well, there's an element of shame  in social policing associated with this,  whereas no one knows if you have an app on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know.  We'll see.  It's gonna happen.  They're gonna put this out.  They're gonna put out an app.  I don't know if health officials will embrace this or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they putting out an app or are they waiting for help?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was my question.  Yeah, where are the apps themselves coming from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The apps are supposed to come from health,  like public health agencies or.  Initially.  Possibly hospitals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Initially, unless I misread, Apple says.  Why wouldn't Apple put out a universal app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, because I don't actually want Google and Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to have this.  Let me finish reading this.  Later this year, iOS and Android.  So starting in mid-May, the API be out.  Apps can use it.  Those apps coming from presumably health authorities,  not Apple and Google.  Later this year, don't know when that is,  iOS and Android will receive updates  that will let users opt into contact tracing  without installing an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there is it going, if there's gonna be an app,  that would have to come from health officials.  But you won't need an app at some point later this year.  We don't know when that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the data from this that Google and Apple get,  are they going to keep it?  Are they gonna donate it?  Are they gonna delete it?  What's the policy there?  Because that's another important question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their point is there's no personally identifiable  information in the data.  The system is set up so that your name,  I understand.  None of that is attached.  So what if Google and Apple get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't, because if they have that data  tied with my location,  But they don't know it's your location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They get a bunch, they get a bunch of identifiers.  But they have the MAC address of the phone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not built into that.  No, it's not built into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  In theory, and Moxie Marlin's bike was concerned about this,  but Steve said, no, I don't think so.  In theory, there is no PII associated in any way  with either that daily number or the rolling number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, they did vow that they would use this data  for nothing else.  Now, is there an audit of that?  Is there, you know, I'm sure Congress  is coming to the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just thinking about like Verily,  which they launched their like COVID testing tracker thing  through Verily, and they did not have a privacy policy  that precluded that data being used by Google  for other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, I thought they did, they've added it though,  I think.  They said to Congress that they were not gonna use it.  Right.  And they argued, I think, properly  that they had to use Google Signing  because they wanted to be sure of the identities  that they were working with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think there's a good point there.  Because there's also liability.  I think this is intentionally designed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so that there is no information that they could use.  What Moxie said, what his concern was  that there could some retro matching could be used  or this technology could be used by illicitly by ad tech.  But this isn't, I think, very consciously being designed  because of that objection,  not to have any PII in the actual numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's fun about this then is,  by gosh, we could do a lot more privacy focused app designs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And I think Apple does do that.  They have something they call differential privacy,  which in theory, although there's some debate  over this as well, ensures the privacy.  So there is some question  about how widespread this used to be.  I'm going to go on record saying,  I think it'll be very widespread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you'll be surprised.  I hope it will be.  But here's another question.  Could you imagine, so I have the app.  I wanna brag about the app.  I wanna push the app.  I wanna say, look at me, folks, I got the app.  I'm a good guy, right?  What do I do?  Start walking around with my phone like this  with the app up?  Do I get a little Bluetooth badge that only works with it  if it says, yes, he has the app?  I mean, what can we imagine that would say,  yep, Jarvis is a good guy.  He's got the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think there'll be some peer pressure.  Could you write an app that points out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can change your Twitter avatar to I got the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there'll be things like that.  Could you do an app that beeps at you  if you're around people who have phones and Bluetooth on  but don't have the app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  That's gonna drive people nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, I'm just being an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm like, oh, I guess you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I honestly, maybe this is stupid of me.  And certainly, I'm glad that we would talk about  the pros and cons.  I don't wanna push too many hypothetical privacy concerns  around this because I think it's important  that people do this.  I'm not worried about hypothetical privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was mostly worried about hypothetical false positives  and a false sense of security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's up to the health officials to worry about.  That's not-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacy, let's be clear here.  This is merely an aid.  We have to have human contact tracers, thousands of them.  It is test, trace, isolate, test, trace, isolate.  This is not tracing.  This merely adds in another layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not.  It is not contact tracing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Contact tracing is-  It is in theory, if everybody had a smartphone, it would be.  Even then, contact tracing, properly done,  is gonna be, I get it, and I tell the tracer  where all I was the last 14 days  and who I had contact with by name  so they can be called-  I think that's gonna be less accurate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  than the automated system in your phone.  It all adds up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all about reducing the load,  trying to get as more of the people who've been exposed  isolated to reduce the R-naught.  Again, I'm no epidemiologist,  but I'm reading a lot about this stuff.  That's what people were saying.  It's not gonna be a perfect system,  but without human contact tracers  who are trained to do this, this won't work.  This is not sufficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't be willing to say that.  The whole world isn't sufficient.  I wouldn't be willing to say that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, even though Apple and Google say this,  they say this is not, the main lead at Apple says,  this is not sufficient.  This is an aid.  Okay.  And listen to me, I'm the Mr. Tech Optimist.  Tech will not solve this.  This requires human investment and human effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I absolutely hope they do that, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to.  No, the one they're starting, right?  The smart governors, Massachusetts has started hiring  contract tracers, New York is gonna start hiring,  and the East Coast cabal.  And until you have sufficient testing at scale  and contact tracing with reliability,  and you isolate people who are exposed,  there's no reopening.  It's BS.  Because the only thing that's different between now  and a week ago is that my odds of being refused  a ventilator went down.  That's it.  Everything else about what was going on is still there.  I can still get sick just as easily as I could last week,  and I can still die just as easily as I did last week.  And people have to take this very seriously,  says an old guy who's vulnerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And contact tracing is being pursued in some countries now  with some success.  Yes, that's where it works.  Yeah.  South Korea and Taiwan name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Leo, I agree.  I don't wanna hear BS privacy discussion.  I don't wanna hear battery discussion.  I wanna hear that this is a generous social act  that you do as a responsible member of society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't know about you guys.  I won't speak for you guys,  but I will run it the minute I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will too.  I will too, eagerly and gladly.  And I'll brag about it.  And as Governor Cuomo, as President Cuomo,  as I like to call him now,  said today.  Do you really want President Cuomo?  As a New Yorker, as a New York City person,  I'm trained to dislike him, but now we've developed.  So as he said today in his briefing today,  he required the mask.  He said, listen, you come to a street corner  and it's social pressure.  You see somebody without a mask, you say,  yo, what about the mask, buddy?  Yeah, Paul Thuron was talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A good New Yorker would.  Talking earlier on Windows Weekly,  he had ordered a meal at a restaurant,  went to the restaurant to pick it up.  You know, as one does to be safe.  And nobody was wearing a mask.  And he said, I saw red.  I started yelling at him.  They thought I was mad  because the order was late or something.  He said, no, you're not wearing masks.  I can't eat food if you're not gonna wear masks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You haven't done any takeout at all.  None.  You have.  At least it got you a nice meal.  Stacey, if you don't take out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do take out once a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Once a week, yeah, that's right.  I had a burrito yesterday.  That's our lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's delicious.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I want?  You know what I want?  What did he else?  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A bagel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you said that on the AMA  and Lisa said, by the way, she agrees.  Tell Jeff.  Tell Jeff, I am him.  His answers in the AMA matched mine.  I want to go to the alcohol Taco Bell.  Because you said Taco Bell would be fine  if they had drinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Across the school, across the street from my school,  they have a Taco Bell Cantina,  which has alcoholic beverages,  which is the saddest thing I can imagine.  Hey, let's go to Taco Bell and get tanked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the deal about that.  So Taco Cabana, which is in Texas,  I don't know, it's gotta be other places too.  They sold alcohol.  They were like, Taco Bell that sold alcohol  with better tortillas too.  And they had their thing across  from the University of Texas.  That's where you would go when you were 18  and you didn't want to be carted.  So a lot of these places,  I think you can kind of ease in and be like, hey.  So you would go out and drink margaritas there  and it was not optimal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, she says,  there's a whole text message chain  going on behind the scenes now.  Lisa says she's taking you there  the next time we're in New York City.  Amen, amen.  I can't wait.  In about three years, four years, I don't know.  I think so.  Yeah, sometime in the late 2020s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm stuck inside for at least a year, is my view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Jeff and I are vulnerable populations  so we have to be extra careful.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  All those times you made fun of us for being old, Stacy,  you're gonna be sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't call it boomer remover for nothing.  I'll never forgive or forget your daughter for that.  No, I'll forgive her.  I won't forgive her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's her, she doesn't say it.  It was her classmates who said it.  I think it's hysterical.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do too.  She's reporting the zeitgeist.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know what?  If I were those kids, I'd be real pissed right now.  I mean, they've got a lot to be angry about.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  More good Google news, Google Classroom,  taking Italy's school system online  after quote, several sleepless days.  Javier Soltero, the VP in charge of G Suite,  said he got an email in March from his team in Europe  with an inquiry from Italy's Minister of Education  asking if Google's platform could take  the entire country's school system online immediately.  Several sleepless days and nights later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a gulp and a spit take.  Yeah.  The whole country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The service was up and running for millions of children  in Italy.  Classroom is of course really widely used, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  My daughter's been in two different schools  and they both use Classroom.  Classroom and Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's good.  Google jumping, leaping into the fray.  There.  Let's see.  Google did ban Zoom.  Oh yeah, we have a rundown, I forgot.  Yeah.  Oh, why don't we talk about anything you want.  You know the rundowns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, can we talk about the chips?  Oh, sorry.  I got excited, the dog got excited, we're all excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's talk about the chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The dog is going.  It's being banished.  No, the dog says never mind.  Chips, you said there were chips?  What chips?  Are they Fritos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Taco chips?  I was excited, she gets excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was so cute, she's very attuned to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is true.  Okay, can we talk about chips?  Yes, yes, I'm eager to hear the Stacey take on chips.  We can talk about anything you have a hankering

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's even Google related, you guys.  So these stories are out saying that Google  is going to build its own processors  for Probooks and phones.  Yeah, I thought that was very interesting.  Right now they're, oh sorry, what was that, Leo?  I thought that was very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they disenchanted with Qualcomm?  Qualcomm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who isn't disenchanted with Qualcomm?  But it's also, having a highly integrated  hardware, software and platform is good.  I mean, Apple's differentiated the iPhone quite a bit  because of its own stuff.  So this will be optimized, they're calling the chip  as code named Whitechapel.  Looks like it might be based on,  it's an ARM based processor.  Axios is, Ena over at Axios, she's delicious.  No, she is accurate.  I don't know where the delicious came from.  Says that it's going to be using Samsung's  five nanometer process, which means very far forward.  Five.  I know.  Five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I had read, and I'm not an expert in this,  that Samsung, that using five is a little bit of a misnomer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some fudging there.  And I can't remember if Samsung is using EUV  or how they're getting that far down on their process node.  But that's not the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't Intel still stuck at 10 nanometers?  Yeah, they're like 10, 11.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, in the 15 years of Twitter here,  we're just kind of interject here.  I remember when geeky discussions were like,  what inputs there were on the back of a monitor.  And now you guys are doing chip nanometers.  I am so impressed.  I bow before you.  Keep going.  It's thanks to Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was Moore's law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this is how we kept working.  I mean, moving down the path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, for a long time, as I remember,  five nanometers was considered the limit of Moore's law,  that it couldn't go any smaller than that  because of quantum mechanics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seven was really kind of where I thought we were.  So this was surprising to me.  But Kevin, I'll tell you over on About Chromebooks,  he talked about this and he said he had heard about it  about a week ago, but he was waiting for a second  confirmation, so he was kind of like, ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're so good, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, sometimes you get it, sometimes you don't.  But he doesn't think they're gonna be used for a Chromebook  because he doesn't see Google really focusing  on using ARM-based processors for Chromebooks.  So this may be just for the phone  and it's gonna have a Google Visual Core  and neural processing unit, which is kind of exciting  because that means we should see a lot more  AI capabilities on the device itself.  And yeah, and it's called Whitechapel.  That was the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Stacey, do I presume that Google,  you trust Google with chips because they make  hot doggity server stuff and all that,  they'd be good at this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, Google's had chip ambition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just hire people, Jeff, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they hire people from chip firms  and they've done their tensor flow TPUs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hot doggity dog.  And they don't make them, they just spec them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, okay, it's a little bit more than just spec.  What they're doing is they're taking  an existing processor design.  So Intel's is x86-based architecture,  ARM has variations of their ARM architecture,  and they'll take a license to that core.  When you take a license to a certain core,  that means you can actually rejigger it  as opposed to just produce the exact license.  So it's called an architecture license.  Google took that architecture license like a decade ago.  So they have been working on building chips

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and playing around with it.  that long, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody took an architecture license a while back  because they wanted to do it for their own servers.  So Microsoft has one, Amazon has them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's instead of letting ARM design the chip,  you have the right to design the chip around ARM ideas.  It's almost like a patent license really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Honestly, it would be irresponsible  if they haven't been working on this  because when you have,  and what's a little weird about this though  is Google is not successful at the level  that Apple is successful at selling devices  because for Apple, it makes sense to invest a lot  in developing a custom chip and architecture, right?  Or a custom chip for themselves  because they sell so many iPhones.  Google using this on like a pixel,  they don't sell that many.  So that's the only part of this that I'm like,  does this really make sense?  Now it says that Google is actually using  Samsung's Exynos chips that Samsung developed.  So maybe if it's gonna go in every single type  of Android phone, then that makes a little bit more sense  because then the economy is a scale makes sense.  I'm saying makes sense a lot.  So that's kind of a little,  when I saw this, I was like, about damn time.  And then I was like, wait a second.  And I was like, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  About damn time.  Yeah, I think it's, I mean, from a purely non-technical,  but purely a marketing point of view,  it's very interesting.  So as you point out, Apple's done very well  at having custom chips and custom silicon.  And I think, especially lately, Qualcomm has,  just as Intel has disappointed PC manufacturers  by being slow to market with improved chips,  Qualcomm has really kind of stalled some of their production.  And I think a lot of phone companies  are a little disappointed.  And now the new Qualcomm chip is being used in some phones.  What is it, the 855, is that it?  The new Snapdragon, I can't remember the designation.  But I do remember, and again, I just dim memory,  that there were issues,  people were just unhappy a little bit with 865.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think part of it is Qualcomm,  when you buy the Qualcomm application processor,  you're also getting a Qualcomm modem,  whether or not you want one.  Right.  Get it all, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Qualcomm has announced five nanometer chips,  so they're gonna do it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  The reason I mentioned that they were using five nanometer  is because it shows that these are incredibly advanced chips.  I mean, this is not yesterday's chip that Google's making.  They're really trying to work at the cutting edge.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what does this allow Google to do  in terms of the functionality of the phone, anything?  Well, I can tell you from Apple's point of view,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one of the reasons they like making their own silicon  is because they don't have to build in things  that they don't want, not merely the Qualcomm radios.  Oh, right.  But you don't have to, early on they had an advantage  because they didn't have to support flash.  And so-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can optimize for,  like if you say you want to really optimize,  like when Apple launched their, what was it?  You can optimize for things like video taking if you want.  And you can add-  Yes, exactly.  You can oomph up your-  Exactly.  Graphics processor for handling that.  And so those are all like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the difference, Jeff,  between, I'll put it in terms you'll understand,  buying a cocktail at the 7-Eleven or mixing your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say it's the difference between-  The Taco Bell's different.  Using like basic WordPress or, you know,  doing a custom CMS for your publication.  There you go.  Although custom CMSs are such a pain in the butt.  It may be terrible.  But designing a chip isn't easy.  Right, oh no.  And then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to rumors,  Apple has more than 1,000 chip designers,  people working in their chip.  A lot of them in Austin.  They bought, yeah, they bought PA Risk,  which is the big chip design firm for risk chips.  It's about a decade ago.  I mean, Apple put, there's a massive investment into,  and of course, again, they don't make their chips.  TSMC and other companies make them.  But in fact, even Samsung, I think, makes chips for Apple.  But they design them.  And that by doing so,  I think they have a lot better control over their platform.  And everybody agrees that the iPad and the iPhone processors  are light years ahead of what Qualcomm's offering.  It's a much more generic product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also can do with that,  once you have that team in place,  they can also work on other projects.  So you see Apple doing their co-processor for movement,  which gets you, you know, longer battery life  and a small form factor on the Apple Watch.  You can see them doing like processors for computer vision,  maybe in the future or voice recognition.  So once you have this skill set in place,  you can really do a lot and you lock out your competitors  because they're stuck buying off the shelf parts.  And they're not gonna,  there's no way you could be as power efficient, for example,  or pick some sort of optimization.  They can't optimize as well.  So this does make it really interesting though,  if you, I mean, one, holy cow, that's terrible for Qualcomm.  But two, when you have all of these people  who are huge companies building their own chips,  if you're a chip maker, you suddenly have to serve  a very different and much more varied part of the market.  So how does that change your business?  And that'll be an interesting,  we've been talking about that for a while in the chip world,  but it'll be interesting going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're a fan of Google, this is very good news.  It also, I should point out, is interesting  because Google didn't create Android to make Google phones,  didn't create Chrome OS to make Google Chromebooks.  These was a way for Samsung to broaden its reach.  I mean, Google to broaden its reach  to get more people using Google services.  That's where they saw their revenue.  But if they start designing chips, it's in a way saying,  we're a hardware company too.  And the Pixel phone and the Google Pixel books,  these are an important product to us.  And they will be, unless Google gives away these designs,  I doubt they will, but they will be,  that'll be a differentiator.  Right now, if I'm looking at the brand new OnePlus 8,  comparing it to a Pixel 4, it's very,  the hardware is similar, the software is similar.  Google doesn't have a huge differentiator.  If all of a sudden, like Apple,  Google's Pixel has a different processor  that nobody else can use, that's a very interesting decision.  Is this kind of, all right, so just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm switching roles today.  Before, I'm tech optimist who says don't count on tech alone.  So now I'm the Google fan who will try to look  for the conspiracy theory.  Is this rather like Amazon, once you're trapped,  now we can raise the rates on you and eBay and such?  No.  Okay, so it's not like Google saying,  okay, now that you only have two places to go,  Android or Apple, and you can't go to Apple,  ha ha, we're getting in the business, guys.  They're not gonna screw the manufacturers in Android land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're gonna screw Qualcomm, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, not the phone manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft went through the same process.  Remember, Microsoft sold Windows to PC makers,  but never made PCs.  And all of a sudden, Microsoft, a few years ago,  said, yeah, we should make PCs.  And there was some concern that they would irritate  what they call the OEMs, the people who used Windows  to make their own PCs, like Dell and Lenovo and HP.  So Microsoft, just as Google did with its Pixelbooks,  picked a certain lane of hardware and stuck to it,  saying things like, well, we're doing, as Google did,  it's a reference design.  We're doing something to lead the way  for other PC manufacturers.  There's plenty of room in the space for differentiation.  It's not quite the same in the Android world, I think.  If you have a Google phone that has a different processor,  there's gonna be a lot of temptation to optimize Android  for that processor, for instance.  If I were manufacturing Android phones,  I'd be a little nervous,  but I think Google made the calculation,  well, where are they gonna go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What else?  Well, and if they're working with Samsung and Exynos chips,  then they've really, I mean, isn't Samsung  the second largest producer of Android,  or the first largest producer of Android phones?  Yeah. Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I wonder if Google looks at that and says,  we'd like to be the largest producer of Android phones.  They also have to be a little dissatisfied  with the low end of the Android market,  which is causing them no end of headaches,  because whenever you hear about security issues,  out of date operating systems,  that's where all of that's happening.  And I'm sure that that bothers Google  that there is such a down market.  On the other hand, that's why Android  is the number one operating system in the world,  by sheer number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was the whole strategy.  I remember at Davos, when Eric Schmidt talked about it,  he said, we're gonna give it away for free,  and that's gonna make it grow,  and that's our strategy, and that's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because we make money when you use the internet,  and it's good for us, right?  That's why I wonder why they're making chips now.  It sounds like a sea change in Google's overall strategy,  that they wanna have a differentiator.  Did you, is Samsung gonna have these Google phone,  Google chips?  I don't know, this is all-  Oh, that's interesting.  Oh.  Samsung does make their own Exynos.  But Exynos processors are functionally equivalent.  In fact, if you buy a Samsung phone in the US,  you get a Qualcomm processor, because they need the radios.  But if you buy it in the rest of the world,  they use an Exynos processor.  But those phones aren't that different.  They're using virtually the same software, right?  Same features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it could be for, I mean,  it could be a server-based chip.  I don't know, I mean, like,  we just don't know enough about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we don't know that it's for Android?  Oh, I thought we knew it was for Android and Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think people are basing that because of an arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, then I may be completely wrong.  Because maybe Google will not do that.  They want ARM chips for servers too,  because they're low power.  The biggest cost is energy in a server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to see if the rumor ties it to the phones,  or if it's just the chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an interesting, it's a business conundrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know.  Oh, Google reportedly expects that Whitechapel  will start shipping with Pixel phones  in the next year at the earliest.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yes.  That's really interesting,  because Pixels have not sold well.  And if I were Google,  if Google holds true to its Davos statement, Jeff,  then it doesn't matter if Pixel phones sell.  Right, no.  But if Google wants to have a hardware market,  hardware business, why would Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what is the change?  Oh, this is interesting.  So they're putting a module dedicated  to improving the power efficiency  and performance of Google Assistant.  So, take that, their design,  now imagine them putting a reference design  onto other battery powered devices  to bring Google Assistant to more places.  Apple always said that if-  And with all that AI locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  That's what we're stressing.  Or possibly.  That they can really show off  what their AI can do distributed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple always said, if you want to make a good product,  you have to control the hardware and the software stack.  That was-  Well, Apple would say that,  because that's what they did.  Well, but that was Steve Jobs' plan all along,  was we want to control,  that's why they made computers,  and why they made Mac OS,  because, or before that,  whatever they called it,  system seven.  Because they needed,  just Jobs was always of the strong belief  you had to do both.  In the early days of the Apple II,  yeah, I guess it was the case even back then.  They made both.  He always felt that you had to tightly  integrate hardware and software.  And they had to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, you want to talk about the new iPhone and chips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure.  The iPhone SE snuck out of the barn this morning.  Got me up at 8 a.m.  Ordering stuff from the Apple store.  They also announced,  and will be shipping next week,  their new Magic Keyboard for the iPad.  Which frankly, is to me,  the most interesting thing they've announced in a while,  because it really makes the iPad,  starts to make the iPad a computer.  It's got a track pad.  It's got a real keyboard.  Same keyboard as on their laptops.  And it's expensive.  It's 300 bucks.  Which is $100 less than the cost of the SE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which I am just like,  I am in love with this phone.  I am excited about it.  It's running the same-  It's 4.7 inches.  It is the same processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a small phone.  It's a current processor, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is the processor,  the iPad Pro.  Right.  Sorry, not the iPad Pro.  Sorry.  No, that is the iPad Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the iPad Pro has a later processor, I think.  It's the A12, right, in this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were just, we were so excited about this this morning.  Oh my God, I hate Apple's design crazy.  Just show me the freaking specs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good luck finding it.  Yeah, we're so, we were a little disappointed,  because of course we do our Apple shows on Tuesday,  and Apple announced,  and normally Apple announces new products on Tuesday.  But this time they announced it on Wednesday,  which is actually what the room around the South is.  It's beautiful.  Comes black, white, and product red.  It looks a lot like an iPhone 8,  except it has an aluminum edge now,  which I think is quite nice.  It'll start at $400.  It does have a current processor,  which is what the SE did last time, too,  which is good, because you want a phone  that has a current processor,  so you can run the current operating system,  even if it is only 4.7 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the A13 Bionic chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it is, that's the same, okay.  That's the same chip as in the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, that's what I thought.  Okay, yeah, no, it's freaking awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why I was so happy.  That means it'll have a great camera.  Only one lens, but still it'll have a great camera.  Portrait mode using monocular depth sensing,  which is magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Monocular depth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You only have one eye.  My wife is so pissed about this.  Why?  She just spent a lot of money.  She still wants the small one.  No, she's still carrying around the 1988 iPhone,  whatever the small one was.  And she will not shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this one's small.  A 4.7, so is it the iPhone 6?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How big was the 5?  Do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like that.  I was surprised to see 4.7,  because I thought the, it's the small,  is the size of the small 8.  The 5S was 4 inches.  So this is what, 4.7?  Yeah, it's not so much bigger.  Still the smallest iPhone by far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The new iPad Pro has an A12Z bionic.  The A13 is in the iPhone 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, thank you, chat room.  And by the way, the Product Red phone,  as you know, Product Red is the Bono-sponsored AIDS,  relief project.  But in this case, it will be donated to COVID-19.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So speaking to my wife, by the way,  she just sent me her new favorite follow on Twitter.  Rate My Skype Room.  Have you seen this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  Is this for people to, you know, the backdrop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is for the people who are now on TV.  So it's Twitter slash Rate My...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is so funny.  Skype Room.  Oh, so they're looking at the art.  I know I do this when I look at people,  they're looking at, in fact, we've even talked about  messy bookshelves and other things.  Fun, chic, we want the lamp, style plus.  That's Kimberly Eakins on CNN.  Oh no, that's NBC.  This is fun.  Yeah.  This is a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Bit of a mess, but I think two points  for color coordinating, bow tie and globe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dr. Hotez.  You don't want to read the one for Lindsey Graham,  but it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but yeah.  Good neutral color, attractive bookcase.  Our guess is he's Italian.  That's Mike Bumoli, NBC News.  Sean Penn, actor and founder of Core.  Tent gets high marks.  He's in a tent.  He's in a yurt.  Yeah, he was in a tent today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Next one's good too.  Here's Bernie, two nice paintings.  This may be Bernie's Airbnb, not sure.  There's a picture of a Vermont barn.  I don't like it.  And I'm just, I like a little depth.  It's always good.  That's why I love your set, Jeff,  because it's got your whole room behind you.  I don't like corners behind people.  I don't like people with a whole lot.  I don't either.  I think it's odd.  I don't know why that bothers me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it makes sense if you have a lot of stuff  because your corner is going to be the only place  that you don't have stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The corner is clean.  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to reading more of these.  Well lit.  Here's Richard Engel, well lit, good color mix.  And apparently they noticed he has a Steve Reeves  movie poster behind him.  Goliath.  Who doesn't like an old Steve Reeves movie?  Wow.  Richard Engel showing some verve there.  Okay, Professor, ugly chair, blank walls  and diplomas, please.  Three out of 10.  Three out of 10.  This is pretty funny.  I have to say I'm enjoying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Claire McCaskill.  Claire McCaskill in her kitchen.  In her kitchen.  What news does the hell ought to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Becky Worley has been doing Skype calls  for Good Morning America.  My good friend Becky Worley for many years.  She was, I think, the first.  It was great.  And she's in her kitchen.  It always looks great.  I love it.  Yeah, but it's Becky.  It's okay.  It's okay.  I think they like Tony Fauci's beautiful.  See, Tony's taking a chance.  He's got back-lidding, right?  But obviously somebody came over from NBC  or maybe from the CDC or somewhere,  maybe Jared Kushner,  and they put lights in front of him.  So he's got fill lights.  So it's balancing him.  So he's breaking the rules,  but only because he has a better setup than you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of people, they aren't ring lights also sold out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, probably they are.  I think maybe footing.  Oh my goodness.  President Obama, one of the best Skype rooms ever.  Look at it.  It's got, I mean, this is,  you couldn't get better than this.  The depth of field, the lighting,  the dimly viewed basketball and the bookshelf,  all excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the depth of field is real as opposed to the fake.  Oh, don't use the fake Skype deck.  The background pretty filter, which I just hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, don't use that.  This is funny too.  Nice space, but we frown on product placement in Skype rooms.  She's got a big Apple iMac over her left shoulder.  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or does she have her books on the shelf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, her own books too, huh?  Ashley Parker.  I always make sure I've got my own books  on the shelf behind me.  Nice kitchen, orange is help, but it's a little stark.  John Hyland.  I like that kitchen.  I think that's quite nice actually.  Yeah, it is nice.  It is nice.  It's interesting, isn't it?  Lisa, of course,  has been doing a lot of Zoom meetings from home.  And for a while she was positioned  so that the cat tower was just over her shoulder.  We've repositioned her now, so she's got a fireplace.  Some more attractive stuff behind her.  You do have to think about that, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't wait to have,  I can't wait to move and have my own office  so I can have a nicer setup.  Are you gonna, are you gonna,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  see, I've decided I'm gonna put a green screen behind me  and project my, this set.  So you won't know if I'm home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a green screen.  I just don't like using it.  I don't wanna see you at home, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've, have I done anything?  Wanna see the real Leo?  I've done the AMAs from home.  But in fact, we're gonna do game night on Friday.  You're all invited if you want.  We're gonna, I don't know games.  We're gonna play, you don't know Jack.  We're gonna play trivia, I think.  It's gonna be a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, have you found a home, speaking of homes?  I'm sorry, I'm asking.  Let's ignore that I asked.  Okay, I'm sorry.  It hurts me.  Oh no. That was painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know that Stacey has to move out  at the end of the month, so the clock is ticking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The end of June.  Oh, you got a little more time, six weeks.  But that's still.  It's still soon to buy clothes at a house.  Still.  Especially if we don't have one.  I'm sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you been able to virtually look?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's just nothing on the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said there's two houses available, two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's, okay, there's like 12 houses  in our price range on Bainbridge.  That's not too bad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, 12 is not a lot of houses.  And some of them are not great at houses.  I mean, a lot of them are like really tiny  for people who have two people working from home  and a teenager.  Yeah, that.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot I've noticed as I have joined my family  walking about this cute little town of ours, Petaluma.  A, what a great town it is.  It is.  There are a lot of houses for sale.  Really?  This seems like it would be a bad time  to try to sell a house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh God, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, if you don't have to sell it,  you should totally wait.  But if you do have a great house on Bainbridge  and you want to sell it, let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  You use the force, AKA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My husband's been on Facebook.  I mean, he's definitely reached out to lots of people.  So anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple, we did the iPhone, we did the keyboard.  I think that was the two products announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we had, hello, the Pixel 4a.  Oh, did they announce that today?  No, they didn't announce it.  They haven't announced it yet,  but they've all bought it.  She got my hopes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any minute now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any minute now.  We would have gotten it at IO.  You know, Dan Welly, we would have had it at 4a at IO.  Yeah.  Oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break and when we come back,  we'll have the Google change log for everybody.  For one and all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You gave Jeff far too much warning.  It's not as much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff already told me he is prepared.  Before the show, he said,  I'm ready for the change log, Leo.  So, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Karsten's sending me his two cents.  Thank you, Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Karsten always sends his two cents.  That's one thing you can count on with Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would, you know, hey, let me just put in a plug here.  I would like to have Karsten and Cam in some form.  Now on the Howard Stern show, they have-  Is Baba Bowie at home?  They have Baba Bowie puppet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gary puppet.  All right, I'm willing to give you a Karsten puppet.  Karsten puppet with a voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I could have a Google display right here  and we could put Karsten,  we could do a duo call with Karsten,  and then he could be right here giving his insight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo's resistant, yeah.  I think Karsten puppet with the robot eye.  Oh no, we put it right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because then he could talk into the microphone.  That makes way more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did Karsten offer you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He didn't come after me.  What did he offer you?  He did not come after me.  He offered me nothing.  I just, I love Karsten Cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like after last week's show,  he sent us all his like Karsten's two cents on the show.  The things I would have said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, thanks, Karsten.  He didn't send that to me.  Well, maybe he knows that you don't want him on the show.  He knows I'd yell at him.  All right, well we could dial him up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what I'm envisioning,  a little tiny nine inch TV screen there on the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We could put a little virtual Karsten floating around.  He could be like a little screen saver  bobbing around the screen if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we need his voice, his wry, nasty, spammy,  Skype-a-man.  Trollish voice coming in once in a while.  I say that with a lot.  All right, well wait a minute, I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spammy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am going to make this possible.  Hold on a second.  I'm gonna set up a special place for Karsten.  Karsten, I think you know what I'm talking about.  Oh, wait a minute, my server's down.  Nevermind.  Oh shoot.  Somebody must have knocked the plug out.  I set up a Jitsi server at home.  It's awesome.  And you just go in and I could easily set it up.  But unfortunately it seems to be offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard it also is like one frame a second.  No, it's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like Jitsi.  That's just dependent on how much bandwidth your server.  But see, it's running on my own server,  so it works pretty well.  I've been using it with a family mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were gonna do a commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Jeff, if you want to pull up Karsten, you can.  Our show today, you can tell my enthusiasm is overwhelming.  We could just get a Karsten Bobblehead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  While we're on it, I'm gonna go to the chat.  You're gonna see this.  This is the Gary puppet.  This is gonna make you happy.  So there.

Cause he throws me under the bus all the time.  So I would in retribution, throw him under the bus.  Uh oh, where are we going?  Don't risk your life, Leo.  We've pissed him off so much.  He's left the show.  Karsten, you've done it now.  You've done it now.  You pissed off Leo.  He's coming to get you.  Where did Leo go?  Hmm, do I have to sing and dance now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.  UT should get something for their J school  that looks just as cool.  The Cronkite J school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're not as cool as we are, so they can't.  We are the coolest.

Transcript:  No, Rosenthal Alves is one of the coolest dudes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have many puppets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so now Karsten has to say something on chat  that you then channel.  I will channel Karsten, exactly.  You have to channel Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's Karsten?  I don't know if I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, you're just the bully.  Karsten's like, I can't handle this.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Karsten's trying to call me.  I know, don't answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, you know what you could do?  Just put his audio up.  Yeah, just his audio, that's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is gonna be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What have we done?  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This reminds me of the time  we got Jason to call somebody.  We called somebody on, when you were gone, Leo,  we did two things.  We got Jason to ruin his phone.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and then we tried,  like, was it Duo that we tried?  Or M?  No, it was Echo.  Oh my God.  Oh, that's right, it was his Google account

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that ended up getting screwed up, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Poor Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poor Jason.  This dummy, I mean puppet, I mean Karsten,  doesn't have any, I have to just put his hands here  because there's no, there's supposed to be a stick  to control the hands.  I'm just gonna let it do that.  Ow, says Karsten.  Ow!  What are you doing?  All right, let's do an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Answer line three, says Karsten.  Answer line three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he's getting angry, he's typing in caps now.  Yeah, and exclamation points.  Jeff knows who signs his check, that's the thing.  Apparently Karsten has forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need both hands to do this.  We need some Jeff commentary now, too.  Just probably over there cursing under his breath  about, he was just ready for the changelog,  and now he messed up his life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not the changelog, we're gonna do the ad,  and then the changelog, and then we're gonna get Karsten,  who apparently, close your mouth.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This show is brought to you today by Worldwide Technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They probably don't want the ad delivered by Puppet,  so I'll just do it by myself.  And AppDynamics, together they enable you  to deliver the application experience  your customers demand.  We've talked so much about the Advanced Technology Center,  the great enterprise delivery  that Worldwide Technology does,  but we don't talk much about the fact  that they also do apps, they can help you do a great app  that will transform your business.  Just great software has the ability to change lives,  and WWT is driven as a custom application design  and development company.  One of many hats WWT wears.  But what I love about WWT is,  because of their enterprise background,  they know business, they know your business,  they know how these things work,  so they're gonna be able to help you identify  your specific business needs.  They're gonna come up with great new approaches  to various problems, create a software solution  that'll make an impact.  Maybe you're a restaurant  and you need to have online ordering.  You know, there are lots of reasons  you might wanna have an app these days.  And you wanna, trust me, we've gone to third parties  to get apps done with less than stellar results.  You want a company that focuses on the exact specifications  you want in your app, and WWT does that.  Their team provides resources and platforms  to make it possible.  They're the kings of agile development.  They really know how to do it right.  And they have two decades of experience,  a proven track record to truly help you succeed.  So I'll give you a couple of cases.  I won't name names, although we saw the apps  when we were there in St. Louis  and I was really blown away.  They worked with a local healthcare organization  to help connect medical teams  from their care center to patients at home.  So it was a custom software app  where care teams could interface with patients  and they got great results within a year.  50% reduction in preventable readmissions  for, they call it engagement at home,  engagement at home patients.  35% fewer days spent in the hospital,  thanks to virtual care.  60%, 60% fewer septic shock deaths occurred  in patients being treated remotely.  This is huge.  I'll give you another example.  They worked with a rental car company  to produce a mobile app  that provided improved customer car rental experience,  lets customers make reservations,  perform check-ins and returns without waiting in line  and without tying up expensive customer service reps.  They worked with a grocery retailer  to improve their customer experience.  I saw this app, this is so cool.  Through ideation, innovation and creative work,  WWT improved their customer experience  and the grocery retailer hit their two and three year goals  in less than one year.  An app can make a difference if it's done right  and that's what WWT is so good at.  Put something in your customer's hands  that exceeds their expectation.  They're an agile house, they do agile software development  from planning and ideation to delivery.  They're faster because of it,  they're more accurate because of it,  they're more responsive to your needs because of it.  If you, DevOps, they're gonna drive business outcomes  by evaluating, designing, implementing and operating  with tools to enhance your operational efficiency.  Yeah, they do DevOps.  Container platforms, they rapidly create services  that can scale and perform by designing and architecting  and implementing cloud native apps  in an agile fashion in containers.  That's just a small sampling of the skill set  WWT brings to the table.  They can solve your toughest challenges,  transform your business today with worldwide technology.  In so many areas, WWT is a partner  you'll keep going back to for years.  They can help you change your business  with apps that help you, that yield great user experiences,  attract new clients, increase customer value  and they are just such great people.

Transcript:  Ta-da!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, some new things in the gook.  Google's rebanding Hangouts chat.  I don't know, why even do stories about Hangouts anymore?  Just endless.  So it's just gonna be Google chat and Google Meet.  And they're taking the word Hangouts out.  So I don't know if this is just yet another reason  to think Hangouts is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this for everyone, the G Suite customers  and normal people?  Just G Suite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There never was a Google Hangouts chat  or Hangouts Meet for regular people, was there?  You just called it Hangouts.  There's Hangouts, it's just Hangouts.  And that's still around.  Yeah, don't believe me, this is confusing enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Waaah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, they're changing the name of Hangouts  but only for G Suite customers.  Frankly, I think they think nobody uses Hangouts anymore.  I use it.  We Google.  I use it all the time.  I know, it's the only cross-platform solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google, why are you so googly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did a while ago and it frustrates me no end.  Turn off the ability to make Hangouts  the default SMS application on my Pixel.  I mean, that's the beginning of the end.  It's just so frustrating.  And yet, Google Fi's text messages still go to Hangouts.  So you tell me.  I can't tell you.  I can't tell you. I just don't know.  Google Phone can now be installed,  I don't know why you'd want to,  on non-Pixel phones from the Play Store.  They put the phone in the Play Store.  And I guess it works.  Since every phone comes with its own phone icon  and phone dialer, I don't know why you'd want  to install it on a Google phone.  It's not that great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You used to change dialers all the time.  Really?  Oh God, yeah, you were all prideful  about how you changed dialers.  I've got this great dialer that's better than any other dialer  and I would say, a launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's launcher, not dialers.  Oh, dialers.  Launchers is the front page.  Nevermind.  Dialers is the little phone icon.  Oh, okay.  I don't know why you would want to,  but apparently you can install it on your phone.  Maybe people just like it better.  It's designated as beta on the Google Play Store.  Phone beta.  Maybe there's features that, I don't know.  Maybe there's features that, I don't know.  I've always used Pixel phones.  Google app is rolling out, Google app,  I don't know what this headline means.  Google app rolling out search tools time  verbatim filtering on Android.  If you had Karsten on the phone,  you could probably ask him to find out.  Karsten!  You don't.  He put this one in.  From a home screen widget to assistant integration,  oh, there is an app called the Google app.  Yeah.  The Google app is how the company  wants you to search on Android.  Well, but who does that?  No one.  It's always lacked one key feature  compared to the mobile experience.  The Google app beta yesterday finally added search tools  and filters on Android.  Oh, you know, I use that all the time at google.com  where you could choose to look at the answers  in news, images, shopping.  Yeah, I love that.  The tools.  You can do that here?  The tools let you do time.  No, you couldn't do that here?  I guess not.  I never use it.  So the advanced tools, you know, you hit search tools  and you can choose what timeframe the search is in  because I use that all the time  because I don't want a two year old article  about Google's chip ambitions.  I want one in the past, you know, 24 hours or past week.  So that's now there.  You can also, or you could even do custom ranges  if you want.  And you can also do either all results or verbatim results.  Now, I didn't really need that because verbatim,  I just put it in quotes.  That does the same thing, I think,  but unless I'm misunderstanding it.  Anyway, that's, you know, this is the kind of thing you get  in the Google changelog.  I'm just saying.  It may not be a big deal.  It's just in the changelog.  YouTube's desktop site is now more touchscreen friendly.  That has always bugged me.  It's so hard to scroll around and all of it.  They've updated the desktop site.  So you can, they've got tweaked the three dot menu.  They've enlarged icons.  I've always found it hard to scrub in it,  but I guess, I don't know if that's part of the update  or not, I'll have to play with it.  YouTube's latest update also includes improvement  to watch history, which now tells you  which videos you watched on a particular day or date.  Oh, isn't that nice?  Additionally, there's a way to organize your playlist  with a move to the top bottom option.  So you don't have to drag and drop videos.  You can move them to the top or move them to the bottom.  And that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You almost had Jeff hit the button.  I know, I was trying to trick them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that was cruel.  No, he knows we get a lot more.  Equally exciting.  Google will show virtual care options more prominently  in search results.  The blog post said that over the coming week,  it'll be easier to find telehealth services.  In other words, not care options that require you  to go somewhere, but stuff you can do virtually.  They'll show up higher now in the search options  because that's what we want you to do.  We don't want you to get in the car, stay home.  ScooterX is way ahead of me.  Google develops a virtual braille keyboard for Android.  It's rolling out.  You may not have it right away,  but this is really interesting.  So there are six buttons on it  and you have to cord them.  And you can, for instance, if you just tap the first,  if dot one, that's A, dot one and dot two are B,  dot one, two and four are C, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  This is grade one or grade two braille.  Makes it easier for, yeah, I think that's cool.  It's part of the Android accessibility suite.  I'm taking Android five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's cool.  So this is for, they're typing this to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would show, I would guess you would show somebody.  You would hold it up.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No?  No, because you couldn't show someone if they're blind  or are you blind?  If you're weird, you're typing it  and you're showing someone what you're trying to spell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says in the thing, it's hard to,  you can attach a keyboard, but it's hard,  it's time consuming.  So if you just want to do a quick type answer to somebody,  that you use this.  So this is input.  I got very confused too.  If you're blind, if you're low vision,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  oh, I hear a sound that sounds like Karsten.  Google completely ruined.  We talked about this last week, the shared folders thing.  Now a review.  Google completely ruined.  This is from Android police, shared folders in Drive.  This is that thing where they're starting,  instead of having duplicate files,  they're doing shortcuts.  I don't even, just read the article.  I don't even want, I know.  Google is not-  We're not into that.  And this, you'll be so happy, Jeff.  Google is finally bringing dark mode  to the YouTube TV app on Android.  Hallelujah.  Karsten put that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Karsten forget it, you're off the air.  No, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's good for TV,  cause it gives you a slightly more-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We should be able to hear Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.  Hi Karsten.  Hello.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can hear him.  Is that Karsten?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, let me embody him though.  Go ahead, Karsten.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm calling you from my mountain lair  in the leftovers of the East Bay.  And apparently I am orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you are wearing a nice bow tie, Karsten.  And a ruffled-  Yes, of course.  And a ruffled shirt, I might add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  And what is that?  Is that a robe of some, a smoking jacket?  Is that what it is?  It is a smoking jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent.  Looks like the shirt's coming out.  I'll tuck it in here for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that is not proper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so proud of myself.  This is really taking-  I'm so proud of myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is taking those Zoom effects  to a whole new level, Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel that just having a puppet-  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have been showing up to all of our meetings  as a potato or a piece of bacon or a night elf  or a glowing cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you were a glowing cloud yesterday.  That was interesting.  You looked radioactive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you just look like you had too many carrots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, am I disappointed.  You're doing a great job there.  Also, you don't blink much, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Too much caffeine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so pro dark mode, except for Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is a good idea.  I do too.  I think TV should be dark.  You don't want a bright, big white-  Absolutely.  He agrees to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Karsten and Puppet agrees.  He does that just to be mean to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Drive is rolling out an updated document scanner UI  with better iconography.  Thank you for putting these in here, Karsten.  Because I didn't even notice any of this.  Google reduce, oh, I did see this one.  So if you have a Nest camera,  it uses a lot of data because it's high-def.  I mean, you could turn it down,  but Google is going to now unilaterally reduce  Nest's camera quality to ease burden on networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And-  You can opt back into it if you do decide  you need the HD.  Oh, you can turn it up?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can.  It's the same thing as having the default  before ADP on YouTube.  Most people just don't even notice and go with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and it's mostly because there's so much  happening over your home network right now anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we had announced some time ago  that Google was going to remove the ability  to support FTP services in Chrome.  I think Firefox did that as well.  It used to be you could type in a browser,  FTP colon slash slash and an FTP site  and you'd get the site and download files and so forth.  Thanks to the pandemic, they're going to leave it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay!  Government stuff is there.  I love what I love.  I put this in there.  What I loved about it is they called it the venerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The venerable.  Function.  FTP.  FTP.  File Transfer Protocol.  Carson, you can do the honors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which honors?  Oh, and that's-  Oh, jeez.  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jesus, man, we set you up and you got it, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I blame you for this, Jeff.  Yeah, you should.  There could be latency issues.  Come on, y'all.  I blame Jeff for this too.  He's talking down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, what else do we want to talk about?  TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One billion installs on the Play Store.  One billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I talked to a friend of mine in the office.  TikTok finally told her,  you've been on TikTok too long, get off.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do that?  Yeah, evidently.  She was on for like two hours.  Sometimes people just sit there,  you get kind of stoned and you just scroll,  scroll, scroll.  Quibi had 1.7 million downloads in the first week.  And they've, you know-  One of the things I didn't-  TikTok.  You opened TikTok.  One of the things-  I opened TikTok, sorry, I'm lost to you now.  Yeah, see, this is the problem.  It's so addictive.  Goodbye, Jeff.  He's scrolling, he's scrolling.  Yeah, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, baby and a dog.  Oh, nothing better.  Every day I'm scrolling.  Nothing better, okay, yeah.  Wait for the end.  It always tells me to wait for the end.  Jeez.  I've done it a million times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do, they all say wait for the end  and then nothing happens in the end.  Nothing happens.  I'm really frustrated.  I'm sick of them.  I actually have the capability of just standing  Karsten on the table like that.  With no legs, oh, he's so-  Well, his legs go underneath the table.  He's actually in a hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's upstaging Stacey and she does not like him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, that's fine.  Karsten gets it right there.  No, no, no, no, no.  I have way less ego than Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wanna be over there with Stacey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Now, if only Karsten could punch Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  We're working on that capability.  There we go.  He's got a good slap.  Here, put your hand here, you can pinch me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you can now sue him, Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Quibi, has anybody watched Quibi?  Jeffrey Katzenberg, Meg Whitman, short video,  attempt by Hollywood to co-opt the YouTube crowd?  One of the things that frustrated me was that you couldn't,  you had to watch it on the phone.  They didn't have an iPad version  and you couldn't airplay it or cast it in any way,  Chromecast or anything to your TV.  It would just, it would just, it would block it.  And now they say,  oh, that was a feature we were gonna add later.  We'll add it now, because of coronavirus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because no one else is going anywhere  needing their short-term views.  There's Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is, go ahead, go ahead.  Make yourself a glowing vegetable.  Do something, do something, do something fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great lighting there, Karsten, jeez.  Rate my, rate my Skype search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm in my mountain lair  with beautiful scenery behind me.  If I don't have curtains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I get COVID-19 from handling your puppet,  I'll be upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We would all be upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't even think of this.  The World Health Organization,  remember Apple announced a COVID-19  or released a COVID-19 for the iPhone.  There is now an official one  from the World Health Organization.  It's a Who COVID-19 Tips App, both Android and iOS.  I don't know if the world needed this,  but now the world has it.  Why do we need this, I wonder?  They do have a section called Who Mythbusters.  Unfortunately, Adam Savage is not on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was gonna say, is Adam Savage part of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think that's probably necessary.  That's probably needed, right?  Jeff, would the World Health Organization  be on your list of trusted authorities?  Yes, most certainly.  The president's been a little critical of them.  In fact, I think he's withholding funding.  Yep.  Perfect timing, right?  That's when you wanna withhold funding.  Because, well, I understand his upset  because the World Health Organization  seems to be a little careful not to offend China.  Not that the president would ever do that.  Well, exactly.  So there is some question about,  and I think Taiwan particularly was upset  with the World Health Organization  that they are being a little bit overly judicious  of China's feelings.  But you know what, China's a big country.  You gotta be, you gotta take it all into account.  Verizon, wow, says it's handling 800 million wireless calls  on weekdays.  That's more than they handle on Mother's Day,  which used to be the busiest call day of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I wanna talk to people using my voice  as opposed to constantly texting them.  And by God, none of my friends will talk to me.  On the phone.  They'll text me all day long.  None of them will talk to me on the phone.  It is so weird to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're talking to bots, that's why.  You're not talking to your friends,  you're talking to bots.  I hate to tell you, Stacey.  What about video calls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that that was the preferred way  in the modern age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am too talking to my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're all using Google Auto Complete.  Oh. Sorry, Stacey.  They don't wanna talk to you.  They just say Google, talk to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, wait, all the ones that are yes or thumbs up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, see?  That sounds good.  You're talking to bots, I told you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Verizon said the length of phone calls is up  by about a third as well on the average day.  Because you got nothing else to do, man.  And the number of cellular calls for AT&T is up 35%.  Wi-Fi based calls, which AT&T supports,  I don't think Verizon does, has doubled.  Doubled.  Internet traffic up 20 to 25% from typical daily patterns  according to AT&T and Verizon.  That means, I guess, internet traffic on your mobile device.  So, you know, there we go.  We're making more calls than we ever have in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think my favorite coronavirus story,  like how the coronavirus has changed a story,  is from the Wall Street Journal talking about  people injuring themselves doing home workouts.  So, new home workouts with new ex-pains.  And not because I mean, but because, like,  there's, it is a thing.  People are like, oh my God, I could finally try this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did a few too many sit-ups,  and I was in great agony for a whole evening.  My stomach hurts so bad.  Oh man.  Yeah.  I wanted the coronavirus.  It's like, kill me now.  I'm serious, I don't know, I'm a wimp.  I am a wimp.  When I am in pain, when I get a headache and stuff,  I just want to die.  I want to crawl under a rock.  I do not take pain well.  That's which is why I can't ever get sick.  All right, let's wrap this up.  With things Jeff is gonna add to his numbers.  He's gonna add a word of the week.  I think that's a very good idea.  Because Karsten likes that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is it a German word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the German word of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  German word of the week.  Karsten is the voice of God is worse.  Much worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least he's wearing a Twitch shirt.  Is that why it took us so long to get you on camera?  You had to put on a shirt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I always wear my Twitch shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Karsten like, is Karsten, are you in a law office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are all the filing cabinets?  No, this is just my office.  This is, here I'll show you.  What do you have to file?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you have to file?  It's very tidy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All those filing cabinets.  I guarantee you.  Let me show you my view, hold on.  I'm full with project materials.  He's a maker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to kick off my microphone.  This is my view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh wow, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh shush, Karsten, oh shush.  Oh, look at that, that's gorgeous.  What do you have, an oil rig out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I know, I can't afford that house.  Is that the baby?  Yeah, this is the fort that my dad and my kids and I built.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool, that's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We just built a garden for my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at this, what a nice house.  You're out in the East Bay.  Is that Mount Diablo in the distance there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is Mount Tam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mount Tam, oh that's us.  I call him Mount Tam.  Tam is up in Marin, but you don't live in Marin.  You're looking across the bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I look across the bay at Mount Tam.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty nice.  Welcome to MTV Cribs, featuring Karsten Bondi.  That's a nice crib you got there, Karsten.  Yep.  Now it's time for Stacey's Pick of the Week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I thought we were doing Jeff's Word, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll do you, then we do the word, then we do mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, ladies first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ladies first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This week, I am showing you the wise band.  Oh, you got it.  Oh, you got it.  I'm also using my ticket. I have that too.  Beautiful screen, yep, can you see the screen?  Karsten has one too, see?  So this is $24.99.  I don't love the band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The price is very good, but can you change the band out?  Or do you have to use their band?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to use, oh, they have another strap.  Is that what we're talking about?  Yeah, I don't know.  What is happening here?  I don't know, it's pretty fancy.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff is revolting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, Jeff is revolting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently he found the bin where we keep  the shots we don't use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, go ahead.  You have completely lost control, Leo, completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't really want it.  I don't think this counts steps as accurately as my Fitbit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't seem to do a great job  tracking my heart rate during workouts.  And it's a terrible sleep tracker.  Oh, this sounds like it's worth it.  This sounds like a great endorsement,  but it turns the lights off.  It does turn the lights off,  but to do it with Madam A or the shortcut,  your phone needs to be within Bluetooth range,  which in my case, usually my phone is downstairs  when I want to do any of this, and I'll be upstairs.  So it's kind of pointless for me  because it needs to be able to communicate with your phone.  So the band, I don't think it's that great,  but it is cheap if that's your thing.  Karsten does it.  Karsten's like, ah, screw the band.  Karsten's had a little too much to drink today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see that. I like the band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just went, do you like it?  Yeah. Why do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's because it's 24 bucks.  Okay.  It's super cheap.  I don't know.  I guess I've only had it for a day.  So I don't know about its accuracy at anything,  but it's nice to be able to have a little thing  that I can shout out to turn off my lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting.  Maybe Wyze doesn't like the band either,  because if you go to the website,  it is not on the front page of their website.  You have to go into the store to find it.  But they have added a no-touch thermometer for 54 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, they did that as part of their COVID response.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that, by the way, I think having a note,  everybody should have a no-touch thermometer,  not just for now, but forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A no-touch?  What's the competitor of the Wyze band?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Infrared thermometer.  Oh, okay.  Oh, the Fitbit is much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Fitbit, yeah.  So that's what I've got on the Fitbit 3, Charge 3.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Charge 4 just came out.  Okay.  But here's the other product.  Ta-da!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you got the scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the Wyze scale for $19.99.  And I recommend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly like the Wythings scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't it look like the Wythings scale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if they got it from the same place.  Although theirs is a lot cheaper, like 20 bucks.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $19.99 for this thing.  Plus, I think $8.99 shipping.  I'm gonna recommend that if you were in the market  for a digital scale, but you were like,  I'm not paying $100 or $120.  Oh, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For that price, this is what you gotta get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems to be accurate.  Wyze says that in is accurate plus or minus .5 pounds.  I believe that.  It seems to be accurate with my weight.  And it also, on all of their metrics that they have,  they use impedance to detect body, sorry.  Body fat, body composition, yeah.  Body composition, visceral fat, my favorite.  Let's see, protein, skeletal mass,  they'll give you your basal metabolic rate  based on your age and height and weight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's Bluetooth enabled.  What app does it hook up to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wyze.  So you've gotta open your Wyze app.  And it'll pull all this data in.  Found it terrifying to step on the scale.  Now that I've stepped on the scale, I wish I hadn't.  Because now I'm gonna have to do something about the fact  that this weekend was my birthday, I ate half a cake.  And it happens to be not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Happy birthday.  Oh, I forgot, yeah, happy birthday.  Happy birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  It was, I mean, it was last, it was Saturday.  So it's Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're drooling a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that because of the cake?  Because it was delicious.  So Wyze scale, go for it.  Downside to both of these devices,  the scale and the band do not integrate yet,  but they will integrate with HealthKit, Google Fit,  Samsung Fit, or whatever Samsung's exercise thing is,  and Fitbit, but not yet.  But not Apple.  No, HealthKit is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, HealthKit. Apple HealthKit.  When you say HealthKit, that's of course Apple.  Yes, I should have known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I say HealthKit, I mean Apple.  HealthKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unfortunately, it is not in stock.  They had early access, which I guess you took advantage of,  but get in line.  You could probably get it sometime down the road.  That's a great price.  They'll sell a lot of those.  I think that's a very-  Oh yeah.  Oh, happy birthday, ScooterX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're birthday buddies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ScooterX also.  Happy birthday.  He's our chat mod.  Jeff, number, word, what do you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, got a quick number,  is that Google and Facebook may have their first time  ever declines in ad revenue thanks to the crisis.  I see what the market says.  And my word, my German word of the every eight weeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  when I find one.  That's bad mojo.  I apologize.  I'm sorry, Google and Facebook.  I'm sorry.  What's your-  Mundschutz.  Mundschutz.  Wait a minute, let me think what that means.  Mund, Mund would mean the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The world is full of schutz.  The world is full of beep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The world is full of schutz.  No, I know schutz is not the German word for schutz.  I think schutz is a slide.  So Mundschutz is the world is going downhill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mund is mouth.  Mouth.  Does that give you an idea of what's on the word right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Swallow?  Oh, it's mouth spit.  No, it's mouth protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mask guard.  It's a mask.  Mundschutz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they have, the site which I pointed to  has a large feature about how to Mundschutz,  which I linked to there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, but the headlines uses the word mask.  So is mask more-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the same, but on the home page  it's how to Mundschutz.  So I thought, oh, Karsten Word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like Mundschutz.  I'm gonna make some Mundschutz.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm gonna make a whiskey sour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then, so that was the word and number.  And I have a, do you remember the million dollar home page?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You brought those memories back with this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the million dollar home page,  you'd buy a pixel or two or three or 10 or a hundred.  And the guy made a lot of money.  Made a million bucks.  This is the million dollar metropolis.  His goal is to sell advertising in all of these buildings.  There are 500 buildings.  He says, own a piece of internet history.  It's a little, I have to say it's a little more,  they see he has a lot of room for ad sales,  but I have to say it's a little more interesting  besides being 3D than the million dollar home page.  You can click on one of these ads  and it'll take you to the website.  Well, I guess the million dollar home page did that too.  Whoop-de-doo.  Whoop-de-doo.  Add spots available.  So you could see the tower, you know,  by clicking on it and see what.  20 years late, fella.  So I don't, million dollar home page, he sold out.  I wonder if it's still around actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I looked it up on Wikipedia  and 40% of the ads are now phantom.  Here it is.  The clicks don't work.  Boy, here it is.  1.1 million, 37,100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it had the same slogan, show this, Jeff.  This is the million dollar home page, the original.  Not nearly as clever,  but he did sell a million, there were a million pixels.  He sold all million of them.  Gosh, a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not 2009, it's been, no, it launched in 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a lot of this stuff is long gone, right?  Cuzzle, guzzle, all the beer, wine, cheese  and other delicacies you can guzzle.  Chip and Dale's the premier brand in ladies entertainment.  Women's picks.  Advice and FAQs on dry skin conditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the Times of London above that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, look at that.  The Times of London.  And it actually takes you, look at that,  to the Times of London.  Isn't that amazing?  They bought a lot.  How many pixels is that?  That's a big one.  So didn't this guy put himself through school  or graduate school or something like that with this?  I feel like it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He auctioned off the last thousand pixels on eBay.  So the total was 1,037,100 gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything that it connects to is gone now.  But the million dollar homepage lives on.  I guess he's gotta keep paying for this for a while.  Here's the Xbox 360 store.  That dates it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just got an Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IP Chicken.  Wow, look at that.  I remember those guys.  Congratulations, what game are you playing?  I'm not playing.  Ling is on here.  This links to my very favorite page of all time.  Ling's used cars.  Now with more COVID.  Now with Munchutz.  The busiest webpage of all times.  Also probably from 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of the evil Craigslist hasn't changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's never changed.  It's never changed.  In fact, I think we interviewed Ling.  Didn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should totally show my daughter this  so she can understand how much the web has improved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember interviewing Ling and she was wearing,  I seem to remember, an orange life vest and a helmet  for no apparent reason.  Ladies and gentlemen, Carsten's passed out.  I think it's time to say goodbye to all the family.  No, I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still here.  I'm still here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't get rid of them.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't get rid of me.  You said his name three times and he appeared.  Thank you, Carsten.  Carsten Bonney, our producer, producing from home  as he has been during this crisis,  as all our producers do.

And Stacey sent me an email in which she said,  oh, oh, and I can just hear your voice.  Oh, you can make sourdough bread in the Thermomix.  Oh, and I-  Did you try it?  No, because when I looked at the recipe,  the Thermomix did this much  and you still had to do all the other stuff.  So it really didn't, if it baked it in the Thermomix,  then I'd be interested,  but no, you still had to bake it in the oven,  do the auto lease and the other rise and all that stuff.  And I do that already with my KitchenAid.  It's a little old fashioned, but it does the job.  I have a dough hook and all of that.  So I'm kind of done with sourdough.  I'm one of the sourdough, enough with the sourdough guys.  You're soured on sourdough.  I'm soured on sourdough.

Transcript:  Oh yeah, no, I did class.  I just wrote a post about how I did my class online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been seeing all these posts, seniors,  pictures of seniors.  Is that related to the fact that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's somehow giving tribute to the seniors.  I don't get it. You don't get to walk, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, if I were a senior, less so college,  but high school is, I feel bad for high school seniors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know some people are very upset  about not being able to graduate.  No, they're gonna graduate,  but they're not gonna be able to walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're not gonna be able to go to prom.  They're not gonna be able to do, like, I mean,  well, some of them did spring break trips,  but like, it's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just remember, you're doing it for your elders,  people like me and Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My mother was still mad, to her dying day, was mad at me.  I didn't go to my college graduation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I walked out of my college graduation.  You walked out of it?  Yeah, it was so long and boring.  And I was mad, because I was in an honor society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you didn't get a mention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't mention my honor status.  I was like, pfft.  So I like ducked out right after I walked.  My parents, I showed up behind them and they're like,  what, how'd you do that?  What are you doing?  Let's go eat.
