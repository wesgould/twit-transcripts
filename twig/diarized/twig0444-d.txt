Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great to see you.  Thank you so much for your help in Austin.  We've got a great panel coming up thanks to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm still looking for some more people.  I'll be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I like the ones you've set up.  I think you and two other people, both of whom I think you suggested.  So thank you.  Yes.  Really thank you.  We'll tell you more about that in a little bit.  Also here, Kevin Marks.  He of the Indie Web.  Protector of all things original internet.  Thank you, Kevin.  Good to see you.  That's the hope.  And speaking of the original internet, Jeff Jarvis who predates.  I'm that old.  Even the internet.  He is from BuzzMachine.com.  Professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  And he's on hiatus.  No, you're on Walkabout.  You're in Amsterdam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm in Amsterdam at the Google Digital News Initiative event tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Amsterdam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do too.  I think we're the reason we all think.  No, no, no, no.  In fact, somebody told me pot is not legal in Amsterdam.  But it's I believe it's unenforced.  The law is unenforced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think I'm not sure the tourists can do it anymore.  The coffee shop.  I don't know.  There was kind of a crack on that.  But I walked by tons of cafes and you have that little skinky smell all the time.  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come to come to California where it is legal for tourists and people who live here.  Completely legal like recreational medicinal any kind of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you have to be a certain age?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to be 21 just like booze.  Okay.  Yeah.  And I think you can't just like smoking cigarettes.  You can't like just walk around smoking or maybe you can.  I don't know.  I haven't tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In New York, it's not like I'll be a small on the street.  Oh God.  This is the smell is so annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting.  Netflix just Netflix had a show about pot a cannabis show.  They just canceled it.  I think people I think now that it's legal in so many states people are like I'm over it.  It's only interesting if it's forbidden.  All right.  As long as we're as long as you're at the News Initiative.  Of course, one of the things Richard Gingrich I presume Richard's there.  Yeah.  Yes, he is.  I saw him tonight.  He's been on this show.  He's in charge of the Google News Initiative and was here to defend AMP.  Now defend this.  They're bringing the power of AMP to Gmail.  AMP stands for accelerated mobile pages was created in an era where websites were so heavy that they just were unusable on mobile and Google created this extension.  It's not official, you know, W3C standard or anything, but it's an extension that prohibits a lot of heavyweight stuff only allows JavaScript served.  Approved and served by Google images are limited stuff like that.  But now now so let me ask Kevin as a defender of the open web.  What I don't I don't know if we've ever talked about AMP with you.  What do you how do you feel about AMP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Am I I believe we talked about it just after it was launched.  Right in the beginning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But beginning I thought I made a page that embedded that show that was an I remember that.  Yes.  So I think there's trade-offs in it.  So part of the thing that I don't like about it is that it replaces some of the basic HTML elements with special AMP elements.  So images and videos things that HTML do natively.  It requires you to replace them with the AMP ones.  That means they have to load JavaScript to execute which means that you are dependent on the JavaScript from Google loading first.  The thing the thing that's good about it is that it's actually made it particularly news organizations think about having pages that load quickly.  And that was so in that respect is achieved.  But it's now getting to the point where they're shoehorned into it.  So as well as the they're putting in Gmail thing there's also oh we need we need something like stories in it.  So there's there's a way of doing stories in AMP now which is which is stories in the Twitter moments stroke Instagram stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have I found your page and this actually goes back to 2015 Kevin Marks dot com slash AMP reaction dot HTML and it even has a clip from the show.  We talked about it. I'll tell you how long ago this was.  Jeff has no facial hair.  Yeah.  We look young.  Yeah.  But now now that they want to show the clip.  Yeah. Oh it's a whole show.  Since then AMP has I think some people have turned around on AMP a little bit and now Google wants to bring AMP to Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Explain what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A powerful way for developers to create more engaging interactive and actionable email experiences.  First of all I'm not a fan of HTML in email anyway but for a lot of people email newsletters are a big part of their economic activity.  Even us we use and Jason Callahan is always saying and you yes Stacey Iggenbotham actually that's her bread and butter is her email newsletter on IOT.  So those are HTML right Stacey you use some tool to make that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are yes I do use some tool to make it.  I use MailChimp and I have someone who codes it the templates and stuff for me in HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess I'm gathering that that's the purpose of AMP because I if ever I mean I guess all Gmail is ultimately HTML mail.  I don't know. I always try to send.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can strip the HTML out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well you wouldn't get any pictures.  Well that's kind of the reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well and I think isn't this to help.  It is annoying when you're on your mobile phone to start something in email and then end up opening a whole new app and then you're away from email and then you you forget what you were originally doing like the hardest.  The biggest challenge for me when trying to triage and make my way through email on my phone is that.  I have to go around so many places and it's stupid and it's nonproductive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I actually am looking forward to the best kind of amping of email would be just plain text email not HTML email.  But if you're going to do HTML email I guess this makes sense and that's by the way it looks like what Google is doing is reaching out to people like you and your developer to to use AMP when you make an HTML email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now the challenges with AMP stories was always that once you made something an AMP link it was AMP or else and you you like lost it.  Correct.  There was sorry that was a terrible way to explain that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can always know you can have two versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can have another version right but you would have to do two versions.  You couldn't just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah yes.  Well you could just serve the version just serve the version.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's an example from from Google relying on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is also Google will cache the version and serve it directly from there.  Right if you choose you don't have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is yeah I mean Google always said well anybody can run an AMP server but I wonder how many people are running AMP servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an example of AMP stories on Google's blog site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God that means my email game is going to have the nice thing about having an email newsletter is you can just give people text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not anymore baby.  You got animation you got pictures moving you got all princesses and princesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah this is People magazine.  Romance in your email Stacey romance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I talk about compromised sex stories all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no there's an opportunity.  There is an opportunity.  Let's see what Cosmopolitan is doing.  For AMP stories this is Apple cider vinegar is the magic potion you need in your life.  The blockchain how about wired the block channel.  These aren't live.  This is just an image too bad.  I was hoping I could go right to the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't do that.  That's going to force me to up my game tremendously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like making to the.  But also it is portrait shape one image at a time thing and then the desktop version of that is let's crop your your screen down to this big and put an image in it.  Right.  Which is kind of annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you okay with this Kevin because it's open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's open ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean the thing that that made me kind of live with them is that it degrades it to if you're not using an app enabled tool it degrades to standard you know web standards.  The thing I don't like about it is that Google seems to be favoring app stories and amped articles in its search which seems to me any competitive.  So I'm not thrilled about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well now I'm not thrilled either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not thrilled because you're getting competition.  I just have to work harder.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No you don't you don't have to.  So AMP for email is a spec that will be coming to Gmail later this year.  There's a developer premium preview you have to sign up for I've signed up but I haven't been offered it.  But it's really not for me.  It's not it's not for any end user to put in their emails for people doing email.  Newsletters you know I presume MailChimp would have some advertisers.  It's for advertisers at some point MailChimp would have a tool that would make you amp your stuff.  My blog is AMP because it's on WordPress.com a sponsor and it it's automatic.  It just gives you an AMP version of it.  All right.  I just thought I'd bring that up.  I thought there might be more outrage but I'm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it's it's what it is is the challenge of doing HTML email at the moment is you basically got to make your HTML compatible with the worst email.  Right.  Renderer of HTML which tends to be Outlook which is running some ancient version of the IE renderer that has been abandoned.  It's like IE 4 or something.  It is some really old version like that and also the other ones will strip lots of stuff out of it as well.  So even Gmail will strip a lot of things out of you.  So the way that the guy who runs AMP was was pitching this was that it'll give you an up-to-date version of HTML that you can put along alongside your plain text and your HTML you have compatible for like retro viewers and then you'll be able to do rich stuff for people who can accept it.  Which is like yes you just maybe do a bunch of extra work to make my stuff appear.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So as long as we're along those lines Google is also starting to play with introducing the reply feature that you saw initially an inbox and then an alo in more messaging apps for instance I would love to see it in hangouts and Android messages.  Here's a nice one.  Yeah here's an example.  Yeah this is an Android messages Alex when can you be home and then there's a button to the right that has a button that says when you're home.  To the right that has 13 minutes and a picture of a car I presume you press that or maybe he sent that here's Gabe are you at the restaurant and it offers three possible replies.  Yes.  Yes I'm here I am indeed.  Nothing about no.  Maybe because Google knows you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No don't give it that much credit because I get I get those all the time and I love them.  But it'll be like can we do a meeting on Friday or Thursday and the options are either works for me Thursday works for me or that sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not I don't want to meet you.  I don't ever want to see you again.  Yeah.  Yeah so that's this is coming from area 120 which I was not familiar with but it's the kind of the experimental Google stuff area 120 dot Google dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it's a workshop for Google's experimental program so I didn't know this so I've signed up saying this I'd like to participate but probably because I would mention it on the show they wouldn't let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not allowed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet I bet not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the first rule of one to one doesn't talk about 120.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Maybe maybe I would love to see so I'm unclear this is a story from Android police that says they're going to make it an app reply is an app.  So another chat app no no no no no it puts the app the app puts the reply into the notifications.  So it modifies you know the smart notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then that means you got one back and forth and then the continuing conversation is not going to help with Google has to build it into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with you they should build into the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah and the other report out there is that Google is going to finally let you text from the web if they could unify all this chat stuff together and add that functionality it finally catch up to and buy an inch beat Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah this was in a early somebody was analyzing the source code of Android messages.  Of course you can text from the web now with Hangouts but Android messages you cannot and that if you can parse Google's confusing messaging about its messages.  Is there what they want people to start using because it has RCS Google's messages has RCS in it but I just keep using how I'm a Google file user and Hangouts is the only way.  That I can do everything I want which is get text messages to all my fi phones and enabled phones and from the web which I really like.  Frankly the functionality Hangouts remain at least for Google fi users remains very good.  I'm just waiting for them to pull the plug on that do any of you use Hangouts with just a non fi phone with like a T-Mobile phone or anything does it not do does it work okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they say they were take SMS out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't use it with SMS I use it.  Yeah because I can't they used to but I use it a lot because why do I use it because Kevin is on it because my daughter and Andrew on it so the people I talk to most prefer that as their method of communication right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you're fi user it really is exactly what you want messages but only if you're because I can use this I can still use SMS with it so it is my SMS client and my data messaging client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm I'm much more responsive on hands because those are the people I like as opposed to the people who text me I'll have to remember to add you to Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I may not accept your invitation.  Oh probably not so if I so that is another thing that's confusing so if I create a Hangouts message I could create it to you as a conversation they call it which is data only or as a text message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh see I can only do conversations as an SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's nice that's a nice feature but it but you would but if I did I wonder what would happen I guess if I did that to you as SMS then you would get it as an SMS message but it wouldn't start a Hangouts conversation so it would have it would if if ideally you would know which is the right way to do it with all the people you message with and you do it.  It's just what I'm.  Thank you Google for nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well thank you the whole ecosystem this whole text I mean texting was the easiest thing out there and it's just become how did it get so complicated.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I blame gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well yeah gifts don't work on SM only text works on SMS Kevin do you have an answer to this Kevin seems like Kevin this is your beat this is the kind of thing you would follow is like why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stuff doesn't work.  Because of their stupid closed platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well no the problem here is it's an open platform SMS is well an open ish platform which means that everyone can implement it which means you end up with five implementations on your phone that fight over it.  Right.  So you know Facebook and Google and Apple and whoever else all want to be your SMS client and Google wants has three separate groups who want to be your SMS client because that's the way Google is so on your Android it's like I've got an SMS who's going to receive it I'm not sure.  Every once in a while.  But both messenger and I think.  What's that.  At least one of the other Facebook ones will receive SMS is what's that will do it as well I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Android yeah you can choose and in fact signal messenger you can choose.  But then I lose my desktop capability and I'm not sure what happens when I because I have so this is a Google five phone but I also want to get the same text messages on my iPhone which is not obviously Google five so hangouts will do that I have to run a hangouts not it's not my text messenger my phone but I run it so I can see those and then I can also do it on the desktop because my Google Chrome has the hangouts plug in so hangouts is the most universal choice for me for a Google five user.  But as soon as I switch to signal or WhatsApp or Facebook messenger I lose all of that capability.  So that's doesn't work well anyway reply which will come out sometime in the future may even be a separate app but it may even be part of the new Google G board keyboard.  It will add hangouts alo WhatsApp Facebook messenger Android messages Skype Twitter direct messages and slack.  It'll add a vacation responder.  Oh no I hate those.  Yeah do not disturb which is a very nice feature I already have on the iPhone and some apps I guess Android car does that also and then when you get an urgent message like we're waiting for a message.  When you get an urgent message like we're waiting for you reply can make sure to get your attention even if your phone is silent.  So reply is obviously AI built into you know your your message notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like to not miss important text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I don't know what the keywords are there but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well you know it'd be really interesting because the reason I miss text is because my phone is somewhere else.  I would love for it to tie into my home or one of my other devices and be like yo grab your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is Casey it'll do more as code for the lights in the house and then she'll get it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah OK you can laugh but I used to have my lights turn red when my editor texted me his phone number text me.  That's a good idea.  Only for important stories and if I was not at my desk my lights would turn red and I'd be like holy crap breaking news go go go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey can you look to your left.  Are you wearing a blue ear muff oh that's just your hair.  Oh yeah sorry that's my hair.  It looks like you have one blue ear muff.  Oh no it's all right because you shook your ear.  Looks like you had one blue ear muff on your right ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were getting used to Stacey as a half blonde.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I'm very confused by Stacey's hair color.  I don't know what pronoun to use now.  So yeah I look forward to this smart reply thing.  It works in others apps besides Android or not Google apps.  So Ronam Audio has a nice write up in ours Technica as well.  So I guess he got invited.  I don't know I'm waiting for my invite.  I'd really like to try this but you tell me that I can't do it because.  There was an amp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't invited there was definitely an amp day before the Google day and I think today after that.  Amp day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No I didn't know.  It sounds like a party amp day.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah I got an amp day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reply app according to Ronam Audio will do something along the same lines as Android.  Where it will grab all the text and images from your messaging notifications.  Through a note there's an API for the notification listener.  And then takes those notifications rebuilds them.  Wow just as a watch might do.  And it does it so it can slip stream the smart reply options into the notification panels.  Interesting and it will block then the original notification.  So that you don't get duplicates.  Yeah I think that's a very interesting way to do it.  We'll find out.  I mean Ron's in the somehow Ron got in the early access program.  Maybe I'll get an invite someday.  Alright moving right along.  Tomorrow.  Chrome.  Gets an ad blocker.  Are you ready for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A bad ad blocker.  Not an old ad blocker but a bad ad blocker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah so this is what they're saying.  Yeah it's not as good as say adblock plus or my preferred adblocker.  You block origin.  Well I think it's kind of maybe it's like a good compromise.  So it'll only block ads that don't conform to the coalition for better ads guidelines.  But if even one ad on a site goes against that guideline it'll block all the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Until when?  I mean what if you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well if they fix it I guess it'll pop up ads.  Pre-stitial ads with a countdown.  I hate those.  Auto play video ads with sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well what happens when you next load the site right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah you know Forbes does that right?  You have to watch an ad before you can get to the site.  A lot of sites do that.  Wired has started doing that I think.  Large sticky ads.  That's on desktop on mobile.  It'll block pop up ads, pre-stitial ads, auto play video ads with sound, pre-stitial ads with a countdown.  Also any page with an ad density more than 30%.  Flashing animated ads.  Large sticky ads.  I hate it when ads are sticky.  And full screen scroll over ads.  That's the worst on mobile.  As you're scrolling the page the ad comes up and you have to keep scrolling.  As the ad goes by you can continue to read.  The worst.  It's using the easy list filter rules.  Which are kind of public and open.  And community curated.  By the way Google's own ad networks are not exempt.  If the ad in violation comes from AdSense or DoubleClick it'll be blocked.  But they're not blocking our ads that mine cryptocurrencies in your browser.  Oh that's not good.  Those will be good.  So you know who's doing that now?  So there's of course a bunch of bad people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Salon yes.  There's the coin hive.  The coin hive is the ad company that's doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the ad company is the ad company that's doing that.  And the ad company is the ad company that's doing that.  And the ad company is the ad company that's doing that.  And the ad company is the ad company that's doing that.  The coin hive is the ad company that's doing this.  It's not bitcoin.  They're not mining Monero.  And interestingly one of the companies doing this now is Slate.  And interestingly one of the companies doing this now is Slate.  Although here I am with my ad blocker on.  I think it's Salon isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I say Slate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Salon yeah.  It's funny it's the 12,786th business model attempt by Salon.  It's funny it's the 12,786th business model attempt by Salon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah here it is.  Wasn't Salon started by Microsoft?  Is that the one started by Microsoft?  Salon was started by the former Examiner guys.  Salon was started by the former Examiner guys.  Yeah.  So we've noticed.  Here it is.  We've noticed you're using an ad blocker.  We depend on ads to keep your content free for you.  Please consider disabling your blocker.  We've seen these before.  By the way you can.  It's an escalating war because  Ublock Origin which I use allows me to set a thing  that disables the ad blocker  disabling message.  The ad blocker blocker.  So I can either click OK I've disabled it  or in beta  suppress ads.  Block ads by allowing Salon to use  your unused computing power.  They don't give you a whole lot of detail but if you click  learn more  immediately it will start  mining I'm told.  So it's mining now I guess.  So it's mining now I guess.  They talk about ads  and how ad is undermining journalism.  And how ad is undermining journalism.  Blah blah blah.  But they don't really say when you say learn more  they don't really say  exactly what they're doing.  That's not cool.  How does Salon make money using my processing power?  The demand for computing power blah blah blah.  We intend to use a percentage  of your spare processing power to contribute to the  advancement of technological  discovery evolution and innovation.  What?  But  for now for our beta program  we'll start by applying your processing power to mine  cryptocurrencies to recoup lost ad  revenue. So in other words  this whole thing about contributing to the advancement  of technological  discovery evolution innovation  never mind we're going to do mine  cryptocurrencies. We plan to further  use any learnings from this to help support  the evolution and growth of blockchain technology  digital currencies and  other ways to better service the value exchange between  the content and user contribution.  I'm not against this idea except that  we've seen these  already we've seen these JavaScript based crypto  mining programs abused  some of them stay on the machine even after you leave the  site. So I think  it's a little target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of my entrepreneurial students is working  on a business along this. I won't give it away  but when he gets ready to say  it publicly I think it will be much more helpful  and at a higher standard for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  publishers. Yeah I'm not  principled against the idea of it doing this  as long as it doesn't peg my processor  as long as it stops when I leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or  when you have the military off Kevin were you  strained? I'm sorry did you use the story this weekend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No what's the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just put it in the  chat. Somebody took  over a  library that lots of sites were using  called browser library  and they injected the  coin hive mining code into it  which meant that suddenly lots of government  websites in the UK and Australia were  mining cryptocurrency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes and YouTube ads  and there's lots of places so  this is already yeah this coin  hive Monero miner has already kind of  been tarnished by these  4200 websites  were affected by Browse  Allowed  including UScourts.gov  Oh Jeff  CUNY.edu  Oh no  The UK  Student Loans Company  I forgot we had talked about this  yesterday on security now.  The UK Information Commissioner  Manchester.gov.uk  NHSinformed.scot  Agriculture.gov.ie  that's the Irish  Department of Agriculture  Croydon.gov.uk  a lot of these  so they were using Browse Allowed  which was a legitimate  or was considered a legitimate  it was an accessibility feature  to read the text out loud  was this  right was this Browse Allowed  that did it or was it a  hack? Browse Allowed was compromised

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  compromised okay Browse Allowed was compromised  and because they were embedding  something that didn't  that wasn't versioned  and wasn't hashed they could just change  the code in it. This is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a huge  weakness in general you know you're running  JavaScript you're running code in the browser  the code  is you know can be  do all sorts of things including  crypto mining  and yeah  so presumably  they're fixing this  not CUNY's fault  CUNY was doing the right thing by putting  a text reader  on their sites to make it accessible  which we have to do by law  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right 4,500 sites  Browse Allowed said oh insert this  and you will fulfill  these mandates to be accessible  but that's why it was proportionally  government sites that did it because they tend to follow  those mandates

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so  back to the ad blocker  in Chrome  it will not block that  for now  correct me if I'm wrong  but I thought you  adblock plus that's what adblock plus  was blocking was the  ads that were not  approved by coalition for better ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know  well maybe the recent version 4  was blocking those ads that weren't paid for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right well but that was  yeah paid for  by  adblock yeah  yeah  anyway I use youblock origin which is free and  does not have that kind of  fishy relationship with advertisers  I know  I don't want to but there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope the chrome one gets rid of the irritating  ones and lets the decent ones in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for me it's not the ads that I'm blocking I'm blocking  the security issues  of things like  coin hive mining code  the tracking doesn't bother me either  it's mostly security and  frankly the weight of sites  yeah that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what I'm doing the bandwidth is consumed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so Google well we'll see tomorrow it  happens that really is the adpocalypse  everybody said when Apple put that into  safari on IOS that that was going to be the  adpocalypse well now chrome  is the dominant blouser and this is not  just on mobile this is  on desktop as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll put another thing on the run down that Google was  I think this is a programmatic  retargeting advertising they called  it reminder ads oh you  looked at these boots on Amazon we're going  to bug you about them for six months I don't  know if that's the same thing but I think that Google's  report is that Google is looking at  making you able to block those as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wait no sometimes I like those  like I might look at something  on Nordstrom and then eventually  I find out that it's on sale through a retargeting ad  and then I'm like BAM BAM BAM BAM

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you don't have to turn it on this is a setting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you don't have to turn it off oh I do because  I cannot handle any more autoplay ads  good lord well this is  this is in your Google ads this is separate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this would be in the Google ad settings  on your phone  so Google's doing these reminder  ads I mean this is their Google ad network  everybody is yeah yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've never heard them call reminder ads  in the jargon they were called retargeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just reminding you  it actually what's interesting  is it will show you which reminder  ads you're actually Stacy you might like this  it's pretty granular because  it'll say here's reminder ads you can say  from this one okay but not from this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  oh nice okay  I bought that thing already

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah well you don't have to you could just check that  box off you don't bother me DIY  plaza I'm never going to do it myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the advertiser would get better  information to say oh yeah  you're one of ours we're going to stop bugging you because you actually  bought our product thank you very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this tool allows users to view all the  reminder ads currently tracked to your profile  from one of over two million sites that use Google's  advertising services  users can then choose to mute individual  reminder ads and view those that they've already  muted with their ad settings  oh my god you guys  that sounds handy actually yeah and then  and it's actually win-win because  you're right advertisers get some benefit right  they know like that Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  know or not because then they know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah you don't want to be reminded they know you've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this little boy is the sweetest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah good oh my gosh  no tats or anything no tats not yet  I'm waiting  alright I don't know what to say about this  I have to say I guess this is a good thing  but it kind of irks me  Google  Chromium has announced the beginning July 18th  the release of Chrome 68  if your site is not  HTTPS  it will be labeled not secure  now  of course  my blog is HTTPS  but I do have a site  the radio show site was designed a few years ago  there's a lot of historic sites  a lot of sites are not HTTPS  there's no accounts on that site there's no login  you're not buying anything  it's a free wide open site I don't know

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what's happening?  I think room service is here  I don't know what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we're just chock full of distractions today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  anyway at the same time  having HTTPS everywhere  protects everybody  there isn't any longer a performance hit  modern machines are so fast  that's not a problem  there is always even with a site like  the radio show website where  there's no login or anything  there's always the risk of a man in the middle  somebody pop you know you're at a coffee shop  you're visiting the tech guy lab site  somebody puts a pop up saying hey thanks for visiting Leo  would you like  the complete collection of Leo CDs  for only $9.95  just fill in your credit card information except it's not me  I don't sell that  so there's always that risk  and HTTPS protects you  somewhat  let me ask Kevin  is this a good thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's a trade off  there's still a lot of extra overhead  setting up on HTTPS side

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's going to be expensive for me  it's not merely getting the certificate  which is expensive enough  well it depends what you get  if you get an extended cert it's much more expensive  I don't know if we'd have to get a wildcard  cert for tech guy labs  but those are thousands of dollars  but that's not the end of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this site was not designed for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we have a  wildcard  cert for twit.tv  we just renewed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so first  baptist church  and you have a simple little site

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how much  it's going to cost to add secure  HTTP to my site  but it's not something you just flip a switch  lots of amateurs out there  it depends on your hosting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  some of the hosting sites are flipping a switch these days  you can do let's encrypt

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but not everybody  we literally just did this last week  did you to what site?  Stacey on IOT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no actually IOT podcast  because we built a Madam A skill  and you have to have HTTPS  to build a Madam A skill  but  we went to GoDaddy and we were like  hey we need a security cert  they were like give me  I think it was like 50 or maybe 75 bucks  and they turned it on  it republished all of my podcasts  and redownloaded it for everybody but other than that  seamless

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I don't know  TechEye Labs is a Drupal site  Lullabot designed it for us maybe 4 years  5 years ago  I don't know if it's that simple

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it depends what you're hosted on  I've got a bunch of stuff  on App Engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we use a company called  BlackMesh  I presume  well I don't know  actually BlackMesh is renamed to  or just was acquired by  Contigx  Contigx  so  I don't know  I'll have to find out  if it's a simple switch fine but this is a burden to some people  right? or maybe I'm wrong maybe it's just so easy now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  oh yeah no absolutely  yeah it's you know if you set up a new site  you should be able to do it  straight forwardly because people have now made it  straight forward including Less Encrypt  but if you've got an old site that you need to change  yes then it's a bunch of work  and that is overhead  and also then you get into the  do I redirect HTTP to HTTPS which means I'm adding the fragility  of certificate renewal to it as well  so there's a set of  extra things you need to think about  and if you set up with HSTS  then if your certificate goes nobody can get you a site at all  so there's  there's extra fragility  being added

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  those will mostly be edge cases and I guess  Google's rationale is  the benefit  in general is so high that we  want to encourage everybody to go to HTTPS  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you're  go on Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well the other thing is if it's not  HTTPS then your ISP can  man in the middle of you and inject stuff into the page  which they can't  so part of it is from Google's point of view  is stopping people corrupting their sites  corrupting other people's sites  and then you can also have a  a  a  a
