With Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York, blogger at BuzzMachine.com,  and author of many fine tomes, including what would Google do public parts and geeks bearing gifts. Hello, Jeff.  Hello, hello, hello.  We are glad Singapore's loss is our gain. Jeff, stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was 18 and a half hour flight. I decided not to take.  I don't blame you. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also with us, Stacey Higginbotham back in her home in beautiful Austin, Texas.  All the geeks have left. South by is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, South by is still happening. It's just not the geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now the more drunken geeks. It's the is it music or film?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's music and film. Oh, so they used to have separate for interactive music and film.  Now they've combined music and film to one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Film kind of stretches across most of the.  Oh, OK. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I miss we really wanted to go this year and we couldn't.  But next year, I think we're at least I said we should really go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I won't be here. I have more of my peeps were there this year than have been in recent years.  It appeared because generally it's marketers and Germans. Yeah.  Of course, you're not wrong, Jeff. You're not wrong.  The Germans for some reason, the Germans thought they love the cool kids go and they love it.  They have German houses, German parties.  You're kidding. I know it goes really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is actually a really big like I would say European in general.  But the Germans are a big chunk of it.  But you I I was just there yesterday and there was two fellows speaking French behind me.  And then I ran into a friend of mine who lives in Finland.  So, yeah, you know, it's sunny here.  It's cold and wet and miserable up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm going to put it in the chat now. Lufthansa runs a special flight.  Wow. The South by South by Express.  The Lufthansa flying lab. Oh, my God.  The chat and they program it with with with with speakers and other things while you're flying.  Oh, that would be kind of fun. I would do.  It's a very good idea. A friend of my friend of mine started this.  He's left Lufthansa since. But but it's really very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So you get a little conference on the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And they look at the speakers.  You're in it, Leo Rand, Lars, Benedict, Jason, Katie Cook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what do they do? They stand up in the aisle and they talk on the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they do. And so and so everybody watches through their through their devices, through the Wi-Fi.  Oh, no, I want to see Shagal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is really interesting. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And live performance.  So don't go on this flight if you want to quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, right. All by yourself.  You get a rap artist from Berlin.  Wow. And then the German house.  You weren't kidding. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's like a French house. There's a Chinese house.  There's all the houses.  There's a D.C. house. There's a Michigan house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hired a brilliant executive from German media just to launch our new program in news innovation leadership at the Newmark School.  And she was on Facebook and said, Oh, I'm not in South by Southwest.  That's because you're a New Yorker now.  Only Germans go. You're not a New Yorker anymore.  You're a New Yorker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, Foursquare was back after 10 years.  Foursquare was discovered at South by Southwest 10 years ago.  That was its big breakout moment.  And Paris Martino was on the Twitter on Sunday talking about her article.  She got a little peek at what Foursquare is up to these days.  And it might be just a little bit disquieting.  Turns out Foursquare is not gone.  Far from it.  They apparently are one of the big data brokers for location information.  And a pivot that worked.  It was a big pivot.  Now, the thing is, I remember when they launched swarm and they said Foursquare is going to be the place like a guide.  But swarms what you use to check in.  And I kept doing it for a while, but I stopped.  Turns out you don't need to play Foursquare or check in on swarm for Foursquare to know exactly where you are.  They're collecting information from a lot of apps on a lot of phones.  They have during South by I don't know if you saw this, Stacey.  They released a demo of this called hyper trending that had bubbles where the most people were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is really interesting.  And all like the writer of the piece is right.  This is both creepy for many people and cool for other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, it was Dennis Crowley who said, we're not sure.  We said we're not sure if it's creepy or cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that they threw it out.  Yes.  At a tech event.  I and I actually would draw the parallel with this and the NBC story that you have on scraping people's photos for facial recognition.  There's a very clear parallel here about people.  This actually makes clear what data is being collected in a way that is pretty visceral for people.  And it does it in a way that still respects their anonymity, which I think is the best possible way to do something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it misstates it because you are not in fact anonymous in the actual data that Foursquare sells people.  You are identified by a unique advertising ID, which I think wouldn't be too hard to de-anonymize you.  Crowley, who is the founder of Foursquare, said we're not sure if it's a responsible thing or not to have a view like this in the phone yet.  I don't know how people will react to seeing a heat map in real time of where all the phones are.  I can imagine some people would say, oh, that's the coolest thing.  And some people would be like, that's the creepiest thing.  So they wanted to put it out there.  But I think what they're doing is misrepresenting it a little bit because these are just anonymous blobs.  These show numbers.  But in fact, the data that they're selling is much more specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It shows also, well, in the not this version, but in the game they were talking about, also showing replacing that unique ID with an avatar and a fake photo and then showing the demographic data.  I think so. I get what you're saying.  This sort of tracking is happening and people kind of assume it's happening, but they don't know what that really means.  I think this gives them a nice window to start understanding what that means.  And I think anyone who freaks out about this, that's totally fine.  Then they're going to say, wait, how does Foursquare know this?  And then they're going to suddenly realize when they look into it that Foursquare has code.  I mean, companies like Uber and I don't know if Google does, Uber, Twitter, they're all using Foursquare's code to get your geolocation information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to feed more information back in, I presume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And then they'll actually be like, wait a second, can I get out of this?  And I think that'll start a really important conversation.  Also, like...  So we're going to switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish it would, but I don't think that this hyper trending thing does that because it's understating what they're actually doing.  In 2014, Foursquare launched Pilgrim, which you cannot see, a piece of code that passively tracks where your phone goes using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, GSM.  It identifies this shop or the park or the restaurant you're visiting, feeds data to its partner apps, of which there are more than a thousand.  And that's, you know, location apps like Twitter and Uber.  Pilgrim and the company's Places API are an integral part of tens of thousands of apps, sites, and interfaces.  As Foursquare's website says, if it tells you where it's probably built on Foursquare, but what Paris points out is, yeah, it's anonymized, sort of.  But there is a unique ID and there would be all sorts of nefarious ways to use this.  She says, you know, what if you notice the same guy in a few different locations and you had this data?  It wouldn't be hard at all to put a face with a number and say, now I know where he is.  And as long as I can get this data, I can see where he is at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But consumers don't have that data and they're clustering people in this particular app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the point. This app doesn't show what they're actually doing.  This is a boudlerized app. This is this is they took the good stuff out.  The stuff that, yes, you and I don't have access to, but plenty of other companies do.  They have an API that is much more granular than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still think it's a good point and a good place to start the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad they did this much, but they need to do a lot more.  It's also good they showed Paris Martinot what they're really doing, because that's much more dramatic.  They know they have an ID for you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know they have an ID. I mean, everybody has an ID for Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got a lot of trouble for having an ID for its users.  They got the cookies, the super cookies.  Now, but you're right. I'm sure it's not just Foursquare.  Google's got to be doing this. Apple's probably doing other companies are doing it as well.  Oh, so you don't need to be familiar with Euclid.  What's Euclid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a company that tracks Wi-Fi.  You're like they keep a unique ID for everybody's handset based on their Wi-Fi.  Trying to join Wi-Fi networks. So, yes, but this is this is happening everywhere.  It's not just Foursquare. It's not just like Foursquare is doing location.  You are. I would also say I don't know if you're getting a super valuable service.  Like, I don't care that Twitter knows my location, but that Uber knows my location is really important to me.  It's the bedrock of the service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I could point out that Uber could get your location by asking your phone in the Uber app where you are.  Uber knows where you are, but apparently is collecting more information than you're volunteering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that is that could be true.  I don't know the terms that Foursquare has with Uber, but one of the challenges with GPS in certain areas is that it doesn't work well.  So having an overlay like Foursquare is probably helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's all.  That's all they're using it for. OK, question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  So we'll switch roles here. Stacey's all in favor.  I'm worried about Iran and Turkey. Yeah. And Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, my point. That's my point. Precisely.  A malicious actor. Let's say Putin says, you know, we got to take Stacey Higabatem out.  She's really forget the individual. Forget the individual.  It could be an individual cluster of demonstrators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or any place. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're starting to mount up in Tahrir Square.  That's what I'm saying. They have cameras, though.  They have the means to track those people already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you could see you could see groups starting to coalesce.  You could see other things. Yeah, you're right. With this data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can. You could see people's phones.  Now, that's why a lot of demonstrators try to hop off networks and use like peer to peer networks.  I mean, that's right. I think there's probably going to be if there isn't already,  we're going to continuously see a development of protocols for people who are protesting.  And I think it's good. And I think some of the things are, hey,  how do you use a decentralized peer to peer app on your phone to talk to people?  How like at home, you're going to regularly go through Tahrir.  I think we're also going to see things like people tweaking their makeup and their hats  and everything else to avoid facial recognition.  And I think those are actually some of the more interesting things to watch because it helps us.  It's the other side that most people don't see that lay bare the surveillance kind of state  and surveillance capitalism that we have. So I don't know.  I don't think this is like the worst thing. I think it's actually a decent conversation starter.  And I like the fact that it self-destructs after two weeks.  And oh, yes, this is my other thing. Wait, hold on.  No. Well, what if they delete? Well, they're not going to delete all that data.  Foursquare has the same sort of subpoena things that Google and Facebook have.  They fight that. So, I mean, you can't argue against this if you're going to be like,  yeah, I love Facebook and all that it's done or I'm OK with Google having access to all of this data,  which they do and more. And they also have unique advertisement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like, yeah, my concern is not the individual level because your phone company knows it already.  Right. Apps know it already. This is not new in that sense.  The question is that that notion of another view of coalescing and using our freedom of assembly.  So it's the aggregate that it bothers me more than the individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting? I would flip it on its head and I would say,  how cool would it be to use something like this and check out how many people are at the DMV when you want to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. How cool is that? Google Maps does that already.  It'll show you when you want to go somewhere where the busy times are.  It's incredibly valuable to stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's it's valuable for people counting or understanding.  You know, I think people counting is actually a really under under discussed and under thought about way  that we could actually use phones to help people like just make their day better.  And I'm thinking of things like, hey, if I have to go to the ER, can I see which ERs have the most people?  Could we build a service based on something like this?  We're not now because there's no profit in it.  But those kind of services are highly valuable and you could do that with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. We are all carrying tracking devices and I agree with you.  It's a good idea for Foursquare and others to start the conversation so that we understand we're not taken off guard by this.  I think part of the problem is it's hard for humans to put two and two together sometimes.  And while we are all kind of aware of the fact that our phone knows where we are and our apps know where we are,  we don't think about other consequences of it.  You said face recognition. This actually doesn't use face recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no. The parallel is to the NBC story on people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll get to that. But I just want to say that the point is if you combine this with face recognition, you're suddenly de-anonymized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I'm like, how do you you're de-anonymized anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody knows Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody knows anybody they want to know.  And if you combine all this data, I mean, I think, you know, when I think about the Bourne movies, right,  and you watch them track Jason Bourne all over the place with what it seemed at the time,  very advanced stuff like cameras everywhere and stuff.  That's now chicken feed compared to the kind they wouldn't have any trouble following Jason Bourne at all nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. You would have to 3D print your own like new face mask.  You would have to I'm not kidding. You would have to do something crazy like that.  You wouldn't have to you'd have to not have a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's funny that you're arguing in its favor and Jeff's arguing against it.  This is completely blowing my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just conspired before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's talk about this Netflix and Netflix flicker thing.  So Yahoo way back when I remember when they did this made a research database available,  which had a lot of information and information that was quickly de-anonymized by people in a variety of ways.  What I didn't know is that among other things in this database, they put flicker pictures.  And now it's coming out that the and this is an NBC news story and good on them for this scoop,  that those flicker pictures are being used by IBM to trade train face recognition.  In fact, we could even say IBM is on the side of the angels here because one of the things they're doing is  trying to make face recognition more racially fair.  Less racist.  Less racist.  But I think the problem is that a lot of people didn't know that this was going on.  And the story is that IBM did not inform people when it used their photos for face recognition training.  Now, the good news is NBC, even though IBM would not give them the data set,  NBC was able to get it in other ways.  And there is a tool on the NBC site.  Did IBM use your photos?  And you can enter in and I haven't done this yet, your flicker handle.  And just to see if your photos, the photos, I think, were always Creative Commons, right?  So they weren't licensed photos and they were de-anonymized.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were they de-anonymized?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or were they they were annotated with features?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's different than being like they might have had race racial information.  Your dog was scared, dude.  That's a good question.  I know that the main Yahoo database was and they made a big point about this completely de-anonymized.  No, none of my photos are in the IBM data set.  What's your flicker handle?  Anybody want to volunteer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't remember because it was that Fakak to Yahoo thing.  Yeah, because I had to use a Yahoo account.  No, it was the same as the Yahoo handle.  It was the same, I think.  Oh, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, well, let me see if Leo Laporte is in there because I was.  Yahoo ruined everything it touched.  Let me see if Chris Markwart.  I know his flicker handle.  Oh, yeah, Chris Markwart's photos are in there.  Here is one of them.  So here's the most important point.  I was able to find it because Chris Markwart submitted these photos to Flickr.  But whoever this guy is, this friend of Chris's is the face, not Chris's, but the friend.  It's a picture by Chris.  And this guy definitely didn't know that when Chris took his picture, it was going to be included in an IBM training set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now on the podcast, I might add, and I apologize for de-anonymizing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You haven't you haven't de-anonymized him.  You've shown a random face on the Internet.  We don't know who that is yet.  Could we find out more easily now that we've seen it?  Yes.  But but one, when you when you scrape faces for facial recognition purposes, what you're pulling is you're pulling that image.  You're going to annotate it.  So basically, that means you're going to say this is a man.  This is a bald man.  This is a bald white man with a camera.  You're going to put all of that in there and then you send that to the computer and the computer like looks at it and categorizes it, does its stuff.  And then you get you.  That picture doesn't ever come up again.  So, again, annotating and anonymity and de-anonymizing very different.  And I would say that when you sent your pictures in under Creative Commons, if you chose that licensing scheme, you did it knowing that your photo could end up on Wikipedia.  But that's the point is that Chris Marquardt did it and made it Creative Commons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's not a picture of him.  It's somebody else.  But again, the guy who's pictured is had no consent in it and may not even know.  However, I don't have any problem with it.  I want to point out because but it's interesting, isn't it?  I don't I mean, I for all I know, I might be one of those pictures, too, because no one else is going to.  So the researchers who are annotating it see those pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's all right.  But that's it.  Those aren't.  We need data for research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need it.  And they want you need knowledge.  We want to especially to make sure our algorithms are not sexist and racist.  Yep.  So what happens with these IBM took a collection of 100 million images, all Creative Commons licensed.  Yahoo had released as a batch for researchers in 2014.  They narrowed it down to a million faces, each annotated with almost 200 values, things like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and some of it was automated, not even human.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Measuring the interpupillary distance, the pose, the skin tone, estimated age and gender, and then used to train the data set.  I think, in fact, this is a good thing.  Everybody, I'm sure everybody knows that when you allow Google to upload all your photos to Google Photos, that they are using that for training.  Otherwise, that search wouldn't work.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say.  So here's a thing to think about.  A picture that is taken in what is clearly a public area might be different than like those naked selfies that you took or pictures of your lover in the bedroom.  I don't know if those are filtered out.  Stacey.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even then, nobody sees it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But even then, no one sees them.  Well, no, the human researcher.  Some researchers might see it.  And I bet he's saving the good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that is so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but you put it on Flickr for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In public.  This is why.  This is why I don't.  And every time I have to sign a waiver for like my daughter's school that she could be photographed and things, I say no.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the thing to keep in mind is that in cases like this, the subject of the photograph is not really in any way involved.  So if you're letting people take your picture, you should consider what might end up happening.  And I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tell like when people take my picture, I ask them not to tag me.  If people take a picture and my daughter's in it, I make sure they don't tag her.  So and you'll never catch me posting pictures of my daughter.  Right.  On anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's really I think now this explains why this is a good idea.  On the other hand, it's also a good idea to give as broad a data set as possible to these face recognition programs, because if you if they only get white men, they can be very good.  And what that means potentially is a police department that uses these for finding criminals is going to be much more likely to have false positives with, let's say, women and people of dark skin.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's a bad use case of facial.  That's a bad outcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is to this is to reverse that I I'm for it.  I'm going to give him a pass.  Pass.  OK.  Leo gives it a pass.  I don't give four square a pass, but I give this one a pass.  How about Mark Zuckerberg?  A week later, that came out.  That took me by surprise during the show last week.  I hadn't read it.  I thought we had a great conversation about it.  It was a really interesting conversation.  Yeah.  And at the time, I reactivated my Facebook account, my messenger account, because I believed he was sincere.  And I have been since talked out of that and have deleted it again.  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm willing to give him the benefit of that.  Maybe he'll change things.  But after reading, for instance, Ben Thompson's excellent commentary, Mike Mazda, a tech dirt, Ben Thompson and Strutecary,  Walt Mossberg says he's skeptical.  Casey Newton says this is huge pivot.  We were kind of ourselves like, wow, this is amazing if he does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. I was I was skeptical.  I want you to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and we and there's no reason to know yet.  But I think I've been convinced by everybody that what Mark said, I misinterpreted.  He's not going to change Facebook.  He's going to add a privacy specific messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but he also says he's changing his book and those other services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he also says that he's changing the focus of the company.  Is he going to kill Facebook tomorrow?  Of course not.  No. Yeah.  Or I would say that.  Or ever.  But but he's but he's basically saying that the focus of the company shifts to encrypted encryption and messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what Ben Thompson said is he's having his privacy cake and eating it too.  And his eye is.  But Ben says, and I think this is actually accurate, is that Mark saw a real opportunity, as we pointed out last week on WeChat line to be the WeChat of the West.  And that's really what he's saying is I have a brand new business opportunity and we're going to go after it full throttle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and Ben says at the end of the thing, it is not incompatible.  A company's own desires is not necessarily incompatible with users interests.  That's right.  And to presume that is gets us in trouble.  So it could be that this is a what do we call it down a win win.  I don't say things like that.  I don't say things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He I think you're he actually says could be he actually says here's the three broad takeaways.  Stop expecting companies to act against their interests.  Facebook is not killing their core business any more than Apple is willing to go to the mat to protect user data in China.  Facebook is doing something that benefits itself.  Facebook doing something that benefits itself is not inherently bad for end users.  When I was making yes, it's perfectly reasonable.  The company can be instituting genuinely user friendly changes like end to end encryption, even as it furthers its own self interests.  Relatedly and most importantly, there needs to be much more appreciation for the anti competitive trade offs inherent in an absolutist approach to privacy.  Facebook is doing what its fiercest critics supposedly want, but it's also enhancing its competitive position as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The law of unintended consequences, folks.  Be careful what you wish for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you what.  I will use that completely private end to end Facebook, but I'm going to wait until that comes out before I reinstitute my Facebook account because it's not that way now.  And I would wait and I would do this because am I am you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Oh, OK.  What's happening?  We just ignore.  That's all.  I would wait.  And this is because he talked about lowering interoperability between services, which he currently says is an important and important aspect is that users will be able to be able to opt in to sharing their WeChat with their Facebook, whatever.  I think given Facebook's history, he'll say that today and then in a year or so we will suddenly find all of that.  Glom together, which to use my example, I do have pictures of my daughter on WeChat and I would be really bummed out if that I'd never chat.  Why are they in WeChat?  Not WeChat.  I'm sorry.  What's that?  What's that?  My friends in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do actually have friends in China.  Then you might put them on WeChat.  WeChat is totally dominant in China.  Replace WeChat with WhatsApp.  WhatsApp could be the WeChat of the West.  I get the profuse all the time.  It could be the WeChat of the West.  It could be.  This is a big opportunity.  It's already dominant in a lot of, not in the US, but in Brazil and a lot of countries.  India is how people communicate.  And in fact, I should point out WhatsApp has had some of the same problems Facebook's having.  It's being accused in India of creating mass violence, being used to incite violence, fake and distribute fake news.  You know, it still has some of the same problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so going to a fully encrypted world, if you're trying to enforce the law or deal with misinformation is not necessarily a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Mark actually said in his Wired interview, quote, the work there, sorry, in terms of safety, security and safety and spam.  The work there will be harder if we only rely on detecting patterns of activity rather than being able to have the security system see the context, content of the messages themselves.  Of course, I would argue that's true.  But as a parent, for example, yeah, my life would be super easy if I kept a surveillance camera on my daughter at all times.  But that's not going to help her develop and allow her to become her own person.  So sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in fact, it was the Wired interview and kudos to Nicholas Thompson at Wired who got very quickly got up interview with Mark.  It was this interview that actually convinced me that I misunderstood Mark's manifesto.  And it was this paragraph.  The thinking is there need to be two types of platforms in the world.  One is a more public platform like the digital equivalent of a town square where you enact with a lot of people at once.  That's largely what Facebook and Instagram are.  The other platform is the private space, the digital equivalent to the living room and the foundation that we have.  What's that message?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want the public to go away.  Let them both exist.  And those who wish to be public, right, like me, like you used to, can have that and can and can gather and can do things.  That's fine. You know, I don't mind.  Otherwise, the world turns into a turtle shell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In all honesty, it's not me mining being public.  It's my I mind the public talking back.  I don't want to hear from them.  So it's you know what I'm saying?  I don't mind them knowing everything about me.  I just don't want to hear their thoughts about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First time caller. Hello. Hello. Hello.  Is there anybody listening? Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have to be public. That's my job.  But it seems like everybody has a thought about that kind of wears you down after a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an entirely different thing.  That's another problem.  Like, I'm going to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so I'm a flawed human.  What can I say?  But, you know, I'd be very interested if he does take WhatsApp and or Messenger and make it fully private.  But when he when he does, that's when I'll sign up.  Not not until then.  How about that?  Let's take a break because I want to now get to Elizabeth Warren.  Well, we know actually that was the whole segment right there.  We can stop now and move on.  Stacey goes, Jeff goes.  But you know what?  She's probably already I bet you there's some interest in other quarters of the other Democratic candidates on what she says and how they can slice that.  They're watching, aren't they?  They're watching. Did that work?  Kudos to Warren for for being the first to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we'll set a call.  Lidicule.  I think it was cynical.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think it was cynical?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  First, I want to show you this.  I know you think it's an iPad.  It is actually is an iPad.  But it but it's more than that.  This is what you will see.  The first thing you'll see when you come to Twitter and a lot of businesses in the world.  This is our envoy.  It's time to welcome your guests to the modern lobby and be ready for everything that comes in your front door.  Envoy visitors and I'll launch it right now is an iPad kiosk that makes workplaces more efficient.  We've always when we've had people come to watch our shows, we've always had them sign a waiver and give them an informational thing and all that.  Now we can do it on we do it on the envoy through this really great interface on an iPad.  When visitors arrive, they sign in on the iPad kiosk.  They enter their details.  If you know, we just need their name, sign any legal documents, in our case, NDA, not an NDA, but a waiver so that they won't sue us for tripping over wires and stuff.  And they do that right on the iPad.  The envoy then notifies us.  It automatically if in an enterprise where you've got people visiting employees, it'll automatically notify the employee their guest is here.  So you don't the front desk is Moses loves this is so much easier for him.  So, you know, their employee knows who's coming and you don't get surprised by somebody.  I don't know him. What is he doing here? What is he selling me?  This is just awesome. I just love it.  It is it is it is really streamlined.  Our process and the thing is our visitors love it too.  It's a much easier way of doing the things we need before somebody comes into our studios.  You'll boost your office efficiency with smart security that doesn't intimidate.  It's very friendly.  There's no more paper log book.  And really, what good is that?  You know, I'd like to go through your log book from last year.  No, it's all in a database.  You could sign in unlimited visitors, even print customized badges.  We don't do that, but you could hook up the printer and have it print the badges.  Send alerts when VIPs arrive.  Somebody really important comes out, you know, beep beep beep.  It even notifies administrators about unattended guests.  And all this is exactly how you want to handle a front desk.  You can integrate any existing security systems like Wi-Fi access, ID checks, emergency notifications.  So you get better security.  And of course, you'll have data on the visitors in your office.  So you know who's coming when they're on site, where they're going, who they're meeting and why.  Okta, which is a great example.  This is a security company.  They use it.  They say it's so good.  It actually makes me excited to sign in.  I love that.  They have it at Box.  Here's Volvo.  Envoy gives our guests the right brand impression.  Yeah, our logo is right on there.  It works with everything you already use.  It works with Slack.  That's what we use.  G Suite.  We use that too.  Box, Salesforce, Chatter.  It's designed to help companies of all sizes and all types, even those in industries that are highly regulated, meet security and compliance requirements.  It's the biggest companies in the world.  Nike, Spotify, Pinterest all work with Envoy.  30 million visitors.  We haven't really added to that number significantly, but we use it to protect your people, your property, and the ideas, the welcoming way with Envoy.  10,000 workplaces worldwide choose Envoy to make a great first impression.  We've got a free trial waiting for you.  Yeah, you can try it for free at Envoy.com slash Twit.  I got to tell you, it was very easy for us to set up.  And I have to give this back now because we...  Moses says I have to have my Envoy set up.  We have it right there at the front desk.  If you come to Twit, you'll see it.  You'll be able to use it.  Envoy.com slash Twit to start your free trial today.  By the way, there's also a delivery app that logs deliveries, says who they went to.  You can see that which deliveries have come and picked up, which ones haven't.  I'm happy to say all our deliveries have been picked up today.  All right, you can take that back.  Thank you, Moses.  Envoy.com slash Twit.  You've probably used it.  And when you go to some of the big tech companies, they all use Envoy.  It's really awesome.  So Elizabeth Warren, Medium Post, says we should break up Facebook, Google, and Amazon.  She added Apple.  Yeah, well, next day...  And she followed up with Apple.  Well, next day was funny because I think...  I don't know.  I have to look at the video.  I haven't seen the video.  But when I was reading in The Verge, Neelay Patel, with the follow-up, it looked like  he jumped her because initially her answers are one word, yes, no.  But right away, he says, you mean Apple too?  And she says, yes.  And that's the headline.  Either they run the platform or they play in the store.  I have to say, in her defense, I do feel like this was something she hadn't really thought  out, and that Neelay got her.  That's a defense?  That's a defense?  She didn't take it out?  The Apple one is less thought out because basically she said, well, Apple shouldn't  be allowed to run the store and sell their apps in the store.  And honestly, if that's the problem, that's not it.  There's a big problem.  Spotify, in fact, is very upset with Apple and has just started a website and a campaign.  I think they might be planning to sue Apple as well.  The website is timetoplayfair.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have sued them in the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've sued them in the EU, which is the best place to sue them.  And their complaint is, yeah, Apple has this store, but the real problem is Apple requires  us to sell subscriptions through the store and they get 30% complete rent taking.  At the same time, Apple prohibits us from showing customers how to upgrade any other  way.  And so what did Spotify do?  Well, they had to raise the cost of a subscription 30% on iPhone and then Apple comes back, starts  its own music service 30% less.  And in fact, to this day, you can still not ask Siri to launch Spotify on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon movies or Amazon video service also has this complaint.  This is pretty anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, Apple won't work with them on a watch app because Apple has a competing product.  If Elizabeth Warren had said this, I'd say right on.  I think you're absolutely right.  This is absolutely anti-competitive behavior from a monopsony, not a monopoly, but I think  it's a monopsony, right?  It's the only place you can get apps for iOS devices is Apple's own store.  So there are some merit to what she's asking for.  Who should we start with?  Stacey, we'll start with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, don't start with me.  This whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, Stacey, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's start with Jeff.  Would you elaborate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it was a cynical move to curry favor right now and not thought through.  For example, forbidding house brands.  Well, tell that to Sears Roebuck and Craftsman.  Tell that to Walmart.  Any grocery store in America.  And then it saves consumers money.  And she might as well move to Europe because the view of antitrust there is different.  And Ben in strategy did a good job of this saying that what's the law of aggregation,  I think he calls it.  Yeah, that's the thing he invented.  These things are happening because they have consumer benefit, because they give us cheaper  prices.  And it's an effort to say, oh, big tech is evil.  What I'm going to be interested in is what Kamala Harris does in return.  And I have my Kamala hat outside because she represents California.  So she's going to have to find a more nuanced view of this to say, well, here's where the  tech companies are causing problems and here's where they're not.  And here's what we got to talk about with regulation.  I was in Ditchley near Oxford two weeks ago and I was dreading it because it was a discussion  of content moderation and freedom of expression, read regulation.  And I thought it was going to be I was screaming just like on this show, defending the Internet.  And it turned into a very nuanced, very intelligent discussion.  And where a lot of a lot of the room came into agreement was a an FTC, Federal Trade  Commission like regime, where companies are expected to make warranties to their customers.  And if they fail at what that warranty is, then there is a enforcement mechanism against  them for basically consumer fraud.  So I'm not against regulation.  I think that there are mechanisms and regimes of regulation that can work.  But to jump all past that and just say they're bad because they're big and we're going to  break them up is a is a cynical political move that hurts this country.  It hurts technology.  It hurts the frigging future.  And she's desperate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's what I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if she's desperate.  I do think it's opportunistic.  I do think it is easy to joust at the tech companies.  I do think that there are issues.  The issue in the tech world is not that these are too big.  It's that they do have anti-competitive practices.  I also think that there is value in understanding how they many of these companies have created  machines that are these virtuous cycles that pull in more data, which gives them creates  a higher barrier to entry for people.  That's kind of a more European view on it.  I would say in the U.S., we ask, does that hurt consumers?  And I would argue that it does because consumers have very little choice that doesn't, you  know, grab their data if they care about privacy.  But we tend to look more at costs.  And there we don't have a case.  So if Elizabeth Warren and the Democratic Party want to change the way we look at antitrust,  this could be a good talking point if it was a little bit more coherent.  But as it stands now under our current regime, I'm a little skeptical.  I'm all for the conversation about changing our antitrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're green so much today, Stacey.  This is going to drive Leo up the wall.  So, yeah, we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would say if it changes, like I would differ a little bit with you, Jeff, in the  sense that I'm OK with thinking about changing our antitrust regimes and how we talk about  that, how we evaluate monopolies or I can never say the word.  Monopsonies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I only know the word because Amy Klobuchar keeps bringing it up.  She's worried about monopolies.  I'm worried about monopsonies.  Yeah, I can't make those words.  I think that's a little show-offy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I do think there is a real question about the aggregation of data and the cycle that  it creates for these companies to get bigger and better and how much of a competitive barrier  it pulls up.  I would also say that the cool thing about technology is a totally different startup  could actually come in, find some random data point or random device that people freaking  love and throw all that down.  So that's the question.  Can you become a Spotify today?  Can you, if you're not Amazon or Google, build an Echo like device?  I don't know if that's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, from the thing that I went to in the UK, what came out again and again and again,  and again and again, there was a guy from a Eastern European online service and he kept  on saying, you guys are trying to set this regulation and I understand why and that's  fine.  But you know what?  The only people who can afford to do it are Google and Facebook and Amazon and Apple.  And you're killing me.  You're absolutely killing me.  Articles 11 and 13, GDPR, a lot of these things, they just can't afford to do it.  And so the irony here is that in the effort to reduce the power of the big platforms again  and again and again, this regulation gives them more power and a competitive advantage  over and a higher bar barrier to entry over those new upstarts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would respond to that.  I'm a specialist in conversation stoppers.  My largest issue with this, you know, I understand the outrage people have over these big  companies.  She seems to be focusing on size.  In fact, I think at one point she even said if they get to a certain point, they should  be broken up in size, which has nothing to do with antitrust law or anything else.  Companies in the United States should be allowed to be successful, as successful as they want  to be, as long as they don't, you know, create any competitive environments, as long as there's  competition, as long as there's challengers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And right, so you've got to go to the specific acts and the specific harm.  Yeah.  That's my fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something like this is like the pitchforks and the torches where we just got to destroy  these guys.  That, of course, is not what anybody wants.  It would be a horrible detriment to our society.  And I'm afraid that this kind of conversation derails a very important conversation, one  that's been ongoing here for the last few years about, well, what should we get the  way?  How should we regulate these companies?  I don't think anybody disagrees.  These companies need to be reined in, especially in privacy practices.  And I'd really prefer to hear from Warren and all the other candidates, specific plans  in that regard.  What are you going to do about our data?  What are you going to do to protect our privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there is a fascinating experiment going on, I don't think it's widely known, in France,  where they're basically doing a role playing, government and Facebook, of regulation to  understand the dynamics.  And so they don't have any regulation to regulate against, but they're trying to understand  what that works.  And it was that discussion that led the group to a larger view of this FTC view.  I said at one point, we have to talk about the terms of service.  And it's a shadow house rule, so I'd be careful here.  But a lawyer from a technology world said, well, we don't write terms of service against  us.  We write them against the users.  And I said, right, but now you're going to be expected to write terms of service that  give the users some warranty of what you're promising to do.  That's the level of discussion I want to see is, OK, talk about your responsibility.  Talk about what you guarantee.  Say what you don't guarantee.  Let us argue about that.  Make that public.  And then we're going to hold your feet to the fire for that.  I'm all for that.  And then that allows Facebook to have one term of service and Reddit to have another one  and 4chan to have another one and Apple to have another one.  As well they should.  There are different companies with different relationships with their publics and you, Leo,  can choose to reject them all.  Then you know you're rejecting better.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mike Masnick writes, I think in a very level headed way, again, none of this is to say  we shouldn't be concerned about big Internet companies with too much power.  It's a perfectly reasonable concern.  But just because you want to do something and this is something doesn't mean that it's  the something we should do.  The way to attack the positions of these big Internet companies is to enable more competition.  And you do that by encouraging alternatives in the marketplace.  He's concerned about platforms, this idea of creating platforms out of them and forcing  them to divest.  He also points out that, you know, this is really Congress's job, not the president's  job, and Congress is never going to agree to do something this dramatic.  I mean there's all sorts of problems with it.  So in fact, even in the logic of it, he points out that she starts with this paragraph, 25  years ago Facebook, Google and Amazon didn't exist.  Now they're among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world.  It's a great story, but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies  and promote competitive markets.  He says, I find this very odd.  I don't know how the first sentence supports the second.  In fact, the first sentence would seem to contradict the second.  If these three companies sprang up in the last 25 years, that's good.  That means another one could do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I mean, clearly it's a bad idea.  It probably is grandstanding.  I mean, after all, it's a presidential election.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I was going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the time when we expect stuff like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's also not the time or place.  Well, it may be the place, but it's not what we get.  We don't get nuanced conversations from people who are going into primaries.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just end of day.  No.  We want sound bites.  In fact, this is probably more complex and less of a sound bite than really is proper.  I mean, this is an incredibly complex idea.  What is the sound bite?  Break up the big tech companies.  Well, maybe that's okay.  Maybe that.  So I just downloaded this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't read it yet.  So there's an FT interview with Tim Berners-Lee today or yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the 30th anniversary of his proposal of the World Wide Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it mentions in their report from the Center for International Governance Innovation by  Kiran O'Hara and Wendy Hall.  Four Internets, the geopolitics of digital governance.  There's the libertarian technology-based Internet.  There's the commercial-based Internet of the big companies.  There's the European regulatory Internet.  And there's the Chinese and Russian authoritarian Internet.  And what we're seeing here is these forces pulling and pushing each other to determine  who's going to regulate and who's going to govern the Internet.  And we're not there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it is an unfortunate trend towards four separate Internets.  That's exactly the fear.  That's where we're moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long did it take for regulation in the railroads, heck, airlines, telecom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the best analog for this is breaking up AT&T, right?  Is it? OK.  I think so.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because AT&T was given a monopoly.  It was given one by government.  You were the only phone company.  You had to rent your phone from the phone company, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's not where we are now.  So no, I don't think it's a good analog at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, it's not a good analog also in the sense that none of these companies are a monopoly in the way AT&T was a monopoly.  Which is also a government sanctioned monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But ignoring the genesis of the monopoly.  That's no, that's pretty major.  Maybe.  But ignoring the genesis of the monopoly for a moment, our monopolies in that way at all, a tiny bit.  What did the what was the purpose of the breakup of AT&T and what was the outcome of the breakup?  Did it in fact achieve?  Still debated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we didn't we didn't achieve anything we wanted.  We.  That's why I bring that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just I'm using it as an example of why government intervention in this level may not be the best solution.  Mm hmm.  Because it's a very big gun that's hard to it's hard to control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That I forget who made the argument, but I saw it a couple days ago that said that if you what could happen unintended consequences is it fine.  So Zappos and Amazon are broken up again, but they're going to cooperate and they're and they both will probably do better.  And that this could end up, you know, the shareholders of these multiple companies then now more multiples could do fine.  And it doesn't guarantee what was the outcome you want.  Are you are you doing what Stacey said?  Are you getting new entrants in the market or not?  Are you protecting?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in fact, if you look at what AT here's the here's the flow chart that's really clear with AT&T and the breakup.  You start at the top with AT&T Bell South AT&T Ameritech Pacific Telesis Southwestern Bell whoop back into AT&T.  Whoop.  Then Bell Atlantic with 9x GTE and became Verizon and then US West with Quest and said you link because central link you went from one to three.  And I don't think you in any way fostered innovation or anything else.  You certainly didn't create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, if you want to break up some companies that are that are hated in this country, try Verizon.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  And in fact, that's what Mike Masnick or no, I think Ben Thompson, one of them says is, hey, she'd even talk about Comcast Universe, NBC Universal.  And and actually she said, yeah, I'd include those two.  I just, you know, I mean, I only had so much space.  It's moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's also it's also that you're going to you're going to reverse decisions that were made by government that did for good or bad reason approve these mergers.  And then you're going to turn around and say, oh, never mind.  So how can you rely on a government decision at any point?  I think honestly, we can all look at it and say it's not it's a nonstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not something that ever could happen.  But I think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think we could create genuine policy shift in the U.S.  We would it would take longer than the the adherence on one side want.  But I think you can do that.  And we have historically done that.  Look at what we're doing, you know, in terms of let's let's call it basic human rights.  Let's talk about voting rights.  Yes, that is taking have normally long time, but we are fixing it.  And so if you look at it, not from a five year time horizon, but you look at it and look how I mean, a good example is net neutrality.  Oh, my God, we are still debating that 20 years after they're actually 30 years after that is something.  But we have shifted our policies.  I would say they abruptly took a abruptly backwards with the current administration.  But I I think we could do that.  We can't just shrug our shoulders and say this is impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we should do something about it.  I just don't know if breaking them up makes any sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, having the conversation is started.  It is doing something.  It's a good starter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there is a tenor in Washington right now of doing something for sure, for sure.  Now, ironically, Facebook made it worse because when Elizabeth Warren bought ads on Facebook saying let's break up Facebook, they took them down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They used the Facebook logo, the automated algorithm, challenged it and took it down because that violates the rule.  They challenged.  They got back up.  So you think it was just that?  Yeah, it's just this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was just a robot.  It wasn't malicious, Leo.  For God sakes.  But can I just say who are the amateurs running this sort of thing at Facebook?  Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The optics were not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The optics were bad.  But the media idiocy is worse.  Yeah, it's a O.F.  How did that happen?  But it was obvious it was.  And this Facebook said it was they they don't allow the use of the Facebook logo in ads.  They don't want Facebook to seem to be endorsing any.  That's a good.  That's actually a comment on Facebook, which they did allow the Facebook logo to be used in it.  They should.  But I'll tell you, try to try to do an ad against Fox News on Fox News.  See how far you get.  Yeah.  Ain't gonna happen.  By the way, CNN on CNN ain't gonna happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To underscore your point of some episodes ago, all the ads cost under one hundred dollars.  At least candidates are getting smart about how to buy by ad time on Facebook these days.  OK, anything else you want to say before we move on?  Move on, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait, I wanted to ask because I didn't get Jeff, do you have any books on historical monopolies in the U.S.  and regulation of them that you would recommend?  That's a good subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had no.  But one that I love and I forget the title of it is a I think it's called the Great Atlantic Pacific Tea Company.  It was a history of the first chain store, which was a A&P.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a wonderful, wonderful book because it because what happens is that the political pressure that goes on that tried to outlaw chain stores because mom and pop stores were getting killed.  There was political value to the mom and pops.  And so they tried hard.  It's like Elizabeth Warren trying to say, um, uh, house brands bad, right?  Chain stores bad.  So if you own more than one store, this suddenly became became awful.  And you see the complete arc from the beginning of that, you know, the end of that mom and pop, which people can't stand all the way over to the wrong way here.  The end of that arc all the way over to A&P dying.  And it didn't quite go up to that.  So I recommend it highly.  I'll try to look up the title.  If anybody in the chat room knows it, let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  Actually, before we take a break, Google says it will unveil the future of gaming on Tuesday.  Google says it will unveil the future of gaming on Tuesday.  We will be covering that live.  We have now learned that they're going to be streaming this keynote from GDC.  So is it 10 a.m.  Carson on Tuesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is 10 a.m.  On 10 a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pacific.  That's 1 p.m.  Eastern 1700 UTC.  Twitter TV slash live.  It'll be Jason Howe and I commenting as we always do on these keynotes.  It's expected that Google, which showed off kind of a cool project stream not so long ago.  I missed it.  I couldn't sign up in time that allowed you to play a very nice beautiful game called  Age of Empires Odyssey on your Chromebook in Chrome by doing all the hard work on servers  and streaming the imagery to the Chromebook.  It looks like this is probably what Google is going to announce.  Project Streams public unveiling.  There are some rumors that it might also announce some hardware.  If it did, it would probably be kind of Chromecast hardware that would allow you to say play  the game on an iPhone, cast it to a big screen TV, not iPhone on an Android phone.  Because I think that's the whole point of Project Stream is to show how you can play  AAA games on inexpensive hardware, maybe even Chromebooks and that kind of thing.  But there is this weird rumor that they might do a high end console.  We'll see.  This is after they fired all the other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the timing of that rumor is very bad because yesterday Google asked a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  working in their hardware division under Rick Osterloh to find other jobs.  Yeah, that's another story.  The implication is that perhaps Google wants to get out of the hardware business.  These are people working on the slate.  I don't.  The slate tablet and the laptop, the Chromebook Pixel.  Remember, they didn't release a new Pixelbook this year.  They did the slate instead.  It doesn't mention the Pixel phones, though.  So I don't know.  So do you already know the name Jade Raymond?  Yeah, I saw that in this article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's from the United States.  She, former Ubisoft producer and motive studios founder, has joined.  She's joined Google as a vice president.  So given that she is a former head of a gaming company.  So it's interesting.  Yeah.  Join Google as a VP.  So I was like, I don't know what to do.  She's an industry veteran.  They hired a major, evidently well respected major gaming executive.  Oh, yes.  No, I recognize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just wondering, like, what is your VP at Google?  What are you in charge of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Variety has an article that says she started as a programmer for Sony, went on to work  for Electronic Arts, was a correspondent for Sony, and she's a former CEO of Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Started as a programmer for Sony, went on to work for Electronic Arts, was a correspondent  for the Electronic Electric Playground, worked at Ubisoft Montreal where she was producer  of Assassin's Creed, executive producer of Assassin's Creed 2, Watch Dogs, and Splinter Cell Blacklist.  She helped open the Toronto studio for Ubisoft.  It served as its managing director.  It's interesting.  Yeah.  Pretty high profile.  So I imagine we'll see Raymond at the keynote on Tuesday.  I don't know.  I think this is very interesting.  Why is gaming something Google wants to get into?  What's your theory on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no theories on this.  I mean, maybe they have a lot of extra server power and they really want to emphasize that.  I don't know.  I'm so not interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One thing you can't do well on a Chromebook.  Well, there's that.  But it is a very important part of the mobile ecosystem.  But you don't have mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything is mobile.  Yeah.  I mean, if you look at either Facebook or Google, they don't give a darn about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I have to think about what we were saying when Microsoft did its HoloLens 2 announcement  a couple of weeks ago, is that it really didn't look like Microsoft was that interested in  the actual product.  It was more as demo of Azure, of its services.  And maybe that's the same thing for a gaming play for Google is, yeah, this is a product,  super facing product, but really what it shows off is Google's...  Amazing cloud.  Amazing cloud.  Amazing low latency network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's kind of what Microsoft did with HoloLens, right?  It's all about all the amazing things you could do with Azure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, well, yes and no.  Yes and no.  I think HoloLens actually has a viable market in the industrial space and Microsoft really  wants to sell Azure and provide the industrial internet that's coming because it will be  a huge market in 20 years.  It wants to get in on the ground floor there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that makes a lot of sense.  And gamers are not, in fact, the customers for Google's cloud services.  On the other hand, if you could put together a very...  See, the funny thing is Microsoft's doing this.  They have a project, won't be out for a while that's similar to a streaming gaming service.  PlayStation already has such a thing.  These things have been around.  In fact, there have been companies that have failed doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an excellent test of your computer infrastructure.  Yeah.  So if you think about...  I mean, and this is purely speculative, but if I think about the challenges required in  bringing gaming to the edge, there's a couple things that work.  One, it's an advertisement for your existing platform.  Two, you're going to have to understand changes in networking like 5G.  Three, you're going to be pushed into things like AR and VR that we haven't really...  We don't know where that's going.  Gamers are often on the front end of services and content, right?  Not all of them will expand beyond gaming.  Right.  And so understanding that market in a lot of ways with Amazon Web Services, for example,  the ability it had to understand what people were building on its platform and the things  they needed, and then being able to release services on top of that that met those needs  based on the data they had is what made AWS such a behemoth.  If Google can provide the type of...  And gaming is such a high-demand edge service.  If Google can understand that workload and build products that make that awesome,  they might have an advantage as more computing goes out to the edge and becomes higher,  like demands more capacity, lower latency, et cetera.  That's just a speculation.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, all we can do at this point is speculate.  There is money in gaming.  Google is so hard to understand what Google's overarching strategy is in any of this stuff.  As we learned, Google Plus happened mostly because Vic Gundotra championed it so long  and hard that everybody just got tired of hearing from him and said,  all right, go ahead, go ahead, do Google Plus.  And the minute he left, it died.  So maybe this is that.  Maybe there's just some guy in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this a YouTube hedge?  Is it...  Maybe.  I always forget the name of the service.  Twitch.  Twitch.  Twitch. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon owns it, but I'm pretty sure Google tried to get it.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's another thing people do and spend time on.  There's a lot of money in it.  There's money in it.  There's this whole notion of spectator electronic sports.  E-sports, yeah.  We're going to talk later about Amazon and the Yes Network, I would imagine.  Yes, we can do it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon has put a bid in to buy the Yankees television network.  This is something...  Along with the Yankees and others.  But this is something that Alex Lindsay predicted a couple of weeks ago on Macbeth.  A couple of weeks ago on Macbreak Weekly said, watch.  In the next few years, most of the big sports franchises are up for renegotiation.  And he says the network television is going to lose it.  Because they're going to get the big players, Netflix, Amazon.  I don't know if Twitter is big enough to play in that field or not.  But these big players from tech are going to swoop in and offer money that the television networks just can't compete with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is another reason Rupert Murdoch will yell about the tech companies because he has a lot of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball, they're all going to move online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good, because right now cable and television, you can't get it.  And then there's all these stupid no rebroadcasting rules.  Wait, Leo, you were going to do an ad a while back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Do you want me to do that now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was like, I don't know what your sense of timing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right before you do, right before you do, Stacey, the book title is The Great A&P and the Struggle for Small Business in America by Mark Levinson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark Levinson. I love it.  Oh, he's good. I like Mark Levinson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an excellent book. It's just really fascinating.  And the parallels to our time now about fear of big giant companies is quite wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of get nostalgic when you say A&P. That's where we shopped when I was a kid at the A&P.  May it rest in peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's gone, huh?  It's gone. It's dead.  It was the largest company in the world.  Was it?  Really?  The largest retailer. It was a retailer. Retailer in the world.  That's kind of crazy.  It was 16,000 stores.  Wow.  Its explosive growth made a mortal threat to mom and pop grocery stores across the nation.  Main Street fought back, leading the Hoover, Roosevelt, and Truman administrations to investigate the great A&P.  Because Senator Warren, I mean President Hoover, said it's just too big.  The governor repressed criminal charges against the company for selling food too cheaply and won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pro-consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that does sound like a lot of parallels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't it? It's really, and it's a well-told tale here. It's really quite a good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you haven't backed up your Aloe chats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of mine say test. Did you get this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have one chat on Aloe and it's with Jeff Jarvis the day Aloe launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. And that's it. No, I think it was at an airport.  They're turning off the servers. So you might as well just delete it from your phone.  And if you haven't backed up your chats, if you have anything, I don't know, on there.  I am so baffled by what Google's doing. I just don't understand.  And meanwhile, Microsoft is now beta testing a feature on Microsoft Windows that lets you put your Android app on your computer screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I already have. Oh, I have that through Chrome in the messaging.  Yeah, it's like that. So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Windows is going to let you do messaging from your Android, I guess, and other apps, any other app you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Skype ever going to come back to my Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was another thing. Microsoft pulled the plug on Linux and Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was using it. Well, not Linux, also Chrome. And I was using it fine. And then suddenly, bump, gone.  Anti-trust. Go after them. Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break. Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait, I had a question related to this. Yes.  Before we go and break, I'm very curious of other people. I am having a hard time on my Google messages, getting messages from people with iPhones.  So I get the texts out of order and now I'm not getting photos. My wife has had this problem.  Okay, I was just curious if other people had this because it feels really aggravating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only her. Only some of her messages don't come through.  What carrier is she on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's on AT&T. And I'm on AT&T.  The sending carrier is relevant. There have been a number of issues.  Sprint and then I think yesterday I read about, was it Verizon was having trouble?  You know, these are all handled through gateways, right? And their gateways were not sending messages in order or messages were being dropped.  That's usually carrier specific to the sending carrier is my guess. My experience has been.  It was good. I was reading an article on Headline News the other day about a guy who was redoing all of his servers.  He runs a bunch of servers. And I was really pleased. At first I thought he was running them out of his house.  And then I read, no, he's running them off Digital Ocean because Digital Ocean is so affordable.  He had Australian based. This is an ad, by the way. Yeah, thank you.  Sorry, I segued into that so innocuously. I probably didn't make it clear. Our sponsor today is Digital Ocean.  But I was just really impressed that he was running like a like a bunch of different stuff, public servers on Digital Ocean.  And that's how good it is. Digital Ocean is a place for you to create your cloud application affordably, quickly, easily,  whether you're running one virtual machine or 10,000 Digital Ocean as you covered with the flexibility to customize standard or even CPU optimized droplets.  You can. This is the thing I love about Digital Ocean. Sometimes I think people don't understand exactly what I'm talking about.  But the idea is, in fact, if I go to my Digital Ocean account, I'll show you how easy it is to create a server.  They call them droplets like droplets in the ocean, right? So I'm going to create a droplet right now.  Now, I use this because I am a hobbyist programmer. So I always like to have servers running so I can learn how to code and Node.js and things like that.  So you can start here you with distributions Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Fedora, Debian, CentOS.  There also is complete full support for containers like Docker and Kubernetes.  There's a marketplace as well of one what they call one button installs. These are all apps.  Let's say I don't know what should I say. OK, let's say I want to learn how to do Node.js.  That's actually something a lot of people want to do. And I could create a LAMP stack very easily or a complete Node.js installation running on Ubuntu 18.04.  I'm going to choose a plan. And you know, for when I first start up, I like to get the cheapest server.  That gives me a gigabyte of RAM, a CPU, 25 gigs of fast enterprise grade SSD storage, a terabyte a month of transfer.  So I'm going to set that in. I like to enable the backups. It's a buck a month.  What you know, I like to have it be backed up automatically. You don't have to.  You can add block storage if you're going to need more storage. I always start small because you can always add more later.  Choose your server. Look at them. New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Singapore, London, Frankfurt, Toronto, Bangalore.  Choose a server you want. You could turn on additional features like private networking, IPv6, user data monitoring.  I always turn on my SSH key, so it makes it easy for me to log in. Let's name this Leo's Node.  And now, basically, in the old days, you would call up a server company and say, I'd like to set up an Ubuntu server with a node on it.  Or maybe they wouldn't even install that. You'd have to do it all for yourself.  And they'd get back to you in a few days and say, yeah, it's provisioned.  Watch this. In less than a minute, I am going to set up provision and have a node server running that I can start programming on.  That's how fast and easy it is.  Notice my bill up here for my Django instance that I've been running last month. $2.41.  You can use Kubernetes if you want to improve availability, scalability, and resource efficiency using containers.  The one-click apps like I just did are amazing. Django, Docker, GitLab, Lamp, MySQL, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, on and on and on.  They just introduced managed databases for Postgres, which is awesome.  You can launch your database with the push of a button. DO handles the maintenance and the updates.  Free daily backups with point-in-time recovery, standby nodes with automatic failover, and security.  And the tutorials on here are fantastic.  Oh, by the way, did you see my node server is up and running?  In fact, just to prove it, it's got a public IP address.  Let me just log in. I can access the console and log in. I can SSH in right now to my server.  It's booting up and it'll be ready to run.  This is awesome for somebody who has an idea for an app, for instance, and wants to build quickly, build a minimum viable product.  Somebody who wants to learn, as I do, how to use these technologies.  This is fantastic. I am just so excited about DigitalOcean.  And boy, the pricing is right. You can know what you'll pay monthly with a simple flat pricing structure.  Access the compute resources you need at the lowest rates, saving up to 55% compared to other cloud providers.  And oh, by the way, four nines uptime. You get an SLA for 99.99% uptime.  They've got cloud firewalls, full DNS management. Those data centers are all over the world.  There's one near you, free round-the-clock tech support.  This is truly awesome.  150,000 businesses, including some of the world's fastest growing startups, rely on DigitalOcean to remove infrastructure friction and deliver industry-leading price performance.  It's a revolution, frankly.  We've come so far since my buddy Kevin Rose set up Dig by buying a server and huffing it over to a colo where he had everything.  Yeah, you want to set up Ghost? Boom, boom, you go. Just push that button.  55 seconds later, it's up and running. Sign up today. You'll get a free $100 credit.  Now we're talking at do.co.twit. It's DigitalOcean. Do.co.twit for $100 credit.  DigitalOcean, trusted by businesses, loved by developers. It really is.  It's a revolution. It's hard to overstate how important this is to creating the next big thing.  I just love it. DigitalOcean. We thank them for their support.  Would you like to get a little change loggy on us here? Yeah. Play the trumpets.  The Google Change Log.  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We missed the trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am waiting on my Pixel 3 to be invited because Android Q is in beta, public beta.  You do have to, of course, as always in the past, sign up for the beta.  So the way you do it is enroll by going to google.com slash android beta, view your eligible devices.  They tell me there are a lot of eligible devices this time.  I've opted in for my Pixel 3 XL. Of course, all the Pixels will be opt-able.  So I'm just waiting because now that I've pushed that button, let me just see.  I'm going to go to the updates and see if, hey, maybe there's an update available.  And I can go to Android. Oh, oh, let's see. Check for update.  Do you do this a lot? I do this a lot. I'm all the time. I'm sitting here pressing that button.  Preparing system update.  Here comes the queue.  So I don't know what's in here. I don't care because it's the new operating system, right?  That's all we care about.  Google is releasing Android beta feedback app for reporting issues and feature requests at the same time.  So if you're if you're here, it is update size.  1.3 gigabytes download and install.  Should I do it? Oh, what the heck? What could possibly go wrong?  I would actually now that I'm doing that, I probably can't show you this, but it's pretty good news if you're using a Pixel phone.  And I think this is going to eventually go to all Android devices, maybe even iOS.  Do you ever use the Google keyboard G board, which is I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got it this morning and it's so fast. It's so awesome. OK, that's so dictation is now on device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No more network delays and it's supposed to be very fast. So tell me about it. You playing with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I just I use voice dictation all the time. Me too. And so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here, did you have to download something new or do you know, just an update to G board?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what are you on? OK, hold on. I'm on the Pixel 2.  It is an update to G board, but it does ask if you want to download this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's I think 85. Oh, because you have to download some software, some additional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to download the voice recognition modules and then you also have to allow G board access to your storage drive on your phone and some and your microphone.  Although I thought I'd already had access. Anyway, those were the two things I noticed happening.  But here I'm going to. Send you Leo.  Oh, Leo, I don't have your number or your phone.  This is me sending dictation almost instantaneously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's really quick and it's apparently more accurate, right?  It uses a built in end to end recognizer on device for it's only for American English on Pixel smartphones right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to lower my thing so you get the contrast. Wait, it's high contrast so you all can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the force, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is me dictating lots of things really fast to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, turn down the brightness is what you need to do, not the contrast.  Because it's so bright, it's blowing out the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, camera. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  End to end all neural on device and all neural on device.  Go ahead, show it. Yeah. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. Keep talking. I'm telling you everything I can think of right now.  And it's doing a pretty good job.  It used to take several minutes, not several minutes. It used to take at least a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would have to round trip to the server.  That is awesome. It's a real time. So you got a notification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How did that happen, Stacy? How did that happen?  You want to get it special. I'm so special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a notification. It sent me.  I. Where did it send it to me?  It is still listening. Hold on. Stop.  Where did it? I think I got a notification and it said,  Hey, would you like to speed up your voice recognition or something like that?  And I said, would I?  And then I read about it really quick and then I if you're one of these nerds,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I bet you are Stacy that loves reading geeky text about how this all works,  go to the Google A.I. blog because there's a really good discussion of  what the issues are and how they trained it and the kinds of training they did.  And this is really interesting.  Deep dive into it and how offline recognition is difficult and challenging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is awesome. Oh, yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're using in case you want to know parameter quantization  and hybrid kernel techniques made publicly available through the model  opposition toolkit in the TensorFlow Lite Library model quantization delivered  four times compression with respect to train floating point models  and a four X speed up at runtime, enabling our RNNT to run faster than real time speech in a single core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  80 megabytes. It was it was almost down to 80 megabytes. Yeah.  Yeah. It was actually I think 85, which is really tiny.  Tiny. So this actually makes sense, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it what is it type when you say y'all?  Why a possibly a LL or why a WL, which is what I'd type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, that's not how you pronounce it.  You'll hold on. Y'all need to spell this correctly.  Yep. Why a possibly a LL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Damn, that's good. All that and 80 megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sheesh. I remember my children way back when when at the San Francisco Xammer,  we had a CMS called Systems Integrators, Inc.  And we had. Did you guys call it SYNC for short?  No, we call it SII. Should have called it SYNC.  And they had a smart terminal.  Before that, all these things had been dumb terminals.  And so they had a smart terminal.  And the and the I remember the founder of the company lauding the absolute rock star programmer  who got hyphenation and justification onto the terminal.  And this was a huge. It really was a huge deal.  And now you think what you just did, Stacy, it's just I'm sorry.  I'm having my old Uncle Jeff moment. Yeah. But it's just amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, thanks to connectionist connectionist temporal classification,  we've been able to have the latency of the rock from recognized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, basically they they used a certain they used recurrent.  So the RNNT is recurrent neural network transducers.  And if you think about a recurrent neural network, you installed my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. Yeah. We're already in there.  That's why I like tech companies because they're already there and it doesn't hurt people.  It's OK. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It so instead. Do you really want to know this? I can break this down.  Yeah, break it down. Stace.  So an RNNT, a recurrent neural network transducer,  instead of getting the whole input and then doing an output, it's doing it continuously.  So that's the first part. That's really cool. Right.  So instead of waiting for like a segment of text, that's why it looks like it's typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like it's going a letter at a time. It's really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. Yeah. And when they talk about things like parameter quantization and hybrid kernel techniques,  just ignore that they're shrinking.  They're I mean, I mean, that's basically that's how they're shrinking it.  The bottom line is this can do it continuously all the time, but it took 450 megabytes to do that.  And they were like, nope, we got to make it smaller.  So they use those techniques to make it smaller.  And then you and they use the TensorFlow Lite library to do that.  And now it's super fast, continuous and it's super small.  So it fits on your phone. How is that neat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As we continue with the changelog, Lookout, which has been around for a while, has been kind of revamped.  It's also AI to help people who are blind or have low vision identify their surroundings.  This is so great. It even shows the edges with haptic feedback by holding or wearing your device.  We recommend hanging your Pixel phone from a lanyard around your neck or placing it in a shirt front pocket.  Lookout tells you about people, text, objects and much more as you move through a space.  Once you've opened the Lookout app, all you have to do is keep your phone pointed forward.  No more buttons to tap within the app.  You just focus on what you're doing and it'll say that's a dog.  Screenshot image of Lookouts most including explore shopping, quick read.  Here it is detecting a dog.  Really cool. Really cool.  If you're blind and you know somebody's blind, you might want to get them set up with a Pixel.  Break them up because they're all evil. They never do anything good for people.  Yeah.  Okay. Okay. Hold up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's like saying someone who abuses their family is a decent person because he once gave a homeless guy a cheeseburger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not.  It's like saying is that size can be a problem.  It's like saying is that size can yield the benefits to do things like this like AT&T Labs back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not.  It's like saying is that size can yield the benefits to do things like this like AT&T Labs back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And incidentally, Google is not the monolipistic monopony that some of you thought it to be.  For example, in Chrome 73, which is rolling out right now, you can change your search engine to DuckDuckGo.  Take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Take that.  Take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet five people will do it.  Next, Google is going to give a cheeseburger to a homeless guy.  There's other features in this.  This is the.  It took me a minute.  Yeah.  What's it?  What?  Chrome 73 is also updated for Mac, Windows and Linux.  This is the Android version.  Some redesigning and the downloads experience and the manager, the Omnibar link shortcuts and light pages.  Anyway, new brand new.  There's a brand new Chrome in town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I talked to a Microsoft executive recently and was asking about the results of the European breakup regulation and all that for the past.  To this day, Microsoft has to offer a Windows version with no browser.  It's Windows N.  And I said, how many do you sell?  He said, maybe 100 or 200 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, just what everybody's looking for.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, you turned back orange.  Were you watching this whole time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I fix it every once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's warmed up.  You're warm.  Oh, yeah, it's the magic hour in.  Yeah, Brandywine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should be having a glass of wine in front of me right now.  But I get a glass of wine.  Don't stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll join you.  Jeff, you just.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's too early for you.  Stays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google.  It's five twenty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The sun's over the yard arm somewhere, as my grandfather was wanted to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what my father says every time.  Yeah.  Sun's gone over the yard arm.  My father says it's toony time.  Toony for martoonies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Martini.  Everybody should have a martoonie.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's my father from West Virginia.  He says things like that.  I love it.  That's folksy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  He's more fun than a one armed paper hanger in a room full of rocking chairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what the kind of things pop up to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome extension from Google helps you filter toxic comments.  Unfortunately, not from this show, but from Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Discuss.  It's called Toon.  It's a tune extension and it lets you control what comments I have to say.  I have been in a number of sites.  What was I reading an article?  I mean, it was a variety when every single comment on the article was spam.  I mean, it was like they had just given up.  Yeah, I've given up on the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I shouldn't say this out loud, but on Buzz Machine, there's not been anything there decent for a long time.  Just turn them off.  Every month or so I go in.  Yeah, I should just turn them off.  Every month or so I go in and I kill like it catches up pretty quickly.  So it's maybe 10 spams are in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this doesn't do spam, but it lets you control, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Jigsaw, which is the kind of quality media and public discourse division of Google that does neat things with media companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's kind of an odd interface.  You can set the volume on the comments you see.  Keep it quiet.  Keep it loud.  Keep it blaring.  Turn it up to 11.  Turn it up to 11.  This is built on the machine learning models that power perspective.  I don't know what perspective is perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's something that's been offered to media companies and others to try to fix their comments to to to to I think it's the right thing.  They this whole effort gives moderators tools so that it will automatically kill things.  The moderators can just check it.  And the moderators have a sliding bar as to where they want to go on things.  It's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this does the same thing, but only on your machine.  Yeah.  On your Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I had a conversation today with a former government regulator who was talking about she's she's in Baku about to moderate a panel.  And what do you do about this information?  We do it in separation.  I just said you will never get rid of it.  You got to stop that notion of of whack a mole with the world with nasty things and wrong things.  And we've got to change the fertile ground in which they they plant their seeds.  But we're going to have bad stuff.  And so having more tools like this out there that help you control your experience will mean there'll be less panic about it.  And that's a fine thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm not sure I want to demonstrate this because I'd have to go to a bad website.  And if it didn't work, it would be a bad thing.  But I've installed it on my Chrome.  I don't use Chrome.  Sign in with Google and click the tune extension.  OK, so sign in with Google.  OK, click the tune extension icon to get started.  OK, no personal data is stored.  Well, that's a relief.  OK, so I guess I control for comments and you should I go to Twitter and I don't know what I'm going to do.  Twitter already shields you from stuff.  It works on Twitter.  Should I go somewhere like a really bad should go somewhere really bad on Reddit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or yeah, reddits probably are a good toxic place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go to like OK, I'm going to go to a good toxic place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just trying to think of a good Reddit place where you're going to get some.  So the first thing you do, what do you want?  What do you want to tune?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm going to tune Reddit.  OK, actually all of them, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Discuss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But just go to YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could show this, Carson.  I'm not doing anything bad.  And OK, so I've selected which sites done.  OK, now set the volume.  I don't really understand what that means on the comments.  Do you want loud medium?  Oh, look, so look at the comments on the right.  As I turn down the volume, it's starting to shrink.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They're all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man, I turned it way down.  Silence.  So these are the sounds of silence.  I don't I don't know what it's taken out.  So here's a here's a comment.  Genius says the Redneck marketing team.  If I turn it down, that disappears.  Turn it up.  Such comments as.  You can fit so many inbred cousins in this bad boy.  Before I go on, you should probably see what they're talking about, because it's not as bad as you think.  It's a limousine, which is just a bunch of pickup trucks welded together.  It's a weird way to stretch.  So understand, I realize now in a vacuum, those comments might have seemed lewd, but they're in fact just talking about that and then turning it up.  Well, this does do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So words like Redneck probably.  Yeah, probably Redneck triggered it.  Yeah, that's the problem with these automated things.  It can't possibly deal with nuance, even though nuance is an odd word to break into that discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and even what is what is loud medium blaring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I guess that means that tones down the commentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It turns the comments.  All right.  It works.  It definitely does it.  There you go.  And by the way, this is a very fun subreddit that I've just discovered.  DIY spelled W H Y.  And it's just a bunch of stuff people have done that really they shouldn't have like turning this piano into a desk.  You know, here's a here's a life hack.  Instead of packaging your expensive lenses, just throwing them in a box and letting them rattle around.  The life hack is fill it up with popcorn and then and then throw the lens in.  But the best part of this is the comments like, well, I think you need more butter on that popcorn and things, things like that.  So this is actually I don't know, Carson, you follow DIY.  It's a high.  Carson and I seem to.  Here's a good one.  This is this is they're taking hot dogs and they're going to build what looks like a Lego Lego log.  Lincoln Logs Lincoln Logs.  Lincoln Log Cabin structure out of hot dogs is basically you've seen this before.  Carson, of course, you're familiar with this.  They do this in Harvard.  Oh, yes.  But the funniest thing is this this whole this whole subreddit mocks what has become a huge industry on YouTube, which is the how to, you know, video.  And now they're now they're cooking the cook it.  Oh, well, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see no Lincoln Log hot dog Buckingham Palace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is such a thing, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If there's not, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is a great I really enjoy this.  He made boxers out of towels.  I don't you know, it's just wait a minute.  Is it too cold to dive in?  So here's what you do.  You take a black trash bag, cut a fun noodle to hold it onto a hula hoop.  Then instead of black, observe sunlight and let's the pool heat.  And then it's nice and that's pretty cool.  That is OK.  Some of these are quite long.  And when you get to the end, you go back to the cat.  OK, how to make a briefcase bed for a cat.  Everybody needs to know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this is a is he going to close the case on the cat?  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are mean.  They're just like, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, Stacey, you become too cynical now.  So he's got an old briefcase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So basically what's about to happen here is an eight minute video where he  basically just takes this briefcase apart and puts foam in it and makes it a cat  bed.  And at the end of it, you go, OK, why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And why?  Because you you've saved that briefcase from the landfill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not the perfect cat bed, though.  Oh, look, you're putting he's putting wheels on it.  I'm seeing this as a stand.  Maybe the cat really likes sitting in briefcases.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe this is a cat that has, as many cats do, a predilection for sitting in luggage.  You just you could just now you can satisfy your cats.  This YouTube is full of crap like this, you know, you complain about the other world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  falling apart.  There's no harm in it.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now he's printing cat imagery to make the cat happy.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is somebody who needs a job.  Well, he's got a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a YouTuber.  Just likes doings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, like, haven't you ever made like a silly, stupid project?  No, that's what this anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I made a portable podcasting studio out of the Ikea box and some little things.  I mean, you don't look at that.  I think the things that are inside the Ikea box and think I've made something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is so sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  They're really this guy's not stopping.  He's not bedazzling it.  Where's the cat?  Wait, we got to wait.  Unfortunately, now we have to see the whole thing because the cats not going to bother.  The cat actually goes in this thing.  Oh, he's put a bell in because the cat likes to play with the bell.  Oh, look at that.  Aren't you glad you have that in your house?  Oh, and the cat loves it.  Cat loves it.  OK, I'm going to run home and make that.  Anyway, turn the comments down on that.  Maybe.  I don't know.  That's something you can do with tune.  Let's let's continue on the Google change log.  I have in my in my Twitter feed today is this the show began.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you all talk about Google related topics?  This is getting a bit out of hand.  That's what I just did.  I had a whole segment.  This is all Google.  Your mission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gum shoe.  Catch Carmen Sandiego in Google Earth.  Where in the world is common San Diego to celebrate the global exploring of all of us.  Google is introducing the Crown Jewels caper.  This is the first in a series of Carmen Sandiego games in Google Earth.  They did it with Hoot and Mifflin Harcourt.  We're going to be talking about the crown jewels caper.  This is the first in a series of Carmen Sandiego games in Google Earth.  They did it with Hoot and Mifflin Harcourt.  We're going to be talking about the crown jewels caper.  They did it with Hoot and Mifflin Harcourt, which is where Carmen Sandiego.  Let's try it.  Should we go search for Carmen Sandiego in Google Earth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to find Waldo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't they have Waldo in Google Maps at one point?  I feel like they did.  I think so.  Yeah.  I think Google Earth has decided to download the entire Earth.  So we'll just let that continue on and say that concludes Google Change.  Gosh, there's a lot of stuff I shouldn't mention.  Patrick Delahanty, our engineer who has a wonderful child named Kayden,  as often happens with the younger set.  The babies make friends with other babies and the parents get together.  Apparently, one of Kayden's friends has said his first word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everyone do the naughty thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Google, play the baddie song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Leo's first word was Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She should get like, Google should definitely send that baby something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She should get a major scholarship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I first saw this story, I thought, well, every baby's first word is good.  But I think she very clearly, when daddy said, hey, she said Google.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Alexa is too hard for a baby to say.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that is yeah, you can't say.  Yeah.  Twice I've activated my phone.  So that is that is a very important story.  And I'm glad we got to that.  Let's just before we wrap it up, sir, anything?  Excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got to go, you know, pace some my kids heads on on the water polo players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a wild story.  OK, OK.  That is a wild story.  There's no Google angle.  There's no tech angle, really, except that the Department of Justice has actually indicted  50 parents for bribing administrators, coaches and others to let their kids into college,  including a couple of well-known actors.  And then David Mamet, who's friends with Felicity Huffman and her husband, William H.  Macy writes a letter in support saying everybody does it.  Oh, no, I don't think so.  He's he's saying like, OK.  Jared got into Harvard after it just was a coincidence that his father gave Harvard a  million plus bucks and then Jared gets into Harvard.  But it's a down and Jared's SAT test for.  Well, but yeah.  So that's one thing.  And that's happened for years.  But I've read a number of people in admissions department saying, no, look, if somebody calls  us up and says, I really want my son to go to Harvard, I went to Harvard, he's a legacy.  And how much is it going to cost me?  I'll endow the library, whatever they say.  No, we just we send it over to the development group, which, by the way, development is academic  speak for fundraising.  And so we send it over to development and development knows the words to say, which  is, well, we would love that gift.  But of course, we can't guarantee placement at Harvard only if your child is worthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you can show a picture of the water polo team your child's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, apparently these kids, these actually the kids had nothing to do with these parents  were so anxious to get their kids into big fancy schools that they were bribing.  And yeah, that's what Felicity Huffman did.  She paid $15,000 to this key charity to make sure that a proctor would allow or fixed any  bad questions in the SAT exam, giving her a very high score.  But that's not that's neither here nor there.  No, it's not. But it's amazing.  We know Jeff, we know he loves that kind of story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was for relief to not be in the political story for once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was never tempted to bribe anybody to get my kids into college.  God, no.  But you don't want them to go and have a bad experience if they're not ready for it.  Right.  You have to trust that the school is going to admit somebody.  Now, admittedly, sometimes schools make mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it says more about the parents.  It says more about the pressure we're putting our children.  A lot of pressure. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And sometimes life, you know, sometimes life just makes mistakes and you have to roll with it.  It's the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what's the lesson you're teaching kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly, well, that is a lesson that they've learned already throughout their lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that I'm privileged to wait and I can get what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they probably already know that lesson.  All right.  Let's take a break and do our picks of the week and we can send you all home and I can get on a big old jet airliner.  Seven thirty seven Max headed for Los Angeles.  What could possibly go wrong?  Our show today brought to you by WordPress.  If you want to know what's going on with with Leo in the world, you don't go to Facebook.  You don't go to Instagram.  You don't go to Twitter.  You go to my blog because that's my home on the net.  And I would submit that even if you are all over Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, even if you're a business.  And of course, you have to have pages on all those sites.  You still should have that one site that's your website, your domain with your name, the place where you're going to be.  The place where your stuff links to the place where your best stuff shows.  If you're a restaurant, that's where your menu is.  The reservation system.  If you're a plumber, that's where you talk about your services, your fees.  And maybe even you post an article on to on there about how to fix a toilet or a leaky faucet.  It's it's a place where you can put yourself out there on the net.  And I am still maybe it's old fashioned.  Maybe I'm still a firm believer that that's the best possible thing you can do.  You want your name, your site to show up when people Google you.  I tell teenagers all the time, get yourself a website, start putting your best stuff up there and the best place to do it.  Wordpress.com.  It's easy.  You don't have to be a geek.  You don't have to be an HTML wizard.  They've got everything you need.  Powerful site building tools, thousands of themes.  So you can make it look exactly like you want.  And if you ever have a question, the support people at Wordpress.com are actual WordPress experts.  So they have answers at their fingertips and they're there 24 7.  Wordpress.com.  Let's anyone pursue whatever it is they love by launching a site that's free to start with room to grow.  It was really created back in the day by by Matt Mullin, Wigan, his team so that anyone could publish their ideas.  It was all about tearing down the gatekeepers.  There's no two week trials.  There's no hidden fees.  And you own your content forever.  You can upload pictures, video, audio, text and download it too, because it's never stuck there.  It's built to grow with you wherever you want to be.  And I love Wordpress.com because I don't have to worry about maintaining it, running it, updating it.  They do it all for you.  All you have to think about is the content.  Some of the biggest companies in the world use WordPress.  Stacey told us Fortune.com uses WordPress.  I know Quartz uses WordPress.  WordPress is amazing.  In fact, WordPress is so good.  Thirty three percent of the Internet runs on WordPress.  Here we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web.  Well, you got to mention Matt Mullin, Wigan, WordPress, because one third of the Web runs on WordPress.  Go to WordPress.com slash twig and create your new site.  It's so much fun.  You're going to love it.  It's for a special event, a project or your lifetime achievements.  I'm at Leo Laporte dot com.  What it where is what's your WordPress site?  Go to WordPress dot com slash twig.  And by the way, if you go there, you'll get 15 percent off any new plan purchase.  Fifteen percent off at WordPress dot com slash twig.  Uh, how about a pick of the week from Stacey Higginbotham?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I actually was going to do the Google download.  Since we talked about it in the changelog, I switched it to the latest book that I'm reading, which is awesome.  It is called Billion Dollar Whale, the man who fooled Wall Street, Hollywood and the world.  This is about the one M.D.B. scandal.  This is the Malaysian banking scandal where this con man basically went in and stole the one point two billion.  Oh, no, they're saying over five billion.  Wow.  From this bank in Malaysia.  And then it was covered up by the prime minister and various officials at Malaysian and state agencies.  The book involves the scandal.  It involves how the hat, the con man who did this had parties with like famous people like Britney Spears.  It is well written.  Oh, it is true.  And it is awesome.  Awesome.  Very good.  Say the name again.  I really recommend it.  What did you say?  It is. Oh, it's Billion Dollar Whale, the man who fooled Wall Street, Hollywood and the world.  And it was written by two Tom Wright, who is a Wall Street, two John, two Wall Street Journal reporters.  Awesome.  Yeah, it's really good.  You like I think it should be a movie.  Maybe it is already a movie.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That should be a good movie, doesn't it?  And no whales were harmed in the writing of this book.  No whales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was a whale in casino terms only.  Only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have a number, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a few.  One is that yesterday, Howard Stern announced his new book, Howard Stern Comes Again.  Oh, Lord.  And it was already immediately number one bestseller on Amazon.  Oh, my goodness.  I called it to the show today.  It was amazing.  And if you went yesterday and searched for Howard Stern on Amazon, you couldn't find it.  It was hard to find.  Nonetheless, it still went up there immediately.  And he's got a rewriting about his transition to being a great interviewer.  And I can't wait.  It's his first book in 20 years.  Quite a while.  And it's the first one he's promoted without a terrestrial radio station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it just shows you his satellite voice is still pretty darn large.  Phenomenal, phenomenal.  So it wasn't a mistake for him to go to satellite.  No, it was not.  Not at all.  Certainly not to his private fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I looked up, I couldn't figure out where I had bought the A&P book.  But these are numbers that I think we'll find interesting.  Again, this is from the great A&P of 1926.  Oh, it's on hold already.  It needs to be in my library.  Oh, good.  So I just put a couple of numbers here, which are fascinating.  In 1926, Kansas City had 30 food markets per square mile.  Right?  Which is phenomenal.  There was one food market for every 51 American families.  That's how inefficient we were.  In the average working class family in the 1920s, devoted one-third of its budget to groceries.  The average farm family, even more.  Most households spent more to put dinner on the table than rent or their mortgage.  And for the average, pardon me for this, housewife shopping for food consumed a large part of the day.  So A&P came in and changed that and made food cheaper and more accessible.  And they got in big trouble for it.  Sounds familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. What was the harm after all?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, all those bomb and pop groceries that had to find new...  True that.  I mean, there is an actual harm.  I'm not saying it's legitimate to stop that.  I'm just like, but that is an actual harm.  All right. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll give it to you.  I'm going to recommend, even though Audible no longer advertises on our network.  I don't care.  I love them still.  And I just listened to this Audible original.  I just liked it so much.  One of the things Audible started doing is these originals.  And they actually commissioned a play.  It was a live reading recorded from Billy Crystal at the Minetta Lane Theater in Greenwich Village.  And as far as I know, the only way you could hear it is on Audible.  I listened to it.  It's amazing.  Kevin Klein stars as the president of the United States who's having actually a terrible day.  And that Benning is his wife, the first lady.  Billy Crystal is...  I don't want to tell you.  You'll find out.  He's funny in it.  It's very funny, but it's actually very poignant.  I didn't know Billy Crystal was a good writer, but it's an incredibly well-written little play.  And it's an hour and 46 minutes, so it's easy to listen to.  I quite enjoyed it.  Have a nice day.  This is not the first time Audible's done a play on their originals.  And I just, I think it's kind of...  It shows you the radio theater really could have made it if you had great writers and great actors.  Because a lot of times when you hear radio, old-time radio, the acting is so broad and the writing is so terrible,  you think, well, this is not a good medium for theater.  But then you hear something like this or Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and you realize, actually, audio is an amazing medium for theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, have you heard like the BBC, every year BBC does a Neil Gaiman book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, amazing.  I mean, those are awesome.  I want to hear more of this.  And I know that some podcasters are kind of venturing into it like Homecoming from Gimlet.  But wow, is this one good?  Billy Crystal co-wrote it with Quentin Peoples.  And it's just, it's really good.  There's sound effects in it.  They do it.  It's done live, which is amazing.  And these actors are so good.  They're really great actors.  It's just fantastic.  So if you have an Audible credit line around or you're an Audible subscriber and you get the originals,  it's a free original this month.  I think it's still free this month.  Have a nice day with Billy Crystal.  And that, my friends, concludes this nice day with Stacey Higginbotham.  I didn't even get to give you a credit.  Let me give you your plug.  She has a fabulous podcast, Stacey, the IoT podcast with Stacey and Kevin Tofel.  She's on the web at staceyoniot.com.
