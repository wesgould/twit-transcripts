He's at that point in his vacation where like the end is near and you're like trying to  like squeeze every last inch of whatever out of your awesome vacation. But you know it's time.  It's time to return to reality. Anyways, I've had a lot of fun sitting in for him, so I'm happy to  be here one more time. Joining us this week, we do not have Stacey, but we do have Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How's it going, Jeff? And I'm not in a hotel somewhere with horrid Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I guess we kind of had you last week for maybe two minutes, I think about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The weird thing is everybody else thinks you're you look like dead and miserable and you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know it. Right. Yeah, I mean, it was it was it was pretty choppy. At a point, it was just like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, this just isn't gonna work. It looks like the worst I've ever had because you guys were just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  forget it. Just forget it. We're done. We're moving on. Well, we're happy to have you on such  a pristine connection today and joining us once again, and Pruitt and I'm a huge fan of your work  and it's great to get you back on tech republic dot com. CBS interactive dot com sounds like your

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  your work is broadening at CBS interactive. Yeah, it is. Thanks for having me on. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  always a pleasure to be here. We're talking always good to have you. Yeah, we were talking  a little bit about the about things catching up before the show and realized you were more or  less you were in the path of the hurricane that just passed through North Carolina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that was pretty crazy. Now, granted, where I live is about 200 miles inland, but that storm  was massive and it just sat there. You know, I believe at one point they said it was moving  about two miles per hour. Yes. And it just sat there. My friends in Raleigh, they took a beating,  but by the time it got here to the Charlotte area, it was mostly rain. So it wasn't that much wind.  It was enough wind to knock down a few flimsy trees, but it was a lot of rain, lots and lots  of rain. The poor dogs around here, they didn't know what to think. Yeah, no kidding. No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instead of going for a run, they go for a swim, I suppose. Pretty much. Yeah. Well,  and then it sounds like your neighborhood is okay. But like, but beyond that, like you're kind of  stuck in your neighborhood. So it's a good thing you know your neighbors and your own community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's nice. I have a decent surround near me anyway. So I'm fine staying right here in my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  own yard. Yeah, right on. Well, we're happy you're okay and safe. And yeah, and it's great to get you  on. I mean, related to this, we might as well mention it. It's a real quick hit, but Google  apparently is matching up to $1 million in Hurricane Florence relief. Apparently, you can  donate to the American Red Cross and 100% of that donation is going to go to the charity.  A million dollars in Google money is a drop of the bucket, but still that helps, obviously.  So if you're going to give, you might as well give through that and get it matched.  So let's see here. Where do we even begin? Do we begin with Larry Page? The curious case of-  Was that? That's a little old, isn't it? I don't know. Is it? I don't know. I mean,  this has kind of been, it's kind of been an interesting scenario, right? Larry Page used  to be the face of the company. We have hardly heard anything from this guy. Meanwhile, the company is,  I don't know, more under the microscope now than it ever has been, yet he is mostly out of public  view, hasn't really been in public view since 2013 as relates to product launches or earnings calls,  2015 as related to any sort of press period. Like you just don't see from this dude anymore.  We haven't seen him for years. Apparently he spends all his time on his Caribbean  Island, which I didn't realize he has a Caribbean Island, but he does. Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But he has the power to be in that position and not be at these different meetings and things  like that. That's why he hired the people he hired because he trusts in their abilities.  And I mean, Mr. Pachar is a sharp cat, you know, so he doesn't necessarily have to jump on all of  these things and grandstand and whatnot. That's why he spent the bucks to hire those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pete Slauson I want to move on to Google Island with Larry. Remember, that was one of his last  major huge IO appearances was talking about having an island. So I want to move on. Larry,  come on, invite us in. Larry Pate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what he's doing. That's what he's spending all his time on. He's creating his Google Island.  Pete Slauson Someday, maybe, you know, I think what we're leading up to is somewhere down the  line, I don't know if it's two years, five years, seven years or whatever, the Made by Google event,  much like Apple's event is now made at its new spaceship campus, the Made by Google event will be  held at the Caribbean Island, the Google Island, whatever that ends up being down the line.  Larry Pate And nothing to get done.  Pete Slauson I would love to get an invite for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Larry Pate And I will go there and I will defect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson Dang, I forgot to move back home.  Larry Pate Yeah.  Pete Slauson Isn't that a bummer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Larry Pate I was with a Googler today by chance just having coffee and I said, oh,  Pixel 3 next week. And I said, you are a fan boy, aren't you? I said, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson Heck, yeah. So, you've been following,  we're talking about Made by Google, so we might as well just jump right into that. I'm sure you've  been following, Jeff, because this is probably your next phone, right? The 3 or the 3 XL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Well, you know, I found it really interesting  with the Apple announcement. Who was it? BuzzFeed's review said, it's fine, but you really no rush to  upgrade, really nothing much. And I could imagine, I'm trying to, you know, every time it happens,  I'm a chump like Leo, I'll jump and buy it. At least I don't have to buy 20 brands like he has to  buy. But I don't know, it depends on whether the Pixelbook, presumably we have that, is magnificent.  I'm not sure, I'm going to try to avoid buying both this time. I'll see if I succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson I don't know, you could be buying multiple  things. It sounds to me like there's going to be a whole lot of different types of devices there.  Obviously, the couple of Pixelbooks, we talked about that a couple of weeks ago, I think you were  off on that episode. But yes, the Pixelbook lineup that I think there's going to be either  two or three that are rumored to appear, the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL, which we see some  new renders that have appeared in the last couple of days, this time with Google's kind of fabric  casing on the back, which I think they had a fabric casing a couple of years ago.  Jeff Bezos Which I like, by the way.  Pete Slauson I like it too.  Jeff Bezos It's a nice case, so I hope they do it again. It'd be nice.  Pete Slauson So we're seeing more and more of these things.  This is just the most leaked device in the history of the world.  Jeff Bezos It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pete Slauson Just planning that ever so slightly. Make sure we leak a video or leak an image out  on Tuesday. Now we'll do another one on Friday night when we think everybody's out partying  and whatnot. They know what they're doing. It's marketing 101.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos The colors though. The mint phone looks like a praying man has pooped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson It actually reminds me of the Nextbit. Do you remember the Nextbit, Robin?  Jeff Bezos Yeah.  Pete Slauson It kind of had a little bit of that color to it.  Jeff Bezos That color.  Pete Slauson But yeah, mint, white, black, and then hidden in the source code somewhere on that  webpage, somebody found a fourth reference to a pink color. So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Why would the color of the hardware be in source code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson This is a great question. I mean, basically what this is tied to is some sort of  a promotional page to drum up kind of interest and anticipation around the upcoming announcement.  And when you go to the page, it kind of has an outline of a phone and the back color of the  page, the background is either this mint color or black with a two tone that matches the back  of a pixel device. And for whatever reason, hidden in the source code of the page, there is  a fourth color that was- Jeff Bezos Oh, so it's not the phone,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's the source code of the page. Pete Slauson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of the page, but it references this fourth pink color. And if the other colors were actual colors  of the phone, then one could argue, oh, well, maybe this is the fourth color of the phone.  Maybe they're going to have their rose gold or their pink or whatever you want to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Or somebody had a bet. Can we get this week  in Google to talk about the green phone? Pete Slauson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Yes. How much of this stuff is being planted? How much are we playing?  Jeff Bezos We've got it on TechCrunch.  I tell you what I'm not likely to buy. Go ahead.  Pete Slauson What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos No, go ahead Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos What I'm not going to buy, I don't think,  is the Google smart speaker since I think I've used mine like twice on the show only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson So which one are you talking about? You're  talking about the Google Home? Jeff Bezos

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have the Google Home thing with the speaker, I mean the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson Oh, the one with the screen. So you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos The Home Hub thing. Yeah, I'm not enthralled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson Not really into it. I mean, I couldn't use  it because my kids would get fixated on the YouTube aspect. Have you used any of these devices,  the ones with the screen app? Jeff Bezos

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't want any part of them. I don't own the Home Max or any of that stuff. I never really  wanted any of those devices in my house. I'm connected enough with my cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson Yeah, fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos So I just never really had the need for it.  And plus, I like my audio to sound good. So if I'm going to spend 300 bucks on something  that's audio related, it better really sound good and not just necessarily be something  to put in my living room. Pete Slauson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the Max sounds pretty good. But I mean, it is pretty expensive.  Jeff Bezos It's kind of big and ugly.  Pete Slauson It is a little big. Yeah, and it's pretty ugly too. Well, apparently,  Google Home Hub is a device that we might see on the October 9th event. And this would be Google's  own branded version of a Google Home with a screen, a seven inch screen in this case.  And actually, the back of it, if you click on the other image in that carousel that shows  the back, it really does kind of look a lot like the Google Home Max from the fabric and kind of  rounded curvy aspect of it. But yeah, so I think it makes perfect sense that Google would want to  have their own of these. It's interesting that they let third parties release them before Google  got around to releasing its own. They let the third parties kind of scoop them by half a year,  basically. Jeff Bezos

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only thing that bothers me about next week is the pricing. I'm not sure what the pricing is  going to be, but I just can't grasp the fact that we're paying $1,000 for a dad gum cell phone again.  Pete Slauson Yeah, yep.  Jeff Bezos It just boggles the mind. If I'm not able to run  Premiere Pro on it or something like that, why am I having to spend that much cash on a smaller  computer? Laptops are cheaper than that and laptops can run Premiere Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson Laptops can fit in your pockets.  Jeff Bezos Right, there's a certain value. I'm not saying that $1,000 is the right price for a phone,  but they are priced differently, for better or for worse. It's not the same, but yet we're…  Yeah, I don't know how to explain it, but it is very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My justification, Ant, is that it's the single device I use more than anything else.  Pete Slauson Yeah, right.  Jeff Bezos And that's part of your complaint too.  I know I'm justifying to me and my wife that I'm spending $1,000 on a phone. My wife who's kept the  same phone for the last 22 years because they're all too darn big. Speaking of which, that was a  fascinating… Did you guys cover that much, the feminist outrage about the size of the Apple phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pete Slauson No. I heard a little bit about that on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos That women complaining that they're too large, and then  Bezos going after the women for complaining that they're too large on Twitter and back and forth  is the usual wonderful discourse we have on the station now. But they're just offering nothing  but really large phones. Pete Slauson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple's basically given up on the smaller form factor and yeah, I mean there are a lot of people  with smaller hands that are complaining. Jeff Bezos

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's only one way to fix that. Don't buy them.  Pete Slauson That's not going to happen.  Jeff Bezos The only way you talk to them is texting.  Pete Slauson My son is talking on a Nexus 6 with a  shattered screen right now. You think I care about the device? You don't have to buy these phones.  I'm still going to get sucked in, but we don't have to buy these phones. That's the only way  we're going to send a message of we don't have to have a thousand dollar cell phone. You can  figure out a way to bring the cost down. Not to really rag on Apple, but they mentioned all of  those recycled parts in that iPhone, but it's still a thousand dollars. I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Brand premium.  I mean there's a piece of it that is that also, right?  Pete Slauson It's like buying perfume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Yep.  Pete Slauson You're buying a few drops of chemicals  and you're paying a fortune for it. It's brand premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Yeah, because you can say that the perfume I use or the phone that I use  is the one that everybody wants to see in their hand. I got it. I was willing to pay the premium  to get it. Pete Slauson

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Jason, Dr. Android, if this weren't a business expense for you,  what in a new Android phone would make you say, yeah, I got to get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason Kass Man, you know what? That is a really  challenging question for me to answer because at this point, it's true. I review phones. I review  phones that come out and so therefore, I really rarely ever have to pay for a phone because I've  always got a new one to review or here at Twit, we buy the phones that we bring in. We definitely  buy the Pixels that I end up with. So my perception on this is very skewed. I do think that a thousand  dollars is too much for a phone. I don't know. Pete Slauson

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a really good, I've got the Pixel XL too. It's a really good phone.  Jason Kass Man Yeah.  Pete Slauson What are you carrying now?  Oh, you're muted. Jason Kass Man

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, that's better. Pete Slauson  I thought you were just, I thought you just really wanted us to guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, I don't know, I should know. So what is it? I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jason Kass Man The Pixel XL too. I've had both of the Pixels.  Pete Slauson Okay.  Jason Kass Man And it's, I remember when I got the first one and I did my little  review of it and whatnot. And I thought the device was nice for the hardware,  but I thought it was really, really overpriced. Personally, I'm getting a little bit of  hardware fatigue when it comes to smartphones because they're not really innovating. The  cameras are changing because of the software inside. But for the most parts, these things,  they all look the same and they almost all do pretty much the same stuff depending on how much  money you spend. And it's just too much now. Pete Slauson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did we get too used to expecting really big updates and now it's just impossible to impress us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jason Kass Man I think that's fair,  you know, but that was, that's because we were fortunate enough to be around when this stuff all  got started years ago. And we were able to see those huge incremental jumps each season when it  was time to get a new device. Like I can remember seeing the Droid X for the first time and that  4.3 inch screen just blew me away. And then the note came out and how everybody laughed at it,  being so big. And we just continued to iterate with these really, really nice features. And then  finally it came to sort of a stalemate. We just started getting more RAM and more disk space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pete Slauson So are there disk space on the phone? I like that.  I wish I had a floppy into my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason Kass Man You can hear it wind up and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pete Slauson I don't even know anymore because I'm so much into  Laveed at Google. Are there three fools left who still sleep out to get an iPhone?  Jason Kass Man On iPhone release day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pete Slauson I don't think I've seen that.  Jason Kass Man There's certainly not the news coverage of it that there once was.  Pete Slauson Maybe that's why I don't see it.  Jason Kass Man I'm sure, I'm guaranteed there's a certain number of people that are willing to  sleep out there and make sure they are at the front of the line for whatever reason.  Pete Slauson Oh, right. Ridiculousness.  Jason Kass Man Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pete Slauson I like the idea of Nexus back in the days with those phones. They were not terribly  expensive. They weren't the best of phones, but you still had a pretty nice experience because of  the clean operating system. I wish that we could continue down those same lines instead of having  to spend so much more money on these smartphones. I hate this, but people are going to continue to  buy these things and it's just going to make it worse down the road. Especially when you have  Verizon and AT&T saying, you know what, you don't have to pay $1,000 right now. Just give us $50  right now. Give us another $70 next month and then the next month give me another $70 and so on  and so on. And people are thinking, oh, okay, I'm getting a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason Kass Man Well, the whole notion of a subsidized phone,  just one day, just left. I never went for the subsidized phone deal because I didn't want to  be trapped. Of course, because I'm stupid enough and I keep on buying these phones year after year.  But I didn't want to be trapped. My last car I kept for like 12 years or something  and I didn't lease it. So oddly, I didn't want to be trapped with the car, but then I kept it for  12 years. Aaron Norris

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds smart to me. Yeah, and it does seem like we've got a bunch of hardware announcements  coming up in October. Everything's hitting in October, right? So we've got,  obviously we have the Made by Google event happening October 9th. Microsoft has a service  event October 2nd. Huawei has an October event for the Mate 20 and the Mate 20 Pro in London.  Razer, we're hearing rumors pointing to an October 10th date for the Razer Phone 2.  But beyond that, then you start to get into Samsung's event. They have an October 11th  event that they've now announced. Four Times the Fun, a Galaxy event is how they promoted this on  their invite, says more ways to express yourself than ever before. And there are rumors that point  to this being a Galaxy phone with four cameras. So you're talking about ways that these phones  can differentiate themselves. It seems like right now the push is definitely around the camera and  making the camera as good as it possibly can be, which by the way, the Pixel does with a single  camera and it's probably considered the best mobile phone, smartphone camera that there is right  now, one camera. A lot of the other companies are just throwing cameras onto their device to  boost the number to increase the quality of it or so we can assume. The selfie sales phones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's the fact of the matter. Selfie sale phones. And the better you can make that customer look  with that phone in their environment so they can share it out and be braggadocious all over  social media, the more those phones you're going to sell. Samsung does a great job of tapping into  the psyche of everybody and giving you all these cutesy bells and whistles to say, hey, this is  going to make you look great by this phone. I don't buy into that. Well, there are a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people that do, right? The selfie camera is probably the more used camera in a lot of people's  oh yeah toolbox than the other, the rear facing camera. And then going back to the Pixel,  the Pixel 3 is expected to have two front facing cameras while still having the single rear facing  camera. So they're going all over the place. Google knows it's all about the selfie.  Yeah. I'm very curious to know why the two on the front, if that's a security measure for face

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  scanning. Yeah. I wonder if it's a sensor, an additional sensor. Yeah. Or what it's for. Is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for wide shots or whatever? So Samsung is not the only company doing this. Like let's throw a ton of  cameras on the phone. LG also has an announcement coming up. October is the third or fifth. It  might be the third. They say come see what's next. They tout in the ad specifically, LG V 40 ThinQ,  LG's fourth flagship this year, by the way. So they have, they've been releasing a lot of  flagships. The invite even says take five. So it's hard to know whether that means this is their  fifth attempt at a flagship this year, or does that mean there's five cameras? And that's what  a lot of people are thinking. There might actually be five cameras on this phone, two on the front

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and three on the back. I'm waiting for them to put cameras on the side. Side firing cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And you're the photographer of the group. What could you do with side firing cameras?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, that's how you get those 360 images. I could totally see something crazy like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just let the software stitch it together. Yeah. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could totally see something crazy like that, but I don't know who has the guts to do it,  because there is a market. There is a market for those big octagons, what are they? Octagons or  whatever that has like eight different cameras on them. I think Mr. Alex Lindsay has one.  There's a market for that because it's an immersive bit of content that you can create.  If you can put that on a phone, why not? But I don't think anybody has the guts to do it just yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you talking about, well, jump is one of the examples of jump.  That was it. Yeah. The kind of like 360 degree array  of little cameras that create a full wraparound image. I guess, yeah. But I don't know how  necessary that would be if you just had two fisheye lenses, one on the front, one on the back of a  phone. That would be good enough too, but who knows? Who knows? All I know is that in their,  in phone companies rush to try and keep innovating, they're either doing crazy designs like the,  what was the phone a couple of months ago that actually had the top that opened up?  It hid the front facing camera until the motor, which apparently was more elegant than I figured

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it would be. Because we want moving parts inside of our smartphones. I'm not sure I buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Longevity wise, I don't think that holds up over time. But yeah, so they're trying to innovate.  They're trying to do what you were talking about. Yeah. I give them credit for that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but that's just something that's not necessarily practical. But then again,  is any of this stuff practical when it comes to smartphones? Most of the time, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not really. The one that we haven't mentioned is the OnePlus 6T, which OnePlus has been teasing  pretty heavily ahead of a October announcement. I don't think we have a date for this yet.  Their latest bit of news, they've confirmed that there will not be a headphone jack on this new  phone. So they've joined the masses. This is the first OnePlus phone to eject the headphone jack  in place of an USB-C port and an included dongle. So Samsung's holding steady though. I got to give

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Samsung credit. They're like, I don't want their software, but I love their hardware. And the fact  that I still use a dongle and wired headphones is one reason why I give them credit. Because I hate  Bluetooth earbuds and Bluetooth headphones because it always gives me interference. I don't care  where I go. I don't care what I wear, what song, what device. I always have interference with  Bluetooth and it's annoying. But every time I plug in a wired headset, no issue. And I have great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  quality sound with my little Sennheiser earbuds. I'd agree with that. I've come around a little bit  on Bluetooth. Really? Well, so the Jabra 65T elites are the ones that I use and I don't get  interference with them. And I expect interference when I use Bluetooth devices and I don't get it  with that. I don't get any dropouts. I don't get interference. So as long as it continues to work,  just as well as my wired headphones do, then more and more I'm like, okay, I get it. But  most earphones that I've used don't do that. So it's not dependable. I just happen to get lucky,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like. I need to write that down. The Jabra, what's it called? 65T elites. Those are the ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that I have and they've got really great battery life. You know, the little case that charges it  up. You hardly ever have to charge that sucker. They sound great. I feel like they give you good  isolation. I like them a lot. And they're not that expensive in the grand scheme of things.  They're like $160, $150, somewhere around there.

And now back to tech news one. No, nevermind this week. We'll see if I can prevent myself from doing  that again throughout the course of this show. I apologies. Hey, did you hear about Android pie  and the sudden settings change that happened on a number of pie devices? Yes, I thought I was losing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  my mind. So it happened to you. It happened to me. I'm sitting there trying to watch the weather  reports and stuff at the time. And I use, you remember when I was on all about Android that  storm radar app that I shared with you? I was going through that trying to follow the path  and that little red icon popped up and I'm like, why did I, what did I push to make that happen?  And it just sort of caught me off guard and I turned it off, but it wasn't long after I saw on  Twitter, everybody was up in arms. Like I didn't turn this on and it's, it's pretty scary. But the  thing is I'm surprised it took this long for us as in the public to catch Google and doing something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like that. Yeah. Well, experience. Did you experience this, Jeff? The, the, the battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  saver going on without me asking. Well, here's the weird thing. I swear that's happened to me like  four times over the last year. Oh, Oh, wow. Um, the, you know, so there must be some combination of  gestures and things that will turn it on that I don't know about or whatever it is, but yeah,  it's happened to me more than once. And you know what? No big deal. World didn't fall apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. I kind of thought when it, before I knew that it was an actual thing that happened,  I just assumed that it was like a butt dial. Like I had it in my pocket and the screen woke up and  something pushed and oh, my battery saver mode is on. Um, but then I, then I realized, oh, well,  no, actually this was pushed out by Google. Google said, uh, it was an internal experiment to test  battery saving features. It was mistakenly rolled out to more users than intended. But what this  story ended up doing was kind of alerting people that may not have considered it or thought about  this as a possibility before that even when you own your phone, Google still can own your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if it really wants to. But Google also gives us a security updates and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That we're quite grateful for. Absolutely. Sure. Um, does an internal mean internal to Google  in its four walls and offices and whatnot? That's what I would take as internal testing.  If it's, if it's going out to other users, then that's more like a pilot test. And then you  would have, would like to assume that they notified a group of pilot testers or beta testers or what  have you. That doesn't seem like this was the case here. So I didn't like the wording in their little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  statement. Uh, and you know, you brought up an interesting point too. And which is that when you  were looking at this, you were looking, when you were looking at your phone and noticed that it  happened, it was right around the time of, you know, pretty, pretty big disaster was about to,  was shaping us, was taking form around you. We talked about this a little bit on all about  Android last night. My initial inclination was to be kind of what you're talking about, Jeff, like,  yeah, of course Google can do this. I kind of always assumed that they could and no big deal.  I just turned it off and moved on with my life. The extension of this, however, is what if an  accident like this does happen? And let's say in the example I used last night, I think it's  perfectly fitting to, you know, this hurricane, what if, what if they accidentally trigger do not  disturb and what does do not disturb do it mutes your phone. It blocks notifications. You see  absolutely nothing unless you happen to notice that there's a little circle with a line through  it on your display that tells you that you're being blocked from all this stuff. So hurricane  is passing through, you miss a message from someone who needs your help or something like that  because that happens. And then suddenly there's a big, there's a literally there's a payload  attached to this mistake. And so to that end, it's kind of silly that an accident like this  did happen. Sure, it didn't end up being a big deal as far as we know, but it certainly could have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was thinking the same thing that there's this stuff where you can control your kids phone.  Uh, sounds just fine. Right. What if, what if your kids out and, um, you know, at a party and needs  to call you and you'll know every day, you know, four o'clock, we cut them off because there's too  much phone going on. Um, there was kinds of, it's also like people wanting to have theaters cut off  all cellular access, but what if there's a surgeon in the room? These, these Uber efforts to, to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  change things on us. Yeah, that worries me. Right. Um, yeah, a family link is, uh, is, is the Google  version of what you're talking about. Right. Um, they actually just had an update, uh, which they're  expanding their features to teens before it was just kind of narrowed in on, on children under  13 so that parents could kind of monitor their use and everything. And now they're expanding it  so that it can be used for teen accounts as well to do exactly like what you're saying,  to use assistant, to say, Hey, gee, lock Heather's device or, or whatever. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I predict the next version of the story will be that husbands and wives can do it to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, you know, and there were a lot of people that, that see changes like this and they're  like, that's, it's not okay. You're, you're, you're, um, you know, we are conditioning our children to  live in some, in some sort of a surveillance position by apps. I can see both sides of that.  I suppose. I mean, I'm a parent, so I'm struggling with certain issues along these lines, but my kids  are still very young, so I haven't got to the really challenge. You just wait and reigans until

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  new technologies do things you can't imagine. Yeah, totally. They're smart. Your kids are smart.  They'll figure it out. Yeah, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. I know. Cause you saw, there was a study,  NYU I saw last week, um, that looked at who's sharing the worst of the fake news crap.  And they had like 1500 or the worst of the worst. And then they looked at Facebook and who's sharing  it. And guess what? It was white men over 65. And all these interventions we want to have,  the kids are sharing all this stuff. The kids are fine. The kids get it just fine. They're fine.  It's grandpa and ma and her dad that are doing this. So the kids are okay. Kids will figure it  out. Kids will be all right. They'll be fine. We're old. We old fries because an old fart,  the old farts, the one who was screwing up the world. Kids are okay. Oh yeah. Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, I think you're right. I mean, obviously that's, that's the way it is. Like  it's impossible for us to understand the depth of, of the level of understanding  that kids who are growing up in an age where there is nothing other than accessibility to  this kind of stuff, what their understanding truly is because they like they've lived their life  through it. We've kind of emerged into it and we've had to reanalyze and reevaluate. And I'm  sure there will be things in their lives that they will have to reevaluate and reanalyze because  their kids will be the natives in that regard. But yeah, it's, it's hard to, it's hard to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the right way. I'm telling you it's real hard to teach and you know, try to use Gilligan's  Island references. It doesn't work. It's dang it. That should always work. We're not dang it.  Now what was it? What was that? What was that? What was it? What you said before? Dag nab it.  No, was that dag nab it? No. What'd you say? Oh, you're muted again. You're muted.  I hate when I do that. Dag gum it. Dag gum it. That's it. That's it. I think that's a show title.  Dag gum it. It's actually been this one ever. Oh, has it? On, on Twitch. It's a show title

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  one time. All right. All right. That's your signature? I think so. That and brown liquor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To the moon, Alice. Another reference nobody gets. Can I tell you my favorite story of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that? The smart replies story. Oh, okay. So kick that one off because I think I may have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  missed this one. So yeah, I put it in the last minute. So smart replies, you know, looks at all  these responses and makes up a response that you should give an email. And I've talked about how I  feel guilty using it. Like the human didn't really send you this reply, which says, yes, I'll be there.  No problem. Right. All these smart replies are there. Well, AI goes off our behavior. So guess  what smart reply tried to get people to say often, which could, by the way, I think improve the whole  world. I love you. Oh, that was nice of it. I'm down with that. Yeah. But, but you can imagine,  I mean, you got to, you got an email with your boss and you accidentally hit, I love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's still that signal though. You know, I, I'm down with that plant, plant that seed, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe Google should force us all to do that. You know, plant that seed, all this hate going

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  around in this world, plant that seed of that. I totally dig that as annoying as it may be to some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't even give us the opportunity. Just start sneaking that in at the very end of every one  of our emails to each other. And suddenly like think of the impact that would have if suddenly  everyone's email ended with, I love you. There would be change, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, with, with regards to the smart replies, I do like the fact that there's one little detail  within them and that's the exclamation point. Speaking with a colleague of mine over the years  regarding corporate communication to people. And I had to train them up. I said, you know,  you could say the same thing and put a period on the end versus an exclamation point. And it just  makes a world of difference to an end user. You know, if you just say thank you, period,  they just think you any other IT jerk. But if you say thank you at an exclamation point,  they feel like, hey, he has personality, even though you're no different.  Something about that exclamation point really makes a difference. And I'm starting to see that  more and more in the smart replies that come up in my messages. Well, and is that a ref,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but that's a reflection of how you communicate, right? Smart. I don't know.  So you don't, you don't add a lot of explanation, exclamation points. I have always used tons of  exclamation points, almost to the point to where I feel like I overuse them. And so I've had to  like peel back in the other direction, but I've definitely noticed my smart replies use them.  And I just kind of assumed it was because I do. No, it's definitely not. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Friend of mine said that she was dating a guy, Yael, which goes to this. And he,  and he had a rule that said you should use three exclamation points in life.  And he'd already used one.  I like you. I said, I said, I'm glad you didn't marry him. So I'm old enough, gentlemen. I am  old enough. Not only did I use a typewriter, not only did I use a manual typewriter,  I was thinking about this the other day, I completely forgot this in my day.  When I took typing class in sixth grade, the way to get an exclamation point was you had to hit a  apostrophe then backspace period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you better really mean to use the exclamation point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You had to do DIY exclamation points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. Wow.  Yeah. Huh? Huh? How old is that?  We'd be a lot less assertive if it took that much work.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, but see my personality, I've always tried to be, you know, black and white binary.  I personally think that that keeps confusion down when I'm trying to communicate a plan to someone  or, you know, or whatever that we have going on. Because I hate it when I was working in the world  of support saying something to a user and they just totally go the opposite direction of what  I was expecting or they felt like I was going to do a different action at a different time.  And so I trained myself to just be as robotic as possible. It may sound rude to people, but  that's how I got stuff done. You know, just black and white periods, commas, perfect capitalization.  Every now and then throw an exclamation point if I felt like somebody needed a warm and fuzzy,  but most of the time, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man. I'm so the opposite of that. And I realize-  You just ask my family.  Yeah. Like so often I'll write an email and then I have to go and in part of my checking the email  is to make sure I have put in too many exclamation points. Like every sentence ends with it. I'm  like, why am I so excited about every single thing I'm saying right now to replace them with periods?  And I have to specifically go in there and do that. I realize I'm admitting too much right now.  I'm being a little too open to you all. It's because I love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just bought a book that I put in the rundown.  I see it. It's in the doc chat.  The Shady Characters, The Secret Life of Punctuation.  And I love this kind of crap. It's geeky as hell, but how all of these various things  have the asterisk, the dagger, the height, the life of the hyphen and the dash.  You know what the manicule is? Manicule is a little hand that she put in point.  It's something that was important. It was used very early in printing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too bad there's no audio book version of this.  A little hard.  I know. I would love to see how they pull that off, but it makes sense that there isn't.  Interesting. That sounds like a fascinating book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what we call the hashtag is actually called?  A pound, right?  Nope. It is called the Octothorp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing we don't call it that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Imagine the world would be different if it was just Octothorp that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Octothorp life.  Octothorpe life.  Yeah. That just doesn't...  Octothorpe YOLO.  Title says Karsten. Octothorpe life.  It goes colon life. Yeah. It doesn't quite have the same ring to it.  Oh boy. That was a fun little tangent. Where should we go next?  I have a feeling they're not as fun. Hey, how about the car?  So this one's real quick. Google Maps for CarPlay apparently is now out to support iOS 12.  iOS 12 came out yesterday, I think, for iPhone users.  What does that bring? That finally brings from what little I know about Apple,  it brings third party maps to CarPlay. So third party map app support.  Now Google Maps rolled out its update today to support it.  It lacks voice control through Siri, but apparently when you're running the app,  it still has voice control through Google. So you can still use Google's voice  control to do the things. And Waze is going to have an update as well very soon.  So that was quick. That was a fast inclusion and sounds like iOS 12 is opening up a little bit more  as far as that's concerned. So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not smart enough to understand how it works, but when you use Google Maps, Google collects all  of this data trying to figure out patterns and where you're going, why you're going, what time  of day and things like that. If it's on iOS, how does that data collection work? Is that something  that Apple has approved? Is it something that goes back to the Apple data centers and Apple uses it  to make the experience better? I wonder how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Couldn't you just use Google Maps in, I mean, thinking of your laptop,  right? You could use Google Maps just in your browser and Google Maps operates as Google Maps,  right? Right. So is it that kind of relationship? It's just running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But even then Google, if you run it in the browser, Google is looking at your IP to figure out your  location and things like that. Yeah, needs to.  So I just wonder, because that's just data collection and I just wonder how is that  jiving on the iOS side and Apple's trying to be as locked down and secure as it normally is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you use your Starbucks app, it says find stores near me. And so you gave permission to share your  location. Okay. Okay. So I think it's just, but the difference is it's sharing your location  constantly as it changes. Right. And what's the rule that are there any rules about recording

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that information and how that's done? Right. You know, cause if I go to get into my vehicle  right now and I put my, I don't have a fancy car or anything like that. So I still use my phone for  the navigation. And if I was going, going there right now and pull up the nav, it will say,  this is how you get to your son's school because it knows right about this time you're normally  going to pick up your son from school for football practice. You know, it, I never really navigated  to the school. I know how to get to school, but for some reason Google knows about this time  every day. He's Monday through Friday. He's heading over this, this way. And I just wondered,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  how is that on the iOS side? I'm guessing that kind of predictive stuff isn't happening. Not,  definitely not on the iOS on the OS level. Maybe it happens when you pull up the map,  but I haven't used it to know, but maybe it would have some, some further insight in there because  within the Google apps world, you know, you've, you've given Google, uh, overview over your  calendar and over your, your navigation history or your location history via Google. So maybe it  could make those, those inferences, but yeah, I just, I don't think it's, I would, it's a total  guess on my part, but I don't think it's as detailed or as comprehensive in the Google apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  world on iOS as it is on Android. We don't have a Google person on speed dial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well we have support as we tested out a few years ago, live on the show.  Uh, but I don't know if they'd give us what we were looking for. I don't even think that's open  anymore. I think that was like the Nexus help line that we got. Yeah. We do or we did. We don't  anymore. Um, this one though is, is very interesting related to, uh, the car. Google  just, uh, announced that it struck a major deal with Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance.  And basically starting in 2021, they're going to start putting out vehicles that the infotainment  system, I'm not sure how deep it's going to go, will run on Android. So it's a really big deal  for Android. You know, Google's been trying for years now to get Android going in the cars,  in vehicles. And I mean, we got to wait a couple of years, but this is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and by the way, look at that 2021, what a ridiculous industry, right? The phones are  changing constantly. We got, we got six cameras on our phone. They're, they're doing all kinds  of things. They're flying and taking the selfies of us and the car. We'll change that in about five

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  years. This is kind of crazy. We're going to have to wait until then to see anything. But I mean,  you're talking millions of vehicles. I guess you're talking millions of phones too, but I don't know  why. I guess the turnaround time on vehicles is that much longer. Maybe they already had deals  in place that they got to burn. Yeah. I thought I was just about negotiations. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true too. The contracts. Yeah. I thought I desperately wanted it Android auto. I talked about  the show at the time when I was buying a car and I went around and I didn't end up getting it.  Mazda is supposed to have put it in like a year ago or it hasn't been in there,  but then I had a rental car and put it in. I didn't like it. Yeah. It's so nanny state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It does. It does kind of, it does definitely control all aspects. I have it running on my phone  and I have, you know, now I have like a Bluetooth trigger on it. So when I, uh, when I turn on my  car, it automatically removes the interface from my phone or replaces it with, with Android auto.  And that's nice because I can't really interact with it and it, it represents what you would get  it out of Android auto, but there are, there are a decent amount of times where I'm like,  this is just too limiting. Like, and, and also as simple as it tries to make it, it still  complicates things as far as getting from one place to another. You, you don't want to have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  tap as many times as you actually still kind of agree with you on that. I agree with you on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So, but one thing that's really interesting about this partnership from what I understand,  it's not necessarily a deal around Android auto. It's a deal around Android, the Android as the  O S Oh, which is a big deal. Yeah. So, and I, who knows? I mean, this is 2021. So who knows what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that, where that lands down the line? That they can't do. Oh, yes. Consumer consumer

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  phrasing, no S well. Right. Right. And so does that mean Q and X is officially gone now? Cause  Q and X was running on a lot of these cars for, for many years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if it's officially gone. Probably still, still around. But I can remember seeing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maserati at CES one year and it had this beautiful IFE in it. And when I asked what was, how was this  powered and they said Q and X and I said, what just caught me off guard. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, apparently, apparently there was an Android auto update today too. So I guess this would  fall in line. I guess this just happened, but the Android version of Apple music now works with  Android auto. So if you're an Apple music user on Android, then there you go. You're happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google wants everybody happy. Apparently. Yeah. That makes me see if you just learn that it'd be  okay. Google just wants you to be happy. That's all they want. That's all for you to be happy.  Tell them what makes you happy and they will make you happy. This is fine. Everything is just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just relax everyone. Let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this week in Google.  See what I did there. I got it right. And then we'll get into more news stories. We've got a  lot more to talk about. But first this episode of Twig is brought to you by Grammarly. For those who  don't happen to know, we've talked about Grammarly on the show many times. I'm a big fan of Grammarly  because like, I think I'm an okay writer, but I definitely make grammatical mistakes and Grammarly  definitely points them out to me and then helps me correct them. And exclamation points. Yes, exactly.  You're a little too excited, Jason. And then over time, what I've noticed in using Grammarly  regularly is that over time you start making less of those mistakes because you've been corrected  so many times. I still use the exclamation points plenty of times though. That'll never change.  So you should check it out because it really does help improve your writing for all sorts  of different occasions. It's a great way to double check your important papers, your documents,  even avoid future typos. Like I said, they have a free version that you can use to get started and  to check it out. And it's available cross-platform. So you can get it online, in desktop, on mobile.  It's all kind of running on the device and out of the way until you need it, which is kind of the  beauty of Grammarly. Grammarly's premium version allows users to personalize their experience  settings to write for different occasions. So maybe you're writing for school is different  than you're writing for work or when you're getting creative. All those things kind of have  different personalization around how you write for those things. And you can have Grammarly  remember new words as well. In addition to spelling and grammar, Grammarly premium helps  with advanced punctuation, structure, style within context, vocabulary suggestions, conciseness,  and readability for different occasions.

And then it appears, gives you that red underline, you hover over it, and it shows you  what the change will be. And you're like, oh yeah, that does sound a whole lot better. Go to  grammarly.com slash twig, and you'll get 20% off Grammarly premium today. That's grammarly.com  slash twig, T-W-I-G. And check it out for yourself. And we thank Grammarly for their support  of this week in Google. Let's see here. We've got Google and T-Mobile teaming up  on 911 calls. Location, this has always kind of been a big problem, right? And apparently,  80% of the calls to 911 operators come from wireless devices. And the big challenge has  that when a call comes into 911 from a wireless device, they don't have nearly the resolution  on location that they do when it comes from a landline. When a call comes from a landline,  they know exactly the location of that call. And if they need to send someone out right away,  they can. On wireless, it's a lot more elusive, a lot more difficult. For whatever reason,  they've never figured this out. And I don't really understand why. It seems like a really  important thing to figure out. Well, Google and T-Mobile struck a deal that will pass along  Google's emergency location services via the carrier when those calls come through. So at  least with T-Mobile, that'll improve things. I'm just amazed that deals like this haven't happened  before. Make it work because that's where all the calls are coming from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It makes you wonder where people's priorities are from a business standpoint. But kudos to  T-Mobile and Google putting that out because nobody has a landline these days. It's just,  it is what it is. Even a big office space uses some type of VoIP option instead of the traditional,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what do they call it? POTS? What was that? Plain old telephone service?  I called this show Tech News Weekly. We can all have me a cul-plus today.  Exclamation points on me. Octo-Thorps too. Yes, Octo-Thorps all around. What else do we have here?  Let's see here. New Mexico has apparently filed a lawsuit against Google and Twitter,  actually going for both of them. Along with select app developers, basically there was a UC  Berkeley study that analyzed right around 6,000 children's applications found in the Google  Play Store. What they were looking for were they were reviewing them to see if they were in  violation and if so, how of COPPA, which basically enforces that data isn't collected on children  under the age of 13 without parental consent. Google says to its developers that they are the  ones that are responsible for informing about their compliance. Apparently all of these apps  were pulled from the Play Store's designed for families section. That's no good if that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  case and yet they're still not in compliance with COPPA. I understand about the story. Is Google  accused of doing something wrong or enabling the app producers of doing something wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both from what I understand. They're basically saying Google, you did something wrong by

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  presenting these apps in such a way. I don't think Google collected the data on young people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't think so, but yeah, I didn't catch that data point. It seems to me it's more focused  around the apps and what the apps are actually pulling because they were tracking data shared  and this was via permissions and all that with the apps themselves. Data like personal information,  location information, Wi-Fi router, geolocation, insecure transmissions. They're supposed to be  secure in some way. That tells me that maybe it's on the developer side of things and that's  probably exactly why Google says, hey, we tell developers you must be in compliance. It's their  problem if they're not doing it, go after them. To that extent, I don't know why they would be  going after Twitter as well in that regard. They're sweeping them all up it sounds like.  I was just signed out of my account so this might take me a few minutes to get back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh Jason, I'm not going to have you do this again. Jason's going to mess up his password. Jason was  locked out. This is a classic on the show. I think I remember this. It was Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was Google Voice and two-factor dedication. Yeah. And man, I felt so bad for you. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  your face just got all pale. I remember, wasn't it Matt Cutts who rescued you? Got you back in.  Yes. Yes. Matt Cutts swooped in. He rescued me. So watch out. Jason's trying to sign in again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. I looked out and said you've been signed out. I have no idea why that happened, but it did. It's  so strange. It must have timed out or something. No, it's just like the whole battery saver option.  It's just another signal. Just another signal. Thankfully, I'm back in and my account still  exists. So we're good. You want to talk about Dragonfly a little bit? We've got a few stories  related to Dragonfly. So Dragonfly is the censored search product that Google has been working on,  reportedly working on for the Chinese market. Very controversial, obviously, because it involves a  highly censored version of the search product and a whole lot of concessions made to make it  operational by the Chinese government standards in the country. Apparently, there's a list of  seven employee names from Google who have left the company in protest that is actually circulating  on an internal email list within the company. Most of them first heard of Dragonfly with the  original intercept story, which is what kind of broke the news to everyone. The names really  haven't been disclosed publicly yet. I guess the sources on this story weren't willing to share  outside of Jack Polson, who is a senior scientist who actually had been reported last month as  having resigned in protest of the list. So yeah, I guess there's still, I mean, obviously, there's  still a lot of internal debate about this product. And I'm sure there are a lot more people that  probably feel as strongly as these who have stepped away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got to give those guys credit for standing up for their values and saying, you know what,  I'd rather not have a job than be a part of what's going on here. That takes a lot because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's tough out there. It's tough out there. Well, I don't think it's too tough for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, maybe not for them. Well, even so, I still agree with you. I was thinking it could be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  different if they were protesting Walmart and it wasn't another Walmart in town.  But I don't belittle what they're doing at all. I agree with you. And importantly,  and too, I think that they're doing it in time that may put pressure on. Maybe Google will come  to its senses. Right. Right. Maybe. I hope so. Maybe. It doesn't seem likely at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More and more, it seems like they're continuing further down this path. The Intercept has another  story that they published, another biggie that says that Dragonfly is being crafted to link  a user's searches to their personal phone number. So if someone in China does a search via this  as yet unreleased Google search product within the country, their personal phone number will  be attached to those search queries, which would ultimately obviously make it much easier for them  to be tracked depending on what they're searching for. Some of those blacklisted item search terms  include human rights, student protest, Nobel Prize in Mandarin. That's just to name a couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So scary stuff, man. And scary stuff. What people are limited to in different areas of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the, I guess there were 16 US House lawmakers last Thursday who addressed a letter  to Sundar Pichai. I think there was also a letter a month before to Sundar Pichai.  Anyways, questions about the company's decision to return to China. What restrictions is it going  to place on the search engine? I feel like we're hearing about those restrictions, but they want  some sort of a formal answer here. What are those restrictions? If Google left China in 2010, why  has it suddenly decided that now is the right time to move back in? And maybe this ties back in with  the first story of the show, which is that we don't hear much at all from the people who  you used to hear about in things like this. Larry Page. Sergey Brin. I mean, they're silent  as far as this is concerned. A lot of that control has gone to, why am I suddenly blanking?  Pichai. Sundar Pichai. Yet, in certain very public cases, Google has given the opportunity to talk  about certain things, maybe not necessarily related to this Chinese search product, but they're  hearing a couple of weeks ago and instead of sending someone, they send nobody. So it's just  weird bottling up of information, this control of information that's happening right now from Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  as a company. Unfortunately, we all still have to realize that Google and Alphabet,  they are a business first and with business, profit is what matters first.  You're not in business for fun. You're usually in business for profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matthew Glacius, who's a political writer, says that he just found on Twitter that  Amazon, Jeff Bezos realized the profit doesn't matter, growth does.  He hates profit. Well, he doesn't grow. Well, he doesn't spend a lot of money to grow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it sort of goes hand in hand in his standpoint. His growth gives him more profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get that. Smart man. It's easy to say I don't care about money when money's being thrown at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. It's a whole different perspective. It's about the bill that Google has to pay to the EU.  It's a lot of money for some people, but not so much Google or Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe not so much Google. Absolutely. Let's see here. Google Home Mini,  best-selling smart speaker in Q2. I'm not sure I would have guessed that. I would have guessed  that the Echo. No, I wouldn't have either. Did you listen to that speaker, Mr. Howe?  Listen to it. I have them throughout my home. We have two regular Google Homes  in the kitchen and the living room, and then we have Minis in the rest of the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, I see those speakers as something that's pretty much good enough for  shower time. Just in the morning shower and you want to have your  ecstasy of gold playing while you're getting ready, that speaker is good enough for that.  Yeah, sure. But outside of that, I'm sure nobody in the chat room knows what ecstasy of gold is.  But I just don't see why those speakers are so popular. I just can't wrap my head around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Price, low profile. We've got them in... Actually, no, I also have an Insignia alarm  clock that has a system. That's in our master bedroom. That was actually a really great buy,  I have to say. We got it for like 20 bucks. It's normally 50 and it sounds really good  for the price. But anyway, the Mini we have in our girls' bedrooms and then the den or whatever.  In that case, they are not of discerning taste as far as music is concerned. They don't care.  They are stoked about the fact that when they wake up in the morning and they're getting ready  for school, they can say, hey, gee, play Beatles or whatever. And it'll play and it's totally  perfect for them. Would I put that in my kitchen or my living room or expect great sounding,  high fidelity music out of it? No. But as an assistant device, it's fine and it's pretty  inexpensive. I think that's why it's doing so well. There are a lot of really good sales on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the home Mini that bring the price to the point. There's clearly a market for it that I had no idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about. Yeah. I mean, it's a way to get it in every room, which is obviously that's Google's goal,  is to have an entry point, a price point that you can expand it. And I mean, like I said,  in our house, we've got these things in every single room now. And it's pretty awesome to be  able to announce in one room, hey, it's time to wake up. And then all the speakers wake up and go,  good morning. It's time to wake up. And then suddenly two minutes later, yes. It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like my home is smart. That's cool. Remember way, way, way back when and like Brady Bunch days,  you had an intercom system in the house. It's kind of the same thing. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not live intercom though. That would be pretty cool. It's not that yet.  But there's no reason it couldn't be right. I don't think so. I think that'd be pretty neat  if it was live intercom. Maybe someday that we'll get that. But yeah, so the echo dot was the second.  So the Google Home Mini, 2.3 million shipments in Q2 2018, 20% market share there. The echo dot was  second at 2.1 million. So the Google Home Mini edged it out by 0.2 million, essentially, shipments.  Apple HomePod didn't even make the top five, but apparently counts for 6% market share for the  quarter. But I would have thought it was the one. Yeah. In that realm, yeah, Apple's not doing nearly  as hot. Late to the game and super expensive is kind of what happened to them there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Jason, I know you discussed this a few weeks ago. What's up? I was going to show it was none,  but the death of inbox. Yeah. So we talked about that last week and I wanted to ask you about it.  And in the rundown, there's also the Google's going to get rid of its browser app and just go  with progressive web app and Gmail. So I'm just looking at that. I turned on Gmail for the first  time in probably a year and a half or a long. I got addicted to inbox, to the updates and priority  and crunch sheet of stuff. This is disturbing me. Are you an inbox user? I'm an inbox user. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I am really sad. Like I'm having to come to terms with the fact that I'm going to have to  totally upend how I'm using and used to using email for the past three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And since we're both Chromebookers, now we also have, so we have a PWA app rather than the  browser app, which just makes me a little nervous. Is this stuff really going to be downloaded  in the background? If I haven't opened up the Gmail tab. Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're, so you're saying on the Chrome, on Chrome OS, if I go to Gmail or if like they're  sunsetting the Gmail app, I think I missed that. The Gmail, it's in the rundown. They're sunsetting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Gmail browser app and going with progressive web, the offline Chrome app offline offline. Sorry,  offline should be clear offline. Got it. Okay. Um, so now it's just going to be a PWA, a progressive  web app, which is fine as far as it goes. But I just have this nervousness that I won't have  opened Gmail for two days. I get on the airplane and I say, Oh, no email for the plate. That makes  me nervous. It's a forced break. They're messing up. That's okay. You still have that thousand

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  dollar tiny computer in your pocket. That's Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, this, this has to do with offline only roach. I'd use a lot and I think from what I,  okay, I see what you're saying. I missed the progressive web app aspect of this. I just  assumed that what it meant was that the Gmail site, the new, the new version of Gmail with the  updates that rolled out however long ago enabled offline access somehow. But you're right. How would,  how would I install that if I was suddenly out of, of internet, how, you know, internet activity  or access, how would I get to that? Huh? I'm, yeah, now I'm curious how that's going to work.  I don't find myself in that position very often, but that would, that would suck.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Users will need to enable offline access in their settings. And if you have a school or work account,  your G suite admin may need to allow it as well. That's a big caveat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. So then I would have to go into settings on Gmail and looking to see if I can get,  if I can find that and there is an offline tab offline unavailable.  Uh, looks like there is not enough space available for offline mail. This may be caused by  installation, hard drive space or a web browser mode. So where are you seeing that? Where,  where did you go to that? I went into Gmail and then into settings and then into offline tab,  the offline tab. Oh man. Um, is that telling me that I don't have much space in my pixel book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause I'd be ridiculous. And I don't see the offline tab. Where is that again? So I'm in Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I go to settings, general labels, inbox accounts. Yeah. And if you go all the way to the right,  there's themes and before themes is offline for me. I don't see themes and offline. I see it  ends with add-ons and chat. Oh, and then I have advanced and offline and themes beyond. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there it is offline. So there's offline, right? It was over to the next line unavailable. Oh,  you know what this is? Oh God, I'm going to kill. I'm going to kill Jason. I'm going to kill.  I'm going to kill. Calm down, Jeff. Calm down. Where's my popcorn? You're going to guess what  it is. Is it Google apps? Yes, it is. Contact your administrator for further details. Google.  This is, this is like, this is killer. This, this is like, this really kills me.  Now I got to go through 87,000 steps. Whatever that happens on this Fakakta thing,  you know, just to add one Android app, you wouldn't believe what I have to go through.  There's literally like 87 steps. And now, now this is contact your administrator. I am the  F'ing administrator of Google and I have no F'ing idea what I'm supposed to F'ing do to get my own  F'ing email. You're killing inbox. You're killing the app. You're not letting me do offline here.  This is not cool. Google, are you watching? This is not cool. The entire company,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for this service, it sucks. Oh boy. It sucks. The entire company is watching you right now, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's, you know, I'm a fan. I just said earlier, I'm a fan boy. You know, I got all your stuff,  right? This is so basic. Yeah. You're acting like a cable company. Stop it. Stop it. So I, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to understand my, so I get it on your end. I mean, I don't get it. I don't get why it is,  but I get it. Watch out. So let's, empathy here. Come on. But, so I'm looking at mine. Mine is not  a Google Apps account. This is my personal account, my normal personal Gmail account. It says offline  unavailable. Are you getting the same not enough space or it's a different? No, it just says

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  offline unavailable. Contact your administrator for further details. Okay. As if they gave me  any details. It's not just further details. Right. I got to contact me to find out what I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You didn't get an email notification about it or anything that you just had to read

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a press release. Oh, geez. So for me, it's a, it says it's a space. It says there's not enough  space. So how do you find out what your space is on your machine? So my machine has 93.8 gigs  available. Jesus. My Gmail account is at 8% full. Plus it's only supposed to, oh, that's obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's only supposed to do like 90 days worth anyway. It's only limited amount of email. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't believe it when it says that. I think I've looked at both things. It could possibly be  either Gmail space or my device space and neither of them are anywhere near full. In fact, they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  near empty. I don't know. So I search for G suite offline Gmail. First thing is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome app, which is what they're getting rid of. Well, I suppose they did just, just mention or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just announce these things, but still, still. So I go to the enabled Gmail web offline for your  domain in your Google admin council console, go to a, this is torture, torture, torture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's, where's Tuffle when you need him? Yeah. Well, he was on last week and we were,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we were going around the horn about, Oh, we got to get him roused up about this. Yeah. That's a good  idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, if you're watching, get roused up, please.  Stand on behalf of Chrome OS users world around. I just fixed this, Kevin. I just really don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to have to get used to not using inbox again and switching over all of my bundles. Like I love the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  bundles. I use them. I'm just bummed. I am too. I am an in, I guess, an inefficient email user.  I'm in box never really worked for me in my workflow. So I never really jumped into it.  I'm not an inbox zero kind of person. I don't know. I'll have stuff in there. This just stored  for, for years or what have you in different folders. And then far as my actual inbox,  I'll keep things in there marked as unread just as, as like a reminder for me to, you know,  knock something out eventually, you know, if it's really bad, I'll take those emails and put them on  my, on my calendar as a task or something like that. But I never really needed what inbox tried  to offer users as a way of managing their messages. Never really needed it. When I open Gmail, it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  looks really cluttered to me and it does now same here. The one thing I miss in inbox, it's a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  slower too. And there's one thing in the inbox, one thing, one thing only, which was mark is unread.  Yeah. Cause I see something to say, no, no, no, I don't want to, I want to, I want to, I want to  come back to that. So mark is unread and Gmail and it never was an inbox. It never was an inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was always so, so then you'd find yourself like I'd get a, I'd get a notification. I'd be  like, don't tap it. Cause I want it to stay on read. Exactly. Show me just enough for my notification.  Okay. I think, yeah, that's where I was done. It's kind of silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It totally screwed up my workflow. So I was done right then. I'm, I may have had inbox on my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  phone for an hour. It didn't last. Yeah, no, I like it. I'm going to miss it. Maybe my problem with  Gmail is that I have the view wrong. I had it on default and it shows all the like little attachments

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and in pill shaped and stuff. I think I tried cozy. I believe that's what my comfortable and compact  are the other ones. Or maybe it was comfortable either way. I don't, it's still a little too  small and a little too much too slow compared to what it used to run like. So then is Gmail,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what you actually use and, or have you found like a third party solution? Nope. I use Gmail. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I route everything from personal to business through Gmail one way or another. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google. So I'm doing the instructions right now. Go to your apps, G suite, Gmail user settings.  So I clicked on that link to do that. And then it says scroll down to offline. It's not there.  Huh? I will bother you. I won't bother the world with this anymore right now. I promise. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  frustrating frustration. We have the Google change log. There should have a Google rant with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis and Mr. Tuffle. That Google rage log. There it is. I got it. I got it enabled.  Oh, you did it. Say, you know, let's see if it works. Okay. So save loading, loading,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  loading, loading. That's a new podcast. The Google rage log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can, you can have that Jeff loading, loading, loading, loading, loading. Why is this so hard?  What's the problem? It's not going to work. So now I'm going to reset. I'm going to go to my  Gmail settings and see, I've been still on a Chromebook for a couple months. I'm totally behind.  Still unavailable. Dang. After all that, not even available. All right. Well, enough of that. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sorry. I'm sorry. That's okay. I want it. I wanted to make sure that we resolved it somehow. And even  after all that, well, we resolved it to the point to know that even when you jumped through all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hoops, you still didn't make it through to Kevin Tuffle. We got to get him really mad about this.  Or I'm fine. Kevin, if you belittle me and say, Oh, Jeff, this is really easy. Let me show you how

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's fine. That's fine. Because then there's a resolution. Right? Exactly. That's totally cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of the change log, why don't we jump into the Google change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome OS 9 is rolling out now. If you haven't got it already, you probably have, but if you haven't,  you can look forward to a new material theme. Lots of white and pill shaped bars and  bubbliness. You'll probably like the changes and improved and more powerful Omnibar. So more stuff  happens in the Omnibar. Linux for Chromebook beta is now supported running Linux apps, editors,  command line tools, that sort of stuff. There's a nightlight mode for shifting the color display  based on like sunrise, sunset and that sort of stuff. And a whole lot more. Did you guys get the  Chrome OS 69 update? See your tabs are kind of like rounded now. Yeah, that's pretty.  Bubbly things. All about the bubbly things. RCS, that's rich communication services.  We've definitely talked about in previous episodes, supported on Android, hardly ubiquitous  standard at this point, as much as Google would like it to be. So now Google and Samsung have  announced that Samsung is further committing to Google's RCS standard, which is probably going  to help along those lines. Whoa, that's big. There's going to be a number of older Samsung  devices that will now work with Google's RCS technology, along with all new Samsung devices  going forward. Samsung obviously is the biggest manufacturer of Android devices. So this is,  yeah, it's kind of a big deal. If you're looking for broad support, this is a great way to cover  a heck of a lot of devices in one swoop. Now we just got to get the carriers kind of on board.  That's awesome. That's awesome. Kudos, Samsung. Yeah, not bad. Google's mobile app development  tool Fabric is going away. Well, it's not going away really. It's folding into Firebase, which is  Google's current mobile and app development platform. And so if you're using Fabric,  you should know that support for that is going to end mid 2019. But like I said,  that's going to fold into Firebase. So transition over to Firebase if you have not already.  And then air quality mapping via Street View cars has been happening for a while. They've  been testing it. They're now expanding this with 50 newly equipped Street View cars that are ready  to do this type of data collection. It allows them to kind of show snapshots at a moment of time of  air quality in a particular area that the car happens to be. That's kind of fuel for data  scientists to use with other air quality models. So kind of using these vehicles that they already  have out the fleet of cars already out there to generate data that could be really useful for  research and a whole lot more. I didn't get a chance to read this about the AMP project.  I'm wondering, Jeff, if you did. This is important. So and Leo over here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he can start his AMP rant. Not ant rant, AMP rant. So when Google started AMP, Accelerated Mobile  Pages, which we won't bother explaining again, I think you all know what it is. They said it would  be an open source project, but Google was running it. And the question always was the governance.  Now they have plenty of contributors to the code and they were open a lot of ways, but Google was  still the boss. Well, they've hit the point now. They say because it's scalable. I think it's also  just the right thing to do where they're opening it up. So there'll be a high Puba chamber of  contributors who will decide things and it'll be more open source, which I think will give it more  faith in the marketplace. So I think it's a good move. Even if you are messing up my email,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google, I said something nice about you. Every nice thing has to be balanced with a criticism.  That's how we make sure that Google continues to improve. And finally, YouTube gaming, that app  that apparently had no reason to exist outside of YouTube itself. I think Google is now realizing  that they released this app, YouTube gaming, to be kind of the home hub for gaming content with  YouTube. And I think now they're realizing that, hey, YouTube is a great place for that to be hosted.  So we'll put a tab in YouTube instead and you can get to it from there. So as far as I understand,  that's kind of the change that's being made. The YouTube gaming app is going to go away.  It's all going to be folded into the YouTube experience itself. And I'm guessing that  somewhere down the line, Google Play Music is folding into YouTube Music. Somewhere down the  line, they're going to make this realization with YouTube Music and then YouTube Music is going to  become a tab inside of YouTube. And it'll just be even that much more confusing. I don't fault them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for trying to silo the whole gaming platform, but it is what it is. Everybody's still just

This is the  Fortnite channel. These are all the people that are broadcasting with Fortnite. I just realized,  Kevin C. Toefel in the chat, says, bring it on. I'm trying to see if he has any sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  insight into what you were saying. This is really simple, Jeff. Just switch to Yahoo mail.  Oh, okay. There you go. There's your solution. Funny. Cool. Thank you for bringing the solution

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to Jeff's problem. This is how you troll folks. I'm going to switch to MCI mail.  And that is the Google change log.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like you, Kevin Toefel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see here. Before I get to the final ad and then we get to tips and tricks and anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said later on, he said, I joined late, so not sure what you were discussing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still well played. I think even if you didn't know, you knew because you played it very well.  Any last story that you want to get in there before we do the last ad?  Oh, okay. All right. All right.  I don't know. I just want to make sure that. Oh, I thought this was interesting. Path is going away.  Remember Path? Yeah, I do remember Path.  Path. It was a challenge on Facebook. Once almost bought by Google, if I remember correctly.  Google was going to buy Path and I'm not sure exactly what happened. Oh, yeah, that's right.  Tried to buy it for a hundred million dollars when it was just months old, says the TechCrunch article.  Wow. That was a mistake.  And oh, if you only knew at that point.  Really, when you're at that crossroads, you can go two different directions and  you can take the money now or you can bet on the future. Obviously, they bet on the future and  you don't know at that moment whether that was the right bet or not. But obviously.  This is true. Ask Vero.  A lot of companies bet on the future and doesn't happen. But anyways, they're going away. Any others?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so Mark Benioff spent one hundred and ninety million dollars buying Time Magazine  when he could have just subscribed to it for thirty dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He really wants to make sure he keeps getting the subscription delivered to his door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what I would do with Time Magazine. When was the last time you bought a Time Magazine?  Neither of you. Well, how many years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I don't even know. Too long. I don't know if I've ever bought a Time Magazine, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They always have some of the best photography, but I hardly ever pick up one to keep. But I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  their photographers. That used to be a powerhouse magazine. That was like a must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was, but who needs a general interest magazine anymore? So if the moguls out there,  if you're going to put big money into saving journalism, I got some ideas for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, just call me. Mark, hit Jeff up. He's got ideas.  OnePlus has a TV that they're going to release. That's kind of cool.  They're going to do a TV here pretty soon, I think. And you can actually help name it,  because they like to do their... Did they not learn from their previous mistakes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. The naming convention.  What was it? What was it? TV McTV box or something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, right. Or McTV pants or whatever. I don't think it's going to be the kind of thing where  the community votes and whatever it ends up being, they have to do it.  But I think they're opening it up for ideas. And if you're part of the community, you can  give your idea and maybe it'll be chosen. But yeah, I think they're giving themselves more control.  What are you showing us, Jeff? I don't know if you can see,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  barely see. There's turkeys and deer in my backyard. Wow.  There's some turkeys. That looks like my backyard.  And there's some deer just hanging out together. Dude, that is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Peace in the kingdom. I wish I could look out my window and see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  wildlife. That's every day at my house, too. I love the turkeys, best of all.  The deer are just tall rats that eat your shrubs. It's so normal to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't even blink, but that's awesome. Every once in a while, I catch turkeys walking down  the middle of the road here in Petaluma. There's like this pack of turkeys that  everybody's just used to seeing and they roam the city. It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turkeys travel in packs or is that just when they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know. There's like more than a couple of them together. So I don't know  if it's called a pack when you're talking about turkeys. What is it called then?  What do you call a flock of wild turkeys? A flock.  A flock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are called a rafter. Oh no, that's simply if they're domesticated. Wild turkeys are still a flock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're a flock. Okay. Thank you. Exclamation points, Tech News Weekly, and packs. These are  the three mistakes I have made on today's episode of This Week in Google. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  their support of this week in Google. All right. Shout out for Wink. What's that? I like this.  One shout out for Wink. I like the fact that most of the time I drink Scotch whiskey or what have  you, but I wanted to try Wink. And of course I couldn't go through all of those bottles of wine.  I'm not a total wino. And it was time for my next box to ship, but they have that built-in service  that says, you know what, if you just want to pause it for a minute here, just hit pause.  And we're not going to ship you anything right now. We're not going to bill you anything right  now. When it comes around for the time again, we're going to send the next box out to you,  but we'll give you a little bit of time. I like that. Yeah. You can kind of put it on pause and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pick it up when you need to. Right on. Okay. So Ant, why don't we give you first stab here?  What is your stuff? It's in here is Ant's stuff. What you got? Oh, you're muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I keep hitting that button. Sorry. How do you do that?  Jeez. I wanted to mention- Just a strong silent type.  The Hurricane Florence that recently passed by here in the Carolinas, specifically North Carolina.  You mentioned earlier about Google saying that you can make a donation in Google, match that.  And I'm all for that, but there's something else that I think that needs to be considered is  is giving blood. I don't know where everybody stands on that, but there's a lot of people that  were injured and hurt and it's pretty serious. And a lot of times the blood banks, they need  able-bodied people that can give blood to help save lives in these serious situations like this. So  if you can and you're able, hit up your local blood bank and just say, Hey, I'm here to give  a pint of blood and help somebody out that's in need. If you don't want to do that, then definitely  by all means send $10 to the Red Cross or somebody to help out all of those that are affected by  Hurricane Florence and how slow she moved over our region, one mile per hour. It was brutal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Can't even imagine. That's a really, really good point. There are many different ways that you  can give to doing it in times of disaster and all this kind of stuff. It doesn't just have to be  money. Some people would prefer not to give money, right? If you give blood, you know it's going  directly to the cause. Depending on where you're sending your money, people might not have that,  you know, the utmost confidence really just depends. So that's a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Excellent. Jeff, what's your number? So this won't surprise people, I'm afraid. Nearly half of cell  phone calls will be scams by 2019, says a report. And these are also scams that practice what we  call neighbor spoofing, where you think, oh, this call must be okay because it looks like my call  because it has the same area code and the same exchange. But no, it's a spoofed number and it's  a recorded voice or a robo voice or whatever, or just a bozo voice. And it's making  telephoning unusable, not just cell phones, but also home phones on planet two. Just while I was  on the show, I saw two, luckily the phone company now says they're spam, but it's gotten awful.  Telephoning has now become useless. So that was a happy way to end the day, but don't fall for any

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  scams people. That's crazy. The amount of phone calls that you get with your area code or something  that's close to you or whatever. And it just, it really sucks when you're waiting for a call from  someone that you know you don't have in your book, like maybe a business is going to call you back  or whatever. Then you get that call that's unidentified, you pick it up and there's like  a three second pause and then the click and then they'll, we're calling because we've been trying,  they're notifying you, blah, blah, blah. It's like, ah, I've been taken. I remember I was on with you,  Jeff, and I think Stacey was on that episode too. This was a couple of months ago and I showed off  the Google phone app and they made a change where you can go in there and you can  redirect identified spam calls from directly within the app so that it never hits your phone.  Has that cut down? Cause it's totally cut down on my phone. Yes. I used to get way more calls and  now I get far fewer. And it's specifically- Do you want to repeat how to do that again for folks?  Here, let me not show it. I need to see that feature. Let's see here. It's not blocked numbers.  So if you go in, okay, so this should be good to show. I don't know if you have my over the  overhead shot. So I'm in Google's phone app. I'm not going to go back out because then you'll see  all my calls and everything, but if you go into the settings of the Google phone app, there's the  caller ID and spam. When you go into their filter spam calls, you want that on. And I think it's,  if you haven't ever switched it on, it's off by default. Yeah. Mine is off. Okay. So switch that  on. And it totally has helped for me. I used to get so many calls every day and I get the big red  banner, identified spam, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. I see so many red screens all the time. It's annoying.  Yeah. And so that's Google's identification that triggers that red screen. This is taking it the  next step to say if they already know that it's a spam and they would normally show you the red  screen instead, they're just going to prevent it from even ringing your phone. It might go to your  voicemail, but you won't see it ever. And the other thing is in your history, if you long,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so you go to your history of phone calls, if you long press on the phone number,  you can block and report a spam that number. Oh yeah. Yeah. I do try to do that. Right. So  between the two of them, yeah, it has helped. It still happens. It does. Yeah. Calls definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  still get through, but minimizing them to sane levels really does help. Yep. Speaking of blocking  things, my app that I'm going to show off today was actually on last night's episode of all about  Android. Last night's guest, Rose Bajar from Android police showed it off and it's actually,  it's a great app. So it's worth, sorry, my voice is going, it's worth featuring here. It's a 99  cent app called bouncer and the, and you can see there bouncer temporary app permissions.  The idea behind it is that you, you might not always want permissions for an app to be open.  And so what happens is that if I happen to, let's see here, so this is the fortnight installer,  right? Device. Would you like to remove this permission? Okay. So I shouldn't have to do that.  So if I go into fortnight installer, let's see if I can show this off the way I did last night.  It's probably just going to work totally differently now because I'm trying to  demonstrate it a second time. So it'll go in here. Have I already, I may have already, uh,  given the permission for this. So fortnight installer, it's unlocked. It's unknown. Okay.  So if I was to go into bouncer and say that this is okay, keep the permission so it can write the  device files. I might be getting this backwards. So my apologies if I am. See here update.  No, it's not doing it. So what it's supposed to do is it's supposed to recognize that you're  opening a permission for an app. And then the second you hit home, it would undo that permission  change. And I think I'm getting it, getting it twisted up and showing it off. If you want to see  an actual demonstration of this watch last night's all about Android. I promise this was not a,  she was a great guest on there. Yeah. No, Rose was great. But the idea behind it is that if you  have it running perfectly on your apps, then it's working in the background. So when you go to use  this, this particular app and it wants access to your camera and you don't want it to always  have access to that camera, but you don't mind it having it now, you can temporarily grant access  to that app for the camera. And then the second that you hit a home to exit that app at the end  of your session, it will change that permission back. So, so it's like a temporary, I mean,  it's exactly what it describes. It's a temporary app permission switch. And, uh, I'm, I'm not doing a  very good job of demonstrating it, but you should check it out for yourself. I did it properly last  night and it was kind of cool that it just kind of happens in the background. It's 99 cents and  it's just kind of a cool way to kind of keep control of your permissions in a different way.  It's called bouncer and, uh, yeah, check it out. But that is, uh, I think that's it. I think we've  reached the end of Octo Thorpe life as it were. Uh, and this is a lot of fun and, uh, Pruitt really  appreciate you, you hop it on today and, and hanging out with us for a while. Oh, it is my

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  pleasure and an honor. Trust me. Truly an honor. Cool. And underscore always great to have your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  friend on Twitter. And of course you write for tech republic.com. You've got, uh, more stuff coming  all over CBS interactive. It sounds like so, uh, best thing like there. You're also doing  photography, doing a lot of the drone photography stuff. I have this product right here that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  sent to me. Um, I, I recorded a little quick first look earlier today, but it is a horrendous video  and my edit was crap. So I'm going to have to rerecord and maybe I'll get that first look up  tonight on my YouTube channel. What was that controller? What is it? That is called the loop  deck plus, uh, last year the company sent me their original model and I reviewed it.  And it's the console that you use with Adobe lightroom to help give you more of an analog feel  for processing your, your images, you know, instead of using your mouse to click on the sliders and  stuff like that. You can use this device that has knobs on it to make it a little more natural for  you. Yep. Unfortunately, it doesn't really work well for my type of editing because I like to use  a wake up tablet and a stylist because I do brush strokes and things like that in my photos.  But as of today, they had a firmware update that allows this device to work with lightroom,  adora, um, Aurora HDR, capture one beta, and now with Adobe premiere pro. So I'm looking forward  to trying this out far as color grade in my videos, because it would be nice to be able to  use knobs and stuff to try to make sure you have skin tones right in your videos. So this,  it's going to be fun. It's going to take me, you know, a week or so to review it, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking forward to it. That's cool. Yeah. It really reminds me of a lot, like in the, in the  audio world, you can get these audio controllers, these, you know, I mean, it looks very similar to  an audio controller and the trick with those always is like, yes, they promise a lot and there's a lot  of capability within them, but you have to stick with them long enough to kind of rewrite your  processes. Your approach for working with tools has to change on a fundamental level to include  that control surface for you to really get maximum benefit out of it. And that takes a little bit of  time and a little bit of effort to make that happen. But once you know, recently, I recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  did a video about premiere pro and it's keyboard shortcuts. And because I hate using a mouse,  you know, I used to spend a whole lot of time in the Linux, so I never really saw a mouse.  But when I'm doing video editing and I can just use keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the  screen, it makes that edit so much faster. So I'm a little nervous about pulling this device in,  but at the same time, I'm like, Ooh, those knobs will make it easier to make my skin just really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pop on the screen. You know, right on. So people will be able to find your, your kind of video  walkthrough that where would they find that on tech Republic? No, this is going to be on YouTube. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  have a write up already. I don't know if they put it up today or not on tech Republic, but I'm going  to do my video on my YouTube channel. Just go to youtube.com slash and prove it. It's pretty much  the channel based on getting beginners started in the world of digital content creation. I don't  always talk about photography. I also talk about videos and every now and then I talk about writing  because sometimes it takes a little work to get something on the page and publish. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. Right on. Well, and appreciate it and best of luck with, with that. And we'll, we'll keep  tuned into to read that once it's all right. And watch it. Jeff Jarvis. Great to have you back, man.  Are you still upset with the whole Gmail thing? Yes, I am. I really am. This is, this is, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a big deal. All these, all these apps, I'm sorry, one last time, all these apps, users you have out  there, all these, all these G suite users you have out there and all the Chromebooks you're selling,  think this through Google. Jeez, think like a customer. You used to do that. I'm disappointed  in you. I'm leaving it there. If you come back and tell me how I'm being stupid, that'll be fine.  It will fix it. But be okay. You'd be forgiven right now. I'm not happy. Jeff Jarvis, not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, thank you once again, sir. It's always red buzz machine.com to check in on his latest rants.  And then me, I'm just here at twit, you know, doing my twit thing. I'll be on new screensavers  this weekend. And of course, tech news weekly, which I already kind of slid in there earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't intentional, but there you go. Yeah, sure. It's a plug. We know it.  Using our show for yours. You really see where your loyalties are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I swear it was just, it was an accident. And then next week I start, I take over know how. I've got  a season of know how and an announcement on that coming up very soon. So that'll, that'll hit the  know how feed early next week, I think will be kind of a teaser on that actually might even be  part of tomorrow's episode with Megan and flows last episode of know how for this kind of segment  that they've section that they've been doing on IOT. So, so if you want to watch that, you know,  check it out in the next couple of days, it'll hit the feed and we'll all be there through the  end of the year and then we'll see what we do from there. So looking forward to that. But Leo  is going to be back next week. So if you've been waiting for Leo to come back to this week in  Google, you're going to get your wish.
