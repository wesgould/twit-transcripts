It's about the future the future my friends  As it includes Google Facebook Twitter the internet the Internet of things  That's because we've got the great Stacey Higginbotham on a regular basis. She's the expert on IOT at Stacey on IOT comm  That's where a newsletter and podcast live. Hello Stacey  Hello  And I'm happy  Normally Jeff Jarvis would be here, but he is in Davos hobnobbing with the president  And Rupert Murdoch that should be fun. There's a room I'd like to be in  So and we thought we would get him on if we could from Switzerland  But you know, it's late at night there and he says there's more interesting conversations

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he doesn't but I'm sure there are I'm sure he's thinking it and he would be right to to be honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're in Davos, why yeah, you could do this anytime  but the good news is  To fill Jeff's seat today. We've got the great Matthew Ingram  from the Columbia Journalism Review  Hello Matthew good to see you. Good to see you too. Wearing his newsgeist shirt proving that he is a Googler  a Google Angular. Was that is that in Arizona? Was that in Arizona this year?  It is yeah, they have one in Arizona every year and then there's one that moves around  In conjunction with the Knight Foundation. Yeah  Matthew we should say Matthew and Stacey work together not once but twice  We sure did  Giga home and fortune and it was great both times and their refugees  From those and they are here with us today and twit makes three so it is three times. You're right come to think of it  Yeah, that's right. Yeah  It's a third time lucky did you I you know, there's a lot of we could talk about, you know  Android 8.1 showing Wi-Fi speeds and YouTube TV having less than 300,000 subscribers  And Facebook giving people a chance to rate news organizations and we'll get to all of that  But I I was kind of captivated by Steve Yeggy's post this morning on medium. Yeah  And I thought that he raised some really interesting issues why I left Google  to join Grab  He was an engineer at Google a well-known engineer at Google for 13 years and  He left because he says Google is no longer innovating. They're  Chasing competitors instead of serving customers  Gatekeeping and risk aversion are Google at Google are the norm rather than the exception

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he's got a point yeah, I think he's got a point  I mean I he put into words obviously I don't work at Google but he put into words some of the things  That I've thought about things Google is doing there's a lot more  risk aversion there's a lot more kind of you know, do the things that are safe and and kind of  Incremental stuff and I miss I mean we've talked about this before I miss the old Google where the moon shots and right  You know the stuff where they were doing things  Because they wanted to change something for the better not just because they wanted to sort of make incremental revenue  He brings up, you know all of the kind of failed Google initiatives like Google Plus and alo and reader and hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and and you know, I mean we talk about it sometimes too, but he also says and I agree with this  I love the people at Google. They're super smart and world-class and always humble  Individuals he says Google though has gotten less humble  He says company strategy is a mess Google know Googlers people work at Google  Googlers people work in there know this is happening. They're as frustrated by it as you are, but their leadership is  Failing them and that's mostly because Google has become a hundred percent competitor focused rather than customer focused  But I'd say this is the innovators dilemma. Anyway, I mean this is this this also strikes me as a very

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  engineering  oriented like oh, yeah, as  I mean as any company and I was on this side  I mean, I remember showing up at Giga own one day at our home office and there were like 80 people there and I was  Like what the heck happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And even then I had very similar complaints. I'm like, oh we don't focus on the important stuff  everyone wants us to focus on this other stuff and part of that is  It is part of be it's moving from being a company that has created something really amazing  to  being a company that  Shelters and protects what they've created that was amazing and then tries to continue building and this is inevitable again the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the lifecycle of a well  Something different well, it's related though. The innovators dilemma is that once you're making this  Well, but yes, but the problem is it's I think it's psychological in every way once you're a success  It's hard to throw away the success right and approach the next thing with beginners mind you you don't want to cannibalize  your existing  product  And it's hard for you to see the opportunities that exist

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's and I think maybe maybe it was naive to think that Google  Could kind of avoid that or would be able to kind of continue being the same kind of company it was before  But I still sort of miss it in a way. I mean, oh, yeah, that's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adolescent viewpoint and I think this is part of like  I'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  James Day more memo minus the sexism

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean maybe I think this is endemic to both Silicon Valley and to a class of people  who are  disruptors and I think  This is a very important class of people to have I don't want to denigrate this but we've kind of in  The tech world put this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're totally you're totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think if you're that kind of person, yes that would drive it and you move on to us you go to a new startup

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so you're saying this is a middle-aged company and this is what you do you yeah, and that's fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it  That's that's a life cycle that all companies go through just like people can't stay adolescents forever  Like you might want to but you see that, you know  45 year old guy with you know a toupee and his  20 year old girlfriend in the red sports car and you're like buddy. You're not fooling anybody. Yeah, just  Mature, I don't know. I mean that's that's my thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I actually think Google to be fair does do a pretty good job of continuing to do stuff that is  you know, not just  Incrementally protecting their business but they so they're still doing lots of stuff  That's interesting and they're still doing lots of stuff that but I I mean I sympathize with this guy's point  Maybe he's just not cut out for Google like it is now. He wants to be a startup

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, that's kind of what he says, which is fun. He was at Amazon for seven years before he went to  Google he does talk though. I thought this is kind of interesting about  Being at Amazon and hearing Jeff Bezos in 1999 saying we're dead  and  I thought that was really kind of an interesting  Both both you have to say both Amazon and Google have are well aware of the problem and have done what they can  To prevent it in Google's case  They kind of every line of business is treated like a startup has to justify its existence its revenue  You know, they really wanted everybody to act like a startup even in a big company  for Amazon, I think it's it actually starts at the top with with  Jeff just spanking people a lot  Literally, well, maybe I don't know we don't know anyway, there's lots of tears we know that let's not go there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And things are getting faster wasn't a Justin Trudeau who just did a speech about how this is the slowest  We're going to be innovating for like the next hundred years at this we're innovating so fast right now, but it's the slowest  We're gonna be innovating. Wow, the next you know, I think you think that's accurate. That's really interesting  I do  You know, he's he's Prime Minister of Canada. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a reason he's got ministers it's a reasonable projection. I mean that's what it that's what Ray Kurzweil  Said in his book the singularity. Yes near is that  the pace of growth is  Is is exponential that not it's not it's not a straight line, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a hockey and it's not just it not it's not just that change is occurring quickly  But the rate of change is increasing as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sleep and now Ray unlike Justin Trudeau, but maybe Justin read the book in that book  He has graph after graph after graph showing hockey sticks basically in in many sectors of the economy  And so I think that that's that's fair to say so what that means is if you looked ahead  Yeah, everything's gonna be growing at a faster faster rate

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If anything that means companies like Google should be  More adaptable or they should be trying to evolve faster instead of getting less adaptable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has done. I mean he talks about spanner and Waymo  Does he talk about like TPUs and the work that Google's done on machine learning? Good point  I mean, yes  They have been neck-and-neck with Facebook and maybe Facebook was a little bit ahead of them for a while  But Google had Jeff Hinton right actually before  Facebook hired Yon LaCoon who now is in second and command there. So like I  Can selectively look at a lot of things and say that that was dumb or that but I don't know  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do think that they're particularly machine learning as far as  Google's kind of smart assistant stuff is concerned that is looking forward  I think there's gonna be stuff they're doing there is gonna be applicable in a whole range of ways that we haven't even discovered yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe to this point just a minute ago  Steven Gillette announced that Google was going to spin off one of its ex  companies Chronicle  Which is a security company and their goal is to  Speed up security to speed and impact a security teamwork by a factor of ten  To keep up I guess with this with the speed up in the security flaws  That that couldn't be more timely that's the kind of thing I mean, yeah, that's it so act this is Google X  They have their moonshots. This was one of them and  They founded it in 2016 and a year and a half later now they're  Watching it as a company. So maybe maybe maybe you're right. You know what? I think Stacy that you that's well put  This is a particular kind of person  Who needs a certain kind of company to scratch his itch? Yeah, and admittedly Google is not that company anymore  But that's not that's normal. It's not necessarily a it's not and this is the key  Is it a bad thing or not? It's not necessarily a bad thing  It's just a middle-aged company without the toupee the red sports car in the young

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna say something about Silicon Valley and ageism. I do think that's a very big thing for Silicon Valley. They focus very much on  Disruption at the expense sometimes of scale and scaling in a mature fashion and I think  Part of that is because Silicon Valley tends to hire  younger and  Get rid of or not rehire older. So I think that might be kind of those two things are related

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think as an old person, you know, I'm in favor of people respecting  wisdom and  Grey hairs and all that other stuff  but I also think it's a it's a tough challenge for a company like Google or Microsoft or Amazon to  To keep enough of those types of people around  and and in places where they can  experiment and achieve interesting things and  Because you need them, right? You can't have just all those people but you need them  But they need to be in certain roles and then you need other people who are gonna do the boring stuff  To keep the business going so you gotta have that mix that that's the big problem at Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that everybody wants to be working on the next shiny new thing and nobody wants to maintain the existing code base?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right and that's that's a problem with I mean that's a problem endemic  I actually wrote about this a couple weeks ago  But that's a problem endemic to IT in a lot of ways and as we bring and I'll bring Internet of Things in here  but as we bring IT and  sensors  Into old-school industries like utilities and nuclear power plants and blah blah blah  That is a huge culture clash because these people are like no, I don't want the new thing  I've got to keep this running and ah  What is this agile move fast and break stuff? No get out of my get out of my nuclear power

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there was a lot of criticism of Google. I remember certain products, you know many of whose names I forget  Where they got a criticism for you know  Remember that thing remember that thing that you kind of built into your user base. Well, it's gone now and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So good luck actually Yagi writes a follow-up post or a follow-up post today in medium  Saying I'm getting lots of calls from reporters  Asking me for a hot take on my claim that Google has lost the ability to innovate  But I'm since I'm busy. I'm gonna just most big companies don't innovate at a large scale. That's normal  You have two perfectly valid alternatives for responding to market shifts  You can acquire the innovator or one of their competitors or you can build your own competing product and compete head-to-head  Acquisitions happen all the time Google buying YouTube Facebook buying Instagram Amazon buying Twitter all good examples  And then he's talking about he's talking also about where he sees the next big thing, which is I think  Truthfully the more interesting half of the memo because he's explaining why he's going to grab which is a ride-hailing startup in Southeast Asia  But he says that in in the Southeast Asia where cash it's mostly a cash economy  People live on their smartphones  there's an opportunity not just for ride-hailing food delivery and  At some point once you've got your once people have you have to have your grab app on their phone  Payments  So he's got interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Roadmap, he's totally right about that. Yeah. Yeah  I mean there's an argument to be made that lots of those countries by kind of leapfrogging straight to mobile, right?  without going through the intervening periods that we did have actually  Accelerated like they're actually now on the leading edge instead of catching up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well the US is a classic example of the opposite not catching up and I think to be honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe we don't want to get into this  But I think you could argue that that kind of move fast and break things  mentality  When when it's done at a company you say the size of Facebook can have some significant negative impacts  I mean, they've been moving fast and breaking democracy, you know, which isn't really the kind of thing you want to encourage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just read an article. I thought it was very interesting  Or maybe was a Twitter a tweet  But somebody pointed out that all of the people who were involved at the beginning of Facebook even including Mark Zuckerberg  but  Are basically don't use Facebook like normal people do they very you know limited or no experience  you know, and of course who was it was it Sean Parker and others who've  Decried social media and Chimath. Yeah, yeah  and  None of them use Facebook  So we're just the suckers who are still using it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and didn't Tim Cook say that he would never let his nephew use a social network, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very famously Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids have iPads  You know, he thought that they should grow up without technology. So  Maybe they know maybe the Silicon Valley knows something that we don't know something. I will say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the kids and technology  This is a thing that I've noticed and then I talked to some of my friends who are not in my  Who are out of town? So their kids are not friends with my kid, but my daughter spends all day long  She doesn't actually she hates her phone. She has a phone for like emergency calls  She never remembers to charge it. She doesn't want to look at it  She doesn't want to text anyone and her friends have phones too, and they're very similar  And I don't know if this is an age thing, but instead, you know, she walks when she gets home  She goes upstairs to her room and just turns on  Hangouts and gets on hangouts with their friends and they just hang out  But they don't actually talk to each other right and they don't always have the video on  Some of them will have their video in all the time. That's it. That's just with each other. That's a yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's parallel play on the internet. Yeah, that's interesting because that's what my kids did particularly  Abby the older one so she that was ten years ago  They would be doing homework with but they have video of everybody on the screen and they'd all be doing  And then they could chat I did that that is very they wanted to yeah, it's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so I'm like looking at  That and I'm like, huh?  She she likes having the am I mean it's basically like having your friend ambiently in your room via technology  And you know, she she goes downstairs to dinner and comes back to them  So I'm she hates carrying the phone and she hates being  She does not want to be instantly accessible via text or pick up the phone  I mean if I if I ping her like I use the madam a and I'm like  Hang out or drop in on  My daughter's name, she'll do it, but she'll talk to me for a brief second, but it's very strange  I just I don't know either way. Maybe she gets old. I there was a company. Go ahead. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People I guessed  I was just gonna say there was a company  I can't even remember the name of it, but I wanted to do this at Gagelman had a bunch of remote offices  They set up a giant  Was a Facebook on a card  No, this wasn't a wall of Skype this was a window they called it  So it literally just had a camera in their remote office and people would just walk by and they would wave or you could talk  To them very common. Yeah, it was just like a window that you so there was no  You didn't have to go and do things in the window and they didn't have Skype hangouts and they didn't have conference calls  It was literally just to wave or to you know, it was just a virtual window into the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that was you go to meeting and that was a big use case for go to meeting  They would just leave it running all day. Yeah, so the people in remote offices would just be part of the and I guess  That's I mean looking at you. Look how I mean I'm sitting here by myself  You guys are on Skype. I mean, this is how we do our shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One day I'll have the tactile punch Leo button. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think this is for that reason alone. This is the better way of doing things  You can't like it more virtual I don't think this is bad at all. This has become I  Mean, I know I'm sure I'm sure  Biologists and sociologists would say oh no. No. No, it's a it's a it's a not a full experience  You know you somehow it's missing  Something but I I think it's pretty close. Well, yeah, it is sure it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think we have more we have more variety of experiences now, whereas it used to be totally binary  Are you you're in Canada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey's in Texas. I'm in California, but we can have a roundtable conversation  Admittedly, it's always better if you're all here, but that's that's it's hard to do exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And before you had to be in a room physically with someone and then you know  The telephone and the telegraph and so on extended things now, we've just got more ways to interact  I know my my wife used to talk about our daughter and say I wish she would you know  Go play with her real friends instead of spending real time online  But but for her those were real real friends and she was spending time with them. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  I kind of prefer it  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true, you know, you don't know if I've taken a shower today so I don't need well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it. I'm basically not wearing pants. Yeah, I mean, you know, there's a lot more freedom

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I remember what a shock it was when I found out that Terry gross on fresh air rarely is in the same room with her  Yeah, you guess they never say that but most of the time people are at another public radio station

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've done that and it's  All of those weird yeah people who are good at it can make you feel as though you can't they can erase that distance

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if I feel if you didn't have video of the show for those of you listening in audio if I mean  I don't think there's Skype is good enough now that I don't think there's a much of a difference between you being in studio or not  Anyway, Jeff and I get when we talk when it works  That's that is the big thing  But you know if you don't know what to listen for you wouldn't even know that but you're right  That's one of the reasons people talk  We get people complain all the time about people talking over each other and they know that's because they don't know we're all it's  It's all there's right. They're all latent. I by the way, I say see I'm a little bit. I  Can't say mad at you. I'm a little bit mad  I'm a little bit grateful because I got went out and got those hue ambient lights that you talked about the hue goes  And I like those yes, and then I had to get a base station to control them  And then I had to get a few more bulbs and then that wasn't enough and I have more bulbs coming  Well, it's funny cuz I had had you when they first came out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the richer colors are so much everything's better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I and then I had it like the Sun when the Sun went down my my TV room would light up and and stuff and then when  I moved I didn't you know  I put them in a box but it set them up and I very recently actually gave them away to somebody and  Now I'm all now they sucked me back in again  But it's great in my office  You know what?  I'm not gonna put them in the bedroom because as you know if the power goes out and comes back the Hughes are on full  And I've told the story before as I apologize if you heard it before but I I'm like, oh  What happened? I when I got my phone and I'm trying to find the hue app and Lisa said dummy and went and turned the lights off  Because they were smart woman, yeah dummy  But I I kind of I'm not gonna put them in the bedroom, but I kind of I kind of like it  And I want to do the ambient. What is that environmental thing where the TV matches the oh, yeah, that's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now they're pushing that so I did it years ago when they launched it with sharknado  we

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was you have only problem with as you have to watch sharknado

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so my husband and I we pop some popcorn and we decided cheesy movie night  Turned on the Hughes  You had to actually have the app open and listening to your television  So I knew where it was but it was awesome because when the thunder would happen your Hughes would go from  Like lightning and then when the shark bit into a person cool the lights go red. It was so campy  It was like it took it up like now to 11 speaking of latency

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there any I mean that would be no good if you're watching TV and three seconds later. It does that no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was right on  It was right along with the soundtrack and they've done now they've got it much better. It's much nicer  They built like an SDK for directors

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're kidding. So somebody's doing the hue mix when he does the audio mix. He's doing the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so yes, I'm  So I but you have to put it in with like the movie  People have to put it in so it's only gonna be a few things at first that are optimized for I noticed that they gave

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me a number of channels that I can use  With it, so I guess so  Apparently it syncs up with cocoa  Here's some here's a video of the hue lights. Let me see. Do we get the  So so those are the those are the orbs behind there  We were talking about the go. Oh look

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Lou

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phillips did this with the television a while back, but now it's doing it with the actual content

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, what's the experience like is it feel like a better experience  Um, I guess for sharknado, it's great for sharknado

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also with I mean sharknado just they were like how campy can we make this by golly and it really did it made it  Much more fun. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. I was like the first time the lightning flashed. I was like cool  And and then I giggled forever, you know whenever the cheesy effects happened so  There are more subtle things like it would be nice like imagine like watching alien or something scary your lights kind of we're giving this  This clue in it it just kind of more immerses you in it. Is it make or break? No  Will it matter for something like cocoa? I don't know. Maybe a kid will like it  I mean they think those things to like kid books right now. You can read your child a story to a Disney book and  You know, the hue light will turn colors with the pages on I mean, it's kind of silly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't sure what it's gonna take to set that up, but I have plenty of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Devices well, I will tell you your other thing. I'm sure you have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let me have the hub I have the the the goes and then I have a bunch of bulbs and they're all in my den  I have one in my I mean, I know Stacey gets a referral for you for everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't I don't get anything for this. It is cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when you hear it with Google Home or Amazon's echo, so it's cool that I could say echo turn on the lights in the den  Mmm, that's pretty. Yeah, that's pretty neat  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be and if you do the echo if that echo is only in your den and you group those lights with that echo  You can actually just say turn on the lights and it will turn on the light explains it because I go to the kitchen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I say echo turn on the lights in the den. She says I don't know what you're talking about  So so I must have paired it to a particular echo  Oh  Confusing here's a video  We just got dimmer switches up here. So Patrick Delahanty has given me a video from a gadget of  sharknado  There you go. Sci-fi sync. Oh  blood red. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My I don't know about that. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can't be fun  Maybe I'm old but no, it's it's purely cheese  It's awesome cheese

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now this is remember on a they're watching on a MacBook here  So it's a tiny screen if you had a big screen, it wouldn't be the lights would not be overpowering  The video like they are and a big screen it'd be the lights would be accident. What are we watching sharknado, baby?  Oh, okay. Sorry. I'm not that I know it just that's what it says. I haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look a Ferris wheel has gotten loose  That's a quality film right there. Well the title says it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, oh Hugh disco, that's what you need for that is you disco. It's a four dollar app. It's on Android and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thought I had to buy more lights

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything you play if I  It'll do different lighting patterns. So all of our dance parties. That's like a light

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so can you do an actual disco though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like a disco ball. I have one of those too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a party at Stacey's house. Oh wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm reading a wonderful book that Jeff Jarvis recommended from Kurt Anderson  Who was one of the founders of spy magazine has been around and it's called fantasy land 400 years of  fantasy in America and it ties right into something that's always bugged me which is that we are we are all  adolescents now right between cosplay and Star Wars and  Action figures even full-grown geeks are acting like 12 year olds, right true

I'm sorry  It's it's stressful  I mean if some guy wants to spend his weekends making a giant mech suit that he can wear to go to some  Cosplay event. I don't care. I think that's great, you know  Okay, so you'll be at a bar drinking watching football

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can we talk more about Chronicle? Cuz I still don't yes other than using Google's infrastructure to  Scan your data to detect security risks. What's  It's just is that it  This is this is where like I was reading about it and I'm like  I'm gonna have to talk to somebody at Google cuz I I don't I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't understand what's two services security intelligence and analytics platform for enterprises  And an online malware and virus scanner called virus total. Oh, wait a minute. I know virus total  Yeah, that's been around for a long time Google acquired that  In 2012 mm-hmm. I have to say Google has a very good reputation  for  Finding zero days. In fact, it was a Google research team that found among others, but they found Spectre and meltdown  Mm-hmm, and  Maybe this repute they're trying to capitalize on this reputation  We talk all the time  About Google's security research teams, I don't know if they'll be in Chronicle or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's I mean they're saying that you have access to Google's info  So this is gonna be built on Google's infrastructure. So it is  But then it sounds like you would give them all your business data and they would use their infrastructure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is kind of what it sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm not trying to be snarky. I would you just trying to understand what it is. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually though if you're a CIO at a fortune 500 company  You're scared to death right maybe it maybe not a fortune 500 because you've got the resources  But maybe a fortune 1000 or even a smaller company you're scared to death  Because you see all these other come Merck took  last year three hundred million dollar write-off  because of  want to cry ransomware  I mean, this is terrifying you look at what happens Sony Pictures Entertainment  You look at what happened to  Sheldon Adelson's casino back-end company. I  Mean, these are companies big enough companies to have absolutely great security and they're not doing so  I think there's probably a fairly hefty market set for people saying help and  I think you'd probably trust Google that there's an answer at  Actually, I've wondered this for some time is there ever been any record of Google's security failing  Not that I can think of even Apple, you know with the iCloud hacks  Has it has a bad tracker? I can't think of a single breach of Google services or systems not one been hushed up  Now now Matthew do you don't have any evidence of that?  What would they say at the CJR  Fake news. Well, it's possibly it's possible, but I you know nowadays I don't think you can hush stuff up  I I don't think there has been and I think that's one of the few companies you can talk talk about  Even Facebook's had you know  Slip ups remember Mark Zuckerberg's private photos got posted to his public timeline

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's never happened to my knowledge at Google both Google and Amazon seemed to have I can't think of anything with Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So either actually come to think of it so I could see why you would trust Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I mean until well, you're desperate you're desperate is the issue though is how far is Google getting encroached on your?  Day-to-day business. So kind of the issue that companies who are in the logistics space are now thinking about with Amazon  They're like, oh, maybe I don't want to give Amazon on my data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually and people are gonna point out well Google owns Android don't they and there have been plenty of Android exploits out there so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  maybe not to mention all the major tech companies have  You know have been handing data to the government pretty regularly. Yeah, they can't help it if they ask nicely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Pfizer did get Pfizer did get renewed or the section set. Yes, 702 the Pfizer is super secret  Yeah now  Check me if I'm wrong is I read that that only  Effects  Foreign nationals overseas nobody in the US at all not even for nationals in the US, right? I don't know  Not sure about that the reason and the reason I read that is because  That's why the president was glad to sign it because it wasn't involved in spying on his campaign, right?  702 under authority  Oh, no, innocent Americans may be caught in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  upstream surveillance or provided they're not the target right so they can be sort of  Caught in the net or all damage provided there. So 702 says collection of foreign intelligence from non-americans

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  located outside the United States  so you can't obviously you cannot target Americans, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can happen to get some information from them accidentally, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if for instance you were to call the Russian ambassador in Russia  from Trump Tower  That call would be swept up. It's supposed to be  Masked the American is supposed to be masked. Yeah, there was an excellent good wife on this  I get all my best stuff from good wife. Yeah  So 702 which would have sunset it has been renewed to for another five years, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because basically every all the security establishments and  Intelligence agencies said we really really need it and you don't want to do this to be even though we can't tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Specifically what we've done with it or whether it works or not. I mean if you're a member of Congress or a senator  You don't want to be the guy who voted against that and there's some massive terrorist attack, right? You don't want to be responsible  You don't be soft

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some good news  Out of the great state of Montana. It is okay, Montana. All right, let's talk about that  Which is where Karsten Bondi apparently is we're gonna talk about Burger King and we could talk about Burger King  Is there net neutrality at Burger King?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Net neutrality, so I'll give you what I you know, maybe it's the good news state of Montana  Has voted that  If you want to do business in Montana as an internet service provider you have to have net you have to be net neutral

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good thing right what's what could possibly that's that's definitely good news if all the states do this if

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  California did it it would be a big thing Montana's  Populous, but it's not like Montana. I'm just saying that Montana like a rural area  Most of them don't want to serve rural areas anyway because it's highly expensive  You know if they can get out of that they would so imagine if  You're like you have to be net neutral. They're like, oh, okay. Never mind. Bye. Bye. You know, it's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was an executive order the governor Stephen Bullock  Just declared Monday that any internet service provider with a state government contract ah  Cannot block or charge more for faster delivery of websites to any customer in the state  I mean, however, of course remember the FCC said we don't want the states to make their own rules  Right, so there could be legal challenges

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I admire them for doing that. I mean, it's I think it's still worthwhile that they that they're even trying to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's better than lots of places and then this one Randall's Randall Stevenson of the CEO of AT&T  Said AT&T is committed. They bought big full-page ads in a bunch of newspapers  Saying they want net neutrality AT&T is committed to an open internet. We don't block websites. We don't know online content  We don't throttle discriminator grade network performance based on content. They want zero rating

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and they also want Facebook and Google their arch nemesis is nemesis. I don't know  nemesis  To be subject to regulations as well. They are trying to write this is their okay. I go for that  Damn it. It's a wrong. It's it's a different they need to be regulated in a different way  I'm not gonna argue that we should not do some form of regulation over like maybe data monopolies  I actually had a guest on my podcast talking about  What an anti competitive regime for the 21st century looks like and it was really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to know when you read that it's AT&T you have you scratch your head and go  Okay, what are they up to because they have never been really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they want theirs they want their definition of net neutrality. So their definition includes  Allows them to do things like zero rating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I think should not be allowed they they want the Congress to pass and which by the way  I think the congressional solution is the right solution if you get if you can get congressional agreement and we're one vote away in the  Senate, but that doesn't mean it's given close to passing in that house  Congressional action rights AT&T is needed to establish an internet bill of rights that applies to all internet companies  by which they mean us and  the information services and guarantees neutrality transparency openness  Non-discrimination and privacy protection for all internet users, you know, I don't tell me why that's a bad thing Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so my my issue is  regulating ISPs net neutrality is a solution for  Provide a lack of competition. It's it's a lack of competition at an infrastructure level  Now it is the right solution  So common carriage type of rules are the right solution when you're dealing with physical infrastructure in a non-competitive market  Now where it gets interesting and is when AT&T is like, let's let's do the same rules  We'll follow the same rules that Google and Facebook do  I don't think that's right because they're in a very different competitive environment  Their competitive environment isn't necessarily based on physical infrastructure  Although their data centers are a huge element of that, right?  But they're in their competitive advantage is based on data. So then they should be regulated based on  That competitive advantage. So you what you really need is two separate laws  And you can talk about yes, you have other Google is still you know, I use duck duck go  You know, I don't have to use Google you can use Bing blah blah blah  But you know, there is a data monopoly developing among the big companies and we do need to look at that and figure out  a solution for  making sure that having all of this information doesn't create a  Barrier to other companies being able to come in and innovate and that's that's fine  I think that makes sense. I just don't  Cause it putting the same rules around them in AT&T don't make sense at all because AT&T is providing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Physical infrastructure physical access exactly. Yeah, I would agree. I mean, there's definitely issues around  Facebook and Google and probably Amazon too. I mean, yes competition sort of competition policy  Just isn't equipped to deal with things like network effects and you know  It's it it was designed to to deal with physical assets like I control all the railway cars or I  Control all the barrels of oil or whatever  Facebook doesn't control anything  Tangible except a lot of data that people willingly provide it which is a completely different animal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile Amazon Facebook and Google are spending more money lobbying than ever before

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's because they know this is coming. Yeah  So it makes sense something I think something is coming so actually  It doesn't really sound like that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but Congress is cheaper than you think. Yeah, I suppose

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Senators are particularly cheap  Particularly cheap

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, so Amazon spent  12.8 million dollars lobbying four times what it's event four years earlier Facebook  Spent also a record amount eleven and a half million dollars Apple spent  seven million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, you know 12 million for Jeff Bezos. That's like me spending a buck fifty on a cup of coffee. It literally is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually probably less than it's probably less than that. He's  So somebody I saw did 113 million spreadsheet because he's worth 113 billion dollars  Let's say I'm worth a million dollars  He's worth a hundred and thirteen thousand more than I am, right?  So that means that every one dollar I spent every one dollar I spend no every  $113,000 I spent is worth one dollar to him. Yeah. Yeah, so twelve million dollars is like ten bucks  Yeah  It's a little more than ten bucks  It's like I think someone probably has it in his wallet. He probably has it in the cushions of his couch

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone said his net worth increased 2.8 billion daily and and that's ten times as much that's in a single day  That's ten times as much as all the cashiers that who work in retail

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the United States by the way, that number is gonna dwindle quickly Amazon go opened on Monday  the first convenience store with no clerks and I cannot I  Am I a bad person for saying I cannot wait for them to open here. I  Love the idea walk into the store  you scan your phone right because you know, I think eventually they'll use Bluetooth le or something to identify you but  So eventually I think by the time it gets here you won't even have to scan your phone  You'll just walk in take what you want and walk out and you'll be billed. I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love that no scanning of any kind to just take what you want. What do you like that? Take it you want that?  Take it. It's a it's a dream for everybody. It's a dream for Jeff because you're gonna take more stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's a chance shirts. I'm not sure it's a dream for poor people. No, I think it's a dream

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a dream for rich people. You're right  Yeah people with disposable income, but you still have to shop if you have to shop  Wouldn't it be better just to put that peanut butter in your you know pocket and walk out don't bring small children though  Cuz you know what children do they just grab  You'd come home you'd have eight bags of M&M peanut M&Ms. I mean convenience wise it's it's definitely great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds fantastic. But you know what it's better what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pickup groceries to her pickup. Yeah. Yeah, they just bring it. That's all I need  But you know what they need is pick up and put away

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I can put away my groceries. No, no, I'm lazy. I want to be like I'm willing  You know if they take out the shopping trip I am willing to put away the groceries

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was remember when Amazon key came out and they were gonna give their drop-off people a key to your apartment or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, if they put stuff away, I'd go for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, someone said the next the next evolution will be Amazon warehouse where you literally just live in the warehouse  Stuff doesn't have to come to you at all  Just bring it but isn't really Amazon go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Am is exactly that it's basically a little Amazon warehouse. Yeah, and you just you're the you do the pick-and-pull  You go you pull what you want you walk out the door. That's it's exactly what that is  It's a little mini Amazon warehouse and I expect and I'm sure you know, there will they'll need people to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  calibrate the video cameras or  You know stock the shelves or something right you you work at home Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you were working downtown  You would love it that when you you know lunchtime came you just go you went down and by the way  It wouldn't necessarily be of any particular size. It could be like that bodega thing that the fake bodegas  They're just a vending machine could just be a little closet in your office. You just take stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's been a very popular  idea for years is  That kind of stuff vending machine if actually Facebook has had their own little vending machines that  Distribute office supplies with your Facebook ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mean nothing really like it hasn't changed that have there right? Do you have it?  No  Okay, so we we kind of have it but not really I mean our market is very different  We only have really two major carriers. No competition. Yeah. Yeah  So it's not really  And maybe we should have had net neutrality a long time ago. Yeah, the thing that's  that's disturbing the more recent thing is that  The carriers are basically arguing that they would like to have a  special  Organization that decides what websites you can go to and what websites you can't go to  Yeah, so it's it's a little like do remember SOPA and people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's sort of like that  So they want to have a privacy or sorry piracy  Council totally independent, of course  that would decide which websites you could go to or not go to and  So that they're kind of lobbying the government to give them not to give them to give this totally independent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, public Wi-Fi ain't no art noted for its speed. It's almost always the worst. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's also full of all sorts of malicious goings on which I imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think they under provision as well. I'll bet you well, I don't why would you over provision? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like  Like cleaning the streets or building highways with enough capacity putting enough bathrooms around  Why would you don't even complain Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So did you any of you watch the event that MSNBC did with recode a care switcher and Ari Melba  member and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why was this a big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai Susan Wojcicki on stage. No, why would sorry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why was it a big deal that he said because this is where he said that he didn't regret firing that dude. Yes  Yeah, yeah. So why was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you know why I'll tell you why because CEOs never say anything interesting true. That's the true  the best they could get out of him was that and  Sundar Pichai compares the impact of AI to electricity and fire  I know I know that just tells me we didn't miss it. We didn't miss anything. I think fire

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would still give it to fire myself. I think it's more like electricity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah fire is the big winner in that  For sure. I think if you look at historically I would say fire win. Kevin Kelly actually we did a triangulation with Kevin Kelly  he's he wrote his last book was about the future and he  He talked he actually said that it's gonna be very much like when electricity became widespread  What all the inventors did was they would apply a thin layer of electricity and they get this new invention  So he he said for instance, look at the pump, you know enough out in the out in the yard the hand pump  Where'd you get your water?  They applied electricity to it something you've got running water and he says AI is gonna be like that  You're gonna take existing and I think he was he was absolutely right  This is your take existing technologies and you apply a thin layer of AI and you've got an AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And arguably the internet did that as well, I mean yes electricity in the earlier days you had  You know Bob and Doug's electric company provided lights for like a block  and so you had hundreds of thousands of these little electric providers and then they all got rolled up and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Waymo is gonna put its self-driving vans in Atlanta more and more you know  You're gonna be able to try an autonomous vehicle as they'd love to yeah, I would too  What do you think South by you said just a notice vehicles? Yeah, they usually have autonomous vehicles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Self I believe they want I wanted an autonomous petty cab

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like an autonomous moped kind of thing. No, you know how they they have those guys  Bicycling around so you would have to build a robot that would pedal. Yeah, that's silly  That's a little bit of a pole dancing robots didn't they see yes, okay, that was that was so I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was offensive. Don't get me and it was stupid. I just know it's stupid. Is that robot?  What's her name the one everybody keeps so far talking to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so bad, it's not a robot no, it's it's terrible Tom. It's no more a robot than that chess playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  machine  You remember the guy in the movie big where you went up to him he was on my side. It's all tar. Yeah midway  Yeah, it's all tar. She's a robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, program responses. Yeah, it's a thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what else is sad less than 10% of Google account owners are using two-factor authentication. I was just reading this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm using two-factor. I'm using  To factor all the way we're not in the majority that doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're good people  Work people. Oh, why do not I mean I explain this every week on the radio show  Which you know, I assume the radio shows where I talk to the most  normal of people and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't listen  Yeah, no, it's a it's a pretty big deal this this radio show it's on 200 stations across the country, okay  And it's you know, it's a call-in  technology show  Okay. Yeah, and so I answer questions, but I talk about I  try to bring  the you know the level of understanding that we all have and they level of the conversation we all have to  People who aren't as obsessed with technology, right?  We are and I think I see I try I told my daughter is hard to explain though like too far like once you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, it sounds nerdy  But even after you explain it that's kind of hard for people to understand  How it works unless you show them so like I'm never gonna get yeah my mom to do two-factor ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My mom doesn't factor. I just told her that it prevents the government from spying in your computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that's the one thing it doesn't do  My

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mom can barely use email. So yeah, you know getting her to use two-factor is a lost cause but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I got my daughter to set it up  She called me in a panic the other day saying Google says somebody's logged onto my account from New York City  It was a it was an IP v6 address. So I think it was not probably anything bad. It wasn't a regular IP address  But I said, okay  A couple things you should do immediately one is change your Google password and to turn on two-factor and  She did it now what I told her is she has an iPhone and get the Google app on your iPhone  And when you go to this Google security page and you enable two-factor say that you want a notification  From the Google app as the factor that doesn't so there's no entry of numbers  Right when you log in Microsoft does this too. It's actually so much easier when you log into your Google account  It says okay, we're gonna look at your phone and say yes, you approve this  That's as easy as you can get right? No, you're right  text message  Authenticator it's easier than I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cuz it fortune we actually had to use  Cuz of Bloomberg had to use authenticator, right?  We did know we I mean we had Bloomberg terminals, but you know, I wasn't in the main office

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never used him but and a fortune we had hard keys, right? We had the we had

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we had hard keys yeah the RSA hard keys  Are as belonging into the computer and you had to change your password every 90 days that we which we now know is wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I hated it. Yeah, it's always a bad idea. So  I think the real problem with two-factor and the thing that's I bet you more than 10% have tried it is  That some apps particularly since we're in this app driven world now because of the smartphone don't understand two-factor  And so you have to create a application specific password and that is bad as a pain  Yeah, not only it's a pain. It's just crazy and it's bad thing and it doesn't work  And so I think that's probably what happens is people go. Yeah, this is I'm not doing this anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I think a lot of people like  it will take a  Significant negative event for them to sort of realize that this is important. So in this way it happened to my daughter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if that hadn't happened, there's no way I could have just said

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the same way my daughter lost her phone and she had not backed up any of her photos  So she lost all the photos of this European trip. She went on. Yeah, and so instantly she realized the value of backing up  Your phone, but it took till that moment. She was like, oh, yeah, I know you're supposed to blah blah blah  But I just never did and then all of a sudden it became much more important. That's like renters insurance

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never get it until something. I mean, that's we're all we're all stupid. We're all lazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And actually I remember thinking I had my laptop stolen when I was in Italy  someone grabbed my bag off the train and  I was glad then that I had two factor on as many things as I did  all I did was log out of my Google account and  Basically everything was inaccessible and luckily I had my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube is asking for non-disparagement clauses from musicians  Before they'll promote your music you have to say we will never say anything bad about Google  That seems like a lot apparently that's not the norm in the music industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I like you could you could trash your record label apparently you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seems to be a pretty popular thing it's interesting I find it hard to believe they could

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Enforce that but well if you want the promotion music and original series creators  So I know you I know you want to talk about this Jeff Jarvis certainly would but I know Matthew would like to talk about  this  crowdsourced  Ratings for news sources on Facebook Facebook, which is just  Struggled coming with up with some sort of solution to the perceived crisis and fake news and I say perceived because I don't necessarily even buy  into this  Now is saying well, we've decided what we're gonna do is do surveys and  Ask people whether they trust news sources kind of like Yelp for news sources

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well, so what they say is that they're going to and actually Adam Maseri who's in charge of the news feed has been  responding to a bunch of people on Twitter including me about this and  They haven't gotten into a huge amount of detail about how it's gonna work I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody I'm trying to remember it buzzfeed the Alex Cantor. Yeah, they got the has the cell. It's got the survey  There's two questions. Do you recognize the following websites? Yes or no, right?  And how much do you trust each of them entirely a lot somewhat barely not at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so the most charitable  interpretation of this survey is that  They're going to use your your answers to those two things along with  The reams of data that they have about you and your behavior  From all the time you spend on Facebook in order to come up with a trust ranking so that it's not like that  It's just another questions. Yeah, right. It's another signal. They're gonna look at what you clicked on how long you spent on it  They're gonna look at how much you know about different things how familiar you are with different things  But I think Adam did admit that it's this is a  It's a very nuanced question. Do you trust something?  there the problem is that I just finished writing about a  Big survey that gallop and the Knight Foundation did about trust in media and what they found was it's split along  Ideological lines lots of other research has found this too. So do you trust the media?  Gets completely different answers depending on whether someone identifies as a Republican or a Democrat  And so do you trust the New York Times is going to get a completely different?  Response so is do you trust Fox News?  so the problem is they're gonna have to in order to get at the real problem, which is  the website that  You know creates itself last week and comes up with a real sounding name and posts a bunch of garbage in order to get at  That problem. They're gonna have to find a way around  the ideological kind of rift that  Exists when you ask people if they quote-unquote trust the media strikes me though

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That it would be really easy to pinpoint those completely fraudulent clickbait sites. Like that's the theoretically that's the easiest

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The hard ones are the ones in between right  So they post something this happens all the time Craig Silverman it buzzfeed is  Has a PhD in this stuff basically they will post true things and then something completely fake  So it's not all completely fake or they'll post things that have a grain of truth, but they're completely distorted  So it's hard it's not just 100% fake all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like most good conmen. They tell you the truth most of the time exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you telling me the truth right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I  Will never know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean Facebook's let's face it they have a hard it's a problem to do  Yeah, and I think they they don't really have  The tools or it's not in their DNA to kind of do this stuff. Their DNA is  Build things really quickly roll them out get people to engage on your platform the end  So they're good at that but that what we're talking about  And what Zuckerberg is says he wants to do which is to prioritize  quality engagement and meaningful  Discussion over just sort of raw engagement. That's a really really hard line to find

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even though in my I was gonna say there are people that I know  Who are huge Trump supporters who will spend lots of time talking and debating over?  Mm-hmm truly fake stories and they will be meaningfully engaged and exhibiting that sense of community

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the last thing I wrote for CJR was about how I actually think their changes could make it worse  So if they're looking at like you said meaningful discussion  Engagement people spending lots of time, you know, what's really engaging?  Garbage like totally made up. That's what the Pope says  And the Pope is right Pope says I'm not sure the devil came up with it  I think he says sourcing there might be a little fake news goes back to the Garden of Eden

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He okay, the the church has announced that  there will be a World Day of social communications this May and  So he was I guess talking about that naturally. I think he's not too bad on this. He says  Fake news is effective because like the snake in the Garden of Eden  It mimics real news and it captures people's attentions by exploiting emotions like anxiety contempt  Anger, yeah, he's totally right about that  He says social networks are the ideal delivery system untrue stories can spread so quickly  that even authoritative denials fail to contain the damage and  That turns people the absence of  Opposite viewpoints turns people into unwilling accomplices in spreading bias and baseless ideas. Of course, the Pope very famously  endorsed Donald Trump during the election in  in what is often used as  the  definitive example of fake news that was believed and  Spread and probably had some impact. I will say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If we're talking about fake news the big book there's some  Sourcing issues there. I  Don't know this Pope wants us to look too closely into but he's got a point  He definitely I don't know about the snake part  Might be fake for all we know. Yeah, the problem is that Facebook, you know  Whether they say they do or not if what they want is engagement  You know things that make people mad and yeah, they're optimized for fake news, aren't they that yeah  They're they're effectively a machine for confirmation bias and that feeds into that that whole problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This probably goes right in the same bucket as Donald Trump's anti-samsung tweet Rupert Murdoch put out a statement saying  that he wants Facebook and Google to pay him and  That's how you trusted publishers  It should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies and that would solve

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fake news problem because cable is what we want to look to as an example for how things really work  Well, the cable industry Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You figure he wrote this in the middle of the night and he just gave it to somebody and said here put this up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I mean Facebook does pay content companies to pay them a revenue share  Have revenue sure. Yeah, so it's not a carriage fee, but you could argue maybe they should pay more  I think Jonah Paredes said that he thought Facebook could pay more. They probably could they certainly have boatloads of cash money, but  Structuring the internet like a cable like the cable industry is not I think the solution

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll actually be talking with this about this  With an old friend Andrew Keene who's gonna be on triangulation in a couple of weeks  He says re-arrange mark Zuckerberg is rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Oh  Andrew  Andrew is speaking of link bait. He's a master. He sure is the well-turned  Infuriating phrase and I look forward to getting him on he's a lot of fun. Yeah. Yeah, he's a hoot  Let's see Facebook has invented a new unit of time  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was reported like super snarky, but I mean this is actually no  This is actually a technical common thing in not maybe not common in engineering  But like you you definitely create a measurement that works to the problem you're trying to start which is all they did  Yeah, but from a headline point of view. This is what you would have to call it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's called the flick or frame tick. It is one. I  Can't even read this number 705  70 billion five hundred sixty million. I don't know. It's one tiny bit of a second and  You know who I bet came up with this  Colleen she works in streaming video at Facebook Arl  Engineer I wouldn't be surprised at all if this  As this has her I hope she trademarked it the flick  Yeah, and everybody it snarked about it. I'm not snarking about it. It's it's for video. It's you need it  Down to 20 cities for Amazon all the ones you expect and Toronto  Yay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and Austin and Austin really Austin in there to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  only non East Coast good old Austin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the reason they're all in these because they already are on the Amazon's are you all the West Coast, right? So yes, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They need to kind of so they can be really hot or really cold. Yeah. Yeah, basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they'll have a they'll move the HQ based on the season  Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HQ they could have to Apple says it's gonna invest a significant like 30 billion dollars of the repatriated money  It's gonna get back from its overseas cash  Building a second headquarters and the rumor is in Reno, Nevada  Really and the reason is actually their second largest  There's a big  You know because it'll be a helps call help center  That's what we had. It's a good lots of room expensive cheap real estate  Yeah, exactly. And actually that's why people were in Austin Dell had the best man. Tell had the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Calls. Yeah was that's right. Yeah. Well Apple's call centers here nest supports here in Austin  I thought we're all in Ireland now or something. No a lot of high value call centers are in Austin  Maybe high value is the wrong way to think of it  But we have a lot of that industry and then what happens is like when Apple bought in Trinity  That they come and they find oh hey  There's a great ship design community and lots of educated people who don't want to move to California. So  It's not a bad place to be  Says the lady who's lived here for 20 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Former Twitter CEO and Anthony Nato  This story comes from before he announced his departure from Twitter, but I thought it was interesting to see yes  He says that streaming devices like Apple TV Fire TV and Chromecast are on the chopping block there in five years  They'll be gone. You'll just go right from your phone to it. I think he's right. Of course. I think he's right. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I mean my TV has Chromecast built in I don't even use a Chromecast, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, he's assuming that Twitter will be the source of a lot of that stream. Mm-hmm, but he won't be there anymore  No, cuz right after that he left  He's gonna become the CEO of a startup financial startup called SoFi

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which we may recognize from scandals such as  We're they that don't have sex in the stairwells one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's Google so if I and stairwells, I don't know, you know  That sounds vaguely familiar. No, you think of Xenefits Oh  So fi  With Xenefits  So fi is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  financial business refi kind of thing. Yes, but they had a scandal their scandal was was a bad loans  Okay, hold on. No, there was there was something I think you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He came from Goldman Sachs to Twitter in  2014 and was instrumental in push the push for live video. He did the deal with NFL for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  football games and of course Twitter's it's gonna be interesting to see whether they like how  Things change strategically because he did push that a lot and in a lot of ways he was  The sort of he was the only full-time senior employee. I mean Jack is a co is a sort of part-time CEO  CEO at Square as well  So everybody always looked to Anthony as kind of the guy who actually ran things. Oh interesting  So it'll be that's a big that's gonna leave a big hole that's for sure and Twitter has a lot of holes like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't need a big hole huge turnover in the executive suite huge. Yeah, this is just one more to add to that list

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it'll be interesting to see what happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stocks not really doing very well either four percent down on Tuesday when this came out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the stocks oh, yeah, so they had the frat house atmosphere and bad underwriting so I knew there was something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me too them too, I guess we have a new hashtag them too  But I love this article in the verge it's really not you know completely about us but  flat's of off writing about  Headphones buying headphones in 2018 is gonna be a fragmented mess  Not the least because of Apple's iPhone 10 and Google's pixel to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Know headphone jack so that's a problem and then you've got all the USB see yeah lighting I  Don't even I am so frustrated. It's a mess

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also now competing codecs. You've got aptX. Yes, L. Dac  It's just that's so we're going backwards now  It's a tower of babble

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like headphones used to be the one thing where yes kind of music with everything it works the analog any kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you know the worst thing you'd have to do is buy an adapter from a full size to a mini jack

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's where we need like some regulation. We just need some standards for these things turn it  Well, I don't actually want to regulate this but I'm like, come on people and the market doesn't help because frankly people buy into a single

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  System so if you're an iPhone user, they do you know what your solution is  It's very specific, but it doesn't work on necessarily and everybody seems to be fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple buyers seem to be fine with every year or two buying something  $500 worth of new dongles so they can connect all their stuff. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't understand that at all  But now that I'm living it  I I kind of I  Honestly think if I could find a decent phone like with a headphone jack my next phone me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rebel rebel fight back

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I gonna do not have a cell phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't have headphone jacks either I might point out yeah  Stripe I don't know what took them so long as ending support for Bitcoin payments on the stripe platform  Just like everybody else for the same reasons that takes a long time for an extra transaction to clear and it costs  20 bucks  Yeah, it's I mean Bitcoin

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's no longer what it  Set out to be it's no longer  Convenient or useful or a good store of value or good for transactions

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the volatility makes it really bad for buying stuff because you know you guys paying a dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't know what you're gonna. So I will say though that I recently did get a press release from the aura family dentistry  Which is the 11th dental practice accepting?  dentocoin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  dentocoin  They have their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Call me you imagine we're complaining about fragmentation in  Headsets, can you imagine fragmentation if every single industry gets its own currency?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about doge coin do they accept doge coin doge coin gone back up father?  Robert has what a million doge coins get some an ungodly amount because it was a joke. Oh, it was a joke  Yeah, actually though. I think the but I think this stripe thing is I mean, it's clear the bubbles gonna burst  This is this for sure too volatile too unpredictable too expensive. It's not a good payment solution

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead you first I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thought it was nice how he described it as an asset not a currency, which was a very polite way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this isn't liquid. It's good for speculating. Yeah, and I read a great essay. I can't remember who wrote it now about how  Basically Bitcoin has become everything that Satoshi Nakamoto  Invented Bitcoin to to sort of yeah not be yeah  So it's become the opposite of what it was supposed to be in almost every way  It's not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about ICOs we've not talked about it on the show because it's complicated  Initial estimate but it is kind of initial coin operating offerings and the the big hook this week is telegram  Which is doing yeah a massive ICO of as much as getting bigger  They're thinking now two billion dollars. So the idea is  that you buy  What do they call them tele tele tokens telecoins telecoin you buy their  cryptocurrency as an investment in telegram and  Then do I see those are they like stock? Do you get part? Oh, that's the big question

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's the big question and it's why the SEC kind of needs to  Make regulations in this area or somebody does because the whole point of doing ICOs  Was that they weren't treated like equity so because they theoretically had utility  and there's all kinds of arcane regulations around this but if something has  Utility if you can enjoy it or use it in and of itself if it's not just a certificate that  represents a share of a company then you it's not not considered equity so  I think the class you can pay your dentist with it  Or if you can use it for some other reason so so the classic case was baseball  Cards so baseball cards, even though you can buy and sell them. They're not shares of a company and they're not  Currency because you enjoy them  Having them and you enjoy them for that share certificates. Nobody very few people enjoy them for the certificate  They and they like it and invest in it because it gives them a share of the profits of a company  So the idea was tokens  Were because they had utility they were not shares not equity, but you could still raise a ton of dough with them  so the last thing I saw from the SEC was a  Release the basic said whoa, just whoa like everybody  Settle down we're gonna do something in this area, but there's as far as I know there's been no  Concrete moves to either regulate them or shut them down and there's a debate about what?  Utility represents so some tokens give you effectively time or processing  Time on a Bitcoin mining

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the reasons people are interested in the telegram ICOs because these coins called grams  Which won't be issued for another year  Are intended to be used as a basis for transactions on telegram, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And kick kick was gonna do the same thing  I don't know if they actually did one but they were gonna use it for transactions on their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  messaging platform, it's in fact  It was shut down in Iran because it was dominant in Iran  It was why not being used to help organize so then if you can use it for payments, it's not equity

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then it's not covered by the SEC. So you'd be buying into a payment system. It's a payment system  Yeah, it's a currency. Therefore you have to go to the place that regulates currencies  Currency, but it's but Stacy's point is a good one. What if everybody has their own currency?  Who the heck determines  The exchange rate like there's no central bank to tell you this coin is worth X or it's exchangeable for Y or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What gets really interesting is I've talked to like I've talked to some people doing like energy  tokens based on basically smart metering  So there's like a group in Australia that's doing a very interesting thing with this they did an ICO  and they  You know you you bought into their token system and that allows you to buy and sell electricity  solar electricity generated by your neighbors at a lower cost because it was a  it was a edge of the grid and so you didn't pay the transmission costs from the  from the real  electricity provider, I guess  So what I thought was interesting though is what happens when you buy into that system and you're buying selling your electricity  Using these tokens which does have a value and it doesn't feel radically speculative  What happens when you want to leave that system like you move? It's illiquid. Yeah, right  and so and that's always been the challenge is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you have to do remember the early early days of  Internet payments and there was beans and flues  One of them would be Goldberg was involved in 80 entire bucks. Yeah, actually they're still around but  They got a special dispensation believe it or not from the government to issue their own currency  But anyway, so I remember those days everybody well  I've got 50 beans or I've got a hundred flus or whatever and and it quickly became nonsensical

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean think about it Apple pay isn't really any different nominally Apple pay is dollars  Right, but the way Apple pay, you know, the payment system and messages works is you don't cash out of it  You just you could cash out of it, but you just kind of keep it there. It's in a way  It's its own currency, you know, it's only the thing is it's guaranteed to be translated into dollars at some point

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's the thing you need someone to basically guarantee that there will be value  For you if you want to cash out and use the money to go buy a house or something if you're just speculating you  probably don't care but if you actually want to use it as a store of value or or  Transactions you need someone some authority  That will tell you that the value is going to be there when you need it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Y'all are about to talk us down to the gold standard. No, you're  This is fiat money all of this like it's all fiat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the thing is that ones a fiat banked by the full faith and currency of and it's a Toshi Nakamoto  And one is or a bunch of miners in China and the other is backed by the now  The credit of the United States government, which is it right, you know, that's a little more sub-sector erratically  Theoretically theoretically the government the US could default

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The US these currencies these currencies remind me a lot more of currencies in small  Countries where the government changes rapidly and the army takes over periodically, right and the value of them literally changes day by day  Month by month. There's always an underground currency that people actually use instead of the real currency and people are carrying around wheelbarrows full of  Governments solve this by tying their money to the US dollar. Yeah, the fascinating thing for me is that is that  Cryptocurrencies effectively just reveal the sort of central  Fiction about money, which is that it has any value at all  I mean we don't have like pieces of paper that we exchange with people that have colored pictures on them  Don't have any inherent value, right? They have value because a bank somewhere  Said that it will accept them at such and such a value. Some people are still backed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think aren't some countries still on some sort of gold standard  They're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imaginary because the value of gold is not based on its true industrial value. It's based on  On its trading back its trading value

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you want to look at something that's a crazy market gold is was the original crazy market  That stuff changes value for no reason whatsoever  Like the actual underlying value of it is infinitesimal  The thing that interests me is I was on a panel about  Cryptocurrency a little while ago and that guy from the Bank of Canada was there  And the Bank of Canada is the central bank it regulates the entire banking industry  And he said that they were thinking of creating their own cryptocurrency. So is the Bank of England  Yeah, and the Bank of Israel. So now you've got a central bank effectively, but now they're competing with every other cryptocurrency

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's a currency really what I think what they're competing with their own currency

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think what they're saying and I think this is actually really interesting. It's not about it's about blockchain  They want a transparent fast  decentralized way of  Recording transactions better than which is current system

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which you could argue is the real value cryptocurrency is fascinating. I will totally argue that  Bitcoin is there's a lot of hype and it's fun to watch but the real value is blockchain and that sort of distributed ledger  Approach to all kinds of information not just I mean currency is just a tiny tiny  Fraction of what blockchain could be applied to you. That's what I find interesting. So Stacy, what is blockchain?  I'm glad you asked you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent. All right  It is it's just a distributed letter. It's a technology that allows you to  Write information to and read information from many distributed notes. I I'm not gonna get into like super technical

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  let me try this way a  transaction a  Value transit currency and money is all about value. So it's like a battery for value, you know  Batteries takes electricity generated stores it till you need it in  You know in the earliest days before money you would do chop some wood for somebody and she'd give you a pie and  There was a direct thing but now we got a problem if I want to chop some wood  But I don't want pie. I want to get some shoes from over there. We have some way of storing value  Could be puka shells. It has been or cowrie shells  Could be strings knots in a string it could be rocks rocks  It could be anything but you want somewhere to store that value in that everybody agrees  That's worth an hour's worth of chopping wood and then so in that you can exchange it around the problem with this is  That's easy to do when there's an actual physical thing that you exchange around  But in our modern world, it's impractical to exchange physical things. So it's all become bits  So now what you need is some way to record  That leo earned this many bits  That he's given this many bits to stacey that stacey's given this many bits to matthew and you want some way to do that efficiently  Securely try in a trustworthy way. Otherwise you got a real problem  And that's the idea of blockchain is it's not and no bank normally now  MasterCard does it or visa does it or the bank of canada does it and they keep the ledger and you trust they're going to do it  Right, but it's centralized what they would like is some way of  Recording this in a trusted fashion everybody agreed on but no one it's completely decentralized

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one that was the key that for me was the key the key thing that Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to do  It wasn't just the mining and the crypto and so on it was the distributed and non  centralized nature of it so that in if in effect everyone who does the a transaction is a bank and is a  Transaction processor and has a copy of the ledger and can read it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oops, this is old. Here's the but let me give you a story that I wrote about this all the way back in 2015  about why blockchain matters  And basically it's because we need something that is yes like Matthew said that is not necessarily secure because there's actually  issues about that but something you can authenticate and that  Is scalable and that's the key you need it to be scalable and for scalability. It needs to be decentralized  and that's  That's why it matters and we're talking I talked to companies who are doing  blockchain based security for iot I talked to micro payment people they're very fascinating and  So once you take it outside of cryptocurrencies, which are interesting, but are really a sideshow for  Figuring out how to use blockchain for  things that will actually be world-changing so I  Don't know what to say about that and there's different variations like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I think you could argue the sideshow the financial sideshow is actually one of the ways that people are  Trying to generate money to do the other things that are interesting. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  everybody's like I wrote about a distributed computing platform that basically you can link all your  Computer like any computing element in your connected home. For example, you could link to solve edge problems problems at the edge  So machine learning tech problems at the edge. So think of it like SETI on your desk  so they're  They're using a blockchain technology  But they're also thinking about doing an ICO because it's an easy way for them to raise money now  Yeah, and then they'll use their currency as a way to trade value among that system. I  feel like  The currency is kind of a side you don't need a token  But they're using it as a way to make money and I think that's gonna cause a lot of problems kind of like back in  The 2000s when we had all those crazy comms  There was actually a lot of value created then with well, and that's what I was saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Value it reminds me of their the early internet  There were so many dumb things and everybody just took whatever they did and added the word internet to it or  Had a website in the same way Long Island IST changed its name to Long Island blockchain  So that everyone's just adding that to kind of get on the bandwagon  But underneath there is something real just like there was in the early days of the internet  It's just gonna take some time to get rid of the froth  You know and to see what the actual real applications are. There's a journalism startup called civil  They're gonna do an ICO  They want to use  blockchain and the sort of distributed ledger as a as a tool for  Distributing and paying for independent journalism. That's an interesting idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and and there's different types of blockchain implementation, so that's something worth noting  There's like Bitcoin Ethereum. Everything's done in public. A lot of private companies said I don't want my data in public  I want it private IBM created hyper ledger. There's  New variations where there's the so-called blockless blockchains that you know aren't as  slow and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Heavy and there's a problem with the way Bitcoin and Ethereum do it because you get these massive ledgers that everybody has to store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's not a problem though  If you think about it is trying to create a currency with some sort of stored value the stored value though wasn't an hour  Chopping wood it was an hour of GPU time for example, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So although there is an issue on resource use with Bitcoin someone said to to generate a single  Bitcoin takes, you know as much power as

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's if you think about it as an economic unit though, so people, you know chopping wood, you know take energy  They require calories in what we've done is we've transferred all of our work as it were to a digital  Now the work is not us we are not the productive entities and that's a that's a huge  Sea change if we think that's actually gonna happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but I mean  It's it really doesn't matter where the work comes from what the work is as long as we all agree on  The value and the units and so forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, but where I think is that really valuable and I don't think we're there yet because if all we did all day was trade  Bitcoins that were blockchain or ethereum's or whatever. Well, but the market the market determines

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What real world value is that 10 is that are those 10,000 bitcoins worth two pizzas?  Or are they worth two houses?  the the market  This is the problem is why it's really volatile right now  But at some point you'd think the market would settle on a value. Well, there's dozens of different markets. That's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not just Bitcoin. There's like 20 different, you know  Currencies that are all going up and down in value because people are arbitraging them  And whenever there's money involved there will be people who want to steal the money and there will be people who want to arbitrage  the value between one and the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and so think of Bitcoin think of this as all a  out of town tryouts  for some system  That is ultimately going to replace our current financial system. We're learning right now  What works what doesn't work? Well, you don't want a 200 gigabyte ledger. That's not gonna work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it may not just replace a financial system though, it might also replace credentialing or  Identity it you know, there's all sorts of interesting applications beyond financial system. So don't just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of course medical and government authentication, right is that the fundamental problem authentication and validation of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Transactions one of the problems for sure. It's one of the problems. We can't you can't think of it. This is like as a binary  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I mean they are not as secure as they should be  Okay. Well, so that's something like 10% of all the value  All the ICO value you think someone said 10% of all the ICO value that's been created today was stolen  I think it was 20% was it 20% It was a big number anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like even even something so no, it's more than 20%  There's a huge yeah instead of thinking about value think about just tracking something so understanding where something's been and  That's how like oh god, who's you who's using the blockchain to track turkeys Tyson Purdue. I think it's Purdue  But those are the kind of things that become  They're not doing it. Nay. Yes. It's a little bit of like he but they're actually tracking it for foodborne illness  purposes so you think so so there are really interesting things  That will come of this and I don't know how much of it actually will be money because we have a decent monetary system  I think we're gonna have to eliminate some fees  And it's gonna have to become a little bit faster and block chain would allow some of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I think there are you know, we should admit there are some kind of  creepy aspects to a center and not centralized but a ledger a single ledger that  Keeps track of all your transactions. However small  That you engage in as you move around the internet  Lots of things could be done  By tracking not just you but your car your dishwasher your car all your smart devices  Everything you touch  You know, there's lots of ways that information could go wrong as well

Transcript:  Came across something. I thought was funny  This isn't really a tip or anything useful or anything like that, but I  No one's useful  This is totally not useful. It's useless  But I saw something  It's behind a paywall, but the Wall Street Journal had a story about how the internet was filling up because a lot of  Indians are sending millions of just say good morning. So I  did a bit of reading about that and  It's just a funny story. There's so many people  And most of what they're doing they just got phones or and so the first thing they want to do is send a  Cheery greeting to everyone they know and you know, you multiply that by hundreds of millions people  That's a lot of messages. So and there is notice network slowing down. I just think it's funny that people are saying good morning

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I it's it's the cutest thing ever in the Wall Street Journal article  They have some images good morning to my life's rose your fragrance makes all of life's thorns worth tolerating  They talk about this fella  Dishra Sharma 71 years old. He likes to send good morning messages on his phone. He wakes up and sends them to 51  Friends and family on whatsapp, but there is a Google tie-in because Google's  Filesgo  Application has been modified  You know  It's it's the application you put on your Android phone that goes through your phone and clears up old files unused apps things like  that modified to delete  Good morning messages. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just thought you know if you're gonna have a reason why your network is slow or your  Bandwidth is slowing down and you're running out of data. I think sending people good morning too many messages  This is a great read not a bad thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They they interviewed the journal interview Josh Woodward the Google project manager in Mountain View  Who led the effort we were trying to deconstruct?  What is the DNA of a good morning message for months?  He said it's been a lot of hard work to get it right early versions were picking out photos of children wearing t-shirts with words  on them  They unveiled the app last month in New Delhi the morning message deletion function  Prompted the crowd of media and government officials to break out in applause

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cleared up on average more than a gigabyte of data per user  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think this is an awesome reminder. The world is an awesome place. It's like a unique place and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like if your phone crashes, it's not fun or your or you use up all your internet data

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it's it's pretty good reason you could take care of this by just deleting the message. Yeah  Yeah, so that's why there's an app. Yeah, I  Am gonna start sending don't be surprised  If you all start getting good morning messages for  Stacey you got a pick for us. I have a tip

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your audience probably knows about it, but I figured they may not and it's worth sharing  Okay. So what was it? Oh, yeah Netflix voice match. I'm like, what was it? I don't even remember for Google home  So basically, you know how you can match your voice to Google and to feel it  That works for some people it doesn't work for my daughter and I but that's okay  Amazon's voice match doesn't work between my husband and I so I you know  Do sound a lot alike. I don't think we do because she is a child and her voice is that of a child  But that's okay and I don't particularly have a childish voice I don't think no  Yes, it's puzzling to me but  She said she hello echo she she doesn't but she sounds like a kid  So you can tell when you tell  Hey G fire up next Netflix, which is my shortcut for firing up Netflix. Hey G  No, I'm just not triggering. Okay, I'm trying to be respectful  So hey G fire up Netflix  It now knows that I have asked for it and it will go to my profile so it will not show me  You know all the crazy stuff that  But actually it won't show me narcos and all of the other stuff that my husband watches  That I'm kind of deemed too violent and scary. He's got a thing for those Mexican drug lords. So does my wife

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meet each other  She reads every book. She is so into this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have we have like all the Pablo Escobar we have all the newer ones we have them all  Yeah, so  That I thought was kind of a nice  Tip so to find it and to set do it you go into your Google Home apps  you have to go under the more settings or under the settings thing you have to go under more and  Then you should be able to link your Netflix account  So you also have to link your Netflix account and then poof there it is

Transcript:  Something Leo I was gonna mention remember you asked about Canada and  Neutrality, yeah. Yeah, so  Basically the bottom line is in a big part of the debate in the US is whether  Internet providers should be considered common carriers. So in Canada that is not a debate. They've been considered basically  Utilities under the telecom act from the beginning  So yeah, so there's been no debate about that and also the CRTC is a lot less politicized than the FCC  So there isn't as much kind of back and forth about you know  Does the FCC chairman want it to be this way or that way and who's lobbying who and it's just a lot more boring basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we like a good fight here in the United

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and they they do what they call bandwidth shaping which is one of my favorite terms. Yep, which is basically throttling  And they've had repeated arguments with the CRTC about whether they should be able to do that or not  So it's it's not that we don't have issues it's that  regulatory wise it's  There isn't as much debate about how to handle it or what applies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and the big the big bandwidth shaping  Hardware that Comcast and others use comes from Canada. I can't remember the name of it sand vine and vine. Thank you
