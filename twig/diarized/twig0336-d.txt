Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's free there's free drinks. I'm a little hot chocolate the machine. All right  And there's a janitor and that's it. It's pretty that's it. Everybody else is off the parties. Not me not me  Huge party, thank you. Oh, I'm not there. I'm sitting here on a silly podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll make a deal. We should make a deal like when can Jeff go to the party?  Like the first time somebody says and over the street  That's easy cuz I'll say it that cuts is here. Yeah, hey Matt cuts  Hey, how's it going everybody? Matt cuts comm slash blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is unaffiliated is this your tribute to what's-his-name the guy who did the bear show and died  Dan Haggerty and Haggerty is your Dan Haggerty's got his grizzly Adams beard on he does it's just laziness. That's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it comes and goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you don't want to want my beard is longer  Why because I pride myself so much on packing I decided to grow it so I wouldn't have to bring the beard trimmer  Little flow because that would add two ounces Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how serious I am and also here as if that we didn't have an embarrassment of riches Kevin Marx is here, too  Hi Kevin  Hi there. Good to see you. Good to see you, too  This is this is a perfect cast to talk about anything they want to talk about  I mean, I will sit and listen in rapture in a wrapped  I don't even want to talk about a bar we could talk about it because you know  There's been a little tweet back and forth going on in fact  I think these two have been involved a little bit in it as I have been with  Jonathan Abrams all of us all of us and Matt too. Yeah. Yeah, you you weighed in as well. Okay  Well, then we better start with this  so  Jonathan Abrams is the founder of Nuzle, which we all agree is  Fantastic spectacular Nuzle is a website originally now an app  It's on iOS. I think it's on Android 2. Yeah, I can't remember  And it's a news app. It uses social signals from Facebook and Twitter to give you news you can  Get into I don't want to say news you can use that's probably trademarked  and one of the things when amp was announced at Google one of the things that  Nuzle was very early on about and Jonathan's a little cagey about how they are interfacing with this  But I gathered from his caginess that perhaps they had a early relationship with Google that when you click on an article that has been  amped  You'll get the AMP page now. I'm on a desktop. So I won't get that. Is that right? You have to be a mobile  Do we know no one knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anybody I mean if you go to the AMP page, it'll it'll work on desktop as well because it's just web stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what the question is will Nuzle send me to because every AMP page normally every AMP page has a standard web page

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Associated with it, right? It does will send you to the AMP page if it exists no matter what I think so is medium amped

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I refer you to our conversation from a few weeks back with Richard Gingras head of news at Google  He was talking about AMP and actually it's timely because the amp is about to go public

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the end of February well, they're gonna I feel already

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not that kind of public but it's been in beta up to this point right and and limited in as to who can use it or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's an open standard so anybody can put it up. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what it has been integrated into anything at Google except that test page. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the okay so and by the way, that's to me in some ways a little bit of the controversy about amp is that Google says  We're going to favor amp sites

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well favor might be no no no let Matt address this let Matt address this because he knows something about Google and search

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just a smidge typically, you know, you care about the quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if a higher quality site is a better answer a result then you want to return that but speed will certainly be part of that quality, right?  It's more of a smaller ingredient compared to you know, things like the page rank or how well we think  It answers the user's question  But if if it's a relatively small difference between two pages then if one is much faster  Then you can imagine that would help with the ranking  But it's not going to be like your page is faster  So you outrank everybody else even though they're they're better resources  It's it's definitely you know, you look for the best pages and then you do do take speed into account  But it's not going to be like, you know three times more valuable as a signal than some other quality signal, for example

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the the purpose stated purpose of amp is to provide a subset of the full web stack and to create pages that load faster  And for users, right? That's is that kind of in summary succinct enough?  It does this by doing a number of things including caching pages on Google and other servers  Although to date it's Google only servers and it also has a subset of JavaScript that's allowed  I'm looking through my Twitter because I'm trying to find this conversation we had  Jonathan Abrams was saying how much he likes  So he's integrated it into what you call it into Nuzzle, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As I would if I were Jonathan Abrams  So if I click on something that is amp enabled like this NY times one  Yeah, you see a little flash like that lightning bolt and then it loads the page directly  So that goes very quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me look at that on desktop. I'm gonna do the same thing  It did not do that on desktop  It did not do that on so let me let me do that again  This is from Nuzzle clicking a New York Times article  And while it did load fast because it cached it it is not an amped version of New York time  You could tell just by looking at it because this bit's probably unapproved JavaScript and so forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, whereas if I click the NY mag one it takes longer. It's noticeably slower. So click that one  Um  Well, it's not terrible but it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also subtext maybe somewhat maybe in the foreground response to the  Ad blocker boycott and I'm going to call it a boycott people using ad blocker to boycott advertising on the web  Uh, and a response to kind of out of control ad tech. There are ads in amp  in fact, one of the news stories of this week is that uh companies like um  uh  If I kind of surprised me outbrain and tabooly will be part of the amp project  tabula  Uh, these are two, uh, two two two advertising tech companies. I would prefer did not be part of the amp project outbrain  Outbrain is the and tabula too are the ones that add  Uh, you like this story. You're gonna love this story about belly fat to the bottom of many websites  But that's laughing at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, one nice thing is amp says, okay  You know what the ad size in it is in is in advance and so you don't have the page stuttering up and down  As you're trying to load it, you know as you're about to click on something suddenly the link changes and now it's an ad or something  Like that and there's also formats that are faster and sort of standardized  And so you're not going to have this pop-up that sort of floats around on the page and blocks everything  So it's intended to make the web faster  But I think the nice thing is users will like it as well because they can sort of understand  Okay, this is this is something that uh that I can  Tell is the article. This is something that is definitely uh, you know an ad and it's not the case that the ad has to be annoying  It can be reasonable and fast and I think users will like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A fast outbrain is no better

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but the thing so the point is that outbrain is a there's a pattern there which is here's some other stuff you might like to read  Um, and there was if you have no life it'll really stupid. It's mostly link bait. Yeah  Yeah  Um, so there's this notion of story cards, which is here's a bunch of previews of other other sites that  Um, you want to it could be standardized that but that got a bit sidelined into a can we have a templating language?  Which is a shame. There was a bug that we wrote there. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so that in fact you just pushed pushed along the  Yeah, the github, uh  Link intent to implement amp template  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So basically we started out to the conversation started out being how do we do these story card like things at the bottom from someone at?  The guardian right and we went back and forth on oh, yeah  There's ways to do that and you know, I I pitched micro formats and indy web because that's what I do  Because actually we solve this problem. Um, and then they were like, oh we need a templating language blah blah blah  And then if this became we're going to implement in sampling language  So i'm not quite sure how that actually helps in terms of standardizing the idea of  Um story cards because the thing is the story card idea is basically  the same idea as  content description format and rss and all these things that we've had for nearly 20 years  Which is how do I get a set of summaries from one side onto another side?  you know this this is  In terms of solve problems, we have to solve the problem  but um  Everyone seems to want to like do something more complicated each time we try and do it which is kind of frustrating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can understand why somebody like jonathan ambers would love amp because it makes his app  fast and respond better and people are reading stuff in his  In his uh, nuzzle and I do I use nuzzle  um  He said I kind of fundamentally misunderstood or or I can't remember if he was that  Rod he said I misunderstood amp or misrepresented in some ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but what we can cut the chase is that I asked him to be on the show next week and he said sure. Oh good  Yeah, what are we talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we get his his point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the other point is that the thing that he's the thing that I showed a minute ago, um  Inside nuzzle was that he's implemented displaying amp stuff in nuzzle, right? Um, and the question I asked of google  um  also in the project which I'll I think I dropped in there a couple of minutes ago was  That's great. But is there a way to you know, we can all embed amp things because they're um, html  So we can just embed them as an iframe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that will work and because there's a link there's a url to an amp page

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And an amp page is just it's a webpage with one particular job library and a bunch of other markup that but if

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a way to deduce an amp page from a url? Can you just like add?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they've got a rel amp  They've got a rel tag defined for which way how to find the amp page. So you have to look into the page to see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  though

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't just well  Yeah, well, yeah, but if you're a parser you can do that. Yeah, you're fetching it something anyway  You can do that. So, you know, so no one baked this in with a while ago and they your website has it  my website has it because then helpfully did that for us, but um the  the thing that google hasn't said this hasn't released code for is how to do the  um the thing that they did in the demo thing which is where you have multiple  Amp things and it preloads the next one and fetches it so you can swap between them instantly  Which was which is the one of the most compelling parts of the demo?  Whereas if you actually have to tear down an iframe and create an iframe and fetch everything each time you click then there's still  Still still some overhead. Um, and so that the question I was asking that in that issue was  Can we have some sample code for doing that?  Please because that would be useful for those of us who want to embed and things other things and that's not that they said  That's not ready yet  So what and we'll talk with maybe that'll show up and we'll talk with jonathan next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My my objection to amp is essentially that it feels like it's forking the web mat  Do you have a response to yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do and and I appreciate that you have played devil's advocate with this and and the fact that you just launched your new site  That is very javascript heavy which is you know  Sort of the opposite end of the spectrum from the I have one article and I want to put it up and here's two or  Three ads to do with it. Um, there are a couple new things one is uh,  Just today google added amp error reporting to the search console. So for people who want to try to support amp  Uh, you can get a lot more help with it now and that's sort of automated and and that's available to everybody  The other thing is after I was on  This week in google with jeff side by side. I talked to  um  A couple people on the webspam team who have actually worked on the the validator for amp pages  And I I love that people in webspam do this consistently. Uh, one person, uh, she worked on the birthday doodle  Another person worked on support for https and and from that conversation  From one of the people who worked on the validator. I feel much better about  You know that google's intent is trying to do the best it can  To try to make sure that we support an open web  and I think  jingra richard jingras and and everybody else realizes that if it's not something that's open and federated and supported by a ton of  Publishers and offers the options that they need. So for example, there's another uh url in the rundown about  supporting subscriptions and paywalls and that sort of stuff if you don't  Support the sort of things that publishers need and that users want so it's a win on both sides  Then it's not going to take off and people will just go to proprietary wild gardens. And so from what i've  Heard from talking to people inside google. I actually feel pretty optimistic that  This will be a pretty nice win in terms of instead of having 20 different analytics, you know little beacons. You could just have  One analytics include and then that would be able to power the chart beads or the google analytics that you want to do  And I do think you'll end up with a better experience  Your point is well taken. You know, what if google has veto power on what goes in the javascript to create the widgets?  But from talking to the person that I talked to at google  I do feel better about that like they're going to try to support as much as they can and still try to be reasonable

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good and I don't want to spend a lot of times it sounds like we'll be talking about this next week  Yeah, but you hadn't been able to weigh in all this time. You've been running along listening to twig  Completely unable to shout at us. So  Is there anything else on your mind you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, there was I was listening to twig and and you said  Matt cutts is probably running right now and I was literally on the treadmill right there  Everybody in the gym's like what's that guy's yelling?  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, it's good to be back. It's wonderful to have you jeff. How's davos? Is this started the world economic forum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah all busy today. I came from a reception. Sorry. They're vacuuming around me. Uh, I came from a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can see that this is kind of poignant. I feel like it's an edward hopper painting like  nighthawks at the davos

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The man is working hard need to get a release

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like me, no, I didn't no you don't  This is a podcast. No one cares

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh  So so facebook has a big presence here this year. They built a whole two-story pavilion  Right by the bus stop by the congress center, which is a big deal  and uh, so uh  They had a little reception for some media people today. I went to sheryl sandberg was there  And at it they're showing off the fact that how wonderful they are to the net and they have some of the material from the  Uh big winged drone there  It's amazingly light the carbon fiber stuff and they have a little display about how they're bringing internet to the world with internet.org  And so they're really here in presence google  They're here, but they're not not being as visible by a long shot  um  So that's that's I thought interesting that they were hanging around is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The world economic forum a big as big a deal as it was, you know back in the day when it was bono hobnobbing  with the bill gates and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, those are your standards for world politics leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the people who run the world let's face it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, we do we do have uh, uh, I think bono's here and leo de caprio's here. Oh  Wow, that's actually pretty good. And how about angela? Angela merkel is she there? Oh, no. No, she didn't show up this year  Other world leaders, that's it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, uh biden is here making a mess of the traffic  Um, I tomorrow I get to be in a session with the new head of argentina and the new head of canada  I'm very excited about seeing I saw him today. He's he's boy  And i'm getting in trouble with your listeners leo, but don't blame him blame me  The cut the contrast between uh trudeau and trump across the border is just phenomenal trudeau and harper. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that too that too that will make the canadians happy for the most part if we say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, uh, but but he was he was uh, charming and amazing today

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I for I for one look forward to a trump palin ticket in uh, 26

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's exciting. Did you see did you see the daily news from page? Yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm with stupid. I was stupid and they're both pointing at each other  I didn't realize the daily news was such a leftist rag

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is the last in the last six months or so they have done brilliant page once brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well trump's given them a lot of fuel for uh for that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, so tomorrow I see the folks and i'm sure we talked about am how long before uh, how long before uh the uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, univision univision buys the daily news. That's my question

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question because you saw what they bought this they bought the onion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cool. I think well, I loved npr's headline. What was it? Uh, yeah area newspaper sold to univision  No kidding and no kidding. Yeah, they had to add that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was great. Yeah, I think it's uh, some people went after me on twitter saying what a stupid move

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's great. It's no it's a new univision because they're recognizing that they're uh,  Their natural audience which is spanish spanish speaking latinos in the u.s  Is dwindling because the second generation?  Are speaking english and they're not watching univision  So and and if you want to reach those millennials humor is the best way and so it's uh,  It actually makes a lot of sense. They started fusion with uh, that was with nbc universal, right?  That's abc abc which is backing out. Yeah, they're backing out of fusion. ABC is yeah, abc interesting interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have a couple brilliant executives there isaac lee is in charge of uh,  Univision digital fusion borja etcheveria  Etcheveria is in charge of uh digital news and they're really bright and they're doing neat things  So yeah, it's it's not a bad call though. I think they're probably too smart to want a newspaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, although they wouldn't mind going after trump a little bit after he went after

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  True true miss universe contest. I was just going to say if you're talking to trudeau  He was uh, just opening up google's helping to open up google's waterloo office  And something I didn't know apparently he actually learned or knows how to code in c++

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think everybody under 40 knows c++ isn't that the case and he's a skateboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, not only am I a former teacher but I also when I was studying engineering got halfway decent as a coder in c++  He says can you imagine if if the president of the united states could you know code in c++?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well to his credit obama has promoted coding as the you know, maybe over promoted the future coding for the  future but um  That's impressive. Wow. Yeah, wow  Because c++ is a not a is a non-trivial  undertaking by all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Accounts, I will try to ask. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would have taken php, but c++ is impressive. So can you give us some cold samples? What's your github reputation?  Do you have any commits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That phoebe is there okay, so phoebe a question I could actually ask besides that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you got to ask him the one for you know, president obama, which was basically if you had to sort a million numbers  Would you go with a bubble sort or a quick sort?  You know, and he'll be like definitely not a bubble sort and then everybody can clap

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be awesome  Awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know I uh, I have been reading donald canoes lately and as a matter of fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, wow, there you go programmer humor  Um, I can't there is a lot of amp news, but I i'm gonna  I guess I should defer it a good good article though, uh in the monday note, uh, which is I was reading that  Yeah, I thought so. Uh, this is from uh, frederick filu who co-authors this with jean louis gasse  Google's amp poised to take the lead from facebook and apple's walled guards  And that is the point that jonathan abrams made as well is hey if the alternative is  Facebook or apple apple news or facebook's, uh, what do they call them stories?  Then then uh, this is a better solution  I think it really isn't necessarily a better solution. It's just who do you trust google facebook or apple?  I think there's similar solutions in some ways aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they're similar in that they're all html subsets, which means that you have to like munger one's open source  google and google's one is open source and is closer to html though. It still has a bunch of um,  Weirdness is in like read funny image and audio and video. Um,  facebook's one  I don't remember which one which order which facebook's one is is is  Um kind of its own subset of html with a bunch of weird suggestions of what you use  It's basically parsing bits of html ignoring other bits and apple's one is two things  It's a sort of strange hybrid because it's partly rss with html in and partly its own markup xml language  which is kind of like the stuff they use for the  apple tv and  um the  um the stuff that there's internal to the itunes store, so  Basically you end up having to write a translator from your content management system into into three different into three new markup languages  And although google google's one is that?  Amp is the is the is the simplest of those I think because it is mostly html is it conceivable matt

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There could be some sort of pre processor that would you could run?  Your page through and get all three

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, there's already uh, you know, like wordpress plugins for example so that you don't have to worry about it yourself  So in theory you can have something like that that generates it  I think for me the bigger hurdle is how do you  You know get into apple news i'm not exactly sure what the process for that would be with google  You know, it's you just add your your rel amp link or whatever and it sort of can get auto discovered  But i'm not sure what the filter is for facebook or apple news

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing for you talks about a little bit is the paywall issue  He says uh amp engineering is consistently asked by publishers ranging from the wall street journal new york times and the financial times to les echo  For some way to have paywalls work  With amp and that's difficult because of the multiple caches involved but apparently amp engineers they're working on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The paywall places want it want some help with paywalls from both amp and instant articles. I'd love to see uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd love to see amp say no paywall  That's the solution no paywall well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the problem is you want to help publishers because if you if you don't have a strong web then you know  To have that you need publishers, but  You know, um, we try to help with like first click free for example, which is google search results  Right, you know, so there's been a lot of attempts to support that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but yeah or a limited viewing of a document as a few points out where you get the first half of the document, but then  and that or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, or google contributor. So I but you have to solve this problem for publishers  So I think it's good that google's trying and amp is trying to tackle that problem. By the way, I have to say I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I uh use google contributor and i'm seeing it more and more places. I'm really pleased about that  That to me more than amp is a contribution to this whole ad blocking a fiasco  What do you think jeff of characterizing as doc serles and others of characterizing uh, the ad blocking as a boycott

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's a fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Argument don't you it is us as users saying  Uh, nothing against you news organizations or your website guys, but we're gonna boycott your ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think I think the we we messed up the web we publishers messed up the web with advertisers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't even blame publishers. I really blame the ad guys. I blame well we

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh ad tech too, but but but but just  Ad salespeople ad agencies brands we all just threw more junk on and and then with it, you know  Another line of javascript and we messed up the web doc serles had a great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Blog post a couple of days ago rethinking john wannamaker wannamaker is the guy who probably didn't say it  Apparently, but it is a great quote. He says I know half of my ads don't work. I just don't know which half  Um, but he makes the point that really  brand ads are the kind of advertising people should be  Embarked on he said this whole notion that targeting people  aiming like with laser like precision at somebody who has done a search for  Men's undergarments and bombarding them. He says we don't know if somebody's in the market  We can't tell there's no way of knowing if they're about to buy he said the best way to advertise is with brand advertising  um a brand  And this is from a journal of advertising research article. The waste in advertising is the part that works  Uh brand advertising has the effect of making a company familiar whether the audience likes it or not  And that is a requirement for any large company selling to a large market  You may never buy a ford f-150 truck, but you're damn sure going to know about it  If you watch football on tv  In other words, it doesn't hurt to have everybody, you know who you are and what you sell and when the time comes  To buy something those familiar names leap to mind  Um and and ad tech really he says ad tech really  Misunderstands it's not an effective way to reach people. I mean aside from the thing that's annoyed  Your customers to the point where they're blocking you  Right, yes, uh that that's a side effect  but uh  He says this this is a kind of a misunderstanding of how advertising works and doc is  I kind of agree with him and doc's the guy who wrote the clue train manifesto and go wrote it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead. Well, that's that's it. There's there's yeah, there's there's there's kind of three kinds of advertising  Um, there's the stuff that doc is talking about there, which is the brand advertising which is I want to show this to a large  number of people and  and  In the world, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the kind of ads you see on major networks on the super bowl that kind of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not direct response actual billboards. As you said billboard is a classic thing there  um then there's the very strongly targeted advertising which is basically the thing google invented with search advertising which is  Um, I know you're searching for something and I will discreetly add some links to the side that give you places to buy that thing  Um, and that that's that's again clearly valuable because it's targeted and then there's this fuzzy thing in the middle  Which is this notional targeted stuff which um is in this which is the stuff that um, macha cheklovsky writes about wonderfully where  Basically, there's this giant arms race to gather more and more information  um with decreasing returns because they're trying desperately to to um,  Intuit what?  What will make you buy something and we are gradually learning that all the things that work the first time don't work anymore  um, and that's that's a bit that's misastatized and this is this is why there's a backlash because um,  There is this notion that the more information you have about the the end user the the more precisely you can target them and actually that's that's  That's been a bit dubious for a long time  and this was and you know, the the challenge was advertising was always a  let's guess let's try and subdivide the audience into different people and and  And so advertising to that that targeted group  That's that's how magazines and newspapers got away with them charging high ad rates for a long time because they were saying  Well, we've got a great audience full of rich people doing this kind of thing and therefore you should advertise to those  um  And again that that works if you're like I have a brand but it's only valuable to this set of people  But the the notion of the micro targeting I think has been has been um less effective than that

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doc has also written a blog post called apple's content blocking is chemo for the cancer of ad tech  So we know we we know on which on which side he sits matt. You might agree with that actually. I mean  Well, I just got brave so  Hold on matt

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matt, sorry. Oh, I I was just gonna say that  You know, I love contributor. I love patreon and I saw that patreon raised money this week and and it's just that's great  If you can have patreon supported, you know enterprise then you've got support from the people that you love your thousand fans  and it's exactly the kind of thing where everybody's happy and so, uh,  You know what you were saying? We're more and more people you see more and more sites using google contributor  I see that as well and i'm very happy about that  And I just kind of hope if we could get to an inflection point where enough people know about it and enough publishers use it  You know, why wouldn't you try that as a business model for a for a publisher?  You know, it's just extra money and and lets people support the the sort of sites that they love

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I uh, one of the things google contributor lets you do is replace ads with the the image of your choice and I decided to put kittens  On pages and I have now many many pages with cats

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I had uh, I had jack connie come to an event at cuny a small a small work group about public media  We go what a star he is. He is just amazing. Isn't he? He's god. He's phenomenal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His story is great too because he and uh his uh, I think wife  natalie have had a musical group called poplamos they still do and they  Put a lot of heart and soul and sweat into youtube videos got would get millions of views and a few  Thousand bucks and it didn't make up for the cost or the effort they put into it  And he said there's got to be a better way and founded patreon  Scratched his own itch and has really empowered a lot of people including many podcasters  To do that. It's it's one route, but it is it is it is kind of a pure route. It's a nice route  I like it. I agree. Let's go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's go back to apple for one second if we could I think we we might have missed this story  And I think it's critical apple killed its ad service fired its ad staff and this what's key about this is  And i've said this for some time apple failed at advertising  And thus apple is now motivated to pull the rug out from everyone else who depends on advertising  So watch for apple to get more and more hostile to advertising on mobile, which is where everything is going to go  And and there's going to be more i'll bet they're going to make uh ad blockers defaulted and they're just going to say  to publishers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're making it the advertising. Well, they're making a virtue out of a necessity because I think the truth is iad failed  And uh, it was it was uh, they were putting too many restrictions on advertisers. It was too much work  There were a lot of reasons it was the little banner ads you see in apps and things like that  Oftentimes a full page takeover in apps so they're shutting it down  But what they're doing is double I I agree with you jeff is going to double down on this  Oh, but we're all for user privacy and obviously running an ad network is is kind of counter to that notion

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think that is to thumb up the nose of uh or other bodily orifice of google. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the way apple can fight google. I don't think it's you need not say a thumb up the nose  Merely a a way to position themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh as the privacy company, I know I think they can they can actively hurt google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd be very careful about thumbing google's nose as microsoft has learned to its detriment. I think  Uh now after the gmail after the gmail man adds  That put them in an awkward position

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was interesting to me that microsoft for a while in internet explorer was proposing blocking  Any third party thing that was included for more than like three sites which would have the net effect of blocking like all analytics  And a ton of different ad things and so  Microsoft pulled back from that based on what a lot of people said but it seems like apple to jeff's point has kind of  At least enabled that or you know a couple steps of indirection enabled that and what's also interesting to me is people love patreon  Which takes I think five percent cut and people sort of chafe at maybe apple taking a 30 cut of purchasing  And so it's it's interesting to think about that spectrum of like where does the love start?  You know, and where where does it become a much transaction? Yeah  Yeah, the people love cd baby and those kinds of businesses and maybe it's just that it's a small percentage. I'm not sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, well, I think that's right. I think there is a you know, there is a transition here  Um from think what what you can support with what because part of what we've learned from patreon and kickstarter  And other systems like that is that actually people are willing to pay for things  But they're willing to pay different amounts of of money for different  And that depends on how much they like the thing and how much disposable income they have whereas and kevin they're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So can I finish? Um, sorry whereas advertising?  Assumes that nobody wants to pay very much and commoditizes them all down to to  A uniform amount per person and and and spreads it out over that  So in effect, it only actually does work if you have millions of people watching  whereas patreon kickstarter and other things of that elk can work if you have  Thousands of people watching if they if they care enough and I think that's a that's an interesting  Transformation of the media scene and one that hasn't fully sunk in yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All I was gonna say, sorry, sorry the lag here, um  Paying for is is a critical phrase here because because they're not paying for access on patreon really they're paying to support

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because even if you don't contribute you get the podcast or the music or whatever. It's right, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so that's a key difference you're supporting versus paying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  paying to get and and by the way, that's  It's very limited what you can do with that  I'll be honest with you because we tried to do that for several years at the beginning now  Of course, we didn't have the infrastructure of patreon  But there was no way I could have built twit without advertising  Um, right. There's just nobody was going to give enough money to do  what we've done  Even when we sold bricks to build the studio we as many as we sold and we sold 1800 bricks  Uh, it only went about a quarter of the way toward building a studio  right, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but you are you're on you are on the other end of that spectrum in that you do have you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're in the millions. I agree but but if you want to have that spectrum  You have to have a spectrum of that of monetization options if you're if you want everything to be  Small and user, you know the the patronage system is a great system  But there's only a few Michelangelo's that can be you know  And and I think even fewer medichis

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there's even fewer new york times is is the point is that I think you can  I think if you frame it that way around you've got it you've got it slightly backwards in that  There are there are many people who could have their artistic work, right? We want many many many many. That's right. That's right  Whereas whereas there is this sort of um, there should be only one twit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, but no, but there is this there is this I had this I went to the social computing supposing new york last week  And had and one of the sessions there was um  TV people talking about how they use social media and it was fascinating to hear their point of view on it, which is that  Their point of view is that tv is a wonderful thing because it enables us to do these these large-scale things and it's like well  it enables you to do those large-scale things but it um to say that  The net doesn't enable that is to miss the point that it enables a gigantic range of things that tv cuts off which we love  And it's very hard for for those two mindsets to meet because if you are if you are successful in  You know in big media, um, it's it's it's difficult to take the kind of leap that you took leo and say, okay  I can do this myself  um  On my own time and on my own skill. It's it's it's not a trivial thing to do and it's actually very hard  and  For them to you know  It's easier for them to say what we need is to find the people who are doing something in the in these in this sort of  In this trivial net media over here and make them into tv stars and that's that's the sort of the mindset you get  Yeah  It's basically basically the original max headroom movie 20 minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You actually are are max headrooming right now, which is kind of have an amazing  an amazing kind of  juxtaposition  We have a great panel and we're going to put up with some of the uh of bandwidth issues  Jeff jarvis, of course is in uh switzerland at davos at the world economic forum. Actually his bandwidth's not too bad  He's doing all right. It's it's kevin march in the heart of silicon valley who's having the most trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, yeah, thanks to dan lians. I think uh the inside  It's really a show that probably is better appreciated in silicon valley than outside of it

It's hysterical turned out  It was him  He's got this great boston accent too so I could just I hear him reading it  So for some reason then he moved to hubspot  Uh, which was like a social I don't know what it was. It was a it was a social network, but he was um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Content marketing so basically it's like they call it inbound marketing  They call it inbound marketing. So the point is it's it's using social media stuff to bring you clients in a sensible way rather than a spammy advertising way  That's that's their broad pitch. So it's they've got a bunch of tools for um bringing  You know helping you make sense of explaining your stuff online to social media and things  So that he left i'm not quite sure how he fit in there and I don't think he was sure either

Transcript:  No, he he was and I remember meeting him at the moto x event at google and uh, and he was like  I don't know what i'm doing here. But anyway, and I love him. I really like dan  And then uh, although others in the industry do not I know a certain well-known tech journalist  Who says I will not be in the same room with dan lians?

We're talking about google. We're talking about  facebook  Uh interesting article in fortune today about facebook's walled garden some publishers  perhaps  Not so excited aol is teaming up  with microsoft and verizon  To say we want a control distribution  Um and the founder and ceo of new york-based tabula interestingly enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Taking multiple mentions in this episode. It is the tabula show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says i'm scared of a future where facebook's getting 80 of your business  That's true, but i'm also scared of a future where there's tabula on every page

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Which

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way is not the fine thing called taboo lee, which is a lovely salad  dish  Made of what is it wheat groats? What's in taboo lee something odd, but it's delicious  Uh tabula and aol have announced a three-year partnership what by the way, what is did you see the story that aol may want to rebrand itself?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would happen to your seo if you changed the name of your company that's been like one of them  And yeah at the same time america online does sound a little bit like a cd in the mail for a dial-up service  Right. I think they have a problem  It was  We'll see what happens. We'll see what happens. Yeah aol is now tech crunching gadget the hovington post is much more of a content  Play than anything else, but I don't know what name you could pick  That would  I just I don't know how you could do that. You're kind of stuck with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody said uh aol ol ol ol ol or something  Aol ol is good  Bulger by the way, I like aol. Let me be perfectly clear  I like a lot of the properties that they have are great. He tweeted that I spent a lot of time on aol. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bulger is the wheat product that is in taboo lee. Oh, okay. Yeah bulger wheat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  update  Did you see the article about uh google core update algorithm continues as seo's notice weekend google update

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let me ask you about penguin because I guess we're getting close  To the to the new penguin is an algorithm. Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Penguin is an algorithm. Yeah the um, it's kind of interesting where our rule of thumb is never to announce stuff in the future  Because you know it could slip or you know for various other reasons. We might want to go back and tweak things. So I I think  Uh folks at google had been like, okay penguin is coming and then the holidays came and they're like well  Let's hold off on penguin for a little while longer and in general  Around the holidays google doesn't want to create extra stress for publishers and webmasters. Yeah  So we tend not to roll out a lot of algorithmic changes right right in the middle of december  But then what happens is if you freeze your code  Then people keep working and come january 1st january 2nd 3rd 4th 5th people are like, okay  We get to launch everything. Yay. And so my suspicion. I don't know for sure is that this particular change  I don't think that it was penguin. It was just  There's a lot of stuff that's been building up in the pipeline and now the code freeze has been lifted and we're ready to  start launching stuff and so you see a lot more changes often right at the beginning of the year because  You know everything's been waiting to go out. I love this article by barry schwartz

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the search engine round table google's gary alias shares confidential screenshot that reveals nothing  Yeah, that was a little not mean  So he says barry schwartz I heard you wanted pictures here's one of my screen. Yes, I do. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And barry does something where every day he publishes a picture related to the search photo of the day  Yeah, so he was saying it's been slim pickings. And so here you go. Here's a confidential  Maybe it's how long the videos are we have no idea we've had barry on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We love him and so gary alias is uh your colleague. I imagine webmaster trends analyst at google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he along with john Mueller and uh, there's actually several webmaster trends analysts, uh, you know do a fantastic job of like  um  Letting people know about new things happening, you know in addition to the google webmaster blog  They do webmaster hangouts all sorts of great ways to help people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he kind of implied the penguin was imminent  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and and I suspect it will be coming and uh, I know the webspam team has been thinking hard about you know  Do you do it as a single kind of push or do you do it so that it's continuously updating like page rank continuously updates?  And so it tends to be you know, you do these things manually until you get a good handle on it  And then after a while you can figure out how to make it work continuously. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And uh search engine line had a story that said, uh  That fluctuations what are fluctuations?  Just ranking changes ranking changes and that was not due to penguin, but that was due to just updates to page rank to the core  Would you please explain? You know what? This is a great time and kevin you'll forgive me if I  You i'm sure know all of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I went through the induction of google so I probably know some of it. Yeah, it's way more than anyone else. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are we talking here page everybody knows page rank, uh named after larry page. It's the very famous  Kind of algorithm that made that put google on the map the and and in  In my limited understanding that the notion of page rank is you rank higher  Uh as long it's kind of recursive as long as high as the more higher ranked pages linked to you  Yep, and that's still in effect. That's not changing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we still have a system called page rank over time some of the underlying, uh,  Representations and how we run the algorithms have changed  But the intuition is still the same the intuition is roughly if you were surfing around on the web  What sort of pages would you be likely to end up on?  You know, it's basically a measure of reputation  And so we we compute page rank differently than we might have in the initial patent disclosures and the initial papers  But the end result is still basically the same the the highly reputable sites tend to have high page rank and the ones that are  You know not very well known or don't have a lot of links tend to have lower page rank, but I remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the early days talking to larry  And he and I don't and I don't really understand what it meant  But he said I will look at the end of the line on this like i'll go to the end of the printout  And look at it and tweak the algorithm. I don't even know what that means

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know if you look at page site sorted by page rank  Yeah, you know you get to the very bottom and and i'm guessing about what he's meaning  But you know if you get to a site at the very bottom and you're like  Well, I expect this to have pretty good page rank and it doesn't right then you might go back and read

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that's probably what he meant. Yeah, I always thought seeds and stems somehow involved, but I don't that's probably not it  but it's kind of like the stuff that kind of it's the  The detritus after all of the all of the index works and why isn't this you know, what what is this?  Why is this here? What is this doing? I mean something has to be at the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Obviously, yeah, and there's always more pages that we could crawl. So you always have to make that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's always more. Yeah, so the algorithm is always being tweaked somewhat  Yeah, and then there are these named things like penguin. What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So penguin is is more targeted towards web spam panda is more targeted towards quality  Hummingbird is more, you know doing weightings about you know overall queries. So  Usually they they don't give them names  If it's something that people might really notice then you then you'd be more likely to give an algorithm a name  Because this is happening every day probably right? Oh, yeah, like 500 changes launch every year. Wow 500 plus  So several times a day. Wow. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah  And that's why if you don't launch anything or don't launch any major changes in ranking, you know right before the holidays  Yeah, that's why all that would you know, it's accumulated more changes exactly. Yeah, it's like a roll-up. It's like a hot fix roll-up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does just out of curiosity?  So there's there's like a team of search engineers  Oh, yeah, and somebody and and then what there's a meeting saying i'm thinking of changing the algorithm to do this  Somebody proposes a change  And then in fact, go ahead tell me how it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you you it works exactly the way you'd think it would work  You've got smart people looking at search results and even looking at queries and and when it that failed and they come up with new  Ideas for how to improve things once they have ideas they test it out  You know sort of in a sandbox and then if that works  Then they'll roll it out and testing more broadly even on the live search results and then they take all of that  Or sometimes it happens more than once a week where they say here's a change. Here's what it affects  Here's how many users are affected in each language and then they debate the relative merits of does it make the system more complex?  now one interesting thing is  they actually  Produced a video of one of these meetings and so you can go and find like a 10 minute segment of people discussing an actual algorithmic  Change and whether to launch it or not. Yeah, that is that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those must be fascinating meetings. Well, it's a lot of fun. Yeah  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but I mean the other things to take away from that this this also fascinating is that  They're continually running experiments at any time using google  You may be part of multiple experiments at once and one of the smart things that they did was was enabling that sort of  Facility that meant that it wasn't a big change once a month, but they were able to continuously roll different things in and out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the quality launch review meeting  happens on thursdays  and in this case, uh  They're talking about spelling  Something to do with spelling. Look at all these this is so cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's omit sigal. He's the head of all of search. You know, there's well, I won't there's paul and tristan

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I won't identify on by what's nice is this video has pop-up pop-up video. So yeah, you can  It's kind of fun. You can actually listen to it and uh, is that chap in the white shirt? Are you in that video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would I would go to those meetings as well. So  They they try to figure out how to make these meetings interesting because for a lot of people they might consider it dull as dust  I you know for techies, it's pretty fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But uh, it's it looks like a un conference, I mean, it's really cool  I mean the little microphones you almost feel like there should be simultaneous translation going on  It's a big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They'll have you know engineers dialing in from japan or all kinds of other places and then you've got people around the table who?  Are experts who have really dug into you have a separate evaluation group  And and so they have evaluated each individual change and those people get those their voices get a lot of weight whenever you're deciding

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whether to launch and you were there in in your role as this in the in the spam  Fighters to kind of just in case something has an impact on the work you do  Yeah, or or publishers webmasters in general. Okay, so you represent the webmasters as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, now that was you know, i've been out on leave so I haven't been in these meetings for a while  Well, I can tell your beard's considerably longer now  Yes, that's incidentally

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just to make you happy  Let's see what's going on  with matt cuts  I'm trying to link link to this. Yes. Yes. Yes, it's happened  Oh, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, what do we have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I knew the minute I said that it was all over  That cuts at matt cuts beard  20 minutes  That was fast  So, uh, uh, by the way, I also have another important thing to tell you today is penguin awareness day  And now now I admit there's one of two big penguin days april 25th is world penguin day  So you've got two important benchmarks here if you want to release penguin  We should do it on those dates that would be hilarious

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're like I didn't want to be that aware of pinkwood

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is penguin awareness day everybody so it has a name  It's a jocular name obviously doesn't have anything to do with the actual code in it. It's not black and white or anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  penguin publishers have been  Posting gifts all day have they really? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well whenever we go to a search conference, they'll give us like stuffed penguins or stuffed pandas  You know, so it's it's kind of handy that it's not like named, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By number or something like that. I know you're not directly involved with it  But do you have some sense of what uh, what changes might happen with penguin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, oh penguin actually came directly out of webspam. Oh pandas overall search quality  Yeah, yeah penguin came directly out of webspam. All the seos are listening matt  And so it tries to improve quality of content  Where have I heard that before?  But uh, but they the nice thing is there are people at google who are always listening to feedback

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, uh and uh, well and you don't have to listen real hard because if somebody's ranking goes from second to fifth  You're gonna hear it. You hear about it. You hear about it  Absolutely, do they come to your home?  Uh  Okay, you don't have to no no don't say anything you'd be smart you'd be wise to avoid that conversation  Yeah  anyway, uh  You're smiling at this at this event though. You're very you're very uh, you're very happy. You're having a good time  i'm looking at the video matt's all of you launch me that's rubbing. Wait a minute. Go back a little bit because  Show the video because not only is he smiling but in a little bit  I think I can imagine what's going through your head here as he rubs his beard. I wonder if I should should I grow a beard?  Maybe I should I should grow a beard. I wonder how I'd look with a beard. I think about that right now  This was four years ago, so uh, the beard was just a twinkle in your eye at this time  Okay, let's talk about something else enough about penguin I think i'm never gonna get anything out of you anyway, so  It's just as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Folks are working hard to make things better all the time. Yes, that's the main thing to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that's actually really cool this kind of um  You know, I mean that's your core. That's your business. It's like the coke never changes the secret recipe, but google has to constantly  You know adjust the secret recipe

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right well and the web changes so you have to adapt to that as well. Right. It's not merely to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh improve your algorithm. It's actually to respond to things that have changed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you know people care more about freshness and breaking news now, for example  So you got to respond to those kinds of things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, I am not going to engage it has a headline which I would not really uh support google's creepy plan to kill  the password  However, they are talking about something called project abacus  Um you which I think is fascinating  Um  Your phone would generate a trust score  As it monitors location patterns voice and speech patterns how you walk how you type  Images that come in through the camera and it's if you think about it doesn't take a whole lot of data points to be a unique  fingerprint  better than a fingerprint  you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well  Yeah, but that means like  I go to the wrong part of town and injure myself and suddenly my phone stops working. I can't call for help  You know, there's there's there's a challenge with a lot of these pattern matching things  Is that they're they're trying really hard to fit you into a box  and that  You still need an escape from the box. That's  That's often problem with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure why violet blue's writing about this because I mean this was announced at google io last year, right?  This is part of the atap presentation  I don't know if it's a bad idea. I think it's a very interesting idea. I mean really the problem of authentication is a very difficult

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Problem and a very important problem. It's it's really passwords. It's clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are the worst way to solve it?  And that's a broken they're broken and it's a new thing because uh, I don't know if it's a good thing  I don't know if it's a bad idea  I don't know if it's a bad idea  I don't know if it's a bad idea  And that's so broken they're broken and it's a new thing because uh, I I I never really thought about this  But somebody said something  Until recently the only thing you had to remember is maybe your phone number in your in your locker  combination  And now we've got to remember if we're doing it right unique passwords for hundreds of different sites and  computers and stuff  and uh  Of course nobody can do that. So the incentive is to write it down put it on a post-it note  Uh come up with some or use the same password all the time, which is what I think almost everybody does  And is really dangerous, too  right  um  So we use password managers and people watch these shows. I'm sure are all using password managers, but  You know recently, uh, we talked about yesterday on security now, uh, somebody  Security researchers showed how easy it would be to fish last passes  Um not not merely last passes password login, but their second factor  In fact, it's easier if you're using two factor with last pass  And oh, what are you using a yuba key?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, this is it's google calls it a security key  But basically it makes you less susceptible to fishing and the nice thing about this is you know  When you need to authenticate you you just insert this usb in and you press the button and so somebody physically needs to be there  but it also relies on a hash of the domain name, so you can't get fished because  Or or you can't really be fished because it only know  This will only authenticate to a valid google.com domain for example, and it's an open standard fido udf. You can look it all up  But that's fido. Okay, that's a fido. Yeah. Yeah. So if you've got passwords here two factor authentication is here security keys are up here  and uh, you know you have to spend a little bit of money to get one but it makes you so much less likely to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hacked and i worry about uh losing the key though

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you can always fall back on you know things like passwords and you know  Texts to your phone and stuff like that  But uh, but I really feel like you're a lot more secure if you're willing to take that extra step

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is fido about two factor? Is it is essentially a second factor or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh as I understand it. Yes, it's sort of a framework that lets you do, you know  This sort of authentication as I understand i'm not 100 sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, and kevin marks you pointed on the in the chat room to a site called will someone  Uh that uses email authentication

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, now this is a this is a site that a friend of mine's put together and this but this uses email and authentication  But it doesn't make you create passwords. So when you do that  You send you put your email in it sends you an email and you click through on the email  Um, and that's it. You're you're then in which which we're starting to see other sites do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it set a cookie in the browser? How does it do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says it's it's it's that's a cookie in the browser once you are logged in. Yes. See that's a that's not a great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  solution  um  For security facebook does the same thing once you authenticate with facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it sends a unique id to your email a link you click on that link and then you go there and then then there's a cookie set  Which everything else does as well every time you sign in a cookie is right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But as we saw with fire sheep, uh, that's that can you know  If there's a flaw in a browser or if you're not using htps  That cookie can be vulnerable

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right, but that's yeah, that's  It  It's less vulnerable than a bit of a fishable password. Yeah, this is this is a hard problem. I'm not saying this is trivial

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very hard  Uh, let me see. I just got the email  From will someone can I can I show the email or is that going to have something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a one-shot link so you should if you you can show it after you've clicked it, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so it says hi will someone provides individual communities better way to ask for help. Oh, that's cool  Uh click this link below to create your account a lot of people do this  But it's never going to ask me for a password again. So it's a non-expiring cookie

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, no, no the cookie will expire but if it if it expires then you then you have to log in again  You do it again create create you a new one of the things  Okay, and it also lets you log in with which is the other way around this  Because then you're just dealing the problem to google which they've they've put more effort into it than the little startup can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's that's oauth right? Is that what is that oauth? Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but again, if you're using google's auth, you're basically using cookies too. There's no yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just that anything persistent would have to be cookie based

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  um, although I'm more for uh mozilla which had something called persona and I think they're in the process of shutting that down but it  Sort of had the idea of baking identity and authentication into the browser  Which I think is pretty clever because you know if people use a common browser whether it's firefox or chrome or something like that  If that could handle more of the authentication where you don't have to remember the passwords quite as much  I think that would be nice, but it it seems like the pendulum is swinging away from that rather than towards it  Which is a shame

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My our friend steve gibson has a solution that he's hoping  Will gain some traction called squirrel  Uh, and I think if it came from google or microsoft it might have a shot  Uh, unfortunately because it's you know, just an individual doing it  Although he's got a pretty good community going on around it. It uh, it it's using a qr code or  Uh, it's I I don't really understand and he's explaining to me like a thousand times  and I and uh  It I don't understand it  But it has some advantages because it's so quick to sign in for instance  You wouldn't you could ask somebody to sign in every time  Uh, and so you wouldn't have to store a cookie you could have a you know active authentication every time  I know my bank for instance is never going to set a cookie  Uh, that just makes me let me log in anytime. I want that would be a bad idea  Right, so if you want if you have a site that needs to be secure you're going to have to have login each and every time  preferably with a second factor  Such a hard problem  Yeah, yeah, it's a shame

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a shame. Well, I mean so this is one of one of our  You know in the web of answers to this which is is um, it's called indior and the idea there is we're basically using the large sites  That um have put the effort into authentication, um to authenticate our own sites  So we do that by linking you link from your own site to one of these silos  And then from that silo you link back to your site  So you've got a two-directional link this works great if you have a website that you can that you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you need to have a website though that you could put these rel links in and all that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's that's where we're on these models. Um, and I use this by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because i'm on with known that was easy to do and I uh, I modified the html on a variety of different places and  So I can use indioth and I have and it works really great. In fact, yeah  I think I've used it on the show and used and gave out my uh, my cell phone number at the moment  Because I used because you can also use sms authentication. I like sms authentication. Is it what's wrong with that? Is there anything wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the the carrier's aren't always good at protecting you from getting hacked and it's possible to  Spoof, you know phone numbers from time to time whenever you call in to get voicemail. So  Uh, the caller id can be spoofable  So I i'm not sure I would trust my authentication to verizon or or at&t something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in the early days of paypal, I had a paypal football you press a button it would it would uh,  Every it was the same thing right? It was an authenticator just like google authenticator. It would generate a six digit  Code based on time plus secret  And that is that kind of what your phyto does

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, yes, so google authenticator and those kinds of standards usually use a secret hash  And a time code right so that way you don't even need to have a net connection, which is very very handy  Um, I think the the phyto stuff it puts the secret  Key or the you know, the secret key is actually on this guy on that right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can it be read? Could it be stolen from that? No, it must be encrypted. I don't yeah, I think it's encrypted

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not 100 sure but I think it's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the question is like it depends if you plug that into another thing and then plug that through you could probably do  A man in the middle of it to some extent. So I don't I don't think so. I think they but you see the physical possession of it  So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right  Darlene loves mad at you  Uh, oh, sorry. She uh sang a song called. It's a marshmallow world. Who doesn't love that song?  Uh, apparently somebody at google loves it a lot because it was used in the ad for nexus phones. You've seen the ad I love the ad  Um, did google not the or the ad company which is 72 and sunny, uh, did not ask her, uh permission

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The article is a little strange. Yeah it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds it sounds like it's not a copyright thing but that it's uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It embodied loves identity through the copying of her voice in other words they used uh, uh an impersonator

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe not they made a cover for it. They made a cover the songwriting thing which doesn't get the recording um sing fee

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a right  Because she didn't write the song so presumably the publishing rights were paid. Oh, okay, but the performance rights maybe weren't paid  Here you can play it. It's okay. She can sue me too. I'd love to meet darlin love  Does sound like her doesn't it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It it might be and they might have tried to get the rights. There's a there's some interesting things here where they claim  Uh, there's a dispute between she and phil specter  The question will arise to what rights love retained or gave up when working with phil specter on it's a marshmallow world, so there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's complicated it's difficult. Yeah as with all of these things. This is like the jonathan colton one and glee, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he just I think he just said screw. I mean what did he end up doing?  I remember I talked to him about and I forgot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, he ended up releasing his version of it  And then telling people to send him money for or something but basically so he he covered I like big butts as a folk singer  And then glee basically completely recreated his right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His pacing played him side by side when I was interviewing jonathan  I wanted probably on triangulation and it was clearly a copy  But I then talked to somebody who works in the music acquisition department of glee  I think I could say this now because glee is now gone, right?  He said oh we never got rights  We just do it  And then wait for the letter and then pay them if they send us a letter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing is, you know normally, you know glee is normally recording covers, right?  Which you are allowed to do that. That's actually one of the things you don't have to pay for cover

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know you don't I know weird al doesn't have to pay for parodies

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you don't have to pay to record a cover because there's a statutory thing  So you have to pay but what you pay is a statutory thing. You pay the publisher publishing rights  You pay the publishing rights, but you don't pay the recording artist. You know performance writers, right ranges and so on. Yeah  and so glee by rerecording songs is totally in the clear from that front, but it's  It's a bit weird if they're actually  Not doing an original performance, but actually doing a sort of flown performance and that that gets a bit odd  Because then the argument is  They're cloning his arrangement, but that's that's harder to do and it's a mess  Basically, all this copyright stuff is a horrible mess and they're but they're being they're basically being a bit sketchy  It would it wouldn't have hurt them much to have sort of thanked him and invited him on the show or something. I agree  Yeah, and that would seem like some glee merch  Having having come on the show and perform that's that's the thing that glee could do for artists is give them, you know  Be nice exposure to a larger audience. That's a natural thing to do that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a lot of people in our chat room have been talking about tap  Uh, this is something google's doing for android pay users  um  Uh, so  I don't and I don't is anybody in the chat room being paid  Have you received your free music?

Transcript:  Do like this new ability built into search to install apps directly from search results  I think that's pretty cool if you you have to be on an android mobile to do that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so. Well, you wouldn't have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The play store knows to install I know I install it from the play store all the time  I think that's like one of the best things about android

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But maybe they'll start with that start with mobile. Yeah, I think it's rolling this another one of those  It's rolling it out  They fixed the stuck pen on the galaxy s5 a little too late for some of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who are you looking around for leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ronam audio, yeah, ronam audio that's who screwed it up  Uh  So, uh, as everybody knows I stuck mine in the wrong way and I paid the price but now  There will be something some not only the first fix was to put a warning sticker on the screen  Which probably caused more pens to be stuck in wrong than anything else  Don't stick it in the wrong way. Well, really what happens let me see  Because I know I did that  So now  Something's going on. They've put a flexible plastic cover over the little  Switch that that breaks and it gives it a ramp. So it pushes anyway, it's a simple fix, but they've  They also say the cover is now attached with adhesive tape. I don't know  Nice fix samsung samsung hasn't said it will be offering this fix to existing customers  So if you have don't don't think that this fix is retroactive if you have a  A note five do not  I repeat do not stick your pen in wrong  It's not retroactive  Be careful be careful  Oh, i'm disappointed speaking of google cast denon apparently there stop it  Somebody's showing a video of somebody sticking it wrong  Yeah  Uh apparently denon and google had a partnership and at that time, uh  It was said that denon would support  google cast  In uh some speakers i'd like to see it in denon. I would actually actively buy  Ar receivers that had cast built in  But nobody's done that not that it's so hard to  In fact, I have a few extras as you know lying around stick a cast in it  But anyway denon has never  Has never done anything with that  Which is disappointing cast partners announced, uh in january at ces include bno play harman kardon ankyo philips pioneer  and romfeld  Anything else you guys want to talk about before we wrap this up I was I was loving it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was  Starting talking about brave and then um forgot to finish the conversation brave  So brave is a new browser from brendan eich and a bunch of other people  Um, and it fits into the ad blocking conversation because it doesn't it doesn't because it sticks its own ads in  Well, sure, but that's for sure  It's the same as app does you know and blocks apps as they put other ads in most ad blockers don't stick ads in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In place of the other ads  Have you have you not been following this wait a minute. Well, i'm using ublock origin, which does not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, but a lot of the ad blockers now actually either take money to white list. Um certain ad that I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fine. We actually interviewed on triangulation the guys behind ad block plus which which has this uh,  Approved advertiser list google's on it, by the way

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say it's not that we take money for this like you can't pay to be on the list  You have to be you have to fit our guidelines and we do ask for money because that defrays the costs of it  That's how we do make the software, but you could make you could you could just find that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, so it's it's another iteration of that same idea basically  So but it was it's  But they also said we're making a browser  But if you actually look at their open source stuff, they've forked three different browsers on three different platforms, which is also a bit strange  So interesting idea, but yeah monitor and and see where it goes. So it's right now. It's on github  Yes right now. There's there's three github projects  um, and they've um forked link bubble on android and  They've forked some chromium vera on ios  Um, and they've they've forked something else for the desktop. Oh, that's interesting  So it's it's three separate browser projects. They've decided for three different platforms. So it's not a new browser  It's a set of forks of existing browsers. So it's a bismodel fork to some extent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brendan ike was of course ran the mozilla project  Before he left  HTTPS everywhere is built in which I like that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's basically it's explicitly saying what if we made a browser that worked better because it was taking ads out of everything  everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At what plus makes a browser for android that does that  Right and and apple's apple's hooks potentially do that on ios. Yeah, you have to download a blocker, but you can do that  firefox I didn't realize this but uh  firefox support on mobile supports firefox extensions, so you could put an ad blocker in firefox on mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right, but  Very few people run firefox mobile. That's true. Yeah, I think firefox and mobile is one of the things they've forked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's their ios thing. I think so. Uh, it also blocks tracking pixels and tracking cookies, which  Now I have to say one thing that bought I understand that there are multiple reasons why people use ad blockers  One is just ads are annoying and I understand that another is for security reasons effect  uh  What was the what was the website forbes forbes?  You you know this  Forbes has been one of many websites that say oh, I see you're running an ad blocker  Would you mind turning that off because that's how we support ourselves and if you did  You would get malware  promotions  I don't know if you'd get actually get the malware, but you got a pop under that encouraged you to download malware  Right, which is why another reason why people run ad blockers  They also run ad blockers for privacy reasons because uh, they worry about tracking  But one of the side effects of that is that uh things like google analytics are often broken  By ad blockers as well, which means a publisher like me for instance  I can't even get metrics of people who come to my site using an ad blocker just are invisible to me  I don't even know they're there  It looks like this does that as well  It's hard to say it it  What's still early days?  Yeah, I think you know you would have to block javascript if you were going to block google analytics, I think or some kinds of javascript

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no because you it's a well-known domain so you can block one and you can just block it so you control everything. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brave blocks tracking pixels and tracking cookies  Yeah, I guess that's fine. I mean I always turn on block third party cookies

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only accept cookies which is like to visit which is basically what they mean. I mean, but the the challenge there is if you are  It will also block some other things that you may want  But mostly you'll get rid of those the thing is if you iframe if you have an iframe on the site that is  Giving you some kind of his information, you know his comments on facebook or something then then that may get blocked by two. Yeah  so  I mean it's it's part of the same conversation about the sort of  Super invasiveness of ad tech and and the fight back and I think that this fits in with that  I'm not necessarily sure it's going to be a great success, but it's it's it's interesting  You know looking that that they've got brendan and and yarn and some people  Um who have got technical respect for behind its interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the one story that I thought was kind of interesting we didn't mention was link nyc  Which is the sort of really fast gigabit wi-fi in new york  So jealous the telephones  Yeah, since def and gina aren't on i'll like represent for new york and be like  Somebody said she wanted to set up her office by this bus stop at 17th and somewhere because it was like six times faster wi-fi  You know, apparently they run fiber to these former telephone booths and it's roland harter war wrote on engadget that he was getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, two, I think 230 megabits down and like 300 megabits up  Oh, man  Where do I get that i'll sign up that's your google fiber, but you have to sit next to a phone booth in new york city  To get it. Yeah  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so this is um, I was in new york last week and I missed that  And I wrote I wrote I was struck by something so I wrote a blog post about this  So i'll give you the argument for my blog post. Um, I just checked the blog post into the thing but um  The frustrating thing about new york is that is that when you go on the subway you lose connectivity  And there's there's an ongoing project to try and get wi-fi and stuff on this on the subway  But it's hard because you've got to like put transmitters on the ground and things  And if they do it, they'd likely only be in stations and not in the tunnels and so on right at the same time  Um new york is spending a fortune to try and refit the subway to work out where their trains are  because actually the way that the train tracking works is  the train  They they the train shorts out between the two tracks and they they have the  Um different sections of the track subdivided into blocks and they can tell that there's a there's a train in that section  But that's basically all they can tell in the central system. And this is this is this is this  Fantastic like early 20th century technology. There's there's a great article about it that I linked to on the atlantic that explains this  And it was fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The pictures of the pictures of the switching stations with their literally their 19th century technology is really amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's that's a one of us and I recommend you'll read it  But the thing that struck me as I was sitting on the subway going  Why the hell does my phone not able to give me transit directions when i'm offline?  Which is my rant to google maps is that google's missing a huge trick here  Now google already knows how to track people when they're driving or cycling or walking  Um, and it will it can tell what you're doing it will also sum over all the people in cars to get freeway traffic  But it's really bad understanding that you're on a bus or a train  Which should be this is is if it's if you've got connectivity. It's the same problem  It's am I moving at a certain speed in a certain path? Oh, are there another 20 people who are  Experiencing identical accelerations nearby while you're probably on a train or a bus  So it's it's something that you could certainly solve from google maps point of view is which bus are you on which train are you on?  But also this would actually solve the problem for the transit company, which is where is that bus?  Where is that train because oh look we've just put 30 people um to track the bus for us  So i'm i'm puzzled that this hasn't happened and I know it's one of these like political will things  But there's a step there's a process here, which is first google actually applies its its smart tracking technology to work out where buses and trains are  Which is you know, I know it's doable  but they just haven't thought of it because probably because most of the engineers on maps are in mountain view and  Don't use public transit much. Um, but the other half of this that was that was the real breakthrough thought was well  Google should actually pitch for the nyc subway  Contract for wi-fi. Yeah, because a that's suddenly they've got a whole bunch of users who were captive users for wi-fi  Well, wouldn't that be great?  But also they will actually solve the where are the trains and where are the problems and actually close that link  Anyway, this is my free idea for google. I don't know if linknyc

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is a private enterprise or I I think this was a uh, uh initiative by maria maria de blasio. I'm not sure  But um, there are no ads you don't get any it is obviously a captive, uh portal, but you don't get ads apparently the ads  That's sponsored are only on the screen at the phone booth and the other thing i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right way to do this god. So when I was at bt, I I built I wrote a pitch up for this for bt  Because it's like hey, we have all these phone boxes in the streets. We should turn them into wi-fi hotspots  They were like that's kind of interesting but it's kind of hard  um, and I it is hard sure it is hard and it's  Of course it's hard and I wasn't able to get it through politically, but it's an obvious thing to do  It's like they've actually built cables to points in the street  They will no longer need to pick them up and put money into phones on it  But making wi-fi base stations is a great idea and they're very well correlated can they use some I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously they're using the hole in the ground, but can they use other  Existing infrastructure like the the phone wires. I mean depends. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean if you're if you're the phone company you can because you know, that's you own the copper that's dsl you own the copper  Um, this is faster than dsl though. I gotta say  But you also have the right to rerun conduit for the phone company. That's that's one of the easements you get for being fun  So there's a there's a natural correlation between the two there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a friend who actually bought from at&t the rights to all the phone booths  Because at&t the money they were making on phone booths was  Diminimous, so they didn't care. He got it for a song. He continues to run them  Because there are places lots of places where people need phone booths  And uh in almost every case it's cell infrastructure now  uh  They don't bother with uh, trying to put them on a landline. It's just a cell. It's just a little cell site  and uh and more than that he says the real challenge of the business is a  logistics problem collecting the coins  That's that's that's where the brain power goes is how do we get the coins?  Affordably and efficiently out of the box because you got to do that and you kind of so  He's apparently got some sort of technology that weighs the thing  Uh, and they've now applied this to the nestle's freezers. He also he expanded the business. He says we're good at this  Hi, what else can we apply this knowledge to?  Oh, you know those freezers in in this in the 7-eleven or whatever where you buy  Ice cream treats. Well, that's it turns out a similar logistics issue  Is to restock those in an efficient way. And so now they they actually have little weight scales  Probably little mems scales on the feet of these things so they know when they have to be restocked because they weigh less  Anyway, I want to say one good thing about link nyc they're doing the security  right and davinder pointed this out when you  Connect with it. You get a private key. That's unique to you  You add that private key to your device  And so in if I as I understand it in effect you are privately connected  To this network, so it doesn't have some of the other problems  That public wi-fi are heir to are prone to which is great interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And leo there's one other nice feature which is called passpoint  Which apparently lets you connect to the wi-fi without clicking the I agree to abide by your terms and conditions

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's why you get the cert right you're getting a cert  And then it's like a ssh login. They have that's a good idea because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The giant nightmare of public wi-fi is that they put captive portals up horrible  Um, and particularly with transit ones. It's like well i'm trying to pass through this station  I don't have time to stop and go through your captive portal nonsense. Yeah  So if you can actually do that and roam across the city, that's that's a good that's a good idea  Yeah, this is also the idea of like the advertising is not on the wi-fi but on the wi-fi base station is also a very smart  idea makes people happy  Because because you you really don't want to mess with their connection and inject inject add nonsense into it. Whereas  If there's if you've got a physical point of presence, that's a that's a sensible way to support it makes me want to move

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  That's the one that's an article. This is a great article by um, charlie stross this week.

Transcript:  So so i'm just trying to get rid of one thing every day and it's actually kind of nice because it forces you to re-examine  Uh the sort of stuff that you're doing but I do have one quick tip as well, which is um,  The google dance is back  so  We used to have something where we'd switch out our algorithm and have a new index  And we only had enough time to roll out one data center per day  And so we every night we'd take one data center out of the rotation update it  And then the rankings would be different at that data center and it would take about a week  So depending on which data center you'd hit you'd get different rankings and people would call that the google dance  Well, what we decided to do is actually have a dance at google  Called the google dance and uh, and we stopped in like  2006 or something like that or 2008. It's an actual dance  It's an actual dance and so  So people called it the google dance and we're like, well, let's have a dance. I love it  We have a t-shirt about the google dance and uh, so there's a conference called smx, uh west which means west coast  And uh, they're gonna have like 500 or so of the attendees who can sign up to attend the google dance  And i'm hoping to be there myself.

I've found that  Uh, great. Thank you matt cuts  Appreciate that. Uh, mr kevin marks a tip a trick  Like fill us in on indyweb

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, indyweb camp new york is happening this weekend  So if you're in new york and want to spend weekend, um  Working on your own website or building indyweb stuff for others. That's that is beginning to put the link in the chat  It's on the front page of indywebcap.com  And of course we have homebrew website club next wednesday  And not tonight that's a week from tonight in various cities around the world  Love it, which is shipping there as well and there's more indyweb camps coming up in the new year  There's one mit in march and there's various others that i've forgotten but there's there's four or five already booked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it. You guys are fighting the good fight  For web standards and the independent web and it needs to be fought indywebcap.com if people want to learn

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and also two of the  One of the indyweb specs has been published as a first public working draft. Oh  by the um  W3c social web standards group. Um  That's what web mentioned so that's been published  So web mention is the is the way that a site can tell another site that you've linked that it's been linked to  um, and that's that's been  There's a first draft of that w3c now. So kind of like trackback  It's kind of like trackback, but it's done over htp  and there's some there's some wrinkles to it to make it like  We're sorry this one as an htp  Post rather than done as a xml rpc call and so on. Um, so that's that's that's been published and um  Micro pub is in the stages of about to be published. I think that's I think that that may come out in the next week  Or so as well. So micro pub is um a general api for letting you post your site  From another site and that's another part of the sort of indyweb sort of protocol collection  So both of those are work at which we're working to try and get those  As as web standards as part of w3c  Along along and there's there's that social working group there has a bunch of other protocols that and things being discussed too  But those those are those two of the sort of directly indyweb derived ones. Awesome. Thank you kevin marks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little tip for me. It might seem like a contradiction in terms, but now you can use facebook anonymously  What a thought  Facebook which has had a tor  Address for some time  Now has made it easy for you to do it on your android device. You'll need orbot which is a tor for android  You download it install it point it to what is the facebook tor address? I can't even remember is it?  um  I can't remember what you you know what you could figure it out  um, and so uh  Yeah, of course not because i'm not on tor right now  Uh, but if I were i'd be there by now  I for some reason I want to say facebook.name, but that can't be right facebook.tor. Maybe I can't remember what it is  Um, but the facebook is now allowing you to use  It through a tor which is kind of wild  It's facebook core  Wwwi.onion. That's it  facebook core wwi.onion  And uh, and the idea really they say is for countries where facebook is blocked  Uh, or uh, it would be dangerous to use facebook. You could now use it anonymously  Um, which is I think pretty interesting and fairly cool  It is cool. Yeah  facebook core  Wwi.onion, but you'll need torbot on your android  Thanks everybody. Hey, thank you. Matt cuts. It's actually anonymous

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not anonymous  Facebook knows who you are, but nobody in between

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The idea would be that uh, emelda marcos can't see you using facebook  so  Something like that. I don't know why  That's just the first thing that leapt to mind. Thank you matt cuts for being here  I just love it when you're on it is so much fun and thank you for listening to the show too. I really appreciate that  Total pleasure always fun to be on.
