Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you. It's a little messed up. My daughter wore it last so I'm kind of like, it could be neater but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wearing. I had no great hats except this one. That is a great hat. That's a great hat. Except  except that it tickles. You gotta be careful with that. The hat that tickles. It reminds me of going

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to commencement when I. Yes, yes. Right. Which side do you put it on for the show? I forget. I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  look at everybody else and do what they do. You never know. Or stash it up on the top. Or actually  what I'm doing now is I'm imitating the president and his wife giving myself a treat on Halloween.  On top of the head. What was that video? I was so confused. I didn't see that video.  And a kid. There was a kid in a blown up thing and they put the treats on his on the top of his

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  costume and they fell off. Poor kid. What? Instead of putting it in this freaking. In the bag. In the bag.  Everybody knows how Halloween works. Right. Clearly he and she do not. No. Okay. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. They need some Halloween school. Yeah. Some Halloween education. You know a lot more now.  That's not what you do with candy. No. On Halloween. No. It was really awkward. I mean  unless your costume is that you are a Halloween bag. Yes. Not even close. That's an idea.  That is an idea actually. I kind of like that idea. Yeah. Pretty good. Could be the Halloween bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To wear a paper bag on your head the other way. Right. The other way. That would have made perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sense. But no. Okay. All right. Well hey everybody you know if that works for. It's POTUS folks.  POTUS. I got a dreaded email over the week. We were kind of talking about this last week.  We're talking about storage. Our email storage and everything. And I checked. So the way my inbox is  organized is like important is up top and that's the stuff I ever actually look at. And then down  below is like everything else and I rarely look down there. I'm happy I did though. Because I saw  down there your storage promotion will expire in seven days. Oh there's the email. So apparently  I had 100 gigs of promotional storage that's going to go away on November 3rd. And like we were talking  about last week. You might want to go through that stuff huh. I'm good. Well either that or I pay a  buck ninety nine a month and get back to where I am right now. Which a buck ninety nine a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't feel like that's. You know what. Here's the thinking. If you're never going to look at it anyway  just scroll through the most recent like two months and then mass delete. Just do it. You're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going to feel so free. That hurts. It hurts me to think. Now how does that hurt because you just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It hurts you. Just let it go. Well he just said last week that he doesn't even really care.  Well I know. Right. You know so. I know but it exists and then suddenly it won't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason does it spark joy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every once in a while I run across an old email that sparks joy because I go oh yeah I forgot that  happened. That's what I was saying. I still keep things. You're not going to be upset.  It's just going to be gone. It's going to be gone. You see the problem. The problem is as you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  older. Yeah. You see this is your memory. Your memory goes away. You're going to say oh yeah  sometimes. What was that name? Oh it started with this. Yeah then you'll search Google for your  email for that. You'll find this little piece of lost memory. Now it's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm OK with that. That's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. So a dollar ninety nine you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dollar ninety nine a month. Just do it. That's what I pay. Twenty four bucks a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm wearing my math hat. Now that it's been confirmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So OK apparently I've got some deciding to do because it is true. I mean these are old  emails that I probably will rarely if ever need you know have any need for. But there are some  really good emails in there and I don't have the time to like pull them out you know like baby  announcement emails with the thread. Are you ever going to have time? I mean really. No I'm never

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to make time for that. There's things that I kept from years ago that are you know like  something legal or what have you that I just want to hold on to it just in case. You just never know.  Something comes back because people are so litigious nowadays. So I'm keeping that email. I  don't care if it is eight years old. You know what I'm saying. So yeah that's why I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Archive those into a file of lawsuits. I have a lawsuit folder. Well something like that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's something like that. Protect my ass folder. Yeah a CYA. I'll download them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should everyone should do this I think. Have a folder for praise. So when your boss praises you  when someone sends you a nice email because every now and then you're going to get crappy emails  and then you can look in and be like oh someone thought I explained that concept really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's true. Good stuff. So that's like Al Franken's character. That's like Stu Smalley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Stuart Smalley. Yes. I'm good enough. Yes. I'm smart enough. And gosh darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People like me. Now I know when breaking news if you care. Oh we do. Go for it. Just now.  That's Google by. Jack. Well no not yet. No. Jack announced that Twitter is going to not take

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  political advertising starting in November. Oh that's. Okay wait. I think that's. Oh well I  guess for the presidential election. I was like political ads have been a full swing for the  but there's local elections where I'm at in November. Well there's plenty of political

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  advertising. Trump's been in two hundred thousand a month on or maybe a week on Facebook.  So in full disclosure I had an exchange about I was at an event a week ago with where Jack was  and I saw him and I said that I thought it was a mistake to to ban political advertising and some  executives there asked me why I said that but obviously I was not convincing because they've  decided to to access. I get the rationale but my concern when I said that there was my concern was  that it only potentially gives more power to big money television  and small candidates and movements that want to try to find thanks to the inexpensive and  targeted abilities of online you know may not be able to find their their people. So does this  does this advantage the incumbents. So but be well you've got a lot of people yelling at Facebook to  take down the ads. I know you're yelling they're making money from bad ads so maybe one of Facebook  gave all the money away to voter suppression movements you know to cure. If you took money  out of the factory is it money or is it the political impact. Sorry Stacey. Well you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have to promote them or pay for them but if you have a good digital social media type team  you can still have an impact online. It's not like you're saying you can't run anything you  just can't pay to do ads which well there are those who say those go ahead. I mean if you have  a candidate that really works you know that really speaks to like people in Black Lives Matter that  they will endorse and promote you across I don't know people talk about black Twitter like it's a  monolithic thing but you could be promoted to people who care about that in so in a way that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  more authentic. Okay so two things about that one is there are those who say especially on Facebook  that if you're a page and you don't pay for promotion no matter how much people love you  you don't get promoted which is a different issue but paying gives you control right. Second a lot  of people argue that well targeting is the evil thing it's targeting is bad we have to get rid  of all this targeting well no if you want to be efficient you want to find people who care about  this issue. I don't see anything wrong with targeting. I think you want to target. Right.  Yeah. The problem is that as ever the technologies aren't bad they get misused by bad actors  but then they get taken away from good actors and good movements. So I'm curious just by a vote  do you think Twitter and Facebook should refuse political advertising or not? I'm obviously on  the not. I'm with the not. I think they should. I tend to lean more for they should.  Oh we got to split the vote. But you know Karsten you're going to split the vote you're going to be the tiebreaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I say at this point the bad guys are better at this than the good guys. Yeah. Yeah true.  There is more harm being done by lying and in ads than there is good being done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there evidence of that? Do we have that data sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No we don't. I don't think we have the exact data of that but it sure seems to me like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the truth is losing. And there's a show title for you. Is losing deep sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Karsten always the ray of sunshine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry it's been a week of fire and screaming. Yes right. How are you guys? Are there fires

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at distance? Are they nearby? Or what's the latest with you guys? They're at a distance. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're far enough away and they actually had a really great night last night as far as  getting containment. Getting some containment. It still has a ways to go. Yes but it's up to  30 percent. They're feeling pretty empowered around that. Is it the Getty fire or the fire up by you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry this is the King Kade. Yeah this is the King Kade fire up by us which is definitely the fire

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that I'm more clued on. Right. And that's a tick fire. I think that was the other one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then there's the is the Getty fire done? Is that contained? I don't believe so. No okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And fire. Is that the same fire that's threatening the Reagan museum?  That's the easy fire. There are so many. This is crazy. Who names the fire? Is there somebody who  names the fires? Is it like the storm people? Oh there was a story about that. It's usually based on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like where? Like a geographic landmark or something where they are and sometimes though they're boring  like the 245th fire. If you don't have a distinguishing landmark you name it based on  the number of the number of fires that have been reported. Yeah. Right. Who did that story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it the Times? I didn't see it. Oh there you go. The Times. Okay. Carsten or someone. But I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  man what an unfortunate name for a fire. Easy. This is the story. There you go. Yeah never easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah okay. I was going to say I agree with Miss Stacy regarding the social media teams because  if you have a good squad they understand analytics and in mode of operation to target  who to get their message out. So it's not necessarily having to pay for ads. They just  do the legwork and work the market inside of it without paying for a particular service.  And there's a lot of people that are doing that successfully that show up in my feeds but it  doesn't show up as sponsored in my feeds. Right. So they know the system. They know the timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know. Jack did say in this thread that it's not just candidate ads but they realize that issue  ads present in his words a way to kind of circumvent and get that message through there. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're just stopping those as well. So that's what you know. It's a slippery slope. Yeah it is.  It is. You know what if you want to start a campaign for climate change and now you can't.  Right. I don't think either is the solution. No well no you can't now on Twitter.  If that's an issue. Oh you. Oh OK. You're right. So that's the issue. So it's an issue and it's  gone. I think that's a. And what's the what's an issue because the next. Right. Yeah. It's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the right is good education an issue. Well and so that's just the. That's just the advertising  portion of it. You're right though. I see. I see your point. It also feels kind of bad for Twitter  because how the heck are they going to make money. I mean they're still worried about you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And their stock. Yeah they're not doing. Awesome. But meanwhile you also had related to this you  had the letter from which is fascinating from Facebook staff. Can I take the hat off now.  If you would like to go for it. We're talking about serious issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need my quarters. Never win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Hey Jeff I'm going to show you gravitas with purple hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could pull it off. That is the show title. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so Facebook employees some unknown number wrote a letter to Zuckerberg  complained about his hands off policy on political ads. You got two extremes here.  And I don't think that either is 100 percent right. I know you know I've argued that Facebook  shouldn't be the arbiter of truth in every political ad. That's another slippery slope.  But there there is some limit. Right. If a politician used  a racial slur and an ad surely they would take that down. I would hope.  Mm hmm. So so so where is the limit. Where is the line. And in each way each platform is saying  we don't want to work at this. And I get that to an extent because we don't want it necessarily  to be their job. But it is their job to set their standards of behavior. And that to me should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the line. Well but if your standard of behavior is something I mean the problem is standards of  behaviors are kind of you know it when we see it. So like you have a very much on the chat for  example we have standards of behavior. And people run afoul of them every now and then because  sometimes it's by accident. Sometimes they're just arguing maybe how they feel they're like  it's just a little too vehement. I shouldn't be kicked out for this. So the problem is they  don't want to have a point of view because points of view alienate people and they don't want to  alienate people. But unfortunately if you're going to have standards or if you're going to  try to become I mean they are a platform for information in that case you kind of have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have a point of view. That's your point of view is a good way. Yeah that's a great way to put it.  They're all put it being put in this uncomfortable position of having to having to take take a stand  on some sort of side of this. And you're just not going to please everybody as much as they would

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  love to please everybody. That's just not going to happen. Same problem the journalism is in.  Yeah. Have a journalist act the same way. Well we we're not human. We don't have opinions. We  don't have any any point of view. But we do. And that's actually one of the big problems with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  way we talk about like politics and government today. So government rules the way we structure  our laws are designed to incentivize certain behaviors and things. But we don't actually  talk about it that way. So I think we're in this weird place where we think everything can be fair  and neutral to everyone. But that's stupid. That's not the way the world works. There's always going  to be tradeoffs and people who are advantaged or disadvantaged by something. And we don't actually  talk about that. We just talk about like this side gets this this side gets that in a way that's very  polarizing. I just see this and I'm like look y'all we have to talk about the give and take and we  don't actually just Americans in general don't do that. So. And talking about journalism a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like maybe I'm just so like confused and overwhelmed by where we're at right now and the  last however many years that have like rewritten my memory on how this used to be. But how did they  used to be? You know how did the from the perspective of journalism like taking a stance versus not  taking a stance like what what's the historical point of view there and how is now different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first word that comes to my mind when you ask how did it used to be it was slower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Slower. Well yeah that's a really good point. Well and there was I mean Jeff will speak to this I'm  sure but there was the history of yellow journalism where you who was it who created the first or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  second paper to Hearst. Thank you. Pulitzer. Pulitzer as well. Pulitzer as well but Hearst

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is most famous for it. And yeah Hearst is the one who was very it was the Spanish Civil War who  was like yeah let's let's let's do that. Let's and you you used to get your papers based on the type  of person you thought you were. And papers had a point of view they still do and even when you're  objective that doesn't mean you don't have a point of view it just means that you're trying to  understand the issue and report truly both sides not actual both sides because that's stupid  but like my example would be when I was at GigaOM reporting about like broadband issues  that can be super polarizing but I took the consumer point of view. That being said I did  talk to all the carriers to understand their point of view and I would report why they felt that way  and I would get their science and everything right. So that's to me what objectivity means  and what it's kind of not we're moving away from that I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So since you opened the door for me this is kind of a perennial in a journalism school obviously  with her objectivity. I'm of the school heretical as usual that objectivity is a false school  we never really existed it was us trying to separate ourselves from the public and say  somehow we're not it was it was a business decision to great measure we want to serve everybody so  everybody loves us and it leads to dangerous things like false balance and it leads to the myth that  we serve everyone all alike when there are many communities in the United States who've never been  served by mass media but we say oh no no no we're the objective ones we decide what's important  we just say because it fits into everything it's our news judgment it's our false balance  it's all of that so I think transparency is needed people need to know our world views  and our experience so they can judge us accordingly we should operate with intellectual honesty and  state that which is the uncomfortable truths but it also goes to the point you were just making  about about the platforms and not wanting to have a position to do anything to take a stand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because it's uncomfortable. Yeah one thing I actually appreciate about you Jeff I appreciate  all of you but one thing I really one thing one thing that I appreciate about you is that you  even on this show you put us on the spot on something that's uncomfortable which on one hand  right like taking a position on this and and and pulling us just a few minutes ago  could be putting me in a position that I maybe I don't want to admit how I feel one way or the  other and that could be a bad thing but instead like it kind of forces us to have the conversation  have the conversation and that always plays and say no comment. That's true that's true but um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah and for that I would say there's a lot of people in the the comments or in the chat room  talking about like factual reporting I don't it is great to have facts when you are speaking about  something that is a contentious issue which most things are beyond like you know the cop shop  right we have this happened at this point in time and this is right but anytime you report on  something where there are going to be again those trade-offs you report the facts this is the law  this is what it states but people need more context because they don't necessarily have the  experience of you know 10 years writing about the government so you need to say and I think it is  objective to say people on this side of the issue feel like the law would do this for them and people  on the other side feel like this law would do this against them or would hurt them in this way  and I don't think that's you can't just report straight facts because people it doesn't give  people the context and the ability to make up their minds. Is it safe to say that that you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  report in black and white with the facts but that black and white needs a little bit of color  to back it up? Yes or shades of gray I'm not sure. I mean and well that's how I look at a lot of the  reporting nowadays and all of the good ones they do exactly what you just said they present the  facts of the matter and then they give you the context to help you understand the facts of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  matter you know sort of enhancing it all. Right and I would say I mean like and that's where  Jeff like your transparency comes in I was never shy about saying when push comes to shove I am  probably I'm pro-consumer and I generally err on the side of being excited about technology.  Those are like the two facts that are straight about stinger my point of view.  Oh sorry my this wig parts on the other side so I keep pushing my hair out of my eyes the wrong way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Habits. Now this also ties into something else that's in the rundown the leaked video  the internal all hands meeting at Google this time it's Google CEO Sundar Pichai talking about  a number of things but now you know this happened what with Facebook a couple of weeks ago  their all hands being leaked now we've got Google all hands meetings this was from I think late  last week where they talked a little bit about the hiring of Miles Taylor who's the former  department of Homeland Security official employees were really pushing back on his role in the border  camps and defending them in his previous role and then talking about internal community  moderation saying that at the scale that the company is at right now it's really different  difficult to moderate moderate at the scale you know asking for employees trust chastising  employees or at least in the words of the Washington Post article chastising employees  for leaking information to the press sort of like this video by the way so  the video of the leaking is now leaked and acknowledging that they are Pichai said we  are genuinely struggling with some issues transparency at scale so being transparent again  taking some sort of a stance some sort of a side while at the same time trying to appeal to everyone  and that's I mean that and that's just impossible but yet in his role he must feel the necessity  around that that that's kind of a part of what he has to do yeah comes with territory right yeah  is what it is yeah so all right well we've done that one  and only three of us are wearing something on the top of our heads now we'll see what story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I look dumb enough as is hey I'm Marshall McClough I'm Marshall McClough into that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we'll see what story takes another hat off of us or wig when it gets really serious that's what  happens uh let's see here something a little bit more fun any interest in google buying fitbit this  seem to be getting people kind of a little riled up like that would be great for google or would  that not be that great for fitbit who the heck knows seems like it makes perfect sense right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just more and more data to mine sure well so in Kevin actually on our site wrote a story about  this because Kevin and I am a dedicated fitbit user have been since like since at launch like  pre like I've always had a fitbit so I would be devastated if google bought this and messed with  it because google's wear os platform is not good and there is that yeah is laughably bad so if google  if google bought it and tried to integrate the fitbit data into my google stream but didn't  mess with the hardware or anything else then then sure but as it stands down I'm like oh no don't  take this away from me I love it and I don't have an apple phone so I don't have an apple watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  could we look at it the way we look at the ways acquisition and in how google maps has definitely  gotten better since then and I like to assume that it's been some influence from that team  of engineers that were formerly with ways guaranteed and you can still download the ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  exactly ways has not changed like it hasn't strayed they haven't decided okay we're getting rid of  who the heck knows if they one day decide to do yeah and that's always my fear is like sure you  know say they buy they say they're gonna buy fitbit and everything this just in ways is going  we're gonna let fitbit operate as its own it's a successful product but it's the two to three years  down the line where it's like okay now we're starting to see what we worried about so yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  five five years it took with the nest acquisition so right 2014 they acquired it and then 2019 they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  went we control it all now nest is absolutely the appropriate comparison in this regard because  nest was a pretty you know popular brand doing just fine and now you've got what's going on  right now I mean there there are a number of signs that you know the the recognition around nest  you know they're just like well now that google's in there like I just don't trust it or what you  know whatever the case may be it's just not the same brand I've never used a fitbit because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just never really felt the need to buy a pedometer or anything like that but I don't want to say this  I could see google channeling the data from that and giving it as part of my morning routine and  you know some analytics and stuff to work towards and things like that is that what  fitbit does already just sort of gives you some stats from yesterday to let you know that you were  you know you were a 20 percent lax versus what you've done over the last couple days and you  need to pick it up and you know is that how it works because I don't know um they just launched

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  fitbit premium which is a subscription that presumably has some of that I'll let you know  in another month but what they do is they give you steps they give you uh they do give you like  a sleep score they give you heart rate information and you can use it with other apps like to track  you know if you want to lose weight calories that sort of thing you can do it it tracks your  activities so like it's got like several items like it knows if I'm biking or swimming or doing  things and it tracks that automatically and it just like logs that as like oh exercise yeah  um but I think where it could really make a difference for someone like google and scooter  x is pointing out that alphabet is the one trying to buy it not cool okay but thank you  scooter yeah with that information um you could do a lot with medical devices like what apple's  doing with like afib okay you could as we start tying our personal wellness into everything else  around us and seeking assistance helps assistant help for that this would be a good deal for it I  know kevin and I talked about like amazon buying fitbit so it's not crazy that you would want this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  deeply personal data on people your fear would be your biggest fear would be google buys this  and then decides hey we're gonna throw android wear wear os into there like I don't see them doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that I also like fitbit makes decent products yeah um so I would like I don't want google to  get all fancy and googly with it or you know I just like I I know this is coming from a woman  who carries a pixel but we had to get through some and I actually like the nexus but google has some  weird hardware designs I'm just gonna throw it out there they do some weird stuff so if they start  doing that I'm like um I don't know google I just the fitbit's good don't mess with it yeah if you're  gonna buy it don't mess with it yeah maybe they won't mess with it yeah that that would be my

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  my guess is that if a google if sorry if alphabet did buy a fitbit that it would be one of those  yes we've got fitbit but we're not going to change the thing that you love because  people love their fitbits um I think it could be a big a huge negative for a lot of people  if suddenly they said and we're gonna make it better we've got ideas to bring assistant and  bake in android wear and you know back and forth and I think they really damage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  damage the the perception of the deal if they did that I think the best way they could handle  it would be the way's way where they take it over and kind of have it be its own thing  and slowly add functions of fitbit into where os yeah to make where os better to make that an  actual I think that's right uh an actual platform that can compete with apple watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that is true I mean that would be fine as long as they still have the fitbit option because I'm  I'm very skeptical on where os in part and I think part of it is google strategy because you know  with where os you can buy something from you know fossil misfit michael cores  other brands that sell watches like I don't know all the options out there um and  you know on one hand that's that's very googley right like android on all the phones but on the  other hand it means that they have to keep things kind of basic or they they can't optimize things  that like you can necessarily with dedicated hardware like having a co-processor or something  like that not the fitbit is using a co-processor so maybe if they turn fitbit into a flagship  brand that really rested on the fitbit functionality like I feel like the two things  could become very different if that makes sense where os for generic smartwatches and then if you  wanted to turn fitbit into a true competitor to apple maybe but I don't know I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about the android model where you google admits that it's where os sucks and they just hand that  franchise over to fitbit and say you do the wearables that might mean I mean fitbit bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the ip from pebble do you guys remember how excited we all were about my son still has his  pebble watch he wears it every day but all I can see from pebble and granted I'm not like a super  deep user or person inside fitbit but what they did is they took some of the pebble interfaces and  they put them on the fitbit but I don't see a lot of I don't see much else from that acquisition  having made it over so so I don't know basically oh that's a device sorry y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is that your google home learning how to bark yeah that's what it sounded like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh I know that's I have I have a secret package those those new tune next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  those new tuned speakers on the home meaning

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  uh we were talking about this uh this whole uh fitbit thing and then someone in chat just  posted reminded me scooter x thank you that um were any of you ever like users of the moto 360

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want it to be but it didn't fit my wrist well it didn't look right but I want it to be okay I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  used the first one it had the flat tire either of you moto 360 yeah I did yep I did too yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because it was like one of the early early android yeah you forgave it a lot of you did since you did

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because hey I'm early flat tire was just one of them uh well apparently there's going to be a new  one in 2019 although I think this time around it's the kind of thing where Motorola is just kind of  it's a branding deal uh someone else is making the watch and they're giving the Motorola name  the motorola 360 or whatever I mean it looks nice it looks nice I'd wear it no flat tire so that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good I never really saw the flat tire the bottom of the screen wasn't wasn't fully filled in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  display it was it was an upside down notch in a certain way yeah thank you okay yes yeah it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  probably a pricing thing right it had to do with a sensor I believe well no the wire they just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have the room kind of the room for the wiring oh yeah that makes the watch would have had to have  had a bezel a bigger bezel is the way leo explained at the time no bezels on your watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so who knows if this will uh make a splash or not I mean it's it's wear os so probably not  that unfortunately as as much as I would love where I'm seeing I still see people wear apple  watches I do see some a lot of apple watches you've probably seen galaxy watches out there right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see any galaxy I don't I'm I'm this is just by my ridiculous non-scientific view but I  don't think there's a growth pattern here in these things there there actually is a slight growth

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pattern but you're right this is not like a smartphone this is not everyone's going to have  right but there are really compelling use cases that are popping up that I think will drive  further adoption so like with apple when it did fall detection on their watch I mean I almost  walked out and bought I almost bought an iphone so I could get that on my watch because I faint all  the time so I was like oh use case that works for me and but I didn't so and I and I do think  you'll see a certain subset of the people who use it and it's probably fitness freaks they tend to  use it a lot and then very busy people tend to buy the smart watches so they can get notifications

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and things like that well here's more breaking news you're making just your point stacy  apple reported the revenue rose 1.8 percent  on the watches to 64.5 with a behind a rise in sales of wearables and services such as  apps streaming music and so on which offset a 9.2 percent decline in iphone sales during the period  yeah yeah yeah it's the ongoing story and their wearables includes the air pods or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah yeah yeah that's yeah I imagine so and they just they just announced a new air another set

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for 250 right um yeah they're not cheap not cheap at all I mean I spent I'm trying to think I think  I bought my job was for 160 which was or 175 even the microsoft ones are going to be 250 I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was it a microsoft or to google's google's I think are 230 yeah I'm actually waiting I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gonna I'm probably gonna buy those it's pretty competitive yeah I'm looking for these truly  wireless earphones can be pretty pricey um they just gotta work and give me great audio quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah that's the thing justified as on the uh the subway the other day and and this woman's just  standing there I had a seat I didn't give it to her because I'm a real old man and suddenly she's  doing some kind of weird dance she's looking in the hood she's going to her oh no she's going  into the bag she's there way around her starts doing the same dance and finally they found her

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  man yeah that's that's that's always a moment of panic there goes 125 dollars all right can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you buy just one you can on apple you can I don't know about the other side yeah on apple on apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you can on apple you can you can't like like I can't I've got my little jobbers right here but  yeah I don't think you can buy just one of these yeah I could be wrong definitely depends on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  manufacturer I'm not sure they're all in the in the habit of offering you a single single pod

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  don't have the budget for that there's a right and a left so you have to you know know what you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  she lost yeah my sister got hearing aids she's my older sister um and of course their bluetooth  and they do all kinds of neat stuff that the that the ear things don't do  right the phone rings and she just starts talking she can listen to tv  it's pretty cool how how integrated that is now and it's invisible yeah you're going to start

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  seeing more of that because I think it was last year the year before but in 2020 we're getting  over there over over there over the counter otc hearing aids the FDA approved this concept of  being able to so there's companies like bose are getting into this I assume you know we'll see  apple get in there eventually but it is the ability to buy over-the-counter hearing aids  without going to an audio audio audiologist audiologist yeah yes audiologist um to get fitted  in that sort of thing they won't be as sophisticated but for people like me who used to who are losing  their hearing because they were covering concerts when they were in college that's probably  sufficient for now so you're going to see a lot of really cool stuff coming in with these and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going to be fun my father who's 93 deaf is a doornail um and he has the tv turns it up all the way  so he can hear fox news right yeah well the apartment upstairs it's a you know it's a continuing  care place they took out their carpeting and the guy up there isn't quite as deaf so he  complains all the time and it goes back and forth back and forth back and forth so they finally came  in I got him I got my father a bluetooth um a speaker an amplifier that he can put right next  to him on the couch oh nice right that works right so the sounds down on the main tv and it comes over  there even that was getting too loud so so to broker peace the authorities from the complex came  in and they drilled a hole in the thing and put a screw in it so we can only turn it up so loud  so they could tell the other guy we've stopped it he can only turn it up so loud there's no 11  on his thing gotcha oh if he had the hearing aids with the bluetooth but it's just too complicated  to set up for him I just I can't imagine him calling saying it'll work right yeah Bluetooth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is never perfect right although you know even even just regular bluetooth headphones like I  was using a pair last night just connected to my tv because I didn't want to wake anybody up put  on the headphones it zaps it right over and that's what you were gonna say yeah no living like the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  jitzens yes what these new hearers that's it these new hearer earbuds they actually do they have  algorithms that they filter out background noise they're designed for people with hearing loss  they're not hearing aids but they're designed to help them hear certain things better and one of  the things they do is work with your tv so that might be an option I feel like Kevin bought a  pair of either new hearers or something else but I can't remember the other brand one of the guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at my father's dinner table downstairs in the home puts his yes I'm gonna map he puts his phone down  and then the phone adjusts for the sound around and and gives him better sound in his  hearing aids oh that's nice that's cool yeah that cool never heard so we can concentrate on just the  conversation the table and it cuts down the around but it has a larger sense than you have just from

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  your ear wow and that's just saying that's the kind of stuff we can do with like basically machine  learning and we're gonna start seeing a lot of it and I mean as much as we don't like things like  echoes and google minis or whatever for privacy purposes if you imagine that sort of give and take  between your personal devices and things around you that's a really compelling vision of the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for people especially with like an aging population and and and we've talked before on the show about  about loss of sight too that you know if you could really have a map inside your home and you want to  go someplace in the home or in a building or an office and you can be directed there with cues  because you can take sense of that it's just amazing what's going to happen yeah really cool  awesome well by the way by the way a good use for facial recognition for a blind person  oh well yes come on admit it admit it i got one come on come on stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  okay so the processing power to recognize individual places faces on a smartphone type  device isn't there yet now if you had so that's it but if you had like six people and it ran a  model just to recognize six people which totally is interesting then you know it could be like oh  that's stacy so you would have the ability to like select 10 of your closest friends that you could

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  recognize for example and it could give you a subtle cue like but you could also do that right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you could also do that with like some sort of app to app communication on your device it doesn't  actually have to be facial recognition oh i see you know it's not like your then you've got to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have a standard everybody well then you then you also organize a place about privacy for the other  person i don't want to broadcast my presence anybody but right that's complicated yeah facial

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  recognition would be the way to go sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  everybody has a panic about it it's just their profit is down okay they're still making bloody  of money google alphabet yeah google they're investing and investing it's not a bad thing  you know baseless did it for years and years and years not trying to profit that's true  i'm not worried about google i'm not going to go take it out of tin cup for them and alphabet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  blames their increase in r and d spending for a decline in profits advertising no no surprise  represented um 85 percent of total revenue for the company which is down considerably it used to  be like 98 percent okay and then they're they're filling in with other revenues 6.4 billion dollars  and other revenues which does include things like the pixel phone a play store cloud products  that accounts for around 15 percent of total revenue so i gotta beef with this if it's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  much money being spent on research and development why in the heck are we getting brand new phones  out the box that allows you to unlock it with your eyes closed you're not spending enough money

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  spend more well they're just they're spending a lot of money on different problems oh no i get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i'm just being a smart alec  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  operating losses rose from 727 million last year to 941 million this year revenue of 155 million  that's things like waymo fighter verily that sort of stuff verily i mean they're spending a lot right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  now for you know contact lenses that detect your blood sugar they're going through fda approvals on  stuff there's waymo so that's yeah those are i'm surprised it isn't losing more money but  i guess it's almost a billion a quarter oh hold up wait a minute let me just process that for a

Transcript:  i mean 40 billion right yeah i mean that's that's not yeah when you're looking at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  numbers on these companies it's really and again if it's almost hard to even really make sense of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it yeah or feel sorry for them or feel sorry absolutely that ever ever but again even if  they're putting all their money in their r&d it's it's about the long game we talked about this with  amazon on this we can text just recently with the amount of money that amazon is spending  to to work out with logistics and you know help reduce the carbon footprint and and give an extra  one day uh well one day shipping for people out there on prime and it's it's a big investment and  it's probably going to pay off pretty bad gun nicely for them in the long run so why not google  put it put the money where they need to put it far as research goes and play the long game yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yep indeed uh you brought up amazon so i'll go ahead and throw this out real quick amazon is  removing the 1499 fee for amazon fresh and uh and now we'll include it into the grab bag that is the  amazon prime benefit when you pay for a year a yearly membership to amazon prime you get all  these things now you get amazon fresh included that's free delivery of groceries also one and  two hour delivery options and uh really just kind of tying up the you know if you have a local  whole foods uh that inventory is being looped into the amazon app that thing right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah see you're getting so old you can't remember what you were talking about two minutes ago you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  make fun of me i never really it's i guess it was part of the whole 15 extra that  discouraged me from using it because we had right because we we had it offered in charlotte  year or so ago and and it surprised me because i was online looking for something else that i needed  to order and it just gave me this little banner it's like hey you know you can order lunch right  now and i'm like oh i can i didn't know that and it'll be here in an hour and it was i thought it  was really cool well actually i thought it was you know spyware or something and but then when i  looked it up it was legit that you know it made the news there in charlotte that hey amazon is  rolling this service out for people to to shop at whole foods or what have you but it's going to  cost you an extra fee in addition to whatever your already expensive whole food prices are  yeah you know so i i never really considered doing it you know you should do it if only to order the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  from whole foods i love that stuff say no more it is delicious and you i mean if you like cake if  you don't like cake this is not going to be your bag well pie is greater than cake but i still eat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  cake here we go oh i went there i went there all right yeah was it a berry chantilly cake is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what i'm looking up um very i think you could get berries on it but there's just a plain chantilly  cake but berries would be a delicious add-on okay well i did my search and i came up with that  that's it that looks okay that looks good to me but okay that's not good i'd eat that free me almond  and marscapone chantilly frosting that is the cake okay then that is yeah that's what's that's what  they just put berries on it so it's fancy looks good to me they could charge you 10 bucks more

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's right they do they they charge you a little bit more although it's a little bit larger of a  cake when you put berries on it according to this bad web page so well they're home foods they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not about web pages they well no they're amazon they are about web pages they are they're on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  e-commerce they are now anyways um this service i didn't realize or i forgot used to cost 299

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  dollars a year oh and remember the amazon dash because it came out out around the time the amazon  dash uh thing that you stuck on your refrigerator oh yeah the little buttons yeah i still have one  somewhere oh no maybe i dumped it the movie did they do that they cancelled that right wrist in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  peace that doesn't exist because now you have your assistant to do it for you anyways like why would

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you need a button yeah that makes sense well it did have the cool scanner you could scan your  groceries with it you'd be like boop and it made the satisfied boop noise switch  that's worth it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  uh let's see here what else do we have here you know oh oh yeah can we talk about the the burt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  algorithm because that's important for google and beyond i want to explain it to me yes that is  important explain this um okay so they basically have an algorithm and i'm trying to remember what  burt stands for i'm going to scroll down oh there it is okay burt is their bi-directional encoder  representations from transformers algorithm okay but basically yeah don't worry about what that  means it's part of natural language processing and it's a way to improve the algorithm that  that figures out what people are saying right and so they've made it better and they've now  allowed it to now it's running did they say 10 of searches yes oh well improving it by 10

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one or the other i could it was yeah so two different expressions of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  i saw that it would would affect one in ten one in ten yes it would it would affect one in ten

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  searches yes um and it just it makes it better it makes it understand things and put more context  around your inquiries which the the way that it's described in like machine learning world is this  is like an image net type of function for natural language processing and what image net was was the  that was the test for computer vision that the gpus really came along and they like blew it out  of the water in about i think it was 2012 that we started seeing huge improvements there and then  they got slightly more gradual but there was like a sea change so they're describing what they've  done here with bert is kind of that level of sea change for natural language processing which  is great for all of us because that means it's going to be easier and better for computers to  understand them when we talk to them yay did that make sense yeah good they they posted an example

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  saying a search query of someone typing in parking on a hill with no curb before the results were  simply about parking on a hill because it was just a bag of words like you said afterwards the results  are actually specific to parking on a hill with no curb like the words imply so just understanding  the words from a more contextual perspective than just i don't get that example because i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's the kind of search that google has always or for years has done well if you put in enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  words it gets narrower but most people don't understand putting in a proper string it's just  just vomiting gibberish you don't i mean that's the beauty it just gets better and better at your

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  word vomit basically right like remember like i still remember the title of the show please  doing like when when google launched way back in like word wretch maybe 2002 you'd be like you know  i'd search new york plus bond issue plus and then i do like someone's name in quotes right and i  don't remember when i had to stop using are those bayesian i don't know what kind of what's the word  for that bayesian search terms i don't i don't remember when i had to stop using them  boolean that's it is something different math but yeah i could explain that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  oh go ahead i cannot okay this time it is boolean yes it is boolean yes  bayesian is a probability thing yeah forget yeah that's one of the other thing boolean is plus and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it is a little bit faded i mean i probably would have been a little presidential i'd say  i like to think of it as as halloween because halloween is tomorrow so although it's not really  a total halloween orange but uh no the design is really nice it feels really nice this this whole  glass back is kind of a frosted it's really hard to show on the camera especially with a light phone  but it just has a really nice feel and what they did back here with this frosting means that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really don't see any fingerprints whatsoever so the edges is what feels great to me it's a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  more grippy around the edge definitely you could use it without a case without feeling like it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gonna slide right out of your hand i was just gonna say like it definitely feels a little more  grippy but it's still glass it's still a phone every day that i'm waiting for the case i thought  the case was gonna get here before the phone it's still not here every day i'm worried that i'm  gonna drop this thing and it's gonna die yes you have a history right i have a history yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  oh it just it was a little bit of an ocd moment for me i'm sorry mr howell look photos are your

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  thing you have a couple of shows on the twit network all about this it's like how but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like how the desk is still not right it should be parallel with the lower third and it's not  and so yeah same thing you've got a horizon problem here in general with this show there it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh uh uh yeah a little more a little more no right there oh my gosh right there right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right there is good but now the nice work mr bondy is wrong you move it down let me move the camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  up now it's all lens distortion i'm sure it could also be because my my screen is higher than jeff's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like if we took that's not fair no no it ain't that just it's just i think it's lens distortion

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's just angled it's not it's not shooting straight it's not shooting straight yeah usually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  not there right um yeah everyone lean to your right there we go this is normal right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all right uh let's see here what else i totally dig that that's 8x with that quality  yeah pretty good that is strong you know that's not something you're going to frame and put up on  your wall but considering how bad digital zoom usually is yeah it gets all impressive to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  everything gets especially with that crooked horizon line i mean i mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you don't really get the crooked horizon line on this shot do you right which is why i looked at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know immediately you're like this is a good one meanwhile that was the one with the most

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  digital zoom on it yeah and it's looking at that picture like this right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's what i know i'm taking a bad picture i look over and he's so true  all right i'll work on my my efforts please and thank you i'll work on my abilities um apparently  dot new was a neat thing that google rolled out that totally i i missed this is very nice that's  pretty cool open yeah so i guess a while back they did this they were they rolled out this dot new  approach which i use all the time do you i never even know about it until this until this week i

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  keep doing new dot doc and i get very upset oh you're backwards wrong my brain doesn't work i'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wrong dot new spreadsheet sheet the new goes at the end so entering into a new browser or a search  doc dot new would create a new google doc for example and because you're always logged into  your google account or you probably are that would take you right to your google docs account open  up a new doc and you can jump right in saves you time well now google is allowing others to play  the dot new game with their own web apps so microsoft for example has word dot new although  that's not working yet but spotify has one playlist dot new will take you right to spotify and create

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a playlist um if you are pizza dot new oh who is that who would that be dominoes dominoes yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  domino should buy pizza dot new well i mean does it pizza dot now pizza dot oh not now not now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  jason just tried i tried i'm curious i tried too i was like let's do it how awesome would that be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  guaranteed that's gonna happen if you aren't already signed into a service it could be a  little less seamless right and that makes sense right yeah totally so i did i just created a new  playlist oh there you go i'm so excited now were you signed into spotify or were you not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i am always signed into spotify oh you are okay because i'm i don't think that i am and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  should go to your phone or on your laptop playlist oh i went on my laptop so when i  signed into spotify on your laptop works for me yeah so what's interesting about this is i'm not  signed into spotify but it still takes me to the create a new playlist thing so if i start and  create so it doesn't oh i see and then at that point it's like all right you need to log in  yeah that's an idea for me too okay all right that makes sense like i can try it on my phone  would it work i think it would be the same on a phone maybe or is this just for desktop no it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  playlist i did it again i was like you not playlist reprogram reprogram

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  um yeah i mean i would assume it would work on the phone hang tight spinning spinning uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it does not it just took me to spotify just took you to your app or to the browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and the last song i listened to was whitney houston i want to dance with somebody as part  of my workout do it from the box at the bottom or from chrome browser i thought i did oh i did  it for the box at the bottom good call yeah i get stuck on that all the time i'm like i do too open

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in chrome what kills me is when i use the box at the bottom i can't ever go back to those results

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yes oh it's asking me if i want to add spotify to my home screen i'm gonna say no  no it just goes up to the recently played stuff so this must be desktop

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah this must be desktop yeah so it's yeah it's still a progression though yeah yeah by the way  jeff so when you use the box in the bottom and you do a search so i'll do a search for twitter  you're gonna teach me how to do this now yeah okay oh god i'm here i'm here for this okay it's it's  really not that it's not hard amazing thanks a lot guys so you know i get to my results so  twit.tv i don't know if you can see it in the overhead overhead shot what you get is this like  limited time chrome so just open up in chrome open in chrome now that's what i do i know but but i

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that would presume i'm thinking ahead jason okay all right all right all right i've gone on to  something else i said oh yeah i searched for that a few minutes ago and then it's gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah sometimes you hit the little multitask option and it still sits there your query is  sometimes sometimes sometimes it doesn't yes that's so frustrating when it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  are you listening google we're giving you lots of really great ideas today  build a build a refrigerator for our garage to deliver no we're talking about our great ideas come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  okay  jason i thought you were going to give me another life-changing moment like with the copy paste

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  software yeah i'm very disappointed thank you guys so much i just i just gave you what i do  um but apparently you do that too i just i thought there was going to be something better i wish  there was something better than that now i don't have anything better than that ebay but yeah that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  services rolled out to more people like chat room is mentioning ebay and open tables as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  okay reservation dot and if you're a trademark owner you can register for your own dot new  by january 14th of next year otherwise anyone can apply starting december 2nd 2019 so whoever's first  to pizza dot new rocket please you're gonna you're gonna make some money that's awesome music dot new  is one that i tried and it's like a single label ovo sound found it by drake grabbed it yes yes  uh grabbed that one yep they're waiting for a nice payday they've they won that game apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they're waiting for a nice payday yeah hmm what else oh man it's a shame that webex got this  instead of something like zoom something usable like zoom got which one medium got story dot new  interesting oh yeah yeah i wordpress should have jumped on that i guess they could do blog dot new

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah that would make more sense to me than than medium would so then

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah how how does google medicate like mediate between right right and if there's multiples

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  andrew it really seems like one anointed winner yeah that's it yeah wins the game right and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so what is it like i could go and get a cup of coffee and ask andrew and he will explain it to me  and i can come back and tell you if we really want to know this is literally his job but again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if his registration is cake at the same time is that what you're angling for here is it just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  any other domain name is his first come first serve it that's i mean they say registered they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're not stacy i mean you would have gotten bonus points if you put on her wig

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  she startled me when she came out of the office wearing that so isn't it lovely though it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  fantastic wig so uh yeah so stacy brought you in because we were talking about well you probably  already know this but we're talking about the dot new domains and uh there's just a little bit of  a curiosity around how this works what what can you tell us about what you know about dot new

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  domains yeah it's kind of interesting so google about a year ago decided to use this dot new  domain that they had acquired in a kind of a unique way which was to have it do an action when  you typed it in so if you typed in doc dot new it would open a new google doc would start a new  google doc and so what they've done now is they're opening it up to other companies they can do the  same thing they can register domains in dot new as long as it as long as it's used for for an  action so sell dot new can start a new ebay listing playlist dot new will start a new spotify playlist  um and so it's kind of a unique way of using a domain name i don't think obviously there won't  be well there could be thousands of these eventually but it's really something that's  created for power users that do something over and over and instead of going to opening up google  drive clicking the button to do new and then doc it's just something you can type into your browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so it should be faster do you envision this to be kind of like a gold rush sort of uh sort of thing  you know as as a lot of other you know kinds of things on the web end up being in the long run  this this seems like an opportunity for some companies to get in there early with something  like music dot new which as we just saw a few minutes ago is basically just a record label  is like yeah okay we got music dot new that seems like a pretty valuable get but no one else will

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  will have it that easy well that's true but what google is doing here is they're saying within  100 days you have to do something with it that causes an action or a new workflow so it's not  like someone can just register and stockpile these they have to do something with it and they have  to do something fairly specific with that's how you regulate yeah that's important right that's  that keeps some control over it okay you know and they didn't do that with with dot app which is  another one of google's top level domains when they launched that you can use it pretty much  any way you want you can you can park it you can use it for an app you can use it however you want  and so there are hundreds of thousands of those register but that was a little bit like one of  those things like oh i should be the first to register music dot app or game dot app and that  sort of thing so dot new is is different i believe i i haven't looked it up but i believe they're  charging hundreds of dollars as well for it so that should keep some people from going after and  trying to to stockpile them but it's very much a niche top level domain i like what they're doing  i mean i don't think that new otherwise would be that interesting of a top level domain the only  thing that's kind of confusing about it is it's a little bit backwards right so if i think about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  starting views i'm sorry it's confused to your wife it is she's going to confuse she said yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah you know so so if she types in that's why we're married

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you see the world the same way stacy you and i should should register argue dot new

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  just said that you and he should register argue dot new oh so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and i could see i could see a world down the line where once dot new is is not the  not the big thing then it's like dot open to jump right all right you know what i mean how  deep do you want this to go pick out any tool in your toolbar and make that an action as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  chat room was saying 550 bucks for the domain yeah that was patrick delahanty he was saying 550

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dollars that's not not inexpensive quite quite a bit of money there definitely want to use it if  you pay that much for it for sure and you've got a time limit with which to do that i find that  really interesting actually so then in that regard so music.new is an interesting example  because literally when you go there all you have there is a music out like an album cover generator  okay so maybe that is it maybe that's the service that they're providing is hey we  we took this uh this album that's on our label and you can create your own version of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  integrate your own cover right yeah i mean i guess that would qualify so that would qualify

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's actually pretty smart okay all right ovo sound one uh yeah there you go that's what it is  my music is awesome whoa you just created an album art and it was so easy to do wow that's all that  did and gave me a little png file 1998 there you go right on cool well yeah i'll hand it back over

Transcript:  mapping updated maps of the fires you know i didn't know that they were doing this until i  read this article but uh google is apparently integrating their mapping prowess with uh access  to two u.s satellites to hopefully provide more up-to-date coverage of where the fires are at  that specifically the king kate fire which is uh not very far from us but thankfully far enough  yeah about 30 miles and uh they're integrating this in a way that they're updating every five  to 20 minutes so that's just faster that's awesome than a lot of other systems i guess they're they're  pulling from near infrared and visible spectrum images in order to do this and um yeah they've  got kind of like if you go on google and you do a search for king kate fire it pulls up a special  kind of like results page that has a lot of uh information that you might need if you were in  the area like emergency information emergency numbers some of the latest news and then it  has this map that's kind of uh dialed into it that is really showing like road closures  you know not to go there yeah yeah it looks like um looks better than it did yesterday i think  yesterday there were that whole area was was a road closure and yeah it was different but yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why would we still consider it being a usable uh mode of of sharing content well on html5 is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is awesome yeah uh like comparison lightweight yeah so yep not everybody's moved over i guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so there's that well now you start hitting people in the wallet and we'll see what happens yeah yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so we should talk about uh a thing on facebook uh and full disclosure is i raise money for the  school from facebook i'm independent of facebook received the money personally from facebook or  any of the platforms um uh where they announced their news tab last week and i went to the i went  to two events last week i went to news twitter's news summit which i can tell you about and then i  also went to um facebook's event announcing the news tab with mark suckerberg and robert thompson  the ceo of um news corp uh and thompson has been highly highly critical of the platforms and we  now know his price just give him some money and he's all kind of slathering all over suckerberg  um and so the news tab is there they're paying a bunch of publishers not all they're paying a  bunch of publishers uh substantial amount of money long-term contract for a separate news tab i don't  have it yet i don't think everybody does have it yet major the controversy however is this and it's  bothering me too they included bright part and there are issues there um go on and so folks in  my world were were fairly scandalized that they considered that a a news source uh next to the  york times and the washington post and such right a trusted now others were argue zuckerberg was  asked about it and you know it's a fairly standard perspective uh we want multiple  perspectives and there is a problem and that we don't have enough conservative media in the  country we only have basically one outlet and so when you go below that one you end up pretty  quickly at a bright part um so i don't know what you guys think of this uh whether they should or  should not have included bright part um bright parts done some pretty awful stuff uh what do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  guys think that's my view i mean miss stacy put this into the truth is losing category

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this is all under the truth is losing yeah i mean bright part is not what i would consider  a legitimate news site sometimes they run actual news stories um sometime i mean they definitely  have a point of view and aren't shy about expressing it but some of their and this is this is an issue  like can you be a news site if you also run things that are not news right and that's what i feel like  thinking okay you know so opinion versus things that people have imagined happen but haven't  actually happened that's the other question yes i'm like there there are things on imaginary news  yeah so yeah i say no and i don't like it because i would like there to be like true  and i mean the way this is is a conservative is like if you're a conservative basically your  choices are you know the wall street journal is the national review still out there i don't know  or white nationalists you know and that really sucks if you're a conservative because there  are there are other shades of gray in there and i don't think everybody's a white nationalist who  is a white nationalist who is you know physically conservative i could be wrong right right yeah we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  certainly if their perspective is out there we've got to serve it what do we expect if we serve that  half of america only that kind of stuff and i argue straightenously and i'm as liberal as they come  we've got to invest in conservative media and so i'm sympathetic to that part is if you want to  have any appearance of balance you can't say here's 200 sites on this side let's have 200  sites on that side when five sites in you end up in info wars there's a there's a there's an  asymmetry here which is hard to deal with but this goes back to the discussion about the political  ads too is there unwilling to make any judgment and they've got to start making judgments

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well and i think that conservative like the conservative movement overall  is it's actually where the democrats were probably eight years ago which was kind of  bankrupt in terms of having actual policy ideas like they there there wasn't a lot of movement  behind any big policies whereas right now if you talk to democrats there's a lot around you know  equal pay there's a lot about environmental action there's lots about you know  paying off student debt health care all of these things have become true policies that you can  debate and have a reasoned argument over whereas the conservative party is right now not putting  up anything beyond lowering taxes and again i'll go with white nationalism and that's  that's tough i mean you that's alienating for anybody who doesn't want to be thought of as

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a jerk which is a lot of people yeah i don't like that that bright bard is part of this  i think bright bard has done enough to show where they stand in this whole dialogue and  i don't when when facebook calls you know calls these publishers trusted publishers i think that  in and of itself feels feels incorrectly applied to me because i don't consider bright party trusted

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  publishing maybe they just trust it in the sense that it's going to deliver a certain type of  opinion okay it's not trusted like you would leave it at home with your children but maybe  it's trusted that it's consistent i i don't i mean right i mean maybe i'm indifferent on it all but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  first and foremost i just don't see the the use of a news tab inside of facebook i get as a business  you know it's a good idea for them to come up with this additional platform but i i just stay away  from all of it and all of this bright bard stuff and now i'm seeing hashtags about photoshopped  and things of that nature none of this makes me want to consume more news so half the time i guess  you could say i'm not woke or informed because i stay away from the news but it's definitely helped  my mental health compared to other people that are so entrenched in all this stuff you know so it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i'm not sure it's a business decision so much as it is pr decision okay well and the amount of money  they're paying to like reportedly three million a year with wall street journal they're not going  to make that back you know they get to this now no zuck kind of referred to that he said well maybe  in some years we could get to 10 or maybe even 20 of the facebook audience can be looking at news  this way that's not terribly ambitious okay yeah that does sound more pr yeah well and by pr i  don't mean i mean i mean kind of policy call it that you know one person on facebook said to me  some time ago i can't control your uncle in the news feed but i can you know create a space to a  controlled space for news where the environment is good they know not everybody's going to go to it  they say that out loud but there's a place for news there that wasn't going to be divisive but  there's great parts there so who knows yeah well it's not divisive these days

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and so that's this is going to roll out sometime in the coming weeks it's supposed to hit anytime is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that right they're dog fooding with uh i think a very small number of people now and so it's  going to be a roll out yeah that needs to be a long roll out in u.s. only or are they dog whistling

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  another thing that's that's dog fooding maybe or at least beta testing is netflix  testing variable playback of video content uh that's just the right thing for me i really like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that idea i can't wait to watch all my shows that way that'd be very great i listen to podcasts  listen to books that way and listening to me really fast he said an unusual experience huh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he said it like that two weeks ago right i think that's what happens what i love about that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there are people who listen to this show sped up so that part oh man this is going to be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i was asking in in the chat i mean i wonder how many people do listen to the show sped up i wonder  i would love to have those stats i think a lot of people huge number i think a lot of people do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and they might not speed it up one and a half because i mean have you tried to do that at  least for me it's really hard for me to keep up at one and a half but i can do 1.2 yeah normally

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if anything 1.2 yeah that's about as much i edit my shows sometimes at one and a half  because i i tend to speak slower because i'm thinking and my sometimes i have yes are you  insinuating something there no no i'm a slow talker stand down stand down yeah sorry i'm a slow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  talker here's your gloves here's your gloves mr jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but is there a difference between listening to a podcast that's sped up and watching a movie  that's sped up i would agree because it's it's visual and also yeah i wonder what are you doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to the art itself yeah podcasts we don't do we think of ourselves as art i don't know that i

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  consider it of course we do some components of it could be considered art no our whole audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know i'm full of crap so i'm not gonna try yeah you can adjust the timber or the voice so that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i mean the first time you go to high speed on voice it sounds a little weird but then you get  really used to it quickly right i do the same with audio books but with visuals i don't know it'll  look you know can they can they adjust it so it still feels to the eyes of what's normal no yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  directors make these conscious decisions about the frame rates they're going to use and things  like i mean that's a that's part of what they're doing and basically what this is is like you must  consume content faster because we are making so much damn content right it's true i can't keep up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with the content that they're making it's just too much but i don't watch all of them either so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but i saw that i i tweeted when i was a tv critic because as we know on the show i used to be a tv  critic former former tv god critic and people um i had what i did that in the days my children  a really long miniseries the miniseries ad was torture but i was i was i believed that i should  not fast forward past things if you're a critic why would you if you're a critic whole effing thing  600 minutes 600 is that what it was that's what wikipedia says 600 minutes running divided by six  that's 10 hours oh heavy so it's like a season felt like 24 it was just and i would hit a week  where i would get four miniseries and i had to watch them so i would have loved to have had this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  then well loved it netflix uh pointed out that you know not too long ago we were all consuming  on dvd and a lot of dvd players had the ability to have variable speed playback but who used that  well that's true who used it but you could and so their argument is well you could then so now you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  can now why not i mean yes they're not forcing it upon people so i i get it but i will also say  that anything that makes directors like less satisfied and sometimes it's boring for you and  you're like god this is slow but then there's a payoff like if you watch boyhood for example  i'm gonna be honest i watched it i was like pacing and like oh my god stop stop make something  happen but at the afterwards i was like oh that was actually well worth my time i don't know i  need to see that i haven't seen it yet it's leaving netflix oh tomorrow or like the day after that or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something so get on it and he's gonna miss that one folks sorry can't can't trick or treat tonight

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i'm watching boyhood that's how i prioritize all my i'm like what is leaving netflix okay i'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  finally watch that um any i mean i know we haven't done the uh the changelog is there anything before  the changelog because we could do the changelog and then do some tips anything that you guys want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to get in there male political reporters retweet other dudes three times more than their female  colleagues but that's no surprise okay um yeah no i think um well we could be doing hell vetica

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for halloween hell vetica's evil twin hell vetica as the article on fast company says will haunt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  your nightmares oh badly kerned yes what did they do and then i'm like oh that is terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  kind of um what they did i hope you all know what kerning is it's it's the space between letters  and sometimes you can kern you know an f over an e to make it look good they went to awful kerning  just just grading kerning however i was just writing about something did you know i didn't  really fully realize this i just wrote a book called uh space between words i don't think i've  talked about this before that from the first century ad till the seventh to 12th century ad  there was no space between words oh wow scribes didn't use spaces between words they didn't use  punctuation they didn't use capitalization it was just a continuous sounds insane scriptora  continuam sounds completely insane but it was meant to record and prompt uh recitation and  memorization and as the author of the book paul zenger says if when children learn to write they  tend to write continuously continuous sound right when i when i listened to someone before i started  taking spanish lessons to no good end because i'm so stupid but i would listen to someone speaking  spanish and it sounded like one complete sound without breaker breath right because i couldn't  recognize the words in it that's fascinating yeah it is kind of interesting and that's actually so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  my daughter that explains my daughter when she learned to write she actually learned cursive  first and the reason behind it was that exact same reasoning so she didn't well it was kind of  painful but really i don't know but it did i mean like so and that was their logic so  jeff i'll back you up on this i'm not gonna argue with you factoid of the day i've not seen that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  since roughly 1996 or so with outcasts and their southern play-alistic catalect music uh track and  they wrote it all out in one word really southern southern play-alistic catalect music by outcasts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's a song yes one long word you barge it's like german yes yes kind of is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all right that's fascinating uh but it's so true like you know the uh the kids when they first  start writing right it all blends together and then that e that should be at the end of the  sentences on the next line on the next line yeah that's about sound yeah so when they started

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  putting putting spaces back it was inspired by um arabic and and hebrew um so oh that's a good  idea let's put spaces there um also the problem was words written without vowels and that's when  they had to have spaces because you had to figure out the word words you had to add your own vowels  when vowels got added into writing the spaces became superfluous in the sounds so that's when  it became all crammed together and then they moved it back apart again which meant that  people started being able to read themselves because it wasn't so hard they were able to  read a lot faster because you recognize the shapes of the word and then that created demand for more  things to read and that led to authorship and that led to gutenberg you knew i'd end up there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of course wow so moving from an oral culture you just took us all the way through thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  six degrees of good one thing more for you god for you stacy is breakthrough in fast charging  for electric cars i thought this was potentially a very big deal being able to get 200 miles in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  10 minutes by heating up your battery um well it would heat up your battery if you just yeah i think  but is the idea that you would warm up the battery and it would accept the  power this was some some research that was done bring me the link

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's one of these pages that has video on top for no reason  money jeff that's the reason yeah i know i know the head of this company yeah um they developed  lithium-ion battery capable of adding two to three hundred miles in 10 minutes wow  oh um by elevating the temperature ah okay so you gotta get up there super fast and then bring it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  down oh i like it oh that'd be very cool battery only lasts three months so they actually say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it extends the life of the battery too okay all right it's not too long no that's that is a win

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  win believe you want to see it there's only i'll be i mean when i'm driving the tesla like cross  not cross country but long long distances it is kind of like the first stop you're like yeah i'll  get something to eat i'll get lunch you know and you charge all the way up and then like two hours  later you're like i'm still kind of full from the last charge up what am i going to do for 30 minutes  here do you plan your motel by the ones that have charging um sometimes i i don't i don't do a lot  of super road trips so like for me i i plan my hiking so i go up near a place where there's two  supercharges on the olympic peninsula so i can't go any further

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  something's changed there weren't a whole lot of changes this week i had to scramble a little bit  to find a few extras so we actually had a decent amount to read here google homes and minis have  been breaking apparently due to a firmware update gone awry particularly this has been  happening since september but google told nine to five google that it plans to replace affected  devices because hello g are you alive oh no you know apple did an update the bristol home pods

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this week too so you know google's not alone okay it's hard to keep these things alive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  i think i meant may have mentioned it on last episode or not but i think it's worth repeating  because i think it was probably a passing comment that they're also putting out an update for google  homes so that you can do independent stereo so right right you didn't mention they have two of  them and i just think that's neat i like that they're doing that home filling sound how many

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  years did it take to go back to stereo yes exactly here we are again you know i had that in the 70s

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  tabs home and media home of course for controlling the devices in your home much the same as  has already been done in the app media highlights any apps for media that are in use with controls  and play for playback artwork that sort of stuff embedded in there so it's easy to find and then  apparently there's a new feed tab that acts as a home recap with things like highlights important  events notifications security alerts audio video clips i don't know if that's like clips from your  devices or what it is but priority events that sort of stuff yeah what was that for you well because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like it you know if you go in the google home app right you can see like your last utterances  and things like that so i'm like is that going to be kind of like that or is it going to be something  totally different and then i still have to go to the google home app because i thought we were  stepping away from all that i i don't know what google's doing or maybe if someone rang your

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doorbell and there was video for it maybe it shows like oh that's who i missed steve came by

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you're like which app should i should i go with the doorbell apps right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you've got options at least there's that and confusion tensorboard.dev preview launch was  announced today i wish i understood this more than i do but i'll just say that you can host  and track machine learning experiments and share them publicly with no setup required so that's  got to be good right we'll hear more about this at i.o next year yeah probably so and it's supposedly  support for google cloud that's all i really understood from that announcement um a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bit more do you have more for us yeah just i was gonna ask i don't know this announcement but i is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it just it it's giving you access to run your own machine learning uh algorithms and problems on a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tensorflow uh cloud instance yes something maybe that sounds really like perfect yeah i think it's  a firm maybe it's a firm maybe i didn't read this one i went back and forth on whether to  include this one because i was like god i really don't understand this you'll not be able to host

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and track your ml experiments and share them publicly no setup required yeah so like you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  how we were talking about ibm letting people play around with their quantum thing when we showed  that last week right um this might just be the same thing for i'm looking yeah so it's the same  thing it's it's basically tensorflow available for you to play with without having to know how  to run with tensorflow so yes and it does all it's like a paz a platform as a service so you  don't have to worry about setting up your underlying infrastructure it just you just  give it i don't know if you give it your data i'm like i don't understand where  i think you give it your data and then you can run your algorithms against it  but i'm not 100 sure there okay but yes that's that's that help that's that yeah that's that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  helpful i actually understand it a little bit more though i should have had you uh clearly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  she knows i didn't i didn't see this one on there otherwise i would have read it automatically

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because i'm like oh machine learning oh i should throw this this is in the is not in the doc but  i'm happy about this scooter x post in the chat serious xm coming to google assistant finally

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  zero six and still exists it still exists yeah heaven is thrilled now he can get rid of echoes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because he can listen to his beetles channel wow this is howard stern of course you do oh that's  right yeah i was thinking i'm good there was another satellite service it was serious and  it was something else maybe i'm thinking that was serious and it was xm because what happened was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that there was one inventor and then they decided that was kind of automatic um anti-trust because  you couldn't have one company so they assisted us putting up the companies okay but neither was  sufficient to be a business and it also meant the technology wasn't as good but by then the satellites  were up above they couldn't do anything about it but anyway so then they merged and got bought and  so uh the technology is not what it could be if they were together but the two companies are together

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  okay yeah uh yeah so i'm happy about that uh anytime i've wanted to play it i've had  bluetooth in and it's not the end of the world but this is a little bit easier so i'm looking  forward to that also youtube music love it or not now has a progressive web app a windows desktop  or mac os dock icon will take you directly to the web app it's identical to the website but allows  you to use keyboard shortcuts to play pause skip also youtube music rolled out a android widget  last week yay so i mean this is just like the further development of youtube music as as  google marches towards that being their primary music service and i don't have a problem with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bringing this and and promoting it a little bit more because they're going to kill off  google play music i just wish they'd make it a better experience because the the five minutes  i jumped into that app it was painful yeah to try to you know navigate through youtube music and  find some tracks and had to discuss it with the family and let them know hey we're probably going  to lose google music so let's go ahead and take a look at youtube music and we all yelled out  pretty much at the same time it was like what is this you know and and yeah i understand there's  times you're going to have to get used to an interface but i don't know man that's a stretch

Transcript:  yay i know it's halloween you guys but let's start thinking about holiday lights oh come on  oh come on you're doing it so these are my new favorite toy these are the twinkly smart lights  they and i it's not dark here yet so i can't really show you but i can take you downstairs  and show you so what these are are these are heli tree up with the lights  no i i strung them on i outlined my window and then took the excess and shoved it into a pumpkin  so it looks like halloween there's the scary new lady in the neighborhood yeah that's me and mine  are the halloween setting so and that is orange and purple so the range of colors on these is good  what it does is you can download these uh patterns they were just showing you a couple of them so  when you put it around your tree it can like you can do patterns that come up and down the tree  that can go to the side to the side it's all fancy but it also gives you a mapping feature  in your phone so you can map out to build your own designs and have the lights work the way you want  so yeah it's super neat but they're super expensive of course they are  i but the the string i have is what is it 225 rgb leds oh and the cost of it hold on i haven't  said the cost yet it was 168 still yeah still wow but oh look you can do a you can do a smiley face  on your tree okay i know i'm inordinately excited so they do really well in the tree because like  the strings basically i've got my strings chasing each other in a halloween pattern which is fine  but i'm gonna leave them up all year round because i can do like ut orange which kind of looks like  clemson orange but we're gonna call it ut or no no it's not like clemson orange i know there's a  difference oh yeah well i know but it's theirs is actually closer to clemson oh it is okay sorry  yeah i'm gonna just say it's ut orange for me gotcha uh but yes it's so fun they're kind of like  they're the level of utility and probably expense that the nano leaf lights that i like so much are  so you know do with that what you will but i'm having a grand old time and i i'm very happy that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i've purchased them nice questions comments so yeah i have one question so if you have a big tree or  a little tree it looks like you can do patterns on the tree like the smiley face but don't they

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  kind of aware of where they are that's the mapping so you hold up your smartphone and you use that  that's how you map the location of the lights and then they're like then you design the pattern  now i can oh that's fascinating i haven't i can't because i haven't put them on a tree yet i haven't  experienced that feature in like 3d i've only experienced it on a string stacy's sneaking into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a park somewhere and cutting down a tree since you can't buy one now just so she can do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i live in washington there's like a tree in my car is in washington  looking at like six christmas trees right now they're just alive in my front yard  that's cool but dang that's expensive you you can buy different lights so they have i just saw that  they have a wall setting so you could like oh my gosh okay i'm done i love and you group them  that was the point you can group them like so you can buy like basically a wall of lights if you  want it to hang down your house and you can tie them into your other lights using like a grouping  scene in the app and many of these lights these are wi-fi enabled i have had smart lights actually  previously that were bluetooth enabled and they sucked because you had to get close to them to  be in bluetooth range to control them so they were too far out on your lawn of course you would like  need to go out to my lawn and it's cold so i know my life is hard those are called the twinkly  twinkly yes the twinkly's so i'm really excited by them hopefully and they seem sturdy they are  indoor and outdoor and i don't know what else do you want to know i don't know what else i need to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tell they are neat but my goodness that's expensive for led lights yeah for that tree right there how

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  many strings did you need so this so this 225 strands so the 170 bucks i spent that was going  to get me a six foot tree theoretically okay i however feel that it's still expensive there's  there's never too many lights on the tree so i don't really know oh boy yeah because like how dense

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how densely is it filled with a single one like you know i imagine you could get it around the  tree but it's still going to be pretty sparse you're going to want to like put a couple of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on there to really get feel like we should bring in your back so we can warn them yeah well so this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is this is this is 73.8 feet is the 225 light strand okay and they're led so they are actually  super bright yeah um they do some colors better than enough density for the pattern right yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you do well i think this will give you enough density for the pattern i mean you're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have a tree with pixel density stacy it does work on shapes that aren't a christmas tree although i  have not because of the mapping it theoretically works on shapes that are not a christmas tree  our robot but i do not know because i haven't i don't know how easy or hard it would be to map  another shape because i've only mapped it on a string i don't i don't know what other shape you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  i have mine in a window right now yeah so cool twinkly.com super fun very fun and very expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh jeff what's your number uh well i have a few but i'll be quick one is we have to pay attention  to this uh the the internet has as many birthdays as it has parents but uh 50 years ago i believe  yesterday the first message was sent on what became the internet and so we should say happy  birthday happy birthday internet yep yep yeah hbd october 29th and then number two so i was at this  event called the uh twitter news summit where i was on a panel about disinformation and jack  at jack was there being interviewed by buzzfeed editor ben smith one little number that came out  of it was uh was that jack said that he sets his phone to limit his twitter to two hours a day  good however however what i really wanted to talk about this is going to get very nerdy but i'll make  it very fast is a paper an academic paper about the precautionary principle that is to say the  uh-oh something bad could happen ergo we've got to stop it and do it so they did a a specific study  of the fukushima nuclear accident and right after that because everybody freaked out for reasons  and they said we're going to get rid of nuclear energy right off the bat overnight boom we're out  of here and um so all nuclear power stations ceased operation and was replaced the power was  replaced by fossil fuels which caused an exogenous increase in electricity prices going up as much as  38 on the average the increase led to a reduction in energy consumption which caused an increase in  mortality during cold temperatures and so in the end uh that caused more deaths than fukushima  so there it is the law of unintended consequences and when you when you operate on the precautionary  principle we have to be cautious about this and think of what bad could happen you could end up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  causing something worse oh my gosh that's like my total argument for thinking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and limiting things like facial recognition jeff that's my argument for not uh doing that because  maybe you don't know how many uh young children couldn't be found by the police uh and how many  criminals could kill more people because they couldn't be found by the police and only through  time are you going to know so this is really hard to map against world panic though well it's all  it's hard to uh regulate uh thinking that you've saved things by not happening but we're not going  to get into this because at the end of the show the people are hungry but but that is yes this is  i'm going to call on this again i'm if you get mad at me for saying moral panic and techno panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i'm going to say precautionary principle that's and i'm going to look at you like this what yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's going to take a while of you saying that for us to automatically go oh yeah yeah  it's gonna take a little while uh thank you jeff and what you got i have two things i hope you all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't mind but i'll be quick uh first and foremost i know that we've been talking about is halloween  coming up tomorrow and all of that and we got our awesome hats on and looking good at least some of  us are looking good um but october is also breast cancer awareness month so uh be sure to check out  the national breast cancer um dot org website and if you feel the need to donate send a dollar or  two to help out with the research um breast cancer is deep in the in the family here um  not on my side but on queen pruett's side uh it's it's run pretty deep and has affected a lot of  people there so we we we take that quite dear to our hearts i've been wearing this band for many  years now out of respect for them and them dealing with it and fighting through it so  that's out of the way uh if you can donate a dollar please go do so now please and thank you  next up is uh nothing but the arts last year uh north carolina central university uh historically  historically black college and university uh they're in near winston-salem north carolina i  believe they invited me out to sit down and talk with the group of students about being a content  creator they invited me and a couple other people and they started this little organization to help  encourage the students there to get into the arts whether it's photography video acting writing so on  and so forth and it went pretty well and it was nice to see these kids just get inspired and go  out and start creating content and start collaborating with other other artists and just trying to you  know build a community there uh at the school so this is their second year and they're having  their event today i believe or maybe it's tomorrow but they're having their second annual event of  course i'm not going to be there because i'm on the other side of the country but i wanted to show  them some love and and just um give them a shout out because they're trying to grow this and their  website is still a little bit of a work in progress right now but um they're trying these are  little college kids and and they're trying really hard and it was great to see the interest that  these kids had in the arts um especially in the black community so that's my two things right on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excellent two picks. I thought that website would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I just thought it. Thank you Mr Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you Jeff and thank you Amp. My pick or my tool whatever you want to call it it's it's more  like a trick. Oh boy. Google messages so we were talking a little bit earlier about the carriers  you know implementing their own RCS and how Google's version of RCS in the U.S. has  uh go wait Google uh i fire off this thing all the time and i don't mean to um anyways in the U.S.  there isn't a whole lot of support outward support from the carriers or or in fact you know none i  believe but nine to five google posted a walkthrough on how you can actually activate  RCS on your android messages app for these carriers whether they are you know whether they  allow for it or not and it's a very it's like a 10 step process it does not take very long it's  like a two minute process you have to download this app off the play store and and run it and  jump into you know and then like delete the storage in the app info on android um messages  you basically have to jump through just a couple of small hoops in order to do it but at some point  like before you do this if you try and go into the chat settings in android messages it won't  even let you go in there right it's unsupported right and after you do this you're allowed to go  in there it says that it's set up is complete and it's all working so then it's just a matter of  connecting with someone else that is also you know using RCS it was really easy um i know some people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that have done it that are not technically savvy or what have you they watched a video from xda  is it the same video that nine to five google is sharing um because the one that i saw was from xda  okay i'm not surprised that they would have this as well and it was so straightforward  and it didn't take any time like you said and these non-tech savvy people that i know they  did it with ease so yeah anybody can do it if you're interested in that yeah so if you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a little flavor of rcs you know and like i said then the challenge is can you know actually  messaging with someone who also has rcs because otherwise you're not going to see any differences  but then once you do that you're going to see all you'll notice the little you know the higher res  image uh sharing between people and like a typing indicator if you're if you're typing  the other person will see like the little dot dot dot to see who you're you're actually typing  things like that so uh cool little walkthrough very easy to do and you can kind of get on the  rcs chat train right now even though maybe you're not supposed to maybe not and maybe google will  like undo this at some point the capability but for right now you can do it and it's neat that  you can so there you go and with that we've reached the end of this episode of this week  in google hats and wigs edition this is a lot of fun uh we'll start with you jeff anything you want  people to know where are you oh this is back all right he's at least you're wearing your hat
