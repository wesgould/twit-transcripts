How you doing Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we were supposed to talk so you can get you out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, no no this very little the show would be very not that very  Entertaining if we didn't talk that's that's kind of a prerequisite of podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think now it is of course the the the devious me wants to take you both down rabbit holes and only to leave your kids  Stranded that's how cruel I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're gonna keep my kid from eating a snack. That's what you're gonna do. Yeah, Stacy Higginbotham also joining us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What were you gonna say, Stacy? Oh, I was just gonna say something about Jeff being mean  or not mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know this already  Yeah, retcon and chat has a great idea. This could be a silent movie edition of the episode perfect for a podcast as a format

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the mime episode the mime episode that'll get people to like watch the video if that's your goal  Like if only you were watching the video right now  Jeff trapped in a box  Jason trapped in a box  Not participating

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On TV because no one knows where you are. So it really kind of works

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true. We're right on the other side of the glass right now. I am in a box. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, indeed on the other side of your mic  Your mic stand though Jeff because the mic stands destroying the the illusion. That's true. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fine cars everybody's not everybody's a critic but Karsten is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With a K with a K. Yes, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Karsten is a critic with a K  Let's see here. So we got some we got some stuff  Although I feel like this top story was was it last week's top story the whole Fitbit thing. No, it wasn't actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speculated on Tuesday the speculation came out and then Friday they announced it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were they were right on the verge of announcing it and then boom they did it Google  Went and bought  Fitbit stumbled into a puddle of Fitbit  for two point one billion dollars  Announced that acquisition last week and of course ever and the announcement mentions the next evolution of where OS  So it's kind of but but Google didn't really clarify what their ultimate plan is  Is it to go the nest route and let Fitbit kind of be its own thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they sort of clarify I mean they said it's gonna become part of Google  Under Rick Osterloh devices and services. All right, I mean did they give the I mean the acquisition is a close  So I wouldn't expect them to have the full plan that they could tell us all right now, right?  But I feel like we we've got any said that it's gonna make where OS better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what does that mean so what is where OS better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again as long as they don't mess with the Fitbit hardware, I think Google needs and needed  fitness data and Fitbit has it and  If Google's looking at its competitors  Presumably Apple and Amazon  Apple has all of this incredible health data available to it. So  It needed that because doctors are getting involved and think about what happens if your doctor prescribes you something that only works with Apple  And then Google's gonna be shut right out of that  So this this makes a lot of sense and it also helps Google with their goals to have a ubiquitous  Helpful home, you know or a ubiquitous helpful assistant that's not just in the home  But it's in your car and it's in your life as you walk around

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. It tells you when to stop driving and walk you lazy bastard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It actually I think my smartphone used to tell me that every now and then it would be like get your butt up  It would say something to the lions and I don't know what setting I had it on  But it it used to track my steps and every now and then it would yell at me for not taking enough  You're not walking do people really I wasn't carrying my phone. That's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember when the Apple watch came out and that was the thing where suddenly, you know  You'd go to an event and everybody would get the notice at five to the top of the hour that they needed to stand up or whatever  Like is that a feature that people still keep activated?  That's one of those features that maybe in the beginning you're like, oh it's doing me a favor than a certain point  Like wow, it's really annoying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It totally like I mean if my Fitbit if I don't take at least 250 steps an hour, it's like  And now sometimes on the show you'll see me glance down and I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quick somebody else talk so I can stand up for a second exactly second jogging place  All right, so yeah, you're right  I mean I think prior to the announcement the rumor was saying that alphabet would buy and then maybe that was a little bit less clear  What what that would ultimately mean the announcement was made that Google is buying Fitbit under Rick Ostrullo  So that really does shape things a little bit more than what we knew beforehand  What do you think this is gonna do for Fitbit?  current Fitbit users because I mean again it goes back to this this thing that Fitbit was, you know its own brand  Successful or not. I mean, I think people vary in their opinions on whether Fitbit is a raging success or has stagnated or whatever  but the users have  appreciated I think the fact that Fitbit was kind of on its own and now suddenly it's being swallowed up by this this big behemoth and  People are kind of a little skeptical about what that means for their health data and that sort of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think as long as they handle the the acquisition as well as Fitbit handled their acquisition of pebble will be just fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I would say Google has a lot of them  So I really don't want Google to mess with the hardware  Just exactly just I know it all  What if I could tell my like I do fitness tracking and all these other things  You know, what if I could tell I track like water consumption through Fitbit if I could just say to my Google home  Hey G  You know add 12 ounces of water to Fitbit. That would be nice  if I could say hey G add  130 calories to you know, whatever that would also be nice or  You know, this is gonna sound silly  But I would love to be able to walk by my Google assistant and have it encourage me like as I walk by it  Use the ultrasonic sensor that they've just activated in their devices if we want to talk about it later  Yeah, it could be like oh, I guess it would need the camera for me because I don't know if it would want to  Tell my husband. Yeah, you've been active for 60 minutes so far today  He'd be like what no I haven't  But I think that would be kind of encouraging  I would totally set those things up  But I did once plug in my Fitbit to an electrical outlet that was plugged  My TV was plugged into and I did tell it not to turn on if I hadn't taken a thousand or ten thousand steps  So I'm a little weird yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So  Good no, well, I was just gonna say that's interesting  You so you basically programmed it so that the TV would not turn on unless you had taken the appropriate amount of steps

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did that several years ago with ift and  My husband Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because he was like, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see where you were headed with it. But yeah, there's unintended consequences and Jeff what were you gonna say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just gonna say I got I got an overdose of  Tech hot takes on this story. Yeah, there were you know, we're going through the practical stuff about what we wish for and how can it work?  But I the two obvious hot takes are oh my god. I threw out the Guardian  I threw out my Fitbit admitted I heard cuz I Google and privacy and you know, it's just relaxed  Nobody cares how much you sweat and then the other is is  Google ruins everything that it buys and their Fitbit's doomed  Well, I think ways is in fine shape myself and it's I just I just get sick of the tech press  Not knowing what to write so they just write some hot take stupidity and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fitbit did have way back in its beginning days  They did have a little kerfuffle around users having sex and that being something obvious that you could tell looking at their data  That was automatically set to private. So whenever I buy like a new device  I always check my privacy settings and I flip everything off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I'm just saying that how could do it how does it know you were having sex because of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Emotions extrapolated it because of I think time and activity or something. This was if you Google Google Fitbit  You know users privacy and sex. I'm sure you're gonna come up with a story. This was several years ago. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you didn't want me to talk about porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sex and porn are different things. Let's not go down this road

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do I dare enter this search 2011

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It moves quickly after users sex stats exposed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it actually has done in the past although people did get freaked out like they've done some stories like when San Francisco had the  Earthquake it actually did a post saying  Hey, here's how many people woke up during the earthquake or something along those lines  yeah, so there's there's really like from a  Huge swath of users all around the world. You can start to look at  How people behave and in physical trends that are kind of interesting. I don't I mean, they're interesting  I don't know if you can do a lot with them, but  They're kind of fun to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kind of along those lines trying to find the story because I'm not sure if they're going to be able to do it  Trying to find the story because I'm pretty certain it's not in the rundown, but maybe it should have been  I'm sure you guys read the  the didn't ring put out a tweet about Halloween and  How Halloween is always its biggest time of year and had all this data breaking down by the hour when the doorbells?  Were being wrong and it accumulated all this data and laid it out in an interesting, you know graph or whatever  And then everybody of course, it was like oh so ring can do this, huh?  They've got that granular data that they're tracking of all these different doorbells being wrong. And that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you could tell which neighborhoods were prime for trick-or-treaters  I would pay for that data because every year I buy too much candy whenever I move to a new place  I get so hopeful  I buy a lot of candy hoping that I can have children come and I give them candy and see their costumes  darned it if every year  No one shows up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so Stacy we live we live in a  Houses are far apart and there's long hills up and down the driveways, right?  So we're not we're not a good place for trick-or-treaters at all  And my wife has some candy we shouldn't get much you get some and so this year I as I drove home from work  I said, oh, there's there's like eight cars out there with kids must cover the neighbors. We're she's mine  How many kids I said, I don't know 15 20. We don't have enough candy  We turned off all the lights  Because we didn't want to disappoint this I  Know some kids some candy not others. Your costume is good. You have candy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you showed that you know, what's creepy about the ring thing is it's like we filmed thousands of kids. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is crazy. You see the one did you see the great one?  Kid comes to front door sees there. There's a there's a bowl outside  Sees the bowl is empty takes some of his candy out of his bag to put in the bowl. Everybody's compelling over that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's nice  That's nice. That's like the opposite  Experience of what I had the very first year. I installed ring at my phone at our house and  We wanted to go trick-or-treating so we left out the bowl of candy  I may have told this on this show already, but we left out the bowl of candy and  Went on our way and when we came back an hour later the bowl was empty and we're like, wow  I guess you know  There were a lot of trick-or-treaters while we were gone the next day it occurred to me to check the ring  You know my ring account because I'm sure there would be video and sure enough  I was able to find one video of these two kids one was on watch one was totally on lookout like  You know out there looking out to the street make sure no one else was seeing and the other kid was at the bowl like  Dumping it into his bag. They were all laughing and they run off and I'm like, hi old got you kid  No, I mean, you know, they were probably like I'm guessing like 10  10 and boys 11

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, of course. Yeah. Yes boys  She grabbed like two or three pieces of candy and put them in now she would root around for the good candy  But you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do peanut butter so David Ferrand hold the yeah, this is it. Yeah. Look he looks shocked. There's no candy  What does he do? He walks away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on mom. Let me let me throw some of these in there. Oh  That's really nice that is isn't that the greatest  What candy don't I want? Yeah, oh man, it's a tootsie roll somebody else could have the tootsie roll

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those things are evil. I would totally give those they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  David Ferran hold the the magnificent Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter covering Trump's corporate work  Tweeted he said would you live in Washington? This is what your kids get somebody put a an RNC Republican National Committee pin  in his kids Oh  Trick-or-treat bag, that's fun  At least it wasn't like a hat is it worse than raisins or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean at least you can eat the raisins. So I remember just I was thinking we would never can't we had a candy crisis  Somewhere we got a bowl of change, you know a lot of pennies but to make that worthwhile these days  You have to give them a pound of pennies each. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be an insult to get a get a couple of pennies. Here you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We sometimes we've resorted to quarters in the past

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, but I can get expensive pretty quick. Yeah. Well the alternative

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, let's see a bag of like a bag of candy  We buy about three or four bags of candy each year and they're they're good candy. So it's like 16 bucks  okay, so, you know, I  Mean, yes, is it as economical as candy, but if you have like a cute kid come  You know, you you don't want to like be like I don't have anything for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Light goes out. Yeah  The

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Last-minute candy my candy is which I can't only he can know about it because my daughter comes and steals it. Otherwise

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't raise her right  Yeah, and I just now realize now looking over the dock we missed the opportunity for you Stacy to talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Missed opportunity of Amazon buying Fitbit. Oh, so this was Kevin's story and  He is  Convinced well not convinced. He thought Amazon for some of the same reasons we talked about is  It doesn't have access to fitness data and this week we found out the pixel not the pixel. Sorry the  Are they the madam a Alexia?  echo buds  Echo buds. Thank you Karsten. I was like the whatever echo buds  they have fitness tracking in them and so  Kevin was like why didn't they buy it?  That would have been great and he came up with a bunch of use cases like the subscribe and save for his sneakers  I thought Amazon I don't know about anybody else  But I get super excited when I find a product on Amazon that I'm looking for and I'm like, oh my god  This is the coolest thing. Mm-hmm. And if Amazon could tell that my heart rate was elevated  Maybe they could like be like, oh Stacy's excited. We should jack up the price or  They could lower it  It's gonna say that's not much of a feature then no, no, that would be a disincentive but yeah, it'd be good for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  certainly, yeah and Amazon's hurting right now, so they got to do something to  to make some money cuz  Yeah, their life is hard. It's like, you know, yeah, their life is really hard  All right, well that's that's Fitbit and ring let's see here  We've got  What are the fun stuff do we have before we get into some of this climate change  It all gets really heavy from from here on out  Sure, we can talk about climate change because that apparently there's two things that happen back-to-back this week  1100 more a little more than 1100 Google employees sign a public letter of  Demanding that Google make significant changes to its environmental efforts  They are demanding that Google eliminate a Carmen their Carmen footprint by 2030 and end all contracts that rely on fossil fuel  extraction  also, there were a lot of demands here also to end the relationships with  quote entities enabling the incarceration surveillance displacement or oppression of refugees or frontline communities also  cutting funds for climate denying think tanks lobbyists and politicians  All very great goals for the company  But quite a you know and and quite a lot of employees how many total employees with Google like is 1100 even?  very like a large cut of the pie, I'm not really quite sure but I  Would guess probably not but still

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as of the end of  2018 alphabet had a hundred and three thousand employees

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a pretty small amount of employees but not  insignificant 1100 more than 1100 Google are signing this at least one percent at least sends sends a message  Yeah, a little less than 1%  Amazon did this not too long ago. They did this back in September 1800 per worker walkout where Bezos then pledged that the company  would cut carbon footprint by  The year 2040 and of course employees are saying that that's not enough so  So that happened but then a day later and I and totally unrelated I'm guessing it's just the way the news works  Google launched a startup accelerator targeting sustainability and climate beginning in 2020  It's gonna function as part of Google's  Google for startups  program

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good business. Sorry. It's a good business decision. Mm-hmm. Yes  This is this is this is a growth area. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and Google has so  Yes, I think I  think there are a lot of things here like when my daughter talks to me about climate change, I feel like  Educating her a little bit about the world and the trade-offs that you're gonna have with these things  I'm not saying it's not worth it to have these trade-offs, but it's important to understand them  And so like ending all contracts with people that are involved in fossil fuel extraction  that is a huge business and  ending all of those contracts or  That will have ramifications and cannot be done quickly or lightly right you have to replace that and Google has worked very hard  partially because of economic reasons on  Powering its operations which are significant  consumers of energy with greener energy  So if you look at their data centers, the way they built them is to optimize energy efficiency  And they've been buying a green power. They've been trying to power them with as much green power as possible. So  And for Google again, that's its cost of goods sold. That's that's its operations right there is  Data centers and those things consume a ton of energy. So  I'm not saying these things are wrong, but  Google's not terrible at this. No, it's like Stacy. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Googling and  In 2016 Google announced that they would their entire global business would be powered by renewable energy in 2017  And I can't find anything that says they didn't do that  Yeah, I remember that remember that yeah, you remember back to in the early days of cool.org  They did major projects around win and geo and I can't where there was a third one  Where they were investing huge amounts of money in in long-term research on energy. So yeah, they've been pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right, Stacy. Mm-hmm. I mean you can always be I mean like every time I take a hot shower  I'm like dang this is extravagant and it is  But it's also really nice to have a hot shower. So like I  Just Google has actually done a lot  towards environmental things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pardon me for this, but the first year I went to Davos  I went to a session off campus with Larry and Sergey  and Al Gore and  They you know, this is early much earlier in their in their history  but they were they were talking about the need to get renewable energy cheaper than the cost of coal and  that that was gonna have a huge impact on the world and on their company and  You know their vision really was that when you get to that point and you can get power  Anywhere on earth then you can get computer and connectivity anywhere on earth and it was a it was a strategic goal for the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it should be  Yeah  Now some of these other things like and relationships with entities enabling incarceration surveillance displacement or oppression of refugees  That's another matter. That's very different and that's gonna be a really I  Mean do you want to be the IBM that was colluding with the Nazis right now, you know people are arguing that  Amazon Google companies Palin the companies working with ice and other organizations in the US are  morally equivalent to that and  That's a tough line for a country or a country a company to  To stand on or to figure out where they want to stand  so  This is it. So the climate stuff. I feel like Google's doing a pretty good job  Yes, we can do better. We all should be but on the other hand  But on this other stuff, I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's me biting my nails well you don't get what you don't ask for  That is true. Maybe it's something along those lines going back to the climate for a second  So I think and someone mentioned this in chat, you know part of this might be  Purchasing carbon credits. I know from an operational standpoint. Google's made a lot of changes  In order to kind of be carbon neutral, but I know carbon  Carbon credits are often used to kind of offset things  like and I guess this is kind of my my  lack of knowledge in in this aspect of things but like what does that actually mean when you're when you're buying carbon offset like  Is that the same as reducing your energy usage? I mean the net effect would be the same or I mean  Obviously it would be best if you eliminate your car carbon usage period  but  It is a good alternative. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mean it is an alternative. It's it's trying so the the whole carbon offset is trying to  Put an economic price on something that we currently don't really price in which is the cost of our fuel and the way we power  Our things on the environment, right? So that's what it's good at. It is  Because you are buying like you're buying from people who have  Generated carbon offsets who do not use the energy that various  it could be global like  NGO type standards or it can be actually mandated standards  if you don't  Consume that energy you can sell it as an offset to others. So  Again, I think it's more of an economic thing  I think it's good, but I think we at this by this point in time where we are we should be doing better  now Google does do a lot of  energy purchases and makes commitments to things like wind farms in areas where it's putting its data centers and what that does is it provides a  So it says I guarantee that I'm gonna buy X number of megawatts from you each year and that helps those projects get  Financing and it provides them with a customer right so it does this and has done this in dozens of places around the world  so  You know those are probably  More effectual just because not only can it it's it's building a project and funding infrastructure  Or helping another helping a company fund its own infrastructure  But so  So, I don't know. Yeah, no that's what no that clarifies

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I appreciate that and actually CR 1 and chat says it's like housing developers that pay a fine in lieu of actually building  Affordable housing. I don't know if that's a good  Yes comparison, but that that makes a lot of sense to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's putting putting a financial kind of number to that usage. It's making an externality

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So something that isn't right. It's making an externality real

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Oh, I like that indulgences for the 21st century. Yes, not a sink  Who says that carbon credits feel kind of like indulgences for the 21st century?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that kind of has a title ring to it. Watch out watch out. I'm gonna get into Gutenberg real fast from there  Gutenberg, it's a very short hop

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Moving on actually, let's take a break. We'll take a break  We're gonna we're gonna put a pause on this Gutenberg thing that you were just about to launch into  maybe you maybe you decide to launch into it afterwards, but  Let's take a break and thank this sponsor of this week in Google welcoming to the show metallic a Commvault venture  It's great to have you guys along metallic brings you powerful  Enterprise grade backup and recovery technology through simple SAS delivery since metallic is built on Commvault core technology  You're guaranteed to get fast secure backups and granular restores  That'll help fight against data loss metallic is unique that it scales across multiple workloads  while mitigating the risk of data loss security threats and other issues like losing access to data and Microsoft Office 365 or  even poor backup performance  metallic offers  Default storage available through Azure or you can even bring your own  It has the capability to do backup recovery and migration from on-premises to the cloud  Some of the products the number of products that metallic offers some of them are metallic core backup and recovery  Which is where you can protect physical and virtual servers on  Premises and in the cloud with comprehensive backup and recovery for VMware file servers on Windows and Linux and  Microsoft SQL databases.

Transcript:  But I am ready to do a fascinating story about porn, okay fine, let's talk about  So  This is relevant this time so I went to this I because I'm doing my Gutenberg research I go to  Use bookstores where they always have books on book sections and there's a place called oak knoll in Newcastle, Delaware  That is like nothing but that huge thousands of books on books. So I'm in I'm in geek heaven  And I come to this book randomly on the shelf censorship for and against I think okay, well, let's if you're gonna know where I come down  So I I've forgotten this see if you got you you youngsters know this  in 1968 President Johnson commissioned a  Presidential Commission on pornography and obscenity and  because it was just seen to be ravaging the nation pornography and  So as it went along  Richard Nixon then came into office and  Hated this existed he kicked managed to give it an ambassadorship to one  member of the Commission and put on Charles Keating Charles Keating was famous for having belonged to  groups against bad, you know porn and such but Charles Keating was also famous for starting the  savings and loan  crisis in America leading to he was  Yeah, he was he was a founder of citizens for decent literature ink  So  What happened was the Commissioner report the 600 some page on page Commission report  It's its recommendation was to repeal censorship laws  Well Nixon hated this the Senate on both parties hated this rejected the findings went crazy  And so then they came out with this was booked  But but I found out as I was researching a clever publisher took the free government report  And  Augmented it with photos of all the things discussed  and  The editor and the publisher were arrested for obscenity  Publishing the government's obscenity report and served prison time  Wow for now, so why am I what the hell does this have to do with anything?  We're doing so as I'm reading this book which has has has positives negatives from all kinds of interesting things  negatives from all kinds of interesting people  not hint off  the father of  Former New York Times editor Joe Lilleveld a rabbi  Judith Christ my predecessor as a TV critic and TV guide and so on well as you go through this book  What you see is an incredible parallel to the discussion today  All the discussion about how we have to save people from themselves there that you know, I'm okay  I just doesn't affect me but all those people out there we've got to do something to affect them  It's it's just amazing so I'm going through this time I read a long post  About about that parallel and about how sometimes we just figure out things we get it  But in the end they so Eugene McCarthy former presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy is in here  And I just it's it's fascinating. It's absolutely fascinating to me  But this parallel it is pardon me kind of the moral panic of the age  That we moved from the idea of harmful content was porn at the time and now it's it's things on the internet  Of course, there are differences. There's scale. There's the fact that everybody can do it's less controllable  But we don't have I don't think the but part of what this what the Commission said was that there wasn't data that said  There was direct proof of harm from porn  And we don't have the data yet on what harm we fear and  So that's the end of my little soliloquy but and when was that book written? This is 1970 1970  Okay, right right after the Commission  So they got to for 12 people to write these essays real fast and got this book out and I've just been been  Devouring it this week about to write a post tomorrow  That was it. See it wasn't what didn't hurt. It was about porn didn't hurt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was not painful porn, you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, very interesting  So what is the boogeyman right now? Is it just is it fake news as in air quotes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it's I think it's hate speech hate speech. Yeah, you're right  I think it's it's and and and I don't like it more than anybody else. You know, I don't like  Like porn anybody else, but I think that's gonna be a Carson Streetlighting against me. So I'm not gonna go there  I  You know, I get the issues of porn  but at some point society learns to kind of filter things out and and not a lot of defect them and yeah, it's there and  Okay, we move on  But we're concentrating on it to such level and I'm not obviously that I'm not including people individuals being harassed and threatened  That's different from content. That's a behavior. It's bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but your content and the way it's structured can influence your behavior  Some person a person actually Jeff who you should be reading who's doing some really interesting work on this is at github  Sarah what is her name? Sarah?  Jewelbots lady  I'm gonna find her  Because she is a content moderator and she's done actually at github and has done a lot Sarah chips CHI PPS  And she has done some excellent work  investigating how the structure of github's commenting features has enabled the community to  Alienate women or people of color  She also found ways to fix it. Yes. Yes, that's what's so cool. So she's the positive story. Yeah  Yeah, she's writing these very thoughtful and I'm trying to think of where she's writing them  But I'm looking I'll look for it because they're really good and  It's it's actually very much in line with what I think  You're probably I follow her

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not trying to defend  Hate speech. I'm not trying to defend and say everything should stay up. I there does need to be work at this  But we're struggling with trying to figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not github. It's stack overflow. God stack. Okay. Sorry. She's on github  well, yes, but  Sorry, she's a stack overflow and that's where she's writing these posts and doing this. Sorry my bad, but great that'll help you find  Okay  What a very bad day at work taught me about building stack overflows community

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what is that? That's that's valuable for my social our social journalism program. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like oh you should leave because it's it's really helpful  And it talks both about  the user experience and how in this particular one, it's it's how  Her experience it never might just read it. I'm not gonna summarize something. I read like several months ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Social J because I talked before about a company called spaceship media  That's in the San Francisco area that convenes communities into conversation  And what they really done is have developed a methodology for having  Respectful conversation productive conversation. That's what we have to work on is that  But moaning it and saying the Internet's ruining everything is is absurd  It's another hot take that's gonna be damaging to freedom of expression  But trying to figure out how we work with this that's that's what we can do it. We'll figure it out  We really will we figured out porn. We'll figure this out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes you do have to make a few wrong turns just I feel like we've made a couple wrong turns with no  Oversight and now it's time to like start experimenting with oversight and be willing to adjust because that's how we're gonna get there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not gonna well, I'll argue we've made wrong terms with oversight

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's that's kind of what democracy is you kind of everybody's like  We all fix it and then you're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look over there squirrel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean I think the what  What I end up going back to is like but maybe maybe the difference now is just scale is that scale is such a  big difference between what we're encountering now versus in the past that maybe  Maybe you know, maybe the solutions are  It doesn't follow in the same path as something else. Maybe let me propose Jason challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, we propose that the yes, you're right about scale  But scale also is a proxy for another issue, which is unheard voices now heard  But but I think that's what causes some of the  Fear and trepidation and I think we have to include diversity and equity and inclusion in this discussion  Because what I hear all the time is the former gatekeepers say and put it back in our hands  Everything is okay. Well you're back in your hands  You didn't pay attention to a lot of populations that are now heard that upsets people. Yeah, fair enough  Yeah, so I think we you know, we scale  scale as a concept

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Masks other agendas. Yeah the story this week that ABC had a had a piece on  Epstein that they spiked three years ago, right?  and everyone being surprised at why  Trump won and now like the people who  voted for him are coming out of the woodwork and not afraid to talk about how  What they're like and so we have a better idea of the sort of person that votes for him. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Karsten, are you sick?  No  You sound very different today, huh?  Every time every time you you pop in I'm like who though what no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't you don't sound like your normal timber, huh? Yes, but that's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean just like no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm I'm not ill to my knowledge. Are you taking podcast voice lessons? Perhaps perhaps that's it. Okay  Talking podcast talking lessons instead of singing lessons. Yeah, I  Would agree on that last one  I had to do a double take because I wasn't quite sure it was you that I realized it was  So I'm not sure what it was. But there we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe today I've got the Skype bug that lowers your voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just sounded more normal  Yes, right there. There's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do sound different the Skype lower people's voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've we've run into a bug on Skype that sometimes  People sound like they're on helium and sometimes they sound like they're on Freon so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait when you you can't you can't inhale Freon, isn't it bad for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well  No, I had somewhat of a misspent youth and yes you can  Yeah, it's like it's like whippets it's like really really intense whippets that make your voice and it makes your voice low. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys I didn't know  It's super

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, okay, I'm sorry Jason let us get it back on track  There's an I have wondered about helium because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then jammer B is wondered about Carson so the wonder train is so so since we're on miss bit miss bent things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't this is that's a bad transition. I just read a story driver forgot on for the Washington Post about  a brain stimulation treatment for opioid addiction  Yes, deep stimulation. It's fascinating  Same thing used for Parkinson's. Yep. Hmm  It turns off that so that you know, they had a case a guy they name in Pennsylvania  Who since he got one painkiller when he was he had a football injury in high school  he's been an addict ever since and  Nothing worked nothing worked nothing worked so they put in something the size of a quarter into his brain and it stimulates parts of the  brain to change the behavior of the  Of the  the addiction mechanism, so  Science does good things too, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  City in your back brain is like a really popular way to solve all kinds of problems. We are just getting to that point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Forward to the Amazon version of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Amazon health helmet, would you stick on your head and it'll zap you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know that just reminds me of shining a laser into your home assistant and explain this to me how that would work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so excited because Kevin who is like my favorite researcher ever. I'm sorry. I'm not sure I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I definitely know exactly how it works  But the story here is that apparently MEMS microphones like the ones that are used on home assistance are all apparently  Susceptible to being  To to something called what they're calling light commands  which is essentially shining a light or a cheap laser pointer or something like that into the the microphone the MEMS mic and  Researchers were able to do things like, you know send commands to unlock doors visit websites  Start vehicles that sort of stuff. So I don't understand how you're able to do that with light, but they don't either

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very exciting. So what happens is when you shine the light it by it has I mean  Light like sound is a wave. So if you modulate your frequency in certain ways the  The microphone perceives it as sound so basically just imagine you've got waves at different amplitudes  Like sound whatever and and that's how it does but they don't actually know exactly how it works  Which is what trips me up. I'm like, yeah go science  But  what's fun about this is it works through glass and  it is  Viable, although you would have to think about you would have to figure out the proper frequency modulations to figure out  So, you know, you would have to buy the two hundred something dollar laser  You would also need to download from some dark website the appropriate  Code for unlock your door. You would have to hope that there's a door attached to it and it doesn't have a pin  So there's a limit of things you can do with this and it feels like it's expensive enough to not be an awesome prank  Is it is it simulating voice or how is it making the actual oh, it's simulating. It's simulating a voice command

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can't hear it  But you can't hear it because or is it transmitting sound in fact, it's using laser it's using a laser

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to laser  No, no, no the laser so sound is a wave like what we hear is a wave  But light is also a wave. So a laser has  waves as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Life is a wave and so is it resonating on the the mic? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they don't they don't know how they don't know how it works  But the idea is that you pick certain frequency modulations for the light and it's to the device  Which does not hear like we do right? It's it gives it the same reaction as a  person saying a command  And you've got to think that the MEMS microphone the way these work is  Something it detects a wave so it's just when I say something it doesn't know I'm talking it just knows that  Whatever waves hitting it makes it vibrate in a certain way. So it's doing this when I talk, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen and read so when the Guardian was doing the Snowden story  GCHQ the NSA of the UK had a fit with a Guardian and  And went up and insisted that from across the canal outside the editors offices  They could you bad guys could focus a lasers onto the room and listen to everything there. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think I saw that in a spy movie once

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds but yes appropriate. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so  Yeah, that's it  So the reason I think Kevin Foo and everybody should just stick a Google alert for him and whatever university is at okay  This is pro tip from Stacy because all he does is hack MEMS  It's all he does and so if you think about IOT, it's just a bunch of MEMS, right?  Because we're taking the signals from the real world and converting them to digital  So in 2017 he did all this research about hacking accelerometers. So he's just a really cool fella. So  That's it  Okay, maybe you won't put a Google search, but you should because he does some great research

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll keep us up to date here on this week in Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so far they aren't doing any of this in Jack Ryan yet because I am six episodes in so I  Can't say your name on the chat, but I'm with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds like something you might find in Jack Ryan or something  I I really just now realize this ours technical article actually has some videos that really that show kind of like the setup  The whole setup on how this is done including, you know, like a waveform on a screen that you know  That is the command that's then converted into the laser light that's shot into the Google Home

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, it's a cool process. So there is there is an actual so the speaker thinks it's getting sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's getting a waveform but in the form of  But through light and not sound but it's it's like it's sound looks to me like they're converting the waveform that you would hear  Into a light wave form right and to the MEMS the MEMS microphone. It's one in the same  It's a waveform hitting the microphone in such a way that it receives that as the words that it's programmed to recognize  That's my this life is a wave and I'm gonna ride it all night long. Oh, that's a different song. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a highway

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah  Cool, that's interesting. I definitely understand that story a little bit better than I did initially. So that is fascinating  science and technology is cool  Let's see here Google is  developing or at least part of a team of  Developing an open source secure enclave chip called open Titan. So this is of course to  improve security on devices  The secure enclave exists on the root of trust on the device, but some you know would ask  How the enclave itself can be trusted?  so this is an open source project to kind of address that and  They're basing it loosely on the root of trust chip that's used on the pixel 3 and the pixel 4  And they're still developing it. They've got a  consortium of companies  Nonprofits and academic institutions that are all kind of pitching in on this open source project  so it's  Currently in developed in an unfinished state, but you can go to the open Titan github repository and  Take a look at it as it's going along  they hope that people do because they want to have kind of the opinions of of  Everyone as it's developing so that they can take a look at all aspects of this keep things even

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have a question on this which is probably bad a bad sign for y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you don't know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know I have an answer but go for it. I'm trying to understand so arm has their secure aren't on Clive technology  So they're their stuff is trust zone and that's it's a physical  Section of the chip Intel has their trusted execution environment  So is this the same thing is that only it's a Google open source version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is that's my understanding. Yeah, it's a whole chip though. Not just part of a chip there. There's  specific root of trust chips that  The basically there's the there's the security chips in the in pixel phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're okay, so it is a dedicated secure enclave for a device  So it is not so because like so then it is not designed for running an application ensuring that secure  It's designed to make sure that  The device itself. Yes things going to that are not messed with and tampered with as opposed to securely running an application from that area

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. That's my understanding is that okay a protection of the device as a whole and not just a particular app or something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then yes, this has lots of variation or lots of use for  The Internet of things. Okay. Sorry. This is something I was trying to figure out yesterday when they I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And IOT I mean  Pretty pretty insecure in a lot of different ways  Do you think something like this would be like is of dire need and IOT right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not only do I think that a bunch of other companies and vendors and customers think that so yes, this is already happening  That's why arm has done stuff with they've actually developed something called PSA, which is  It it makes it easier to code to their trust zone area so people can have secure devices  It also ties it back to the cloud so you can  Basically your device can call back and say hey, I'm this secure secure device right here  I'm identified as blah blah blah with my my private key and then the clouds like are you really and it's like, oh, yeah, you are  Okay, I'll give you this and then when it arrives, they're like, hey, did this really come from this thing and they're like, yeah  And they check and then it runs  Microsoft has that with Azure sphere and  There are probably a half a dozen private companies doing variations on this. Okay. So yeah, it's a big deal  Yeah, or it's a it's a thing that exists

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just realized while you were going through that you should create a comic book of some sort with where you like  explains  Yes, Stacey explains  Technology topics through the conversations of the technology components of these things  Stacey's plane that was lame thought it was great thought it was helpful Stacey Splains  There we go show title Stacey Splains love it, let's see here what else do we have  We

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can we talk about the Google Nest ultrasound sensing whenever it's yeah, you don't have to tell me about it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, let's do it right now and then we'll take a quick break. Where was where was this one?  I know it's in here somewhere. Is it in there a lost try it. It's it's in the the change log. Oh, it's down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, we have a  Huge ton of stuff. Yeah change log is too full. So I'm moving it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is good to do this I feel so bad you guys because I told you there was gonna be solely on this particular device  And I had lied to you because it's not solely it's this ultrasound chip doing similar things  So instead of the cool 60 gigahertz chip, all this is basically doing is using the microphone in the device to be like  Sound my sound waves and when someone interrupts that pattern  It's like oh, there's a person here and then it adapts and they just did like today the updates started rolling out my  House forget what this thing is called. I'm so sorry you guys nest hub max

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how could you possibly forget? It's only had three names

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My nest or something is not updated to this yet, but the description of this is so amazing  I cannot wait. I wish I could show it to you now, but it's talking about how the display adapts based on how close I am  So if I ask it the weather and I'm close it will give me like a lot of granular weather detail  But as I walk farther away, it will just give me like the temperature and big font and that's so that's neat  I'm just like way to use technology to drive a better user experience  Not just to put cool technology and things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now it just needs to tell you to go outside and walk because it's really nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See in once they bought Fitbit they can see me getting closer and be like, oh  You are not approaching that couch walk

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keep you keep walking. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was confused I thought that this was a and they actually had a sonar  I did they don't they're actually just using the microphone. That's that's what this story says. That's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean were you thinking that the solely was was in there. I  Didn't get that impression. I thought it was more like positing wouldn't that be neat if but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I thought that they were gonna do because they talked about so they talked about the feature which is  Detecting people as it got nearer to things. Yeah, they didn't really talk about how they were gonna do it originally  So I assumed it was solely because solely was being used for that in the phone, right?  That's a common use for 60 gigahertz ultra wideband sensors  But that's not this use and it's the same thing the nest mini is doing remember how we talked about it  like yes, was it last week, yep, yep to be like  Hi, I'm lighting up for you. So you can actually see what things you need to press. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Change the volume and everything. Yeah, it just makes me wonder what then  Why is one necessary when the other does the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they do it in different ways. So yeah your phone  Your phone shouldn't be constantly emitting an ultrasonic  Good point for I would think a lot of reasons  But it would also be pretty battery-intensive I would also think I don't know this is this is me not sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're probably right and the way that they built so solely into the phone. It's not that it's necessarily battery friendly. I'm guessing  But maybe it's better than it would be if we went the ultrasonic route  My jury's still out for me and solely on the phone, but we talked about that last week  It was a little bit more and you know, it's great my alarm  Yeah, yeah, totally it's it's worth checking in and see like are you still using it any appreciable like but like improvement to your life

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But my alarm clock out so give it time not to use it on your phone  But for other people to develop things that make sense on your phone. This is an ecosystem play it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But even Google has said like we have no plans  Right now to do third-party API access for this like it's not our plans right now  But I guess they say that until suddenly they do  So that's how it all works. All I know is my alarm clock app sleep is Android doesn't support it  I tried it this morning. I woke up. Oh  What wave my hand over the top and it did nothing  So I still have to tap the screen to turn the alarm  Like a caveman

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would have oh and they do say that they tested it with dogs and cats because that is an interesting question  Does it drive your pets nuts? Oh, and the answer is Google says it doesn't I?  Can't wait to get it because my dog I have had devices that drive it nuts  So I'm very curious because that would really suck because my dogs are be a little neurotic. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Suddenly your dog video around the dog ring the ring doorbell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And knowing how to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on my old I had a German Shepherd when I was a kid who rang our doorbell  Every time I jump the fence and it would just go ding-dong. That's awesome. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in it's in the rundown  the rundown  So the dog was locked out the owner didn't know it realized the dog and locked out. So the dog comes up  Rings the doorbell. Hello. Anybody there goes back and waits  Why did it just bark because then I guess owner is upstairs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is amazing isn't that great and then comes back one more time now I know what I have to train my dog to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The dog is gonna come back and it's gonna bring the doorbell again. It's gonna let in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seriously owner, I'm still out here. Look I rang your doorbell. Let me in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm your dog. This is why recording on ring is such a wonderful thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just reading an advice column actually and someone had a video doorbell and they  Said it was it was a very funny. I think it was in Karen feeding on slate and they're like I caught my son using  They had forgotten their key and he was using horrible language including multiple instances of the F word  Should I discipline him? I was like, whoa  The smart home has jumped the shark Wow  Wow, the columnist did say that you should not discipline your son for cursing on video in the front  but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe bring it up and relay maybe bring up the point that he is being recorded

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, when you forget when your key doesn't work and like your hands are fuller. It's cold  That is a perfect time I think to drop an F bomb. Yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah, I completely agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break and then we'll talk about more of these topics and a whole lot more  Maybe we'll get through some Google and get to some other topics because there's a lot in there  But first this episode of this week in Google is brought to you by privacy  Comm you don't use the same password everywhere  So why use the same card number when you shop online?

Oh  Let's see here apparently Chromebooks are getting a boost on their their support  They always ship with an end-of-life date, which has been pretty good when you compare it to like Android device, you know support  But Google is apparently revising the end-of-life date for 135  Chromebooks to give an extra year of support in many of those cases most of those cases actually some of them like the slate  They're boosting that another two years. So the slate for example, you get an extra two years through June of 2026  Just makes me wish that phones got similar support  Because that's a that's a nice long chunk of time for support  There are some devices that only get a couple of months extra but most of them seem to get a year or more so  That's pretty awesome. You've got Chromebooks. You're gonna be able to use them for a long long time  So Kevin, by the way

He says the way I liked voice assistants and better wireless headphones  But on the whole was kind of an incremental decade  He says then the comments of course are the best part of it because people then nominate things  Gabe Rivera says uber and Lyft, but Farhad says I kind of on the bubble ramped up this decade but started in 2009  So I guess that's cameras on cars became required  Farhad says, huh fundamentally  but did he not run into things I  Guess not dropbox said somebody. Nope. Sorry started in 2008  He my nomination somewhere in there is  of course  Chromebooks

It's the very first worldwide

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Launch of anything of LTE was December of 2009. I'd give it to you. I think that's firmly  The first US phones were late 2010. Yeah, and that's been huge. I mean, yeah

Transcript:  Was there any tech released in the 2010s that completely changed your life?  Like how or I would say as how smartphones did or even a fraction of that?  I see that's why he's trying to argue is it because he's always negative or odd  He's trying to argue that it's a incremental  Decade

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I'm saying we've got LTE we figured out how to do neural networks at  With at a scale that's possibly at a reasonable scale and price  So that's huge and that's having an effect on our lives. Even today. We just don't necessarily realize it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just aren't using them like the way we use a smartphone. Yeah, it's not necessarily consumer technology, but in industry, it's huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cup yeah, so I guess i'm a couple of weeks into it and a couple of weeks. Oh, yeah and um  I've been asking myself that question. I mean there there aren't a whole lot of things  About this phone that i'm like, oh man, you gotta check this out. You know what I mean? Like it's  Between the pixel 3 and the pixel 4 there's there's really not a whole lot of differences outside of let's say the solely  Thing but even that like i'm hardly use it  Um, I feel good holding on to my three I I activated I went in the developer  Settings and activated 90 hertz to like just like put it on and force it on and see  How much of a difference it makes and I mean it's it's really nice  But I could very easily keep that off and you probably won't notice the majority of the time that things are  You know as smooth as they ever were prior to 90 hertz being a thing. So I feel like some of the major  revisions on this phone  Are neat to have but not have to have that makes sense. Okay. Thank you  I don't think it's i'm gonna buy I don't think it's a must upgrade if you've got the go instead.

We'll do tips tricks numbers all that fun stuff and round out this show  But first let's talk a little bit about tailor store. They are the sponsor of this week in tech tailor store is awesome  I'm a tall individual. It's not easy for me to find clothes that fit  That's why I like tailor store because their clothes are made to fit they offer high quality  Made-to-order dress shirts for both men and women that are fully customizable and tailored to your measurements  As a 100 carbon neutral business tailor store challenges the traditional fashion industry with its new way to purchase clothes  Ready-made garments and off-the-rack sizes have no place in the modern world  They rarely work for me to be honest people are individuals and tailor store embraces individualism  There are virtually endless options to choose from they have a selection of finished designs that can be directly purchased  Or what's really cool about tailor store?  You can use those designs as a starting point for your own customization and when i'm talking about customization  You can get super detailed with how you want these these shirts these clothes to be designed their perfect fit guarantee  Takes away the risk of ordering if your shirt does not fit you as you would like they will remake it for free  All you have to do is just snap a couple of pictures of you wearing the shirt that you received  They make the necessary adjustments and they send you a new shirt  Super quickly at no cost  And the best part there are no returns. So that means that faulty shirt that you received first is yours to keep  Um, so hey you have another shirt. Maybe it doesn't fit as perfectly as the other one  You can wear it or you can give it to charity whatever you want to do. You're not returning that shirt  Tailor store has a size me app which revolutionizes the measurement process using advanced technology and algorithms  So you aren't pulling out a tape measure and like how what?  How am I measuring the neck and the sleeve and all this kind of stuff? You don't have to do that  Um, no other hassles like that. You just download the app and you let their algorithm  Precisely calculate your clothing measurements. It takes just seconds. And again, I used this it worked really well  My the I received the shirt initially and it actually  It fit the way I had described but I realized like I know I didn't get any tapering  In the in the body and so it wasn't as slim as I liked so I contacted them they  You know, I sent the two pictures. They sent me a replacement. I kept the first shirt  and I have a revised version of that shirt that fits me slimly and  Couldn't be happier gone are the days when custom made to measure shirts were an item of luxury wherever you are  Look and feel your very best in perfect clothes made only for you by taylor store  With their exclusive trial price each new customer gets their dress shirt starting from only 39  Dollars, that's 50 off the regular price  Go to taylorstore.com  Twig with offer code twig and you can get yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Yeah, you know, i'll keep throwing it on it'll be in  I'll be a little depressed when it fits  When it fits i'll know I have failed  um  Jeff you were going back and forth on a number before the show so i'm gonna throw you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So kevin tofel came to the rescue as he does with everything. He sent me a message  300 is the number. No, that's how many topics you'll be able to follow on  Twitter  As they shift to an ability to follow topics, not just people. That's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. So apparently this has been like I  You know, I I know i've heard people  Wanting something like this along the way and I guess twitter's been kind of wondering how they're going to  Implement a feature like this for a long time and they finally have it 300 topics to start with  um  tweets from accounts  Uh from people with credibility on those particular topics whether you follow them or not  So it's going to be kind of a stream based on topic and you probably aren't following a lot of the people in there  Maybe you end up following them because you like that person or whatever, but that's a neat feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh control four  launched a brand new device  They acquired a company in 2019  Called neo and I had last seen neo's hardware at ces in 2017  And I was super excited by it and it was a remote control to integrate your diy smart home stuff  And it was gorgeous  Control four bought it and basically they have now turned it into a gorgeous remote control for control four  So i'm going to show that briefly to you so you can see what a beautiful  Remote control experience looks like and I also learned that control four now  Really? You can build a system that works with a lot of your other stuff for about two thousand dollars at a very minimum  Which gets you the hub this particular remote control and  It works with other stuff too like your nest your hue lights and other things sonos, etc. So here's the remote control  It's very skinny. It's very pretty. It's capacitive touch up here  there it is and  It's nice  I don't know. I mean, I don't know what else to say. I just thought  It's worth seeing the remote control because it it kind of reminds me of the the phone design that andy reuben tweeted the super  Long format phone. Yeah  Because I don't have a control four system that I have with this is the charging  Puck  Is not both ways. So it's not like lightning and if you flip to me  So this thing is huge and you're supposed to like stick the remote in but you have to stick it the right way  Where it won't stay  And that makes me sad. Yeah  It seems like a little bit of this is a six hundred dollar remote and it's magnetized

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love magnets snaps right in does it do you feel a magnetic rejection when you put it in the wrong way?  So at least like you don't think it's in there and just like leave and it falls. No, it just falls over

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just falls over. Oh, oh look, I can make it sit up straight if I do like this, but it won't be charging  Um, it doesn't actually fit. That'll be confusing then. Yeah  Yeah, it is it is but  So that that was my one beef with this whole thing and this thing yellow  I could kill a man if I threw this at his head. I mean it is heavy  Wow, sorry not that you're angry today or don't throw that at anyone i'm not i'm i'm not angry
