She has an exciting day today. We'll talk about why oh  very exciting  And I'm not talking about the wine dinner. You're going to later today  I'm talking about Microsoft's big announcement. We'll also welcome Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York. He's back in his office  He is a professor of journalism there. He's also at buzz machine.com the author of many a fine tome  He's a tomologist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is better or worse than being a tamale

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or a tomography  So this kind of surprised me on Windows Weekly and and they said you were tweeting all about it  You're very excited about this  Microsoft announced a secure IOT hardware software play called  Azure Sphere  Yes, it is a software play

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a three-way play. So there is a MCU microcontroller  There is a OS secure OS that sits on top of the microcontroller  Most people were very excited because this is a Linux based distribution. It's not Windows embedded. Wow  And then there is a cloud element  which is the what do they call it the secure cloud or something and  What all this is is this is designed to solve a lot of the problems with connected devices and these are not  computers servers things that have like  Official big chips big chips and then there there are things like washing machines microwaves  Not actually wearables because there's an a7 in there, but they have microcontrollers. So these tiny  Smaller chips that don't have a lot of processing power except this one does so it's it's a little different  It's certificate based authentication and it's got a secure element on the chip. So  What's happening here is you're like you put this in your device  it's going to have its own it's gonna be basically auditable secure and you can actually update it from over-the-air send  everything via encrypted traffic and it's it's actually a really  Pretty awesome step forward for IOT security. The big catches are  Here they come  These are still pretty significant chips  There a microcontroller is usually very small but they have an arm a7 chip on there  So that's that's actually a big chip. So this is not for like sensors  This is going to be in devices that have substantial enough batteries light bulbs. It's doorbells. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lightbulbs would work really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's small enough for that and you can plug a light bulb in I mean, it's oh, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're thinking I see low power devices and battery powered

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking I'm like looking around for the sensors that are scattered in my desk door, but like door window sensor  Got it. And the other thing is this doesn't do anything for all of the devices that are out there now  So this is coming in the future end of year  You should start seeing devices that have this on there. And then the third thing is for this to actually work  Microsoft has to partner with the chip guys and the chip guys have to put Microsoft's IP on their silicon and adopt it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Media tech is making the initial batch of chips. Although Qualcomm has said they're interested  Yes. Yes, Qualcomm's interested. I think I bet Samsung is not because they've got their own platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a secure chip for their Arctic platform  So they have Arctic modules and they have an Arctic s module, which is their secure module  So it'll be interesting to see what happens there arm is a partner for this  So if you license arm stuff, you can just wiggle the Microsoft IP block in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My sister says licensing will be inexpensive  But I think they make their money because it uses the Azure cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so this is where it gets fun  they  You'd this does use the Azure cloud you pay a one-time fee for the chip and the license and it's a 10-year life  And what will happen is you can use Azure cloud so you can send the data from the secure device anywhere you want  So you don't have to use Azure  Where I think this gets maybe more interesting is Microsoft has an edge product Microsoft IoT edge  I believe it's called and this is for like intermittent computing environments like  think about like a container ship or  Anything where the power and connectivity might come off for off and on  You're gonna need a platform for that that can handle those on and off environments  It's gonna be easier to tie it to Microsoft's IoT edge  Then it might be for  You to tie it to AWS greengrass, for example, so that's where things are gonna start  It'll still work with AWS greengrass, but you might have to work a little bit harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My guess is it really the goal here is to compete with Amazon and Google  And to provide something that really is security first, which is something Amazon and Google really aren't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Amazon has a chance with free R toss, but they haven't done anything there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so and I think this is this actually is really good news for consumers  It's it's Microsoft saying we're gonna this is an important thing for us  IOT and we're gonna make a secure platform and that means you'd be able to look and I'm sure they'll have some badge or some  Sort of certification and that'll be on the box and you'll have this sense that yeah  Not only is this a secure system is Microsoft gonna provide patches to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Operating system as needed. Oh, yes, that's part of the security  So yes over the 10-year life of the chip and that's really actually a hugely important thing for IOT is having such a long-lived  support element, although as a consumer  I'm like yay ten years that sounds reasonable, but then I'm like I have had washing machines

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's better than anything out there right now and even you know where this really becomes valuable as these Chinese companies that are making  These really insecure cameras and and other IOT devices  Routers they can for a reasonable fee  Put this Microsoft thing in there  Saves them a lot of development time and consumers in the states will look at and say okay  I could trust this even though I never heard of Xiaomi or whoever right this $20 device that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To all the $100 devices. Well, it's got ashers fears in it. Yeah, that's gonna cost to license that  That is not disclosed but I did talk to someone in the community and they were like it's a bit pricey but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh really change over time. So it's not gonna be a $20 camera anymore. It'll be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, $25. No, I don't think well pricey for this segment is a few dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a few cents. I mean, so when you're looking at your chip pricing, it's a few cents  but if it's like an extra buck then that adds like and 20 bucks on your right and  Anyway, I don't know if that was way like super nerdy for y'all so I think I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft was saying it was not expensive. But of course that's all in the eye, but yeah expensive is in the eye of the beholder  But what I think is really good news and it for a few reasons  It makes it easier for companies to make secure IOT devices without doing all that back-end R&D it and it makes  competition for Amazon and Google  And Apple to some degree and it encourages them to put security first all of which is really good for the general ecosystem  I think this is I'm really happy to see Microsoft do this and it's kind of a surprise. It's a little bit out of nowhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've been working on it for four years

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they had something called sopress that they were working on and we were talking this is this is the rules for project sopress

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Galen who did that and it's all based on their uh, oh, what's their gaming console Xbox? Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Better learn that before you talk to Galen by the way, I talked that he's already in the can it's in the can  It's in the can and so the next the next IOT Stacey and IOT will be the interview with Galen  What's his name Galen hunt who is the guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's the guy who came up with his seven security principles that he was designing for and then  If you thought the stuff I just said was interesting. I talk about it even more with him. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft's president's Brad Smith said he expects nine billion  IOT devices to ship this year  I'm with Brad nine billion with a B  so this is this is probably the fastest growing technology segment ever and  As it stands right now is a massive threat to security  So this is a big deal  And I I feel like Microsoft's really putting a stake in the sand it goes right up against Google and Amazon because those are the  Those are the other two big companies and as I said Apple wants to be in this but they but they haven't made anything particularly compelling yet  Although Apple will be security and privacy first, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but I think this might actually go up more against Samsung and Apple  Yes a bit Amazon. So really what they're trying to do is  And even the chip players none of the chip players have gotten their act together on this the closest thing we have because this market  So fragmented so I think this is really  Yes, it should drive Amazon and Google to be more secure  But I would say Samsung actually makes these modules Apple already does its own chips. They have the MFI program

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Samsung I'd forgotten completely but they were their acquisition of smart things and all the devices they make if they're a big player in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they just integrated other all their appliances and smart things  They're in the process like right as we talk of integrating that all in together. So if you have Samsung appliances  You can start doing some really cool stuff. Like your lights will flick on when your dryer is done  Okay, maybe that's not really cool. I think it's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We now know where Marissa Meyers been she's hanging out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well sort of that's weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's renting her old Google office

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I know was it her old office it was the original Palo Alto office, I think Oh Google's old office at Palo Alto  It's Google's old office. Oh, how funny that fabled one in downtown Palo Alto

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, she said she'd worked there because she said every time I go up the steps. Yeah, it comes back big article  This is actually not the one to look at let's go back to the New York Times article  Let's go back to the New York Times article because this is this is a rehashed version of the big article in the New York Times about  Her and yeah, she says let me see if I can find the quote  Because she says every time she goes up the steps it reminds her of the early days there  It is by the way great picture Marissa Meyer. She looks relaxed happy. She talks a lot about Yahoo  She said, you know, I had high hopes  Of turning around Yahoo, but ultimately it was a legacy business and all I could do is slow down  the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Death absolutely true. It was the last old media business. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She she is looking I guess this is kind of to be expected to be invest I guess and be a  startup person  Loomy Labs, yeah, that's it. Loomy is a Finnish word. It means snow. She says I like snow a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good name that was that was a silly little quote I'm like and I just love snow I'm like, huh, huh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is actually the office. She said where I started my career in 1999. It's also where PayPal started  So there's a lot of good juju here  Coming back reminds me what Google felt like in these early moments. I remember this was a telling statement  I remember running up those steps because if you didn't get here fast enough on Saturday morning  Somebody in the world was gonna get worse search search results and it might change their life for the worse  Wow  I'm not running up anybody's steps on Saturday morning

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like the old Disney joke if you don't come to work on Saturday, don't bother coming to work on Sunday

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She talks about Larry and Sergey in the early days, I'm glad the Times asked her this  She says Larry and Sergey just yelled at us until we became what they needed us to become and get done  What they needed to be done and so I said look she was employee 20, I think right look  I'm just gonna rinse and repeat that hopefully with less yelling  We ultimately brought in management coaches and all kinds of mentors  Wow  Wow, she said I always knew what Larry and Sergey wanted  I knew what looked good looked like to them and so I never got discouraged by them saying wait  I don't think this is ready or I think this is overly ready

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Overly ready overly ready released an overly ready product in his life

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At a startup you never really know when you should launch something so Google built the philosophy of launching early and often try things out  See what works  She said the first phase of the company when you're tens of people the the idea itself either attracts people or it doesn't people are  There because they think the problem you're trying to solve is just that important then  Getting from a hundred employees to one thousand you have to be very careful  You don't want it. This was really interesting  You don't want to pay them too much because you don't want somebody who's there for the wrong reasons  You want to get people who are really aligned with the mission you make sure they're fairly compensated, but not necessarily  Motivated by that compensation. That's not true anymore. Is it no well, she says that's up to a thousand  She says then around a thousand people the culture and the mission becomes self-reinforcing  At Google I always ask new people  Why did you come when we were about 1200 people all of a sudden for the first time?  I actually heard the answer I came for the culture  She said I had a strategy both at Google and Yahoo of meat  Salaries not beat salaries. It's the trade-off between this is a great line. It's the trade-off between mercenaries and missionaries  You want a true believer is not somebody who's there for the money  Mercenaries and missionaries I love that  As a as for Yahoo, she said well, I was I'd been working at Google for 13 years  She doesn't mention the fact that she was kind of demoted or pushed aside a little bit right before she went to Yahoo  I'd been on search for ten of those years just recently made the changeover to focus on maps  Maybe this is her way of saying that and I was like, you know, I'm just not sure I want to be like the 50  year old search girl I  Always had huge respect for Yahoo as a company when we were here in this office  We dreamed of maybe getting the Yahoo contract maybe one day powering Yahoo search in 1999 Yahoo was the Internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said there's the problem there's the problem in 1999

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I knew that while there were a lot of things going wrong for the board and leadership at Yahoo  There were a lot of really good people still there working on  products  She wanted she says to return it to the preeminence in its users daily lives  Where it used to be where people were on Yahoo for half an hour to many hours a day  I'm proud of what we achieved at Yahoo that said we had a quickly decaying legacy business  And all we really managed to do was offset the declines  She talks a little bit about the activist  Dan Loeb and Carl I can and how that was really focused on short-sightedness and  She was mad because they forced Yahoo to sell some of their Alibaba steak  Which would have been worth a lot more had they held on to it  She tells an anecdote about building something with her son with magnet tiles  Stacey you probably know it. Yeah, it's not Lego. But what is it? It's like magnetic Lego. They're like plastic covered magnets that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Build stuff with I'm like they're flat you build the I'm like deep deep deep deep

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She said we built this giant kind of castle complex and it collapsed and my son was crestfallen I stopped and said  Son, it's a teaching moment. There's nothing to be upset about we built it and it worked once and we'll just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rebuild it kid fail fast. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She said that was one of my civil engineer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't want bridges to fail even once  She said I would say one of my key learnings for Yahoo is that timing is everything  We could make the products really good but regaining the contextual relevance that was afforded to Yahoo in 1999 in the early 2000  It was difficult difficult. Absolutely  She said an interesting thing about me too. She said as important as these conversations are  I hope we're able to have them in a concentrated way fix the problems and then move on  Because what I don't want to do is dissuade the next set of leaders entrepreneurs and executives from even entering the field I  Don't want us 15 years from now to turn around and be like wait  How come there's so few women VPs of these companies? Oh, right because in the summer of 2018  All this me too stuff was happening. It caused people to say I'm not getting in that business

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, me too is everywhere. That's just asinine. Okay, there's no business set aside from this yet. That's a point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on, Marissa. It's not just the tech industry  Even podcasting even in podcast even in podcasting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are some of your tips for perseverance when the chips are stacked against you?  Develop a thick skin Bradley Cooper the actor once said if you ever want to feel really really bad about yourself go read about yourself online  And then she quotes the last line of a book. I bet you've read your daughter Rosie revere engineer  Life may have its failures, but this was not it the only true failure can come if you quit

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  scene  So that's Marissa Meyer back at it, and I guess she's good interview. It's a it's actually you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've always liked Marissa respected Marissa, and I wish her the by all means the best what I loved about it was very colloquial and not

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Forced not she didn't get back. This is no there was no PR person. No, it was very genuine. It was good  I thought  Okay, I agree  Kendrick Lamar wins a Pulitzer Prize  For music the first damn damn. That's right. Damn  That's his that's what I don't know if that was the album that won but this it is he  He's the first hip-hop artist to win a Pulitzer  You know traditionally the Pulitzers go to  jazz and classical music

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know slate did a wonderful it was wonderful too much slate did an interesting article  They interviewed the two other nominees and classical music for the Pulitzer about Kendrick winning. So it was kind of a fun article  That's interesting. What did they say? They basically like dude  He's awesome  And we really like his work and one of them was kind of influenced by some of his stuff and they were  Really excited for him. I think is not your typical rapper. He talks about

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lot of stuff deep stuff real stuff  You know, it's it's it's it's hip-hop but it's but I think that he is  Absolutely a poet and and pushes the envelope. So and of course, he got a Grammy right album of the oh no  He didn't get a Grammy. He didn't get the Grammy that was  Oh, but he got a Pulitzer it's like somebody the New Yorker says kind of like Bob Dylan getting the Nobel Prize

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually what I thought of us like times are changing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that interesting he didn't get the Grammy but he got the Pulitzer  Wow, that tells you something about the Grammys and then the can and can film festival saying well  Netflix can't be in the can film festival because  Their movies aren't on a screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a theater well, they're trying to force them to put them in French theaters and they refuse yeah, they say okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't even read a theatrical experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't read that. I I just I I couldn't you couldn't care less the outrage. I could not care at all about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a little too much outrage in this world  I'm sorry, but  you are  You're not in the theater and yet I have to say some of the stuff I like the Meyerowitz stories pretty amazing stuff  Really good work being done by Netflix and Amazon and others and just because they're not shown in us in a theater doesn't mean they're not  cinema  Well that you know what that is gonna change  Yeah, I  Don't know how much that hurts Netflix to not be a can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, isn't there Orson Welles daughter something something this these are the headlines that I've skipped so from the headlines  Has something that they want shown his daughter  Is pushing for this but it was a Netflix deal Netflix acquired it and she wants a shown-it-cans and the French are like no

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It hurts the creators. It doesn't hurt Netflix  What does Netflix get out of can nothing if you want a distribution, you know going to a festival

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Important but they they are distribution if you were but if you're trying to pitch your services to like a famous actor director  They really want they want to be a cache. Yeah  First they want in something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want the palm door the golden palm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you ever done I can do no  Have you you probably have

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I go to VidCon instead VidCon is the you know what Netflix same time go to VidCon instead  Yeah, it comes much more much more with it much more you really it's fascinating to see the world change and  And to see some people dragging their heels as it does  I'm sympathetic

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you used Google's new book search I was trying to I was trying to sell I couldn't go over the right question

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used it so it was fun because  We were talking about this on Twitter, but we were also talking about  Individualism versus collectivism and how the United States where we really have  This sense of individualism  You know is is has you know, I just learned that there are 176 million cameras in China  You see the 60 minutes on Sunday about  How they they found a currency?  Manipulator in China at a concert of 60,000 people with face recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he thought he'd be safe, but no

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean they're they're really moving fast and face recognition. So we talk how yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did how did Google book search get to this topic? I can't wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I asked  This is you go to books.google.com slash talk to books and this is Ray Kurzweil. He talked about it at Ted this year  And he this is Ray Kurzweil and he said instead of doing a search you're gonna speak to it in sentences and you're gonna get it  so I  Can't remember what I wrote something like how does  Individualism  Or us and I can't remember what I wrote collectivism  affect our views of  Privacy say that would be an interesting subject right? How do individualism collectivism affect our views of privacy and  Look I got some really interesting  And  related  Another way of thinking about individualism versus yeah, did you see that?  Well, that's probably because it's cash another way of thinking about individualism versus collectivism is considered the degree of privacy a person seeks  This is from oddly enough occupational therapy with elders  But then there's Stephen Breyer former Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer's active Liberty  others find connections between personal privacy and individualism and the privacy may encourage nonconformity and more free expression or  Privacy impact assessment, but that rolls off the tongue  So this so that you know  I thought that was actually pretty good and if you're a student and you were thinking about these issues you would get some  interesting references anyway  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tried it for a question that I'm constantly trying to figure out and think about we talked about it a lot actually and I asked  It does the US legal system focus on intent or outcome?  That's good less less about finding more for finding things to read because I'm trying to focus on what happens the US legal system  So it pulled up the first two were not useful, but they started actually getting  More useful over time including a book liability for crimes involving artificial intelligence

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bring it. Oh man, this is good for research. So I just put in tell me about moral panic and technology. There you go. Bingo

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you get anything good in there? Yeah, I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually I was like, oh this is kind of fun  Also scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is what journalists do one of the things I've really been thinking about lately is you know  Artificial intelligence is like blockchain  It's the thin spread of peanut butter that you put on top of anything you want to sell to the marketplace  to make it sexy and  I really wonder you know, we we bandy this AI around an awful lot these days and  I really wonder how close to I mean are we is it really AI? I mean, is it really is it?  Or is it just Eliza?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There there's there's words you can use like artificial intelligence can mean lots of things  But if you do things like machine learning that actually means a very specific thing. Yes, so  Maybe we should ask people to be a little bit more safe machine learning

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  machine and machine learning is a method not a not an outcome right and the outcome  It implies the outcome of artificial intelligence. I don't know if it delivers that outcome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And  it's also like how do we what kind of intelligence do we value and how do we add like  computers are already  artificially intelligent when it comes to solving things like chess problems or

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Antigrams, you know, so the chess is he playing chess. Well, or even go well is really little more than math

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's the ability. Well chess is  The ability to foresee and try the future chess is absolutely math

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's purely deterministic and computers win at chess with pure brute force  Though the thing that was interesting about go is you can't win with brute force because there's too many combinations  So you have to have some intuition about what a position means, but I'm I'm not convinced that that's still not essentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There but they're teaching themselves. That's that's what's interesting is the intelligence comes from teaching themselves and  There's this idea that you can train I mean  Being able to train a computer to recognize this on their own and work towards an outcome that you're asking it to work towards  That's actually pretty cool. I mean again, that's valuing one type of intelligence over another we could have just not impressed with the progress

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've made maybe that's really what I'm saying. Oh Leo  And and we you know, and this comes up with self-driving cars now, right?  because  that's a form of  What would you could is that can I say that's AI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Self driving cars. Yeah, I mean you'd say lots of things are a okay, but if you had level four

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  autonomy  That would be AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What people think of as AI if you give the car a goal and it gets there?  I guess so I can't level for which it what what is level force complete self-driving  Well, I thought that was level five. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Four-ish five-ish it's in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five is if you don't kill anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  5,000 miles, you know, it's just one of those  price of progress well what happened is we made a lot of remember the early days of the DARPA challenge, which is the  Autonomous vehicle challenge in the very early days, which was only what ten years ago. The cars barely got a few feet  They would just go drive right off the road  It very quickly they advanced very quickly  To be essentially self-driving all the way across the country within a decade  But I  Think that might have given us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  False hope that's what technology does though. I mean think about when you had your first I don't know your IBM  Selectrix and then suddenly you're moving. I mean technology seems  Clunky and not where you want it to be until suddenly you look around and you realize it is and that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That becomes invisible. Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's then that is not frightening any but I feel like we're far from that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know what I'm saying, but maybe it is a hockey stick, right?  Maybe it's it seems like we did we did a lot really fast and now we're just stuck  we're going through a phase of moral panic or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because we're scared and I don't say that we're scared. We're frightened of unknown outcomes  Jobs are affected right our society has changed all these things  We feel out of control and then I believe we get back in control and then we're okay the technology becomes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ubiquitous and and just part of life and meanwhile Google's selling DIY AI kits at Target

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ayy  I would say the technology and I'll just go back to this because this is near and dear to my heart  The technology got really good and now we're kind of in a space where we're trying to advance the actual underlying hardware and  software governing AI so we saw this huge epic leap in like 20 from 2012 to 2015 and  Facial recognition because we're like hey we can apply this to GPUs and  Then we got new ways to apply it to more cores on a GPU  so right now where we are is  Right now where we are is  We're now we've we've done all that work there now. We're trying to build new types of learning  self-learning models for computers and that's gonna  They're figuring that out and then once they've got that they're gonna have to figure out hardware optimized for it because this still does  Take a lot of computing power. So I  Don't think it's really a moral panic thing so much as it's like a we hit a technology wall and we're going there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know how I missed this AI why thing this is pretty cool from it is pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This for a while. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the idea well, but they started selling it in target which I think is right and they added a pie  It's cut. Yeah, so it's got there's two of them ones for sound and ones for  vision  The sound one has a raspberry pi zero  The vision one has a raspberry pi 2  You could literally build your own intelligent speaker and experiment with voice recognition. So how much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Expertise do you have to have in what area to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, see that's an interesting question. They they I think they're pushing it as a step part of a stem program, right? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think anyone can actually do this you you have to have it. What's your coding? You're not writing any code  You are actually working through some code, but it's they they show it to you  So you can I don't know if you can cut and paste or if you just it but it's not hard it. Yeah  But it gives you start in the the voice one's been around for a while the  The other one is newer. I believe the computer vision one. Oh, I see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this also this just ties it so I see one of the examples here you showed was was  Picturing an Apple and it's giving their probability. So that's good. So this is a this is a way to get into all of Google's pretty  tremendous  tremendous  Apis and  And I want to see how to teach my journalism students to tie into these things. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Either for fifth graders or journalism students. You probably could do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But not us we are too  I think you should get one and make it a little I will you know what? Let's order it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's or I'll go to Target sport  Yeah, no, I will buy this but I bet it isn't too hard and it really is up to the teacher or the professor  To add the content that would make it more about AI and more about what's involved and stuff like that  but at least you got all the hardware and you can interact with it and write code and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do it yourself project for STEM education ideal for teens. You're right, Stacy. That's what it says on the one you on the buy page  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well  they had put it out for kind of the hacker community about a year ago because we looked at it on the show because people are  like, ooh cool, but um, I  Don't think it did super well there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we should have a joy detector point the vision kit towards someone's face  Ask them a smile ask them a smile really big as can make a frowning face  And then of course, they've already pre-programmed it with a machine learning

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they steal their photo and send it to the to us while you're at it. What could be the harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Please I  Love it. She's working with a Chromebook on this too, which is interesting. Yeah, we need we need the new Heath kit  This is kind of the new Heath kit. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Oh, I love it. It's a cardboard  It's got that Google, you know ethos  What is your cardboard?  They make stuff. Yeah, I did Heath kits. Sure Heath kits. What is a Heath kit? Oh my god happen again  Oh my god, I have to drink now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no now you can tell you the rest of your audience who are maybe not as  Old as we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was it was a great do-it-yourself built build a radio  Build a guy get all the parts and the instructions. Yeah  Yeah, this is all hardware stuff, you know build a ham radio that's the that's the ultimate Heath kit thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, I built a radio with my dad. Yeah, there you go. Maybe it was a heat. It's probably a heat. Yeah  in fact our  Guys at the  Ham nation show the hams have their own it's very much a Heath kit build your own am ham transmitter  It's called the pine board computer  If you go to Bob Hiles site, Hiles sound  calm  You can read about it. Click the ham radio section. Let me scroll down a little bit here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just put in an image from an old Heath kit catalog

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is as Heath kit as it gets in fact, it even has to have a warning  Don't touch this it could kill you  And it has they had they sell the parts he danger high voltage that makes it exciting for kids and they have the circuit  diagrams and you make and you build it you build everything and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at the look at this link I sent you it's just too beautiful. It's an old catalog

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These were that these were the days weren't they? This is memory American radio history

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Make a phonograph make it make a shortwave radio. That was what I always wanted to build a shortwave radio  Yeah, but you could literally but build your own  Mediterranean oak cabinet television for a hundred nineteen dollars nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at this. See long. It's just great. So Stacy you weren't born when this came out 1969, but  There's a DW nurse president Heath kit  Why do millions build Heath kit electronics this was 1969 this does

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? This feels like 1949. I know it does doesn't it but the TVs are a little more advanced than that  They got a color TV. Look at that  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

That's like when you do security now, that's a predominantly one-way conversation  Wow, this is this is the best thing I've ever seen this  Tools and accessories for kit building goes on forever, too. Yeah, these are the but this is only 1969  That's what kind of blows me away  in  1976 a few years later my college  Roommate was building a kit computer in his dorm Wow  He'd grown up building Heath kits  So yeah, it was this was right before the digital era began  Kind of the end of the line  And you could even build your own laboratory instrumentation I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still had until two weeks ago  I still had a store near me where you could go in and buy, you know resistors and capacitors and  And special kinds of plugs and cables. It was all this electronic stuff. I don't know how they say this  Well, he didn't say business. They just they just closed all these years who was going in buying resistors

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  how halted just closed in us in  San Jose, which was the place for that stuff and really really yeah  And do you ever go to weird things?  No, they just closed the weird things a warehouse in San Jose somebody just bought it. I  Think I missed or I'm sorry weird stuff. Pardon me  weird stuff warehouse  Was purchased by the outback equipment company and they sold all their assets and it's gone  Since all the weird stuff. Yeah, it was just like I mean it was components. It was it was the best stuff ever  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could still buy like components and such it fries though, right not really not like that not really not what it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's a place still in Palo Alto that you can go  On 4th Street where you can go in and you could buy one a resistor or a diode  Okay, but halted I I don't I don't I think halted went away went out of business too, which was I won the seventh grade

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really my dad was a paleontologist  Really professor thereof right? Yeah. Yeah as a professor thereof. That's right  And my mom was an ecadisiologist  What's that?  Grasshopper  Grasshopper a learn to code app from Google's area. Now we're talking software. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know I was I was excited by this because it felt like dual lingo for coding. It's JavaScript, right? Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So actually if you go to grasshopper code, let me do that grass  Hopper code you can see it directly  Learn to code for free. I  Guess it's a it's an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an app. I'm installing it right now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Welcome to grasshopper the coding app for beginners best way to start your coding adventure with fun quick games on your phone  This is Google's response to Swift Playgrounds  Teach you to write real JavaScript moves move through progressively challenging levels as you develop your abilities  Then graduate with fundamental programming skills for your next step as a coder

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's so cute

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is really neat area what accredited area 120. Yeah, that's a Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  incubator or what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that kind of their secret place?  Their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like people who have cool ideas and let's build crazy new stuff. It's their crazy new stuff thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does Google still do the 20% time thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't know it's 120%

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are tests in this you guys, of course, there's tests by the way, I'm still waiting to receive my final grade  But I did complete my my online class in coding  Which I would actually highly recommend which language  It's a big it's a student language specifically designed for teaching  Good coding habits and they don't tell you but it's really it's really based on this. So I just had some folks in from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google  Amp talking to a bunch of product and audience people here at CUNY  It's where I'm here all day and the argument was made at the end of day that we should be teaching students to write and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a way to make them make no how self-serving is that that is no, I think it was actually somebody else the room. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well tell that tell them no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although is Google bringing with the new email  I don't know if we want to talk about this yet  But the gmail update is that I read something about bringing the amp to gmail is yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard a bit more about that today. Yeah, and it's it's really basically you can't do JavaScript that kind of stuff in  Gmail it's a way to make gmail responsive. I mean email and gmail responsive and updated has have any of you gotten that yet?  No, but I got my inbox has a new feature called highlights  Highlights for children you have new highlights. Oh  What are the highlights are they inbox highlights important new email so you can read them first?  How they decide what's important whom you email  Or your my personal was my is my app is my it's my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cheese, oh, it's your apps account. Okay. Yeah, cuz I'm like, is it your regular gmail or your apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks at which emails are you open which you reply to keywords that are any mails you have already read

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's learning from what you use what you do. That's nice. How is that different than the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Priority yes, thank you that yeah, I don't know cuz basically well because I use inbox  It separates out updates from low priority from social and all that and then everything else that's left over is supposed to be  Important, but now there's important important

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But someone just wrote a story about I think it was kill Google killing inbox  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so that would be bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be bad. Maybe it was a reddit. So this is a reddit post  But then I swear somebody just did a story, but maybe it was based on this thread

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reddit is Google stopping it  Development it asks is Google inbox stopping development submitted one year ago. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, here's the here's the article what that's from Android Central. Yeah, I don't know how we  Yes, so it sure looks like yeah. Yeah. No, that's link bait. I hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was on this very show. You hated it was frightened to death  Scared me and you've changed your your tune. I live love you to Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so this new gmail I guess is something like that on steroids maybe  Well, I thought it was just a DUI. I didn't realize there were gonna be new features. That's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried to go to gmail and took me to inbox. Oh  That's interesting. I heard you talk  Like but there's still there's a link on inbox to gmail  Still the same  What looks old-fashioned to me now? I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you use my gmail I don't use inbox I tried to use it for a while and it just didn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got you got even more freak than I was as I remember you just you were like, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what? I stopped using gmail entirely. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just just so contrarian  Are you already Miguel? Let me guess Leo you're using you Dora

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no pine is a client. I do use pine, but that's not  Fine is a client. That's not the server. I use fast mail, which is a nice IMAP paid IMAP service  And I actually I like it. I can't show it because it's got all my email it but I actually like it a little bit better than  Gmail part of it really it's not gmail's fault part of the reasons  I stopped a couple reasons I stopped using it one is it's not true  I map but the other is because my email address at gmail  Which was simply laporte at gmail.com turns out to be so generically French that I was getting huge amounts of French spam  In fact, I still in the middle of the night every night. I get some fake French account  On my hangout saying  Because they think I'm French and then I think there were a lot of reports like people would  Write, you know Antoinette space laporte at gmail.com  So I was getting people's confirmations and tickets and also how does fast mail get rid of all that?  I don't get because it's not laporte gmail. I use my whole life. Right, of course  I'm not laporte gmail anymore. So what I should probably do is this darned address at  No, exactly. I don't use a real address but but I do use Leo at Leoville, which has been my address for 15 years  But that just forwards to whatever so what used to forward to goop gmail  For the spam filtering and then go from gmail to fast mail  And then I realized I don't I eliminated the gmail and actually spam went down because gmail was generating more spam than it was filtering  Just kind of a kind of annoying  Do you want to see my final student project? Yes  It's a space invaders it's not it doesn't have any sound  I'm just shooting bad guys as they come down from the sky  But you would think this was as trivial but it was eight hundred and eighty nine. Oh, no, don't let him land Leo  Oh, I lost

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's it. I hope I get an a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's actually really fun I'm really enjoying I like coding but I'm gonna download this grasshopper I  Pro I've programmed for years. This is kind of me. It's kind of it's like when a native Chinese speaker takes Chinese  It's just not really fair  By the way that happened to me in college and it was really annoying  Yeah, they come in there it's they're rattling off Chinese I'm going me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a difficult language how I feel when I go to Germany and see a see a three-year-old

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you speak German pretty well, don't you? No, I don't know  You just give the impression you could say like so and so stress fast  Why why why does Google Google Maps now give directions based on fast food locations  Okay, that's awesome. I think it's I think it's any I think it's a lot of different kind of locations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's the Grubhub local angle to this so this woman tweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Google Maps instructed me to turn right after Burger King  hashtag mind blown  Then Scott tweets Google Maps told me to make a right right after White Castle  This really happened in the Bronx  Elizabeth writes Google Maps told us to turn left at Taco Bell. We were so good. Oh, you drive into Taco Bell

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's actually good. Is it really an egg or is it an egg product? That's my question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that. It's got a yolk on it. It's an egg. It's a suspiciously

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  symmetric yolk  That's by the way, do you know that right that a lot of places don't use real eggs in their eggs  You know, they have an egg product they pour out of a little carton  Yeah, well, but it's no I don't know but I mean fast-food eggs are often not from a actual egg

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm telling you this is actually pretty good

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey's so disgusted. All right, we can go we can go back to Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boys

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's kind of shocking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right  So anyway, so so Google will tell you to turn left at the Taco Bell after you drive into the Taco Bell  Then it'll give you this did you see the ad for Taco Bell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, will it that is that is not what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I want you know what I want though I want to say I have go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's moral panic. I was gonna say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's ad panic marketing panic. I want to say find me the nearest Starbucks on the way. I  Wanted that feature for ages. Well, the next exit is ten miles off the exit, but the exit after that  It's like two miles off the exit. I wanted to give me

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Choices it doesn't do that. Just don't go to the Starbucks. What is it?  May 9th when they're all closing to for  How not to be prejudiced

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, wait, wait, I want to talk about this Google thing because it's actually useful. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then we can talk about Starbucks. I'm gonna I'm gonna while you're doing that  I'm gonna find the video that a viewer sent us of of you punching me. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes  Okay, but what Google's doing is there this is basically to make your direction sound more like people actually give directions  Which is like turn left at the Burger King or the bank and I just think that's useful because I can never tell my right  From my left so and I'm really bad with landmarks. So I'm very excited. That's all  That is all I think this is nice  and yes, they could they could do a hell of job marketing things but  So the data they have there  Well, they have all that data from Google and they have street maps. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have the weirdest thing with Google Maps  It puts my house four houses back on the road and doesn't recognize where my house is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that like does it show you in your house at the wrong place

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it says when you're in your house. Does it four houses early? It says welcome. Well, here's the problem  I have I try to set it up so so that that's a trusted location. It won't do it  It doesn't recognize that part of the earth. I'm in a black hole. I don't exist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you does that work for you? I don't know you should try it  Because that's a real problem. Jeff. I'm sorry you do that. It is a real problem. Can you do it in Google Maps?  Yes, you can but what is it someone help me out here I'm just gonna start

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gibberish you can't you can't you have to do it from what three words and then it sends you to Google Maps with a GPS  Coordinate, but don't Google created one. Oh Google has their own. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but it's like really obscure  It's like weird. It's like we played with it on the show. Yes  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I was trying to help you out Jeff, but you can correct Google Maps. Can't you you can I think there's a way

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know how in that case to say you say I don't exist, but here's where I exist. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mean this is actually this is the flip side that you always argue like think about data collection Jeff  You talk about this a lot. There are so many good uses of data collection  You could create principles around that so maybe you collect satellite data for  Like that could be used for nuclear disarmament or something, but you wouldn't do it for  Targeting people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They these people have actually had accidents like somebody like somebody had two cars in their front lawn and I mean  Those are actually like if this happened in a city  Your city would actually install speed humps or something to well, that's a response McGill's response is we'll do it if the city

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Restricts it  But until the city does something we're not gonna do it. I think they're they're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  One of those super stretches trying to go down Baxter Street and bottoming out so there's there's problem number one  It is fairly steep. This is from 1937. That's fairly steep  In fact, it was in the Little Rascals. Here's something else Stacey won't remember. No  1930s Little Rascals, you're not old enough to remember either Stacey  They had a derby race down that street in the 50s automobile manufacturers sent new models up the slopes of Baxter Street  So show how powerful their new engines were  More recently Baxter set the stage for legendary skateboarder Don Noogie Nguyen  Wens  Incredible run which went viral last year. You want to watch his his bomb hill drop  If you have vertigo  You might not want to watch this. This is from Thrasher magazine. I do you know me bridges Noogie's hill

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that is you know, it's great up the hills of San Francisco at Tesla

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really it's easy peasy cuz yeah Stacey  You know this if you press the brake a little hard it puts it on the emergency brake  It just locks and you can take your feet off the pedals and sit there and then because there's so much torque in it  And you just put the accelerator down you just go up  Yes, that's how I slammed through a fence. Thanks to my pedal error

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So much  Recently  No, this happened like a year and a half ago  This is why I all this is why I say all the Tesla's you see them all like going through windows and stuff and it's because  When you mess up you really mess up you really mess up big time  You got you got a lot of torque

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's hard and fast, yeah, you're going you're going fast when you when you mess up so is Tesla in trouble or not  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's good news

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They just announced that they're gonna go to 24-hour production for the model 3 and they're gonna be able to do. What is it?  6,000 a week. Oh  I was talking about the NTS

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this whole thing over the self-driving car. Yeah, I'm like god  They're kind of you know, you don't get in the shooting war with Tesla

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're kind of you know, you don't get in the shooting war with government agencies, you're not especially

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially after you've had multiple accidents. It doesn't look the optics aren't good

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I and I really I agree they should not call it  Autopilot it really and it shouldn't be treated as an autopilot  It should be treated as kind of fancy cruise control with lane change capabilities or something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't sell as well that doesn't fit on the little dash

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but when you buy a Tesla you understand that there's some hyperbole involved they call the air filtration system the bio  And it has a big biohazard logo on it  It's part of the fun of being a test and it's called insane mode and ludicrous mode  You should understand there's a little bit of hyperbole going on with the marketing. It doesn't work. So what with lawyers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and it doesn't work well with everybody I mean you tell somebody that they can keep their hands off the wheel  They're gonna keep I mean  Driving for many people is very boring. Here is here is David Letterman

She'll be able to eat it'll be fine  Uh  Android p we were talking a lot about this on all about android earlier this week  Looks like android might be copying iphone 10  with the gestures  And you know what?  I'm happy if they do because the gestures in the iphone 10 are actually the best thing  About iphone 10 is a very natural way of moving around new navigation bar  Similar to the iphone 10 with a swipe up gesture to reveal the multitasking ui instead of the recents button

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, so we get the how can they get rid of the recents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You swipe up instead  Oh, I see it's very natural now. I hope they have the best thing about the iphone the absolute best thing  Is instead of even worrying about recents you just swipe along the bottom to go to the previous app  Just like that. It's very natural  See how natural that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just I want to see because sometimes I get up with 20 apps running. I just want to see what they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you can still do that. That would be the theory is you would be able to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Well, how do I how do I get to all of the apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, google's presentation may look different than this. Yeah, right  But the idea is you get to all the apps by on iphone by swiping up  You see a little bit and so that's what they're thinking that this is all from pre-release android p stuff  We know we're gonna find out  Google i.o is three weeks away exactly three weeks away hard to believe  Three weeks away  Uh, I will be I will have just come back from vacation  Uh, we will be doing I think we're you've been contacted. I hoped are we moving twig? I think we are  Oh, I didn't know this because i'm going i'll be at i.o. I didn't know this either  Well, okay. So the problem is that microsoft build is the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The build keynote monday morning and then in the afternoon we're doing windows weekly normally right before this show on wednesdays  Right, uh tuesday is google ios keynote. So we'll be doing that movie there, which means we'll move  ios today and mac break weekly to wednesday in the  Traditional windows weekly slide, but I guess this won't affect twig will it so we'll do twig on tuesday  Twig will be on tuesday. I'm being told  It's so funny. Usually when you say i'm being told you're listening in your ear  In order for me to be told anything. I have to take my ears out  What why'd you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I have these

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ceiling here will be tuesday afternoon. Oh see now it's in my ear  Tuesday afternoon so tuesday maybe so why are we doing that because we could do it on uh, it's normal time couldn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could well you want to be close to the uh, oh we'll be closer to the keynote closer to the keynote  I'm gonna be on a plane on wednesday when y'all are recording. How about tuesday?

Transcript:  You look like you were upset. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't mind yawning. I yawn all the time. You can yawn. You don't have to cover your mouth. Yeah  Yes, you do. So google has I mean tesla has now been so  Inflammatory to the ntsp that they've been banned  from the crash probe  And then after that well so I this the sequence of stories is crazy like  They they were dueling with one another tesla. I think tesla's being a little unfair to the guy who got killed in the crash  Saying things like well, he didn't have his hands on the wheel for six seconds. You tell me stacey  My experience with autopilot is it's doesn't have any magic sensors in the wheel that knows when your hands on there  You actually have to jerk the wheel a little bit so I can have my hands  On the wheel the whole time and it says put your hands on the wheel so I actually have to go  Just to let it know is is that your experience or does it know your hands are in the wheel if they're just lightly resting there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, my tesla is so old. It does not have autopilot. You don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think this is a little unfair and certainly tesla knows this  Um, the guy could easily have had his hands on the wheel  Now the question is why he didn't notice that the tesla was veering into the guard rail as it had done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before and he observed before like i've driven other people's cars with autopilot and  At some point you're like well i'm gonna decide to trust this because it's worked in the past mistake  So I can see how you could be like, oh, oh, oh, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's really unseemly of tesla to put out public press releases saying  Well, he didn't have his hands on the wheel. He wasn't paying attention. That is not nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like imagine if that were your dad. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I and I think this is why ntsb says look, you know what? Uh, really it said the quote from the ntsb  Releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation  And incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a class of a crash  And that is why we're revoking tesla's status as a party in the probe  They too many public releases and I think that's completely appropriate tesla is going to plan  It's now going to file a complaint with congress  In the next few years contending that it's in its own statement the ntsb is quote more concerned with press headlines and actually promoting safety

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually think going after the ntsb is kind of a jerk is kind of an odd move because  out of all of our public agencies  They're actually pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not hated by anybody. Well, and as as this article from nbc points out tesla has really been  Blaming the driver  Yeah  So and come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we we will watch with interest I mean  Look as somebody who uses autopilot a lot i've had the experience of the car pulling into obstacles putting it pulling into in particular construction  road division if it can't see the lanes and  You grab the you know, you're holding the wheel and you pull it the other way you say nope and you disengage  And i've disengaged my autopilot my tesla numerous times family think of you using autopilot lisa refuses to use it  And she doesn't like it when I use it  but now but I will say I believe it's safer because uh, I I think that momentary inattention is less likely to cause a crash  And that that can be a problem as you as you're a driver, especially on long distances  I love on highways. I turn it on I pay attention keep my hands on the wheel  But it's just one more way i'm avoiding running into the guy ahead of me because because it won't do that  Staying in the lane even you know, if my attention wanders or whatever  It's just help  You shouldn't rely on it  But it's but it's a very helpful tool and I think it makes me a safer driver  I feel more safe behind the wheel, but that's because I also pay attention. You can't you can't  You can't let you can't say oh the car's driving. I'm gonna read a book. You can't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I could pay attention if I weren't actively driving. I think that would be fear is a remarkable motivator

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh cruise control. I hate cruise. Oh, well, you wouldn't like this. This is just i'm not a huge cruise control fan either  This is cruise control and steroids. I use it even in traffic. I love it  But i'll tell you why it's great is stop and go traffic cruise control on the tesla and many new model vehicles  Uh will stop and go  So it maintains a safe stopping distance. It maintains speed it does I I mean  I've never had a problem with it not seeing the car in front of me  So that's a really great way of kind of you don't have to keep your foot on the accelerator going back and forth brake accelerator  Brake accelerator, you could take your feet off the pedals still paying attention  And it will automatically keep a safe safe stopping distance and and speed up and slow down appropriately and stop and go traffic  That's I think huge  So I am not against tesla's stuff. I just don't I think that  They should probably be at greater pains to remind people it is an autopilot  And uh, and people should learn if you've got it don't don't you know, don't let it do the driving you're still driving  Meanwhile waymo has requested and received permission  This is not a timely announcement  From the california department of motor vehicles to take the safety driver out of their cars  And drive fully autonomously at starting on the streets of mountain view where google is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought they already were doing that. I guess they had a safety driver

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They still have a safe driver now those chrysler minivans will be  Powering around town

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With nobody are they still driving those little funny looking little things are minivans. These are chryslers

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if you're a pedestrian in mountain view just word of warning you might really want to look both ways carefully  Yep  Because before jaywalking well, here's my here's my concern  They talked waymo was you know said immediately. Oh, you see uber they have a disengage  What was it every 13 miles? We only have a disengage once every 5600 miles a disengage means the safety driver took over  But once every 5600 miles means in this car without a safety driver once every 5600 miles. It's going to do something bad  That's not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or the human being was wrong and shouldn't have disengaged

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, maybe maybe that's their position is oh, no, that was a mistaken disengagement. Well, who knows?  I mean, I don't nobody denies cars drive better than humans already  But there are plenty of situations these self-driving vehicles are not ready for that the human has to take over  And I worry that in mountain view these cars will be plowing through those situations

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they do are there limitations on when you can't like during rainy or weird weather?  I'm sure there are yeah, let me look in certain hours. You can operate without a safety driver  I don't know. I mean we have to we have to get there if we want to actually create autonomous cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we have to get there when we're ready. We shouldn't we shouldn't push it  Only two companies have applied for such permits waymo and some other company  According to source familiar with the matter. This is the san francisco chronicle waymo plans to start testing near its mountain view headquarters  Over time it will expand the testing of autonomous cars with no backup driver notice they call it backup not safety  to more of the bay area  Uh the way most approach will be to extensively map a train by having vehicles with test drivers cover it first before using driverless vehicles  Uh, let me see we have a lot of confidence says john kraftchik ceo of waymo  That our technology would be robust and would be able to hand situate handle situations like the one in arizona

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See meanwhile, I want tammy joe schultz to be driving me wherever I go. Yeah, because tammy joe needs a job

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's a nice person

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know who tammy joe is. Oh, I was like who is tammy joe schultz. What tammy joe schultz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the amazing pilot nerve? Oh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yes, the southwest lady the southwest jet in first fatality since 2009 in commercial airline traffic  And it's right before I get on a plane

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm well, that's makes it statistically even less likely. Oh, yeah good. That's right. Oh i'm safer

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They got it out of the way. It's actually it's a tragic story. Uh, the southwest flight from new york to dallas  I had a catastrophic engine failure and I guess shrapnel from the engine pierced the window of the  plane and a passenger was  Partially sucked out the window straight out of a james bond movie

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, was that the person who died? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other passengers pulled her there were seven other minor injuries. The other other passengers pulled her back in  And she survived that but she died of a heart attack shortly thereafter  And but of course you're you're praising the pilot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who everyone praised that she was she was the sully of the sully of that's why I hope her nickname is schultz  Because it should be sully and schultz sully and schultz

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think partly the attention is because she's a female

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Commercial airline pilot and not only that she was um  Very early on as a fighter pilot. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice  So, uh, you want you want sally joe to drive your way. I want sally joe. I trust sally joe over uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any darn any of this technology  Uh planes mostly are drive-by-wire. They are that's true. Sorry. I'm like well actually jeff you're already there. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they don't leave it on all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, it depends. I mean they leave it on  A lot some of them leave it on for landings even now, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  What?  What the heck we're talking about wordpress not the sex compass the wordpress.com, which is my blogging  host  Uh, I love wordpress. I see more and more people using wordpress  Well literally 30 percent of the entire web uses wordpress. I've used wordpress practically since matt mullenwigan wrote it early in the 2000s  But for a long time I was hosting it myself, which was so I don't know why I was doing this  Because I spent you know, I was always kind of tweaking it and playing with it and the server not the content  I never put any content on there  And and I was paying more frankly to host my own copy of wordpress than to use wordpress.com when that light went on  And I realized I twigged if you were to the fact that I could save money  And they'd maintain it i'd always have the latest version i'd have all the plugins and i'd have the great support of the wordpress team  I I ran to wordpress.com and created uh moved my site there leo laporte.com  Make your site  Your own  Because wordpress.com gives you the freedom and the flexibility to share your voice your work your  Way, you don't need to be a coder. You don't need to be a designer  All you need to do is is have a something to say have a and want a place on the net  And by the way, this is your place. This isn't facebook's. It's not mark zuckerberg's place. It's not twitter's place  It's your place every business every human should have their own place on the net  The place people find when they search for your name, you don't want to let somebody else determine what they find you want to do that  Great customer support 24 7 monday through friday and on weekends, too  WordPress has great e-commerce now  This is nice ranging from a simple buy button to a complete online store and plan start at four dollars a month  I was crazy to be doing this. I don't know what I was thinking myself  Actually, I ended up getting the business plan because I get so many fabulous features including great plugins. It's htps. I get jetpack. I get  Uh the the amp plug-in so it speeds loading  on mobile  Really if you look at wordpress, you'll realize  30 why 30 percent of all the websites in the world want on wordpress and why I run on wordpress.com and steve gibson does and  Paul therotte does and everybody I know  wordpress.com gets started today with 15 off any new plan purchase  wordpress.com slash twig is the website  wordpress.com  Slash twig for 15 off your brand new website  I might i'm really pleased my daughter. I registered  When abby was born 26 years ago and henry was born 23 years ago  I registered abby laporte.com and henry laporte.com  And I got I bought I think I bought the 20 year which was expensive  It's like 200 bucks or something 20 year registration because I figured if they don't want it by the time they're 20  And they they still you know, but just the other day abby said, okay i'm ready to set up abby laporte.com. What should I do?  I said wordpress.com  And so stay tuned and I told I told her I think she she realized this  If you don't create your own website  Then when people search for your name, it's whatever other people have posted about you  She said I want to put like my my best work there my resume stuff like that. I said, absolutely abby  That's what everybody once you're 16  I mean  Take control of your online presence by having your own website.

Well, you were feeding information to cambridge analytical  Data was collected says cambridge analytical with the consent and limited to tens of thousands of facebook users  Facebook says well, yeah, but except that because of friends of friends 87 million accounts  All of the data was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exfiltrated to cambridge analytical. I want to know which of my friends took the sex compass quiz  That's that's what i want to find that out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never got notification that anybody  Did you have to go to a page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I thought it was just going to pop up. I thought so too  Now i'm not on facebook anymore. So I can't do this but you there's a page  What's the page you go to facebook?  Cambridge I have to look it up  Chat room, do you know?  Um  Have I been pwned? No. Yeah, have I been pwned how to check with facebook?  Go to a new help page  Um on the site  Obviously, I can't go there how to tell if my info was shared with cambridge analytical  Uh, you must log in first  But this is but see here's the interesting thing. This is just for that one quiz. This is your digital life  But now we know from the second whistleblower there were more  So, uh, I don't know what this page is jeff, but if you search for cambridge analytical on facebook you should find they're still there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No  They were banned cambridge analytical page on facebook. Oh lord. That's just their business page, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but they were blocked  Weren't they but they were just banned from using the data. They don't necessarily get banned from having an ad for data driven campaigns

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's nervy as hell no press is bad press

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's probably true  Facebook has thanks to gdpr remember we were  There was some thought that they weren't going to give you all the features that europe required  But then mark said in that phone call you were listening to jeff that they were and now they have announced  Uh new privacy controls worldwide based on gdpr  I know a lot of people are starting to download their facebook information, which is great  You can for instance turn off facial recognition now  I think that's new  you can uh, you can manage specially protected data in your profile such as religious  and political views  You have a lot more control. Yeah, here's the setting for face recognition  Do not allow facebook to recognize me in photos or videos  now  I imagine it's this is where i'm i'm going to have a little disadvantage of not having an account  I can't check but I would imagine that by default recognition is turned on you'd have to find it and turn it off  So  Facebook's also rolling out additional protections for teens  Uh young people between 13 and 15 in some eu countries need permission from a parent or guardian  To enable targeted ads or to add information like interested into their profiles  So facebook said teenagers in this age bracket will see a less personalized version of facebook awe  With limited sharing options until they get parental consent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good, yeah  So, I mean I I think  Having a conversation with people about like how their data might be used  I mean we have those conversations with our daughter all the time. You could say really this is a benefit of gdpr

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm mixed feelings about benefits. I have mixed feelings about generally about government regulation of of internet  But this is one where you could say there really are some we're lucky  gdpr exists

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, we'd be luckier if our own government would implement something like this at least let's see how it goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a new page jeff you can look at called access your information  On which you can further evaluate the information you've shared and manage it if you download the blob the 50 megabyte blob. There's really no  Rime or reason it's just a bunch of data. Although i've seen people already start to write python scripts to parse it things like that  Yeah  I that's the one thing I regret about getting rid of my facebook account. I would like to see that blob  I'd like to know what it knew  Is it is it dead? No, no, I deactivated  So it's still alive. I just I decided on the lester conian thing  So that for instance, I could turn it on download the blob and turn it off again, which I predict you will do  Oh jeff bezos put out his shareholder letter. Oh, we always enjoy that. That's a great read every should I go ahead stacy do a dramatic reading
