Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I really

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  had to narrow that down. You're my favorite middle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  child that was born in the spring.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I don't want the other guys  to be jealous. I do like doing this show an awful lot  and it's partly because of you, Jeff  Jarvis, the townite  center professor of the thingamajig  from the Craig Newmark Graduate School of  Journalism at the City University  of Newark.  Hello.  Hello.  And it's partly because of  Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IOT.  It's mostly because of Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff's room  is reversed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute, it is. Wait a minute.  What the hell happened here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is because I was  on Star Talk  earlier and I had to debunk  Filter Bubbles and I wanted to show the book.  Did I mess that up?  I did, didn't I?  I think the book is now backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, no, wait a second.  No, I reversed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my god, Stacey, I can't believe you noticed it.  How could you not notice it?  There you go. The French doors

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are on the left.  I didn't pay attention to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The French doors were there.  Holy cow, Stacey, you would be really  good at... You're observant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a reporter. That's my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  That's a special skill. That's for like  I spy with my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  little eye. I was about to say like  newspaper comic pages  and highlights magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Highlights for children. A useful skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're very good at that.  Anyway, welcome from Stacey on IOT.  The Stacey on IOT newsletter at  staceyoniot2.com and of course the podcast  Stacey on IOT.  And it's also because of this fella  here, Aunt Pruitt.  Hands on photography.  I don't know if I would have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  called that observant. Where I'm from  we call that nosy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh!  Bless your heart.  Just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just was called nosy by aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That hurts me in my heart.  There is a little something  and you two probably get it because Stacey, you're from  Houston and aunt's from South Carolina  and you probably get it because  there is a little kind of passive  aggressive thing going on in the  south. It's the bless your heart  thing, right? Oh yeah. Where you say something  nice but it's really  a little bit of a thrown little shade.  I've said it to you a couple  times. I know you have.  Don't think I didn't miss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're constantly nice and  rude. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll censor myself for John's sake  but I call that grin effing.  Grin effing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not quite

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so, I feel like it depends.  It's soft. Harsh?  But then there's also like  we notice that you are not meeting our standards  which is just kind of like  let's say you brought a grocery store pie  to the picnic. Yeah.  Exactly. You know. She brought a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  grocery store pie to the picnic.  Bless her heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you not have  enough time?  Were you rushed this morning?  Bless your heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But now see Jeff's  from New Jersey and in New Jersey  it would be what the hell you thinking,  bring a grocery store pie. What the hell you doing with that?  What do you think this is? I didn't think this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whole different vibe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just realized Leo  that the lower third and the  lighting behind you is the same blue  as the new Mustang. Yeah. Grabber

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  blue. So Jeff's  giving me a hard time because I was very  excited while I'm doing  Windows Weekly in the other studio. I have a  window outside. I'm looking outside.  And I see what I'm pretty sure  is a Mustang  Mach-E, the new electric vehicle  go by in Grabber Blue.  And it kind of really grabbed me because I'm waiting  for mine. So I immediately  after Windows Weekly ran across the  street took this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He has threatened people that if  the car comes in while he's on the show, he's gone.  It's our show then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know though, it's one of those things  life is so disappointing.  I'm sure you all understand this.  Where the anticipation  I don't know about that. Well tell me  you tell me. The anticipation of getting it  far outweighs  you know the minute I get in and I  drive off it's like, that's just a car.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, when I got my Tesla I loved that thing  for years. I still love it. Oh okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't say that. Okay.  Anticipation is great but depends on  what the anticipation is for.  Because some things it's just  I still enjoy sitting right  here and hitting these buttons to turn on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the camera. Yeah I'm not saying that.  In fact you know I always enjoy  travel. But I have to say  that often the case the planning  the anticipation, the leading right up  to the trip is  a lot of the excitement.  Once you're on the trip it's just you're living  your life. I haven't loved a car

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  since my Saab in  1990. Did it make you cry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or just Saab?  Your weekend's coming up,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Jammer B where's the rim shot?  There is a tie in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a tie in because Ford  and Google announced this week they've  signed a six year  deal for  connectivity in the car  and cloud services.  Ford did not say which vehicles  this will include  and I have a feeling that the  Mach-E which is new  is not quite new enough to take  advantage of this.  It's designed according  to CNBC to streamline  Ford's operations and accelerate  their 11 billion dollar  restructuring plan.  You know Ford has for the longest time  used QNX before that it used  Microsoft Car as their  operating system. It's not clear  whether they'll use  Android.  There's a Google version of Android  for automobiles.  I'm not sure that's exactly what's  going to happen. Under the deal, CNBC  says Ford and Lincoln Vehicles  will support Android,  the Google Assistant, Google  Maps and Google Play. This starts in  two years in 2023.  And they'll use Google's cloud  for other types of services  as an example  for enabling a system for sending  customer messages about maintenance or trade  and opportunities. Google  will also help  Ford use artificial intelligence  in areas like supply chain  logistics and manufacturing. So this is a big  tie up. Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I was going to check  and make sure because the first  thing my husband was like, so I have to  have a Google phone to drive a Ford car?  This has nothing to do  with what you're going to plug  your phone into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ford specifically addressed  this. It will still  well, that's a question. It will still support  both Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay  while driving.  So they said they're not  going to abandon that.  But I think it is  replacing Sync. The Mustang  I'm getting has Ford's latest  version of Sync which is kind of their UI  on top of  I think it's QNX, whatever real time operating  system they're using. As I said for a long time  it was Microsoft's platform  with Ford Sync on top of it.  So I'm not sure when  or how this is going to happen.  Yeah, years ago the company  used Microsoft software to power its Sync  in-car communication system.  But they switched to QNX which is from  Blackberry of all people in 2014.  In 2015  they committed to using Azure  Microsoft's cloud for software  updates and they signed a multi-year  deal with Amazon Web Services in 2019.  So unclear  if those relationships  have continued. They've tried everybody. Yeah, they've gone through everybody.  Interesting. I think  it's interesting from both  companies. It  sounds like a bigger relationship  than either of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it sounds like they're trying to  solidify or consolidate everything  from their back end cloud  stuff for the cars  into the user experience  stuff on the cars and then the underlying  QNX is  embedded and I guess  yes you could use Android but  most people chose QNX  because it is a true real-time operating  system and it's got a lot of security  benefits that Android  frankly  I don't really feel like it has.  So that's a question I have  on that just from a IoT perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so Android Auto  is like  CarPlay. It's a user interface  glossed on top of the screen  that interfaces  with your phone. There is also  Android for cars  which is an Android Automotive OS  and it's not  I don't know if that's  what Ford, they didn't use that  phrase Android Automotive OS.  Not clear  what the relationship is going to be around that.  You have, you know on a Tesla  it's one of the interesting things about Tesla  they do it all. They don't use anybody  else's operating system. It's Linux  they do all the software on top  of it. They don't even  integrate very well with  third party services like there's no  CarPlay or Android Auto  There's no Apple Music. You just got Spotify like a year ago.  Yeah, you just got Spotify.  So it's  more of a closed universe and I have to  say the cars that I've driven that have  Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. It's great  because your phone is always updated.  Those maps are much more  recent than any map that's built into a car.  So, although  for a while I didn't  But this sounds a lot like something no one will even

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  notice though with it being the  OS of the  car. You know a lot of people don't really  know. No, they don't care. All of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, ScooterX is saying yes, this is the quote  by leveraging Android Automotive  Ford will also be able to divert  significant software engineering talent from operating  system development to the creation of  Ford and Lincoln customer innovations.  So it sounds like they are replacing QNX  and Sync  And they're basically outsourcing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the operating system  and all of the underlying software  and focusing on it. That kind of makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let the software guys do software.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you believe they're going to make 9 million  dollars in revenue  off of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what they're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the Yahoo story there, the second one  says they'll get 5 million  profit, 9 billion revenue  off of  data subscriptions for  say entertainment or retail services.  From your car? Oh, this is Ford

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  getting this? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  9 billion. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is the money flow  is toward Ford, not toward Google.  That's interesting. Well, I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sure Ford is paying Google. But  let's think about it. So your car has a data  subscription, right? So  there's obviously some of that goes to  the carriers, but you're it's usually  offered through the car vendor,  not or the Ford, not  AT&T, for example.  If you  subscribe to a maps service,  because you could always  say to people, yeah, hey,  for  an easy map service, it's constantly  updated and has like something like Street View,  which is more data intensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pays 5. But that's in my phone. I don't  want to pay Ford for that. I already have it in my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  phone. I get that. I get that.  And some people are going to say I have it in my phone.  Some people are going to say, just put  it in the car. Like if I were buying it for my  mom, I'd be like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just here. This 9 billion dollars  is a complete back of envelope  calculation for Morgan Stanley,  who says, well,  we figure if each  there's 75 million vehicles on  the road with the Ford badge, if each  generated 10 bucks a month in subscriptions,  that would create 9 billion dollars in revenue  with a 55 percent pre-tax  margin that's 5 billion. It's completely  made up. And then if it drives to GameStop  on the way, Apple is in trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  each and every year. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if you think about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  though, like, okay, think about ML  services, right? So let's think about  insurance. If you have  this level of connectivity in your car,  you could actually, Ford could offer  you insurance in conjunction with someone  else and take a cut of that  revenue. They're already

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  doing that with the new Mach-E,  which is an electric vehicle.  They have deals with all the chargers  so that I don't have to give them a credit card.  The car  communicates with the charger, says, yeah, yeah,  this is Leo, charge it to his account.  So they're already doing those kinds of  deals. And I think that that's just the beginning.  And Ford even said, Jim Farley,  their new CEO, even said,  what we're looking at is ways to make,  just like Apple did,  revenue per customer, not  more customers, but revenue per customer. Yeah,  ARPU. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the deal on the Sirius  with an automaker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't  know. Most of them come, at least the cars  I've had lately, you know, you get six  months of Sirius and then  Sirius pesters you for the rest of your life  saying, why haven't you subscribed?  Why haven't you subscribed? Have  you heard of podcasts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't miss those messages at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sirius is annoying, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, but I think  that Sirius pays the automaker for the  marketing experience. Yeah, I bet you. Yeah.  So there's something there. Maybe there's  a spiff if they get you to subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it never gets me  excited.  Howard. I listen to Howard.  Oh, yeah. Howard.  Oh, Howard.  Anyway,  there's the Ford, the Ford story.  It's kind of an interesting story.  And that's, yeah, yeah.  And I'm even more interested because  there's a car outside with my name on it.  Okay, let's move on.  There's a lot of money going on right now.  Money talk. I don't want to become the money  talk show. All of our shows have  last week was GameStop, right?  This week, it's  it's Alphabet.  So Google had its earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, come on.  Yeah, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's had good earnings before. Revenue  up 23 percent, ad business showing  strong growth up 47 percent.  Google revenue was  fifty nine point fifty six point nine  billion.  Three billion more than more than three billion  more than the analysts predicted.  So, yeah, very positive.  But does that explain the Google stock  price? Holy cow, is it  up? Let me pull  up their ticker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why wouldn't it?  I mean, there's a lot of people  who have way more time at home  watching YouTube more  than they were before. Well,  they're trying to find a new tutorial  to get themselves a new skill or something  right now during this pandemic because they can't really  go back to work or just work on a  side hustle. So you're implying

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that stock prices have something to do  with the fundamentals  of the company. But  in my opinion, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Google's fundamentals are good.  They're excellent. Absolutely.  I mean, the ad market obviously  did great by them. And plus  they've got their signing and announcing  these crazy long deals like Ford  and no,  that was Apple. Anyway,  they're doing I mean, from a fundamentals  point of view. But can I point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  out? Google doesn't pay dividends.  So  the stock price isn't  how this we had this conversation  last week. I don't get how the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stock price. You say zero sum game. I'm just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to scream. No, but I don't.  The stock prices depend on  what people are paid for it. You know,  it's like a real estate market. The house is  worth whatever anybody will pay for it.  And since there's no dividend from  Google, you don't have any direct  link to Google's success or failure.  It's just what people pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's talk about Google's cloud services.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. I'm sorry. I brought it up.  I'm sorry. I brought it up. I was hoping you could explain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're losing less money.  How it's tied.  They're basically  so they their revenue  has gone up considerably.  They're at 13 billion. Last year, they were  at almost 9 billion.  And they're losing less money.  Based on that, like based  on the revenue. So that's good.  They are losing 5.6 billion.  But a lot of these deals,  they lose losing money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google. Google's losing money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are you talking about? Their cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, God, they're not. Their cloud segment hasn't been  competitive ever. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it's consistently lost  money. They're consistently making

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's losing less money.  They get it.  OK.  This may be this Ford deal will help. Right.  Yeah. Their Google  Cloud revenue, 3.83 billion.  Which is out of 56 billion.  So it's not a big part. Oh, I'm talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  annual results. So annual  annual. OK. For 2020, they earned  13 billion and they  lost 5.6 billion.  Wow. So.  But 2019, they made 9  billion and they lost 4.6 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I would buy some stock now.  They're losing money.  Especially after this Ford deal.  They're losing money slower.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Pichai,  Sundar Pichai said that they have  done  their deals that are over a quarter of a  million or quarter of, not a quarter of a million,  quarter of a billion dollars more than tripled.  So that's pretty good.  Go Thomas  Korean. OK.  OK. I'm done.  I'm trying to talk to you about money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  You just be difficult.  I'm trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  be difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's make it something fun.  Who would kill a business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you just are. OK. It's time to  take a break.  Our show today. I just am  difficult. Our show today is  brought to you by Melissa.  This is a company I know  and really appreciate.  Melissa is  a company that actually they started  and I think it was back  many years ago, 35  years ago, and it was probably at that time  correcting zip codes. Remember when the zip codes  first came out, nobody knew their zip  code and then there was the zip plus four.  Melissa has been doing that  for a long time.  And as the years have gone by,  they've added more and more capabilities.  Now you can verify  full addresses, emails,  phone numbers, and  names. And there you could  do it in real time. They're so fast. They have a global  address verification service that could  verify addresses for 240  plus countries and territories.  And they can do it as  you enter it. So you've probably  experienced this, whether you're on a form  and you're starting to enter it and it says, you mean this?  Melissa. Or  if you're a customer service rep, you know,  it's so easy to accidentally  type the wrong zip code or transpose  street numbers.  Melissa fixes it. They make sure your data is  accurate and current. And that's  important in any business. You want to reach the right customers.  You don't want to waste money sending  mail to the wrong address.  Their tools  are going to save you money. They're going to make  sure your customer data is good.  And customer data goes  bad even after it's entered. In fact,  around 30% of customer data goes bad  every year. So there's  the real time, Melissa, that will help  you with the data entry. And then there's an ongoing  relationship with Melissa that makes sure your  data is accurate as time goes  by. You can even add customer  demographic information to your records.  Public information like property,  mortgage data, marital status, social  media handles. So you can know  your customer better. You can interact  with them better. Melissa has completely  flexible deployment options. Whether  it's on-prem, there's a web  service you can use. They have secure FTP  processing. You upload a database.  You download the clean database.  Software as a service.  You can choose the best way to meet  your particular needs.  And of course, Melissa treats  every bit of data  carefully. It's so important  that the data is secure.  They continually undergo independent  security audits to reinforce  their commitment to data security, privacy,  and compliance requirements. Melissa has  the utmost dedication to your data security.  They implement strong controls and safeguards.  When processing your data, SOC2  HIPAA GDPR compliant,  trust Melissa to be your foundation  for data-driven success.  Melissa is a great company  too. They're supporting communities  and qualifying essential workers  during COVID-19.  See if your organization qualifies for  six months of free service. You can apply online  Melissa, M-E-L-I-S-S-A  dot com slash  tweet.  So don't put up with sour  customer contact data.  Try Melissa's APIs in the developer portal.  It's easy to log on, easy  to sign up and start playing in the API  sandbox 24-7.  In fact, right now you can get started  with 1,000 records cleaned for free. Just  see how it works at Melissa  dot com slash tweet.  M-E-L-I-S-S-A, Melissa dot com  slash  tweet.  Let's see.  Yeah, I mean, it was a good  quarter for Alphabet.  Their stock went up a lot.  What else?  Stadia though, not such a good  news cycle for Stadia.  They have announced that they are going to shut  down their independent  game studio.  Jade Raymond, who they brought in  with great fanfare. She's a very well  known game developer from  some of the biggest game platforms  is out.  Had you played any Stadia games?  Well, I don't, had they  released any of their internal games? I don't  know. I played, yes, I played Cyberpunk  Yeah, I don't  I don't know what they...  But I don't know which ones were  theirs.  That's a historically very  difficult thing to do. It's very expensive to develop  games. It's a very hit  driven industry and a lot of them flop.  Takes years to  do it. They brought in  Raymond is a veteran producer who  created Assassin's Creed.  So they brought in  heavy hitter, but boy  they didn't give her a lot of time.  Less than a  year. I'm trying to remember when they hired her.  Though the service is going to  continue, as is the  $10 Stadia Pro service.  They're going to continue to offer games. I have to  say though, it must shake people up who are  invested in Stadia. I'm a  I have a Pro membership.  I don't use it that often.  The advantage of Stadia is the games run on their  servers. There's a lot of companies doing this now  including Microsoft. And you  can run it on low or inexpensive hardware  like a Chromebook or an Android  phone, even though it's a very high end  game because all the work is being done on the servers.  That is going to continue.  The disadvantage Stadia has  compared to something like GeForce Now, which is another  competitor or Microsoft's xCloud, is  you buy the game from Google  and you don't have a copy.  You can't play it anywhere else.  And so when anything  I think that happens that's shaky to  Stadia that concerns people at Stadia is  going to really, I think  impact them  going down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's plain that being a disadvantage  because you don't have a copy.  What's the difference between buying it  and buying it? If Stadia goes out of business

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what happens to your game? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You spent 30 or 60 bucks on something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the same could be said for the likes of Steam.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean  you download the Steam game now you're  playing it on your computer. You have it.  I guess if Steam went offline  maybe it wouldn't  do any piracy  check or something. But you have the game.  Save it with Microsoft. You buy the game.  You own the game. In this case  you own the game but it's through  Google.  With GeForce Now for instance  you can play your Steam games on  GeForce Now. You can play your EA games  on GeForce Now. So you buy  the game in a normal fashion  but you can play it on your Android device through  the GeForce Now servers.  It's a little weird if  you're a Stadia  with Stadia. It's a little different situation.  We were talking about this on Windows Weekly.  Maybe if Google decided  to pull the plug on Stadia  they'd give  somebody else the game so you  could play it with them.  I don't know. The thing is it's the maybe that's concerning.  If you're going to spend 60  bucks on Cyberpunk 2077  and you can only play it on Stadia  and Stadia starts to look shaky  that seems concerning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah.  Now I see the picture.  I have that trial  whatever. I guess I still have a pro account.  I probably should look to see if I'm charged.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're paying 10 bucks a month for nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I play that thing  just sort of here  and there. I've played that Destiny  2. Yeah. Even though I never even  knew what Destiny 1 was and it was pretty  fun. It's a good game. I'm playing the F1  game and it's really hard.  My only problem with the Stadia  service is I would definitely  have to run some type of ethernet cable down  to the TV because of the  latency and the performance of it.  From an internet standpoint it's a problem.  That's what makes me just  turn it off and find something else to do  like a podcast to listen to or something else to  watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I think that that's what's interesting  about all of these things is  who are they aimed at? If you're a hardcore  gamer you probably  have a gaming PC and you're buying  the games if you're serious or a console  and you're serious. So  it's offering  these hardcore games to people like you  and me who are casual  gamers. I don't know what kind  of business that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when I thought about the whole ethernet  wifi  I was having, Hardheads  they play, well one of them, he plays Xbox  and it's wireless  and he never complains about performance  issues from the  internet, you know, dropping packets  and whatnot. But maybe  it was just the whole Chromecast Ultra  in addition to wifi for me  that made a difference with  performance. But I said  no I can't deal with this. I'd much rather  be sitting at this desk with  an ethernet cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's the question. Who's  going to pay 60 bucks for a game but isn't  a serious gamer? So that was  always kind of the question mark on this.  And then I think it really just  adds to the overall feeling that Google  just kills stuff, right?  They're not killing Stadia  but they're killing their independent  Stadia development team.  And I think that sends a signal to people that  yeah maybe this isn't a long term thing.  I think it just hastens the  end of the line for Stadia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh I didn't realize  they weren't killing Stadia. Oh yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  see? That's exactly my point.  They're not! Third party games,  cyberpunk, I'll still be able  to play that. It's just they were developing  they had an in-house game development  team and they were developing their own  games. And so it's not  they're not going to do that anymore.  But that's exactly the problem.  There's people who will say oh I guess they killed  Stadia, that's one. And then people like  well a lot of people  are saying ah man now I'm wondering  what the future of Stadia holds.  I have a feeling this is not  a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing. What is Google  not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not killing? Advertising.  So search ads  and Android. Yeah search ads,  YouTube and YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That department there that  you can say they'll keep Stadia around just  a little bit longer because they're sort  of stopping the bleeding right?  A little bit longer, not much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just what you want to invest  in as a company that's sort of stopping  the bleeding. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well the other thing is  in this business exclusives  are important to selling a platform. So the  exclusives that PlayStation  brings to the PlayStation 5 sells  the platform. If that's a game  you want to play, well you got to buy it.  Xbox has not so many  exclusives but it's widely considered  that's an important part of  any console is these  exclusives. It's one thing that Amazon's  Luna which is a similar  offering, GeForce Now,  Xbox Cloud from Microsoft, PlayStation  Now don't offer exclusives.  Google was gonna.  Not anymore.  I think Google works really well.  Google got a lot of attention for Cyberpunk  2077. It was the only place you could really play  it. You couldn't play it. It didn't work on  consoles very well. Oh that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't it PlayStation that had a big  mess about that game? Yeah they had to give refunds.  Have to refund everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So.  And people aren't able to get GPUs  for their home gaming PC.  So there was an opportunity there.  But.  I know there's an interesting article in The Verge  which probably lent some  credence to Stacey's point of view.  Sean Hollister writing, the writing's on  the wall for Google's stadium.  But they point out  that Google's  never released Stadia sales or subscriber  numbers so it's unclear how well they're doing.  But Sean says, I'm wondering  if today's announcement tells us everything we need to know.  Google launched Cyberpunk  2077, the hottest game  of the year on Stadia.  The Verge called Cyberpunk  a make or break moment  for Stadia.  It worked on Stadia  but it didn't work in other places.  But he's wondering, did Google  look at Cyberpunk's game sales?  Grimace and wonder if a future  Google produced game could do any better.  And that might be  well, you know, was the time  it would explain the timing of killing their own  independent offering. It's millions  of dollars to do these games and it's a long shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does Stadia see  the year 2022?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to, you want to lay some money on that?  Yeah, yeah, let's play some bets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  see the year 2022? I think your bet to be better  will Leo lose weight in 2022  and it could be a safer bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, then the question is, will Stacia  invest in you? Yes, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably. If I gave you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a dividend. I invest three  hours every week. That's a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  investment. I know that's more than  let's look at it that way.  Let's not forget that.  Want to hear about Scissors? Yeah, what is  Scissors, editors and the  this is the more of the Australian  story. What is this?  I hear the scissors. Are you cutting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in here? I was doing my research for my  Gutenberg book and I came across some really  fascinating stuff in a book. Do I have it  here? Yes, I do. The St. Paul

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Globe, 1886.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will Slaughter's  Who Owns the News? A History of  Copyright. That's the kind of fun stuff I do.  Yeah. But it's actually a good  book. So  as you may know,  the  1792 Postal Act of the  US, I'm sure you have memorized,  enabled newspapers to send each  other exchange copies of their  newspapers for free through the mail.  No cost at all. Nothing. What?  Why would they do that?  Because the point was to encourage them  to share each other's news. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it was a scam set up by that  Ben Franklin feller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there's that.  So the newspapers  employed what they called scissors  editors. That was their job, was to cut  up the other papers and  either a column of news, okay, here it is,  and they'd put it in. And it was fine with everybody  because everybody copied everybody else.  So you didn't hire

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  reporters. You didn't hire reporters.  You hired that too. Oh, you had some  of your own, but you also... For your local stuff.  This was before there was  AP and... Before there was...  1792. Was it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  1792? 1792  Postal Act, right? So newspapers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  were not covered in copyright at all.  And Slaughter  says that probably wouldn't have made any  sense to  Congress to have done so because  that's the way news was spread. It was a policy  decision that it was good for  the democracy and the public conversation  for this to work out, right?  And, I mean, you go way back, don't worry  I won't go too far. 1605,  the first newspapers were copies  of email newsletters,  basically, not email, but mailed newsletters.  And which in turn  were copies of each other's newsletters. So  news, since the beginning of its time,  has been copying  each other's snippets, which is context  to me for the Murdoch  law in Australia,  where he's trying to force  Google and Facebook to pay  them for the privilege of sending  them free marketing by using  snippets. And it just struck me  the hypocrisy of it.  Well, so one is for about... The news business has been the most clever and it still is.  No, one's about geographic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  dispersion and, you know,  sharing news around the world.  The other is about  arguing if you're taking someone's  content or not, I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or sending them value, which you're  doing.  And  that's really  the issue, is that  now there's value sent to them.  But the truth is, Stacey,  if newspapers  suddenly had to pay each other for their  stories that they use for inspiration,  they'd go bankrupt. If sources  stopped talking to newspapers and said, okay, no, no,  if you're going to do this, Rupert, I'm  charging you for the next quote. Pay me  by the quote, right? Then it  can happen. Newspapers count on  free copying  of information from others.  And newspapers get value  from Google and Facebook sending them audience.  I'm just pointing out the Murdochian  hypocrisy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't actually disagree with you  on this one. I'm just saying that  it doesn't feel quite like the right analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead. You guys  are going to make an alliance and vote me off the island,  aren't you? I can tell.  I see it going on  already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not an  area where A, I'm an expert,  and B, that I have strong  feelings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have strong feelings about what Murdoch's trying  to do in Australia. I think that's  very risky and  silly and bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also spreading to Canada now. So now Canada  is jealous. Really? Canada's going to do that?  The Heritage Minister there said this week  that they're thinking of doing the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing. The wise thing to do would be to wait and see  what happens in Australia first.  Just see how that goes.  Then maybe you could try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My favorite little bit of the story,  so in 1902,  the Charlotte News, I went looking  through  newspaper.com to find things. I found  this great little anecdote  where papers were  fine with being copied, but they demanded to be  credited as well. They should have been, right?  So the Charlotte News was using  stuff, or the Herald  was using stuff from the news. So the news  set a trap for them. They ran  a fake news story  about a gang of anarchists  from Vladivostok planning  to kill all the prominent rulers of the globe.  As I say, you thought Q was new.  Police arrested the leader, said the story,  one count, Robikin  Rumov Le Svijan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Show it, John.  So there's the name.  As soon as I saw that, I knew exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what to do. So the news said in the next  edition, if the Aryanite scissors editors of the Herald  had read the story carefully, he might have noticed  the name of the illustrious count was more understandable  when read backward, we steal from  our neighbor.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  enjoyed that. Yeah, it's been going  on as long as time.  A story as old as time.  Oh wait a minute. Now we're  going to get sued by Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. CNBC

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  says,  Microsoft is the  no, you said Microsoft is the Eddie  Haskell of the tech industry. I said that.  Because they're backing, Microsoft's  backing Australia's law. Is that just  because they want to stick it to Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're Eddie Haskell. They see an opportunity  to get Bing in there. That's what  it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morris has  said on Monday, Microsoft is ready to step  in and expand its search product  Bing in Australia. If Google  pulls a search engine.  Ten years to 20.  Don't worry.  We will help you.  We will bring Bing to  the Australian continent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh boy.  Consider 94%  of the search is Google.  Yeah, look at that. Wow.  Unbelievable. I was just getting  ready. I think, let me ask you this.  Bing is still around? I didn't even know. Because I was  thinking Google or DuckDuckGo.  Bing's number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bing's number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a question. Here's a question.  Political question. So let's say  that Murdoch wins.  And Google  leaves Australia.  What's the  political ramification of that?  I've got to believe that the citizens of Australia  are going to be peeved. And especially  Aussies say so. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not going to be happy.  They'll always come back. I mean, it's not the end  of the world. I mean, they're politicians.  They're doing this because they think they have  a way to do this without  hacking off people.  If they get voted out on this issue, then maybe  they change. I mean,  I don't know. I just think politically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it just doesn't seem very

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  small. I don't know. The way people feel about  Google right now, they might be like, yeah.  Oh, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  imagine. Okay. I mean,  I know how I'd feel if I couldn't use Google.  Even if I, you know, do use  DuckDuckGo. Even if you were a dedicated DuckDuckGo.  Yeah, I'd be pretty peeved if some  politicians, law,  or would you, so  who would you be mad at? The politician or Google  for abandoning your country? I might  actually, I bet the politicians are  calculating that it would affect Google  more. Like people would be more angry at  Google. They pulled out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they didn't want  to abide by our laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. That may be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  media duopoly there with two  fairly unpopular proprietors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, the Cheyennes  don't really love either of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's Murdoch and who's the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Channel 9  something. It's Corey Carrot.  I forget his name. Chat room.  Some other guy. You got the Aussies in there? You're all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sleeping. Some other guy.  Yeah, it's an interesting  it does, I agree  with you, and it seems a little risky.  Yeah. That  they're taking a little political  risk. Business and politics  are not that weak. I  mean, clearly that's why Google's threatening it, right?  Well, go ahead, Minister. Let's just see  what happens. And I bet you that  the Australians  did not or do not believe  that Google would do that.  So there's a little game of chicken going

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on. I mean, Google's not  in China. Google could be in China. It could  have. I did an interview on ABC Australia  where I said this. Google could  have made the compromises  and stayed in China. They chose not to.  Google does believe in the  open Internet.  I think they would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's made some decisions around China  that its employers also or employees also  were like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's funny because  Huawei is a Chinese phone company  and has historically used Android  and because they can no longer use  Google Android in China, they have  been, they say, developing a brand  new operating system they call  Harmony OS.  According to Ron Amati, a writing and arts  technica, there is no discernible  difference between Huawei's  quote, all new OS and Android.  They just forked Android.  Called it Harmony.  You know, job done.  We're over.  They can do that completely legally. It's open source.  You know?  Probably should be better not to  call it, you know, a new operating  system.  To hear  what Ron writes, to hear Huawei tell the story, Harmony  OS is an original in-house  creation, a defiant act  that will let the company break free  of American software influence.  Harmony's  announcement in 2019 got big splashy  articles in the national  media. CNN called  Harmony OS a rival to Android.  Richard Yu, the CEO of Huawei's consumer  business group, told CNN  Harmony OS is completely different  from Android and iOS.  Even last month,  head of consumer software  said Harmony OS is not a copy  of Android, nor is it a copy of iOS.  But Ron looked  and  it's essentially an Android fork.  He says,  OK.  And there's a good article, if you want to read more  about it. There's a lot  of detail in the SDK  he's looking at and so forth.  Well done, Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a lot of Google,  Stacey, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not done.  We're still Googling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's more.  You want to know what a hit the Chromebook  is?  Demand has grown 400  percent during the  quarantine, according to Canales.  All time high, 11 million  units in the past quarter.  That's up from 2.5  in the same time 2019.  And of course, that's got to be  education. A lot of students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People looking for cheap computers for their  kids at home. Yep. A lot of kids working at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm also a fan of Chromebooks, but people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have been out of work  and struggling financially. I am  glad that this has been a viable  option for a lot of people to be able  to have class. Some Chromebooks are crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  expensive, though.  Before you assume,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  though, that this is a big...I mean, look  at the graph, because the global tablet market  almost exactly the same kind of growth.  So iPads  did very, very well as well.  Wow, that's interesting.  Yeah. It's really...I honestly  think it really is people not trying  to save money as much as just looking for some  way for their...because, you know, when you  kids weren't studying at home, one computer at home,  maybe an iPad was enough,  all of a sudden, I know many families.  I have a friend and family of five,  three kids. Each one needs  their own computer, because they're all in school  at the same time, plus dad's working  at home. Suddenly, they went  from needing one computer to needing  four. That's  what's powering this, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can get a Chromebook for $100 or $200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty amazing. But...  Usable options out  there now. But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With every bit of good news,  a little rain must fall, Jeff.  Google is apparently  discontinuing their tablet  Chromebook. But you didn't buy one of those, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't buy a tablet, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that was Mr. Toffold. Still waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't Kevin's  favorite, though. He did buy it to review it.  He didn't have it long.  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He didn't have it long. Yeah, they've taken it off

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the... Kevin liked the Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Pixelbook Go, which is a normal  laptop, you know.  Before that, what was the name of it? I can't even remember.  The Slate. The Slate. Good job.  Very good. Good job.  You remember that old stuff.  So they're still selling the Pixelbook Go, but  the Slate is now  history. Bye-bye.  You know what? It never was that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Slate has been struck.  Well, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I loved the prior tablet  with the keyboard. I loved.  I was almost my main machine.  Oh, the Pixel C.  Oh, give me my mournful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  desire, Stacy. I'm like, oh,  Jeff, we know. The Pixel C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was great. That was the one where the  keyboard kind of had turned and it would go  out. It was really cool.  Yeah, I gave it to somebody. I don't remember who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nexus 7. I miss my

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google tablet. Nexus 7. That's 7 inch?  Nexus 7. I wonder  if...  Honestly, no  Android tablet I've ever used has been very satisfying.  It's really... The operating system  does not lend itself well.  You're right. You're absolutely right.  Because the software is not really  tuned for that kind of  thing. The Slate was a 3,000 by 2,000  12.3 inch  LCD. It was a really nice  screen. It used a pen.  It had Intel  processors. Here's one problem.  It started. The entry  level model was 600  bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was off. I was thinking it was like 800.  Plus keyboard, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, then you had to buy a keyboard and pen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the 800 dollars to  keyboard. That's what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sick of all this Google news.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's something else in life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the...  I go on the Android tablet  with the OS and what not.  But I'm still not the biggest fan of  iPad and  iPad OS. I don't know what's wrong with you.  It works. But if I'm just  trying to download a file, it just...  Well, you don't download files on  iPad. It's gotta be an easier way for me to find my files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would you download a file?  What is that about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I pull in a camera raw file  from my creative cloud because I'd rather  process that camera raw file  on the iPad.  Well, if you use Lightroom, it'll be a snap.  Yeah, supposedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so you're just not using the right software.  What do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have Lightroom and I also have Photoshop for iPad.  I have the creative cloud. But you need Lightroom on the desktop

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and then Lightroom on the...  and then you have to use Adobe Sync on the iPad  and use Adobe's cloud.  Then it's there. So wherever you put it,  it's everywhere else. Edits and everything  are automatically propagate from desktop to iPad.  I don't do it either.  But that's one of the workflows.  It's a bit colluge-y.  The other workflow that I do use  is just using Apple's own tools, which is  Apple Photos. And then you can have  Pixelmator Photo. So it's in Photos,  which is your catalog.  It has its own kind  of limited editing, but it's not bad.  And then you can say... But open that in Pixelmator  Photo. This is all on the iPad.  Do the editing. Save it back to Photos.  And that goes to your cloud.  You don't use Macs either. So it's not for you.  That's all. It's not for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I try. And I even try to use  like Affinity Photo on iPad.  And again, it's the whole file  browsing that the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you're thinking of it as a desktop  operating system. That's the real disconnect people  get when they get the iPad.  There really isn't a file system exactly.  I mean, you know there is one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a media consumption device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the only reason I use my iPad.  You can do photo editing, but for security  reasons, you can't...  It's difficult. It made it a little easier,  but it's still difficult to see files  owned by other programs.  Each program has its own  documents.  I think it's more a  cognitive disconnect. Because you're  such a Windows guy, such a desktop guy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I struggle with it. So I just  spend more time just consuming  content on that thing when I actually  decide to pick it up. It's a good choice for that.  It frustrates me to create on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean honestly, I use the Mac,  but it is nice to have that touch interface  for like selecting  and quick edits.  Pencil, the pencil and the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iPad. Yeah, I love the Apple Pencil.  If I'm in Photoshop  and doing some layer masking,  it's great. Nice way to do masking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then the pinch.  You can zoom in and then do that  and pinch to zoom out. I mean it's a very  natural workflow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm with you.  Infamously, when the original iPad came out  on this very show, I reboxed  it. Because it wasn't made  for making it. Wow, was that on this show?  Ten years ago? I reboxed it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah.  That was your first rebox?  That was my first rebox, yes. I think we really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  missed it. You hated it that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  much? Oh, he's reboxed so many things.  It wasn't made for making, was my complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was somewhat wrong.  Yeah.  It was better as time went on. The Pro

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is better, but still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the Pro with the keyboard and everything, but  yeah, I don't use it that much. That would be the route I'd go, but  that's really pricey. It's expensive  and it's not a computer.  It's Apple.  It's Apple. It's whatever that is.  Google is,  speaking of Apple and Google,  we were, weren't we?  Google has found an interesting solution  to the Apple  privacy  conundrum, ATT,  the application tracking  something.  Apple has, of course,  the ID for advertisers, IDFA,  and Apple has said that  soon, with the release of  iOS 14.5,  which is probably  a month or two away,  everybody will have to  offer, anytime you put  an app on an iPad or an iPhone,  will have to tell the user  what your privacy policy is and offer  then the choice to turn off  the ID for advertisers.  That's the one that Facebook  took at a full page ad and said,  you're killing small business.  So Google's found a  solution, a way around this. They're not going to  use it.  They're going to do something else.  Now you can do this because you're Google. Google is  sure going to use some sort of even more  sticky tracking  system  that works better anyway.  Google said now, remember we said that Google  hadn't updated anything since before  Christmas because we thought they  did not want to do that privacy  nutrition label thing.  Google now says its iPhone apps will stop  using data  from the so-called third parties to personalize  ads. Big change for Google.  Facebook has said,  no, we're going to show the pop-up  give users the choice but we're just going to try to  convince them to say, let us do that.  Google's taking a different  path.  It's  interesting. I think Google can do this.  Google's  maps and YouTube will just  stop using the app  from the tool from Apple that lets  them personalize ads so they don't have to pop  up that warning.  They're just not going to use it. In effect, turn it off  so you don't have to.  It's my contention they're only doing that  because they have some better way  of tracking you. They don't really need  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We talked about this a little bit last  week. It's going to be the big guys can  afford to do without the old  tracking. The little guys can't  and so it's another unintended consequence  of  threatened regulation  that in regulatory capture  the big guys win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  We're going to talk all about GameStop next.  No, we're not. I'm just teasing.  There is one more Google story.  Okay.  One more Google story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One more Google story because Ant and I both promised to talk about it  on Twitter  which is Google paying  $3.8 million to settle discrimination  lawsuits. Right Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yes. Sorry. I did not mean  to leave that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no. It's $3.8  million. I read  the headline and I said okay let me dig  into it a little bit more.  It's discussing that it was about  2500 employees affected  or former employees affected  by this lawsuit or settlement.  It struck a nerve  because I remember  somebody named Andy  Rubin I believe.  How much did they give him?  $92 million.  One person.  But yet  these people were  battling out and  standing up for themselves  and terminated for whatever reason.  And  they get a measly $3.8  million to split up between them.  I think that's utter crap  from Google.  Then I found this other story  that I meant to put in the other day  that came back from September of last  year where Alpha that  paid out was at $300 million  or so because they're  trying to fight off all of these allegations  of wrongful terminations and things like  that and it ended up with a $300 million  settlement. And I'm thinking  that's still  way better but why did this  $3.8 million just  hit the fan and say that's the number  for these people that are wrongfully terminated  or discriminated against  at the job or even applying  for the job and was wrongfully  discriminated against.  Because their lawyers gave up on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The employees lawyers?  Yeah, when you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  negotiate a settlement like that what's  happening is you're evaluating  how much someone doesn't want  it to go to court because of the weakness of their  case versus the power  that you might have.  I mean I'm not saying it's right  at all. It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there were a number of different  groups. There were  female employees in engineering positions  that were subject to pay discrimination.  Google's going to give them  $1.3 million in back pay.  There were 1,757  pardon me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Divided by how much? $1.3 million divided by how many?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get your calculator out.  female and 1,219  Asian applicants who were not hired  for software engineering  positions. Google  is going to pay $1.2 million  and then they're going to set up a cash reserve  of $1.25 million over  the next five years for pay equity  adjustments.  Any excess money will go to the company's diversity  and inclusion efforts.  And of course in this Google says, now we don't  admit that we did anything wrong.  Of course. But, and we deny  the allegations, but we are  going to agree to do a better  job in the future.  Now I'm going to ask you  as a black gentleman  to compare what  Google's doing  in this regard with racial injustice and what  Apple's doing. I'm just curious what  your take is on this. Google  is committing $12 million in grants  to advance racial justice. This is the  Google page. They're asking people  to donate.  These are the groups that they're donating to, which are  all good groups.  And then Apple's  page, racial  equity and justice initiative for  which they've committed more than $100 million  including  some very concrete  stuff like  creating an education  platform in Detroit.  Criminal justice reform, economic  equality. Now don't judge it on the web  page, because clearly Apple won  on the web design.  I mean that's obvious, right? That's what they do.  Yeah, they're good at that. It's design. Clearly  that Apple wins.  I mean  compare this  to Google's kind of  Spartan like  well, while we're using HTML  what do you want?  Apple  clearly  I also think Apple's really  they're working on STEM  for girls. Apple  developer, academy engineers, support  for Detroit entrepreneurs.  They're going to do a bunch of  in-store, well I guess they don't do it  in-store anymore. They do it via  Zoom or whatever, I guess FaceTime, but they're  going to do a bunch of educational  things featuring black creators.  On the one hand, I'm  wondering if you look at this and go that's  cynically and go well, that's corporations.  Or do you feel like  one effort is maybe more impressive  than the other or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Part of me is  cynical where I say well  corporations are just going to all of a sudden  it's PR.  Especially right now, February of all  months. But I also  see that actions speak  louder than words. And if you  can have these conversations  and raise awareness and then  actually put some action behind it  then I'm all for it.  Have at it. Keep doing it.  Even if it is cynical PR.  But then it's all we do is just talk about it.  What are we doing about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are doing products  too which I think is interesting because Apple is a product  company. They have a Black Unity  watch band  and new watch faces which are available  to everybody. They have  new Apple music channels.  Rap Life Live.  In Maps they have Black owned restaurant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  guides. Amazon has  done a similar thing with its Prime service  and with its Prime video service  of raising awareness for  people of color  from the creativity  standpoint. Whether they wrote the movies  or produced the movies or what have you.  And there was a lot of stuff out there I had no  idea about. That turned out to be  fairly good and then there was some things that just  didn't resonate  with me. But I did like the fact  that these things got pushed up to  the top a little bit to say hey  check these other creators out as well.  So that was a nice gesture and  hopefully that will continue to happen when I  open up the Amazon Prime app  and not just something that's right now  because it's a hot topic  in a good PR push. Actually I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  apologize. Google is committing $175  million  to racial equity initiatives  with a focus on Black. This was back from  last summer. I just missed it. Focused  on financing Black owned businesses and supporting  Black entrepreneurs.  However,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you need to fix your own house too.  2,565 female  employees back pay and interest.  If I'm wrong here, $506  each.  That's what I was going to say. Take care of your  house first though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's justice. That's not good.  And of course, as you point out,  Andy Rubin got a very fat  golden parachute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $90 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to leave. Google's not  been doing all that well. At least  from the point of view of  its public relations anyway.  It sure doesn't look like  the, you know, I don't know.  None of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are stupid here on this panel. We  know that PR is going to be  PR because that's just how  it operates. But again,  just show me  what you're doing. Let me see  your actions in place.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook's oversight  board has overturned  this is good. There's some teeth  in this. Overturned  four cases  in its first ruling. That's four out of five.  And as we mentioned last week,  they're going to be taking  on the case of  President Donald J. Trump  being banned from Facebook.  You wrote a piece on Medium,  here come the judge.  Nice.  Yeah.  Laughing, right?  Is it Flip Wilson? Who was it?  Here comes the judge. Here comes the judge.  Only  old people like us remember that.  So what do you think of  what Facebook's oversight board?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my smart ass remark, which I also believe,  is that it makes Facebook's judgment look good.  Laughing.  So they,  and I blame  Facebook for this as well. I blame both of them for it  because Facebook gave them their statutes,  their nitty-gritty  community standards to judge from, or very  high concepts like hate speech  and human rights. So they read  it rather literally. So  an insult to Muslim men  as a group,  oh that doesn't rise to hate speech, they said, so they leave it up.  Well, how is the world better off with that?  Or the one that shocked me  was a French  post-taunting  hydroxychloroquine,  Donald Trump's favorite cure.  They said  it wasn't imminently harmful  because you had to get a prescription to get it so you couldn't die  tomorrow. So they put it up  under freedom of speech. And my view is  how is Facebook  or the world better  off for attacking  Muslim men as a group  and forcing Facebook to put back  up medical  disinformation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really high bar, Jeff. How  is the world better off by  putting, I mean that's,  I publish stuff every day and if I  ask myself how is the world better off,  I might be hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pressed on a couple of things. Well, Stacy, but this is not  news. You publish news. This is a case  where somebody put up  medical misinformation, where science is clearly  spoken, the WHO and CDC have clearly  spoken, and  the Oversight Board forces them to put  it back up. And my standard here  is it's not a governmental  decision. It is a company.  And at some point there should be a standard. This is  what I argue, is they should have higher level  principles that say if they had a higher  level principle that said we want  people to treat each other with respect, then  the Muslim post would have to go. But they don't have  that. They have a statute. If they had a higher  level principle, as Monica Bickert, their  head of content policy, did  say right after the decision,  is that they are going to keep going with science  at the WHO and the CDC. If they  had stated that as a policy, then the Oversight  Board could have said according to this policy,  this shouldn't be here.  But instead they just said, well, here's the  nitty gritty of that statute, so we're going to  put it back up. It just makes no  sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that seems like what it's designed  to do. I mean, you have laws,  not laws, but  in the Facebook statutes.  I mean, that's  the spirit and the letter of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I'm arguing they need higher level  principles, which they don't have. You liked the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oversight Board when they appointed  the people. You thought they were well  chosen, right? Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we'll see.  You may not like their actions. Just like, I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know about it now. I'm not so sure now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I think that there's a  strong kind of libertarian view  to it, which to  its peril, interprets this  in a way. And Stacey, I'm going to come back. I  still think that as a private company,  they could have said  your policies are crappy.  If we'd followed your policies to the letter,  then you should  keep up medical misinformation. But everybody's coming  after you and you say you're following science.  So write a new policy, bozos.  That's what the Oversight Board should have done.  Is that part of their, I mean, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  feel like if I were an oversight board  and you asked me to decide  on things based on a certain  rubric, I would say  this rubric sucks.  And you could say that. But then  Facebook is every right to say, well, then  I don't want you on my oversight board because these are  the rubrics we want you to follow. And then  your choice then is to say  I don't want to be part of this. You can write a nasty  letter and publish, share it with everybody saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  whatever. Isn't it the case  though, really, that this board  has one and only one job, which is  to let Mark Zuckerberg say, well,  we're going to have the board handle that  and defer responsibility.  Like I have created  this board. That seems to be what it is. Yeah.  I have created this, I don't think Mark cares  what the board rules on any of these individual  things. If they overruled  him every single time, I don't think he'd care.  The board cannot review  a meaningful number  of cases. There are millions,  probably billions, I don't know, there's a  lot. And they can only do, you  know, a few at a time.  It takes them 90 days to do it.  This is a little, this is the tiniest  amount. I think a lot  of it is just, look, we got this oversight board.  And yes, I agree to be bound  by the decision. And these are very  prestigious people. See, we  care. And it's pressure release.  And he walks away. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Stacy, to your point, the board  did make higher policy  suggestions, saying, you know,  this rule is pretty sucky.  That rule is pretty vague.  So they did do that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's beyond their portfolio, and  Facebook doesn't have to do what they say there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right? So somebody I know  in disclosure here,  somebody I know was asked to put  together a group of  outsiders to  talk about the Trump decision.  So she invited me to be part of a group  of 35 people for 90 minutes. I don't  think we're going to be able to say much. But it'll be  interesting to see the dynamics of that.  Where they wanted outside input.  I fear their Trump decision.  I think the Trump decision based on  what they know so far, they'll just say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who asked for that?  The oversight board asked for that.  Oh, that's interesting. What was their  idea? This kind of rump oversight  board. What was the point of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, the point is to  have outside input. So  it's input for their decision groups.  Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  So I was not asked personally  by the oversight board. The oversight board asked somebody  who in turn asked me. Right.  So it'll be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, at least here in the United  States, their decision on Trump  carries a lot more weight.  I agree with you about the decisions  they made. It seems a little  odd. Maybe that's not the decision I  would have made. But  I also agree with you, Stacey. If their rubric  is you have to, this is based on what our  terms of service are and you have to decide whether  it violates our terms or not,  then they maybe did exactly what they were supposed  to do. But I think that... Yeah, I think it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  does show the... I think, Stacey, you and I would agree here.  I think it shows the weakness of Facebook's  rules. As one friend of mine said,  a journalist said, they are not fit for purpose  to be interpreted by  a court of last resort.  They're meant to tell a  moderator and an algorithm. Yes, that's correct.  Well, if  the female nipple has a baby attached,  okay. But if it doesn't, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was the one  ruling they did overturn.  Even though Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  already overturned itself. Yeah.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But again, I think that nobody really...  Nobody at Facebook cares because that's not the real purpose  of this. It's just to let  off a little pressure. That's correct. Yeah.  So I don't  think they really care about that. And then  by the way, it may be that  Mark secretly harbors a desire  to put Trump back on because he  drives a lot of engagement and a lot of  revenue. And he's just  figuring, well, if they  make me do it, they made me do it.  It wasn't my choice. Oversight Board made  me do it. And he might be  satisfied with that result. See,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  where I think it's going to go though,  I think if you look at Australia, where  Facebook has threatened  to take news off of  Facebook, keep Facebook there,  but that users and  publishers could not put news up on the platform.  And you look at the story  this next on the rundown that Facebook has  developed a bad news avoidance  tool for advertisers.  It's not avoiding bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  news.  It's avoiding news that you don't want to be next  to. This is a classic problem for advertisers  on Twitter, on YouTube,  and on Facebook  because they could be next to something that  they really don't want their ad next to.  So why is this a bad tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm not saying it's a bad tool.  What I'm saying is I think where Facebook  Well, it's bad for news because I think  that what will happen is that  advertisers will  go away and away and away.  Now the advantage to Facebook is,  to take your cynical interpretation  as normal, which I would agree  with in this case, is I think Facebook  would say, listen, guys, we got forced  out of the news business. This news is  a pain. We really don't make money on this stuff.  We don't make money on this controversy.  We spend a lot more on lobbying for it.  We spend money on all these darned  moderators. Fine, screw it.  Pets and parties, pets and  parties. That's what we are again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I'd love to see them do that.  Well, but that doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  help news  in an informed society.  Wait a minute. That's an interesting... Now here's an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  conversation. You think Facebook's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for news? Oh, as opposed to every conversation we've had so far  has not been interesting. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they've all been pretty dull, but, including the one I brought up.  But, do you think Facebook  is good for news? No, Stacey thought no.  Do you think Facebook is good for news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Inadvertently,  through the side door, not through planning,  not as well as it should be.  But yes, if Facebook disappeared...  When Facebook reduced  news because of the  disinformation controversies of  the Trump years, news organizations  were hurt. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if they didn't let  you share... I mean,  if it's a place for you to talk about things  with people, you know, right? It's the theory.  A lot of what people talk about at the water cooler is  hey, did you see that story about that kitten who  rode a bicycle? You know, so it's  news in the sense.  I don't know.  I mean, like, I'm trying to think of if you took  news away from Facebook, so  as a publisher, could not promote  things there, and people  couldn't bring it in to talk about  it? Is that the idea that would happen?  I mean...  Then it just becomes almost irrelevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it does, but  a lot of your life  is not news. I mean, you know, we're  news hounds, us.  I'm like, what?  It's our business. Most people are not  as obsessed with news as  we might be.  But turn around the other way.  What occurred to me one day is that Facebook  was definitely not built for news.  Our readers took news  there because they wanted to talk about it. Twitter was not  built for news. Witnesses took  it there because they wanted to share things that  they saw. Right?  Nextdoor is not built for news,  and newspapers should have built that so neighbors could talk,  but we didn't. Nextdoor did.  So all the things that we lost out of the news business  because we wanted to keep doing what we'd always done...  No, I don't think a news  organization could have built that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of disagree.  So I think there's an...  If you have people who don't normally go to news  sites because they're not that into news,  I don't know if a news site could  have created kind of a place  like that, like  for local communities to  talk. I think what's...  We're missing the third place online  where you can come together with people  and talk to them in a  way that matters. And maybe for those  platforms, you need to be  authenticated and maybe use your real  name, not everywhere on the internet, because I'm  very anti... But maybe  if you step into... Nextdoor.  I don't know, your local  newsy  cafe. Let's call it your local cafe.  As long as you're who  you say you are, you  can say, hey, I'm Stacy and I'm coming into the  Austin local cafe because I used to live here  and talk about things. But  I also would be telling people that I no longer  live there, so I couldn't argue about like  school bond issues, right?  Because I have no stake in that.  I think that might be an interesting option  for a Facebook or Nextdoor.  No, Nextdoor requires you to actually  live in that geographic area. But you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  talk about it. Nextdoor is close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to be nosy in other neighborhoods, right?  It's not just nosy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like when we talk about things  like if you don't  live in that exact tiny area,  but issues still affect that area, you  do need to be able to talk about it with people outside  that quote unquote neighborhood,  because there are state issues  that might affect that neighborhood or there  are citywide issues that are  relevant, but  one neighborhood is against  something in another neighborhood. You see what I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  saying here? Yeah, you know, I did a  lot of work on this when I ran local news sites  where it's what I call the cinder block  of local, because in every market, the definition  of local is different. In Cleveland,  it's east side or west side. In New Jersey,  it's a county. In some places,  it's a town. In Louisiana, it's a  parish. In Alabama, it's  three slices of the state.  So every vision of local is  different. And then you get to certain kinds of stories.  Local is  two square miles. Other kinds of  stories, it's a hundred square miles.  And so the definition of  local online is really actually nuanced and  complicated to present.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to take a little break and then we're going  to come back and talk about something else.  And that's my promise  to you as a  podcaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Podcaster promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Podcaster promise.  Pinky swear.  Our show today brought to you by Nureva.  You know, I'm a sound  like Nazi. It's  to me, video  is great, but the sound is what matters.  And I was really thrilled to talk to the  engineers at Nureva about this  really interesting  technology designed to  make your business meeting  sound better.  To improve meeting room  audio. You know how it is most of the time you get  one of those conference phone things in the middle of the table.  Everybody sounds like they're echoey. You can't  understand people at one end of the table.  It's nasty. It's awful.  It's terrible. Nureva is  applying computational audio  to meeting  room sound. You know, you've seen how computational  photography can take a  terrible picture and make  it amazing. That's what Nureva does  with the sound in your conference room.  When people are  in a meeting space, especially nowadays, because you're  distanced, right? You're six feet from each other.  So it's spread out even more.  Conventional audio systems just can't handle  that. Beam forming  systems, yeah, but that's not what Nureva  is. And the problem with beam forming  systems is they have to be adjusted and  people have to sit in specific spots.  Not with Nureva.  You don't have to add mics all over the  table, which means sanitizing each mic  in between meetings. Don't have to do that.  You don't have to have your participants  face any particular way or sit  in any predetermined spot.  They can go where it's natural, where they  feel safe, and  still get great sound. The Nureva  microphone hangs on the wall.  It's easy to install.  You can do it yourself.  They use something, a patented system  called microphone mist  technology. It's  actually amazing.  I got a demo. I was so impressed.  Essentially, this microphone on the  wall, which looks kind of like a sound bar,  fills the room with  thousands of virtual  microphones.  And it does this computationally.  It's automatic. Doesn't have to be adjusted or  tuned. It's easy to set up. You'll get  true full room coverage.  So everybody, everywhere in the room can be heard  exactly the same as everybody else. Clearly,  precisely, you can understand  them. There's not room tone or echo,  no matter where they sit, no matter how they're distanced,  no matter where they face.  You can install it. Just put it up  on the wall. It automatically  adapts to every room configuration.  That's important because some meetings  there's going to be one person in there. Some meetings there might be  many more. And it'll adjust  to who's in the room and where people are sitting.  Four patents on this. It's  really inspiring technology. Microphone  mist. They've won numerous awards.  Nureva's won the top new technology  award at the ISE 2020  for the Nureva HDL  200 system. But the  200 is one of many. No matter the size  of the room, you have a variety of systems  for small, medium, and large  spaces. You should go to the website.  Nureva.com slash twit. You can hear for yourself.  They use it at HubSpot.  Jimmy Yan, who's there,  I love his title, principal collaboration  engineer. He's, you know,  he's the AV squad for your meeting room.  He says, we are so impressed with the sound quality,  the ease of use, the ease of  install of the HDL 300. They have  the little bit bigger one. It was just a no-brainer  for us to adopt it.  It's incredible.  And I want you to check it out. To learn more  how Nureva audio is the simplest,  cost-effective way to let your teams  distance in meetings and still act  and converse naturally. Everybody  can hear them. Visit Nureva  N-U-R-E-V-A.  Nureva.com slash twit.  Nureva.com  dot com slash twit.  Bringing computational audio  to your meeting room.  It's really clever.  I was very impressed. Nureva.com  slash twit. Thank you Nureva for  supporting Twig. Thank you for supporting us  by using that special address. It's again  Nureva.com slash  twit. T-W-I-T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cloud's where it is at.  This is not a retail company.  Retail's gravy. Retail's a  sideline. Retail's just a little bit of a thing we do for the  fun of it to learn how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ben Thompson's Stratecary was really good on this.  If you haven't read it yet,  Stratecary.com.  That's exactly it.  He said Amazon's never been a retail company.  This just makes that...  I thought it had been a data  and logistics company.  I mean, Bezos  said what...  He didn't  say what problem can I solve.  He said...  Stratecary says  Bezos started with a solution and looked for a  problem. The solution broadly considered was the  internet.  What business  can only exist on the internet?  There's no brick and mortar competition.  He said selling books.  Because there's two and a half million books.  The largest bookstore in the world can only hold  175,000 books.  There are actually  over three million books worldwide in all  languages.  He was able to get two and a half million books in a  virtual bookstore on the internet you couldn't compete  with. Because no one's got a bookstore  that big.  But that was a logistics problem.  It was a  data problem. And obviously he's a genius.  The question is  whether Amazon can continue to succeed.  Now I saw some people say  maybe even more cynical than moi  that, oh, Jeff's still going to  run the company. He's just now  out of the eye of regulators,  the SEC,  investors,  all the people who are annoying.  So he can manipulate the levers behind  the scenes and Massey gets  to sit in front of the cameras.  Jeff I think has never been comfortable  in front of the cameras.  Does that, do you think, make sense, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, again, I would like  Will he still run the place?  I don't think he  I don't really think he needs to.  He's, remember up until  the pandemic he was pretty  I don't want to say checked out, but he spent a lot of  time doing strategic thinking.  And he  He doesn't want to do day to day.  And that pulled him back in  and if you look ahead and you're like, God, this  regulatory quagmire is coming.  Geez, I mean, he, take his  money and run. He made a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  lot of money in the pandemic. His personal  fortune went up significantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's going to spend it on like space rockets  and newspapers. I mean, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of what he said in his  announcement. He said, I want to work on  Blue Origin. I want to work on  the Wall Street. I mean, the  Washington, whatever it is, the  Post. Washington Post, thank you.  He mentioned some other, some other businesses  that I didn't recognize. I guess  a charitable enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But here's the question. So  is he like, as a personality,  is he like  Larry and Sergey that they really have  pulled back and they're fine? Or is he going  to keep his finger in? Well, that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because I think you can make a case that Google  has not been as Google-y since they  stepped aside, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Amazon has never, Amazon  has had wonderful  processes, I would say.  So I think,  I think Andy Jassy will  do a good job in the infrastructure, the  management layers around, that  have been built up over time.  Amazon has a very distinct culture.  And you don't  stick with Amazon unless you buy  into that culture. And so  I don't think we'll see  a huge deviation from  again, the culture.  Well, as

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ben Thompson points out,  Jassy is not an engineer.  He's a business guy. He's an MBA.  As is Bezos. Bezos  came from a hedge fund.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Jassy is legit.  He understands what's  going on. He understands the Amazon  business model. He is  cold if he needs to be.  And he will get stuff done.  He's like Bezos in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So should I keep my imaginary Amazon stock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, keep your imaginary Amazon  stock. Although this news  should have no impact because really  we're just playing a big shell game. As we

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have agreed now, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does Amazon have a dividend

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hold up? Amazon probably does.  I don't know. A lot of tech companies don't.  Apple for a long time did not, but  changed their tune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never paid a dividend. And actually Amazon  usually runs close to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nope, never. Yeah, they don't  even try to make a profit a lot of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Thank you. I was like,  the words are escaping me by  making the strike

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing.  We should mention that at least  halfway through the  pandemic, Bezos was making  $13 million an hour.  Which is slightly below minimum wage.  Shouldn't it be $15 million for billionaires? I think it  should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft pays a dividend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, older

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  techs... Microsoft's an old  company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Traditionally tech companies didn't and then I think  Apple and Microsoft and others started to  because they realized we can't...  There's a lot of reasons for it. A lot of pressure.  Apple got kind of forced into it. Microsoft,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think, was more popular  by having a dividend.  As you said, that stock stayed  at 35 or whatever for  years. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Flat. And Amazon  has really had a lot of control over how much  money it makes in profit. Which is  I wonder if  Amazon's incredible record quarter is  partly because Jeff wanted to go out  with a blaze of  glory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Find me another billion, will ya?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had a $100 billion  quarter. $100 billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  quarter. They are amassing  more power during the pandemic.  More people and they're taking  greater control over their delivery  infrastructure. And they're taking  driver's tips but they're paying  a small... Oh yeah, that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  nasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that was an old story and I guess the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  fine came out. Yeah, they got fined  for that. Although you gotta  point out the guy's making  $13 million  a day.  But he's stiffen his employees.  $61 million fine. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's part of the  ethics that like...  Did you see O'Donnell?  What's his name? Charlie O'Donnell's  this was from January and it's an  excellent essay. And let's see  if I can find it on Charlie O'Donnell  in his sub stack.  Give it  a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's Googling right now. Or is she binging?  No one knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need investments in insurrections.  Alright.  I'm gonna pop it into  someplace. I'm popping it in here.  So this whole...  Oh I should pop it in the show notes.  I'm bad. Is this from the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is going to be  big blog? Big.  This is going to be big Charlie O'Donnell's  blog and venture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the idea here is  as a venture investor, he's  starting to ask questions about people  saying things like, hey we're gonna  make huge margins off of  people making $10 an hour. And he's like  well what happens if it's $15 an hour  minimum wage? And then  he's like, and hey, even if we  don't say that's gonna happen because  of politics, do you think that's fair?  So he's saying that  basically the tech  industry needs to start  and the financial industry behind it  should maybe ask some questions  about their culpability and  the rise in inequality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are two kinds of people in the world.  There's people who believe  in fairness  and then there's the very, very  rich. I don't  think they care about  fair. It's like  but I'm rich. I don't have  I won. I won.  So  unless I'm gonna pay a penalty  for mistreating my workers  I see no downside.  I don't think people used to be that way.  I think what's happened is as a culture

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we've moved towards that.  If you had told  my grandfather something like that,  if you had made this sort of argument to him  and said, well it'll be great  because then my  stockholders will be better off.  This is a myth that is  morally reprehensible.  And I mean that's why  I pay Kevin, for example.  And that's why I pay anybody who writes  for me as much as I can.  Let me show you this.  Have you read Jonathan Haight's book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Haight's book. He isn't like it. I don't want to call him Haight.  Really good book.  He is a sociologist.  You know the book probably  Jeff.  Because it's maybe more up your alley.  But I've interviewed him on  triangulation. He talks about  liberals versus conservatives.  And what values  they all have.  There's five values. Harm,  fairness, authority, ingroup, and purity.  And he has much more detailed  definitions.  But liberals tend to value  their values are  in the harm and fairness scale  higher.  And conservatives tend to have  higher value for  authority, ingroup, purity.  And  he is by the way saying this in a  very non-judgmental way.  In fact if you're a liberal you look  at it and go those stupid conservatives. If you're a conservative  you go oh those stupid liberals. But he's looking at  it in a very different way.  He  says if we're ever going to understand  each other we have to understand  these five values.  And why that guy across  the table why disagreeing with so vehemently.  It's just because he values  a different set of those five  higher.  It's actually very interesting.  He's done a lot of  research and work  around this. The Righteous Mind is his  book which I highly recommend.  But his point is,  and this is the point I was making,  I agree with you Stacey. Fairness  is important.  It's really important. We want to be fair.  But not everybody feels that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think though fairness is also  important for the growth of society.  And even if you're  selfishly concerned about  your own happiness  it's actually good for that too because  it creates a more  equitable society. It's a society  that is calmer,  has less random shootings.  Of course you'd think that. You're at lower

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  risk. You're on that liberal side.  Of course you'd think that.  And then other people think you know what  if we honor traditional values  if we  there are things that we would do that would be better.  And by the way his point is  nobody's, this is not, these are  autonomic processes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. This is like when we talk about  the difference between the US and China.  We're talking about cultures that value  completely different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a good book. I highly recommend it.  It certainly opened my mind.  The Righteous Mind, while  good people are divided by politics and  religion.  And it's helped me to kind of understand  the other side a little bit better  because they're going oh yeah because  their values are slightly different than  my values. Liberals tend to put  fairness above all else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It's also  kind of  circumstances too.  Dana Boyd's argument in  the epistemological war  is that we have  to start, it's not so much teaching each other  facts, it's teaching each other about each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. We all got the same  We should never use the word epistomology.  Epistemology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Use epistemology  in a sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean I know the word. I'm just like  we have jumped the shark right there.  We're like nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My only point was  while you and I and maybe  everybody on this panel would agree oh yeah we should consider  fairness the fairness of a billionaire making  13 million dollars a day while  paying minimum wage to the people  making that money. But I don't know  if that necessarily is a universally  held belief. You don't even have to look at that as fairness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could even, I mean on that  chart  you know, what was it?  Authority, purity and the third

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one? Yeah that really is reductionist  that chart I'm afraid. I shouldn't have  done it. Loyalty,  authority and sanctity.  Sanctity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Well you could argue  I mean there's a lot in the Bible  and you could argue  loyalty to you know your  fellow man argues  that you would not  you would not treat someone  like that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not that conservatives don't believe in  fairness but  they don't weigh it as highly as  liberals might.  It might be reductionist. I don't know if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like I don't want to say that it's unfair  like to me it's less  an issue of fairness.  The big moral issue  here, I mean  it is unfair but  is that when you  have something that's so obviously  skewed you have people  who are able to utterly  take advantage of the people  underneath them and those people have no recourse.  So it's basically abusing your power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I completely agree with you.  That's why I said Bezos makes 13 million  an hour while  his employees that are making  him this fortune are making less than  $15 an hour.  That's really kind of been the story of Big  Tech and the pandemic. It's been very very  profitable for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's another cynical angle to  the Bezos story too is that  he can't top this now. So whoever  follows him is going to look bad by comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I think that that kind of ties  in with Amazon's giant quarter.  Right.  Good luck.  Have fun. Here's the keys.  We'll see.  Bezos is a fascinating fella.  I've always watched  him with great interest. I've read  Brad Stone's great book The Everything  Store. I highly recommend that.  I wish there were more actually about  Bezos. Read Ben Thompson's  article today in Strotecary because that was a  good one. By the way it's  Blue Origin, his space project.  The Washington Post, his newspaper.  The Bezos Earth Fund  and the Day One Fund.  Those are the  things he wants us to devote his time to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Washington Post by the way  is going to get a new editor imminently.  The brilliant Marty Barron has announced his

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no really? Oh that's too bad.  Speaking of  CEO movement,  the Mercer family, Rebecca  Mercer's decided to kick  John Matzey out at Parler.  Parler CEO John Matzey says he's been  terminated by the board, quote,  I did not participate in this decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is being

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  seen as Rebecca Mercer  taking the reins  and saying alright we're going to  get this thing together.  It's kind of related because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the Mercer's.  It's all that matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the Mercer's.  It's the Mercer's social network.  We just live here.  I don't know  if that will get them back on  the internet but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm delighted I just caught

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey catching me tweeting  during the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steven Sinofsky, former  and much hated  Microsoft's executive, the guy in charge  of what was it? Windows  has decided to write  his memoirs  but on Substack.  How cool can you be?  He's a cool kid. Hardware,  I mean sorry, hardcore software inside  the rise and fall of the PC revolution  which would be he confesses at least  a two volume set so he's got a lot  of running to do. He's going to serialize it  as a set of posts on  Substack.  Chapter 001.  That's a bad sign that he feels like he's going to need three digits.  Becoming a Microsofty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At least it's not 1.1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  This book is broken into 15 chapters  in an epilogue. Each chapter has a number.  You know, that's the plan. We'll see what happens.  Hey, guess what?  It's time for the  Google changelog.  The Google changelog.  February security patches  rolling out to the Google Pixel.  Why am I having trouble saying Google? I don't know.  Factory images and OTAs  are live. That's usually the first  the Herald, like the  like the Robin, Heralding Spring,  the OTA images Herald, the  new security patch for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  February. That's a pretty boring story. We get that every

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  month. Yeah. You know what?  Jason Howell is the host of All About  Android. I think he stuck that in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Alright, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's okay. He still produces  the show, right? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pixel 5. Yeah, yeah.  He gets to do that. That's his job.  Pixel 5, 4a, 5g,  now supports standalone 5g on T-Mobile  and Google 5 with the February  update. Another exciting  February update story.  Let's see if I can find something.  Oh, there's a green room now in  Google Meet. So  this is actually much needed. Oh, this  is good. To test your audio and your video.  It  shows you a picture of yourself.  And you could decide not to wear that  knit cap. And then it says  say something.  And I'm just testing my audio  and that plays it back to you. That's a very good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And magically, there are donuts and coffee

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there. It's amazing. Oh, I wish. In the  green room? What's the best green room  you ever experienced?  Best food

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  green room. I've been in crappy,  crappy green rooms every time.  MSNBC had  Dunkin Donuts coffee  and Dunkin Donuts donuts.  Yeah, they didn't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Regis and Kelly was not a great green room.  It was okay, but it wasn't great. You know, the  best one I've been in was the Today Show.  That was pretty nice. They had  eggs. I bet. They had like breakfast.  But you were up pretty early.  It's like at 6 in the morning, right?  Yeah. I think they had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they had to.  I think the best one I've been  in was on 1351  Redwood Way. We have an excellent

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  green room. Awesome coffee machine. He likes our coffee  machine.  I have also  an excellent green room.  What's your favorite green room? Yours, Ed?  The best cookies.  Google  Google search links are going to get a  panel that says about this result  that will give you information  about the website,  which is kind of an interesting  idea. Here's how it looks.  So this is so you can  vet the source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook has been doing for like two years.  Have they really? They don't find a huge  uptake for it, but that's a different  experience. People might use this.  I don't know. We'll see. So in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  example that they give, you see  an article  from the Lancet.  And it says, the Lancet is a weekly peer  review general medical journal. It's among  the world's oldest and best known general  medical journals. That's from Wikipedia.  It says your site is secure.  It shows you the full URL  of the article,  which is sometimes really nice to see  ahead of time. This is a search result,  not an ad. Only ads are paid.  And they'll always be labeled with  sponsored or ad.  And I think that's really cool. There's buttons at the bottom  with the privacy settings  and how search works. I think this is  nice. I guess it's only  on mobile.  It's a beta feature  rolling out to Google search in the US. Oh no,  desktop, mobile web, and the  Google app on Android.  I like it.  YouTube is going to celebrate  Black History Month, the month of February.  There'll be a new  BHM logo every week  on, I presume,  leading to BHM content.  I don't know. I would  guess. YouTube  says, at YouTube we believe in the power  of diverse voices and perspectives as part of  our continuing work to support  and celebrate these voices. We're starting Black History  Month by highlighting four black artists  this Black History Month.  They will bring their creative talents to  the YouTube logo.  Every Monday  in February there'll be a new logo. So there's only going  to be four in the top left  corner of the home feed.  Now I'm going to, should I try it?  YouTube, let's go, let's see.  Where's my BHM  logo? I don't see one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to say I saw it earlier  today. Do I have to play a video  to see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not working. Is it because you're on premium?  Is it because I'm premium? No.  They wouldn't only show that to  people who don't pay. I guess I'm just not getting it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw it on,  well maybe it was my other computer. I don't know.  But I saw it on something earlier today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't see it on this screen. Maybe I do have ad  blocking turned on. Let's refresh and see.  Don't know. Anyway.  Look for it.  Google Play is going to allow Android gambling  and betting apps in more  countries including the good old  USA. So  Robinhood is just going to fit  right in. No, I'm kidding.  We're updating our real money gambling games  and contest policy so more developers  can build sustainable businesses  on your addictions.  And in a way that helps keep consumers safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, insurance companies  are just legalized gambling. That's true.  It's all gambling. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Draft Kings is going to bring its sportsbook  and casino app to the US.  There's online casino  games permitted in Delaware,  Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.  Congratulations, Jeff. You win.  There'll be sports betting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The commercials for gambling now are  two people who  frighten me most are the online  gambling people and the Previgin people.  I don't know which one. I just like more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell me you're tempted though, aren't you, to take that  Previgin? Aren't you  tempted?  Have you taken it? No.  No. No. I do take  a lot of sketch supplements.  Why not?  Why not? One more sketch  supplement.  This is just depending on which  state you're in and what's legal.  Lotteries, again,  from state run operators.  Daily fantasy sports, depending  on the state, may be regulated as gambling in the US.  But  if it's legal in your state, it's going to be  on Android.  Applications will be rated  adult only and  prevent underage users from  using.  And the app has  to be free to download and not use the  Google Play in-app billing system. So,  Google is lightening up a little  bit on gambling on your  Android device. The Android TV  home screen gets another revamp, this time  with some Google TV  goodness. Remember they released a new Chromecast  with Google TV, not  Android TV. It's very confusing.  Some of the Google TV features are now  migrating over to Android  TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually need you to explain this to me, because I'm thinking  of getting the new Chromecast  with the remote control and the whole thing.  Do I pay something every month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. Is it just a different Chromecast?  It's a different UI.  If you want to play any Stadia games,  because right now it doesn't  work with Stadia, you need a Chromecast  Ultra for that. I think that's the only  but it's a nice UI. I like the  Android TV home screen.  And you're going to  the point of this story is that more and more  they're going to look the same.  So I should go ahead and buy it.  Vice versa, the Google TV home screen is going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  replacing the Android TV. Should I buy the new  Chromecast remote? Yes, it's very nice.  I think for the remote

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  alone it's worth it.  Android  Phone Hub  is going to start appearing in  Chrome OS, so look for this  for a select few.  So I think you're going to  be eligible because you use a Pixel phone,  right?  Phone Hub is a code name for a new  set of features that make your Android phone and Chromebook  work better together. You've always been able  to unlock your  Chromebook with your Android phone.  But they'll also be instant tethering,  Google Messages  integration, which is great,  Android notifications will show up on your Chrome  OS desktop.  Recent Chrome tabs will be  shared. Handy options like  silencing your phone or locating would also be  available from the Chrome OS desktop.  This will all be powered by Google Play  Services.  It's right now in the  Dev or Canary channels,  and your phone has to have a beta version  of Google Play Services, so I would  just wait.  I'm not clear what,  if you'll have to have a Pixel to do this,  I'm not sure which phones  will support it, so  probably  more than just the Pixel. I don't see any restriction  to Pixel.  And that, my friends,  thank you to Jason Howell,  who's the Google  changelog.  The changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  now, right? It's a booze delivery company, yeah.  Drizzly never did any delivery.  I didn't realize this. They provided the backends  for your local liquor store to do  their delivery. So it was just a...  At a very high price, right? Yeah.  And actually I did it only once  in my life, and  to Bevmo,  and it didn't work.  I had to call Bevmo.  I said, where's my delivery? Three days later I paid for it.  They said, oh yeah, it's right here.  I said, what, would you bring it over?  And they said, next time  just use us. Don't use Drizzly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just curiosity, why do you hate  that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because then we have to talk about  the...  Clubhouse? People  at Andreessen Horowitz  and their high opinions of themselves.  Is it Ben or Mark you don't like?  I don't even want to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love this. We have tapped  a nerve. I don't know.  I'm not a fan either, but I'm just curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have never said a bad thing about Mark Andreessen  in my life and he blocked me. I cannot  understand why. It's because you know me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Let me just see what I'm missing.  It's not on Android.  So, Jason Freed's doing a  startup and product chat with Ryan Hoover  and Kevin Rose. Love those guys.  Cultivated WIC Club.  That's Baratunde.  Transitioning to  Tech and what we've learned. I don't know who...  Oh, Wesley Faulkner.  Because these are people I follow,  that's why.  Oh, my license. I've got to turn that around.  And Marshall  Arts and Fashion.  That sounds fun.  So, these are rooms you go into.  I can't play it because that's part of the  deal. You can't stream it or anything.  You can only have to be there. But last week,  10pm,  Elon Musk does a  little clubhouse.  5,000 people try to hear it. More people  show up. They have to do an overflow room than another  overflow room because Elon Musk.  He's Elon Musk. And then he brings up  the CEO of Robinhood.  But I should point out  all of these are Andres and Horowitz's  investments.  Every one of them.  So, it's kind of...  I think what it's...  I mean, it doesn't bother me because I...  And I shouldn't bother you, Stacey, or  anybody who's in journalism because  it did bother Jessica Lessin at the information  because she's worried that  with companies doing their  own journalistic enterprise, and frankly,  I mean, I wouldn't expect  anything coming from  Andres and Horowitz not to promote Andres  and Horowitz stuff.  Or at least worry about you.  I think that it's going to take over from journalism.  But I think people are going to know the difference and they're going to say,  no, I want to hear what Stacey thinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think there is a...  We're talking about it.  I think there has been a very...  Real Ren.  There has been a  confusion.  It's been happening for the last  probably 15 years.  And a lack of questions because some  journalists are not great at their jobs.  Or they're great at some parts of their jobs,  but they don't want to lose access.  True journalism  isn't sitting there and taking press  releases and talking.  You actually have to know something  about it. You have to ask the hard questions. You have to go  and find stories that maybe people don't want you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to tell. And you can't have investments in the  companies you're covering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And  there's... But there's a huge  audience.  It's non... For critical,  like quote unquote critical thinkers in the tech  industry, they are horribly  uncritical about the content  they consume. And it's just...  It drives me up a  wall. So this whole strategy is just...  It's this insular  bubble just getting... That's exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what Casey Newton says.  He says, I'm leery of any company...  Let me play Leo. Hold on.  Casey Newton says, I'm leery of any company  that thinks regularly talking to journalists  is beneath them.  And let's see.  Benedict Evans  has described Andreessen Horowitz as  a media company that monetizes through  VC. Well, that's interesting.  I would have thought the other way around.  That's interesting. Okay, go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my...  I think that once  most media and present  company is excluded, most of the time,  Leo, they see  all the time,  has gone  in moral panicky, has gone negative,  has gone dystopian.  I think that there's a different  perspective  that they just don't get out and they can do it on their own.  So I think the real import of this  is I'd sell your stock  in a PR company.  Oh, because that's who they're really

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bypassing.  That's who they're really bypassing.  It's not news, but PR.  They used to be the intermediary between  companies and journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now the other piece of this is  I'm not  completely pessimistic about  the quality of this, mainly because  I look at...  I'm a great fan of Ben Evans, and Ben was  an employee of Andreessen Horowitz as an analyst  for a long time, and his analysis  was always sharp and independent.  And  now he's truly independent,  and I value him greatly. By the way, his  annual PowerPoint extravaganza  is on the rundown this week, and it's  great and it's smart.  And so  they did foster Ben  before.  Any VC firm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hires the smartest

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people it can because they're trying to make  the best investments. So there are plenty  of great, smart people working  in these companies.  They may be obnoxious sometimes, but  there's a little bro culture  in some, but  I just think that  I don't want to see the  traditional media  replaced by, you know,  pet media, because  that's not going to benefit end  users. But I don't  think it will be. People are, I think,  smarter than that. It's going to be another source.  Look, Clubhouse has a lot of startup news.  That's, you know, it's like  it's all... And it will be  as soon as it becomes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's everything I  don't like. I was just going to say, it's everything I  disliked about San Francisco, right?  Yes, it's very much that. Yep.  Probably. You can't find  anybody who... I mean, you can, but you really  have to dig for it. Everybody  there is focused  on their tech. It's focused on their startup.  It's what can you do for me? It's very  focused. I don't like it either. I'm with you.  So, but  that being said, you know, Kevin  and I are going to do something.  We're going to talk about IoT.  Oh, drag.  Clubhouse?  Oh, tell me when. We have to. I mean, you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you don't have to. My impression is it  was just another extension of...  I hate saying it like this. It's like an  extension of YouTube for...  It's more like different influences. Yeah, for audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just don't have to do your makeup. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this stuff  has been around for years.  You know what? It's like  Meerkat. Remember Meerkat?  These things are always very fizzy when they start.  Right now, it's invite only.  As soon as it becomes open to the public,  it's immediately going to be the worst place  in the world.  And it'll be shut down in a year.  Honestly, there's no hope for this.  There's no hope for any social network like this  because people are horrible.  I'm not horrible.  No, you're wonderful.  But, you know, it's the...  I like people.  It's humanity I don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  TikTok is doing somewhat the same thing,  though, right? I mean, no, there's not... Yeah, but this is different.  It's long-form. One-to-one conversation.  When you go in these, it's a conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's very different, right? And it's long-form.  These go on for hours.  You know, Stacey and Kevin are going to sit there for hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we're not.  Because it's Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like...  I was going to say, when's dinner? I got to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe like, we will be here  for the next 30 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk. I've sat in on a few things.  It's, you know, it's sitting around the  pork barrel, the pickle barrel  and the B.S. and...  The pickle barrel.  I'm going to start a new one called  Pickle Barrel.  You can come and be in my pickle barrel.  It'll be Dilt Hawk.  Alright, get your pick ready, because we're almost  wrapping this thing up. I just have one more commercial  to do for our sponsor,  Cashfly. They're more than a sponsor.  They're a partner. In fact, they have been  for over 10 years.  When I say, you know,  bandwidth for Twitter is provided by  Cashfly at C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.  It's because it is.  They are... That's where you're getting  our stuff from. Video, audio.  Cashfly has been  innovating content delivery since 1999.  They saved our bacon  in the early days of Twitter. We were trying  to figure out, how do we stream? How do we do  this? Can't come off a website.  That was a measure of success,  I guess. But thankfully, Matt  Levine, who's the founder, came to me and  said, please let me help. And  well, the rest is history. We've been using  Cashfly CDN  content delivery network ever  since. And this is how  I can say with absolute confidence, they're the  best. Never have had any  problem. When you download our podcast,  they come in fast because you're getting them from  a server near you.  And that's one of the keys.  The new thing is ultra  low latency streaming. If you're doing live,  WebRTC  is okay, but this is not that.  This is stream delays of less than a second.  Less than a second latency.  They have an HTML5  player that offers easy support  anywhere with an SDK available, even  for mobile, which is fantastic.  And whether you need your player to run  on websites, applications, mobile devices,  or whatever platform, they've got you covered.  Again, can I say  it again? Less than one second of latency.  Anywhere in the world.  That's the thing about Cashfly. They have over  50 points of presence. Pops  servers all over the world.  That's the whole idea. You're going to get  your content from someone near you.  And it gets into those  Pops using their own low  latency background. So your  video streams will be streaming quickly  no matter what continent  your viewers are on or all of them.  Infinitely scalable.  Cashfly's ultra low latency  video platform can deliver video to  more than a million users  concurrently. It can ingest  thousands of synchronous streams  reliably too.  And they support everything. It's designed  to transmute thousands of streams  simultaneously with live failover.  RTMP,  RTMPS, SRT,  and more. They're going to give  your end users  ultra low latency SLDP or HLS  streams simultaneously.  Whichever one they prefer. Get a solution  that works for you, tailored  to your unique needs. And it's  all built on top of Cashfly's amazing,  amazing, robust  global network.  With ingest and delivery no matter  where you need it anywhere in the world. Best of all,  24-7, 365  priority support. There's always  somebody to talk to. They have the best  engineers there. And I love  what they've built here. One million  concurrent streams. Amazing.  More than. And up to  five times faster than other CDNs.  It's the world's most reliable CDN  backed by a 100%  SLA.  It's as good as you can get. Cashfly's  helping out people during  COVID-19 by supporting  World Central Kitchen. They've already donated  over $50,000. There's  more to come. They're serving warm meals  to people struggling  during this very tough time.  Cashfly, I don't know if you know this, they  pioneered Anycast, the Anycast CDN  infrastructure, way back in  2002. And their best  top technology automatically finds  the fastest route to and  from customer origin across  that global network of pops I was talking about.  That way you get maximum performance and reliability.  We could not be  happier with Cashfly.  Find out what Cashfly could do for you.  No pressure. No  just informative.  They'll give you a complimentary detailed analysis  of your current CDN bill and usage trends.  If you are thinking  maybe you need something better, maybe  you don't have a CDN, maybe  you want ultra-low latency streaming,  maybe you're overpaying and you want to save,  twit.cashfly.com.  Bring them your current  bill and your usage trends and  see what they can do for you. No pressure.  Just information.  twit.cashfly.com.  They've been a great partner.  We are so grateful to Cashfly.  The chat  room reviews are coming in. I love this  show but it's the smuggest show on  twit.  And they  say yeah that's part of its charm.  So the smugness continues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't  want to be smug. We're not smug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're just better than everybody  else. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think I'm better

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  than anybody else. I know. I put words in your  mouth. Stacy Higginbotham,  would you like to give us  a pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am going to be a little promotional  today but only because I want  to help you out. Not because, I mean,  yes it does help me out. It's for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're doing it for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wink has been down

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for a week. Oh I was going to ask you  about this. Somebody called me on Sunday.  I'm so glad you brought this up. Are they  still down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were this morning last night.  What the hell is going on? Right before I publish this story.  Yes, they're still down. They're struggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is going on since the  25th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah,  yes, that's true. And they did  give people a discount. So I  have a Wink subscription or I had one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I no longer have one.  The story so far, people bought  the Wink device free  service. Then they realized that's not  a financial model. Earlier  last year they started charging people five  bucks a month. That's  a financial model but everybody was pissed off.  Now they've been down for more than  10 days and I'm wondering if it's related.  Like,  what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, who knows?  So, yes, so  we don't know and believe me, I have  spent probably like a whole  week of my life trying to get in touch with  Wink. If I look back on  my efforts.  Just as a journalist like, hey, what's up?  So,  I did a story. The  idea was the reason you  stick with Wink for the most part, for most  people, is because you still have Z-Wave and  Zigbee devices that you  like and you don't, they don't work with  well, okay, Zigbee devices  can work with Madam A  or the Echo, some of the Echoes  but not all of them do.  And so for those people  out there who are like, I got  all this Z-Wave gear, what am I supposed to do?  I tried to create a rundown of  options. What I discovered though  is most of those options are sold out.  So it's kind of  it's kind of sucky.  But in order,  like, and what I did is I wrote a post  and this is in order of like ease of use.  How in, y'all are, the audience  here is pretty tech savvy.  So without smart things  you're probably like, that's cool.  I could probably load some software  onto a Pi and get a Z-Wave dongle  and use something like Home Assistant.  But, you know, your options are smart  things, they're no longer making their  hardware. Oh, no. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they were bought by Samsung. They announced this.  They're going out of business. No, no, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They're just going to focus  on the software. So they pushed, so it's  actually been very difficult to find a smart  things hub. Aotech  is going to be making them.  But they're not available yet here  in the US, which is frustrating. So they'll be  available in a couple weeks according to smart things.  The other one that'll be available later  this month is Eslo.  This is a brand you may not have heard of, but it's  VeraLite, Centralite, or sorry,  Vera, Centralite, and Fortress came together.  And then the other  option that's still sort of easy for  people, like normal people to use, is something called  Hubitat Elevation. But that's also sold  out. So all your easy options are kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of not on the market. I told the guy who called,  I said, this is the problem with going  through a third party server.  You would be better off running your own server.  And so I  mentioned Hoops. Would that be a  good alternative? So in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Micah, Micah pointed out that  because I had Kevin try Hoops,  that's a home bridge connection.  With Hoops,  you still need to have a Z-Wave radio  if you want to bring a Z-Wave device in.  So that's  a note. And the same  with all of these. So  there's Home Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could buy the Hoops for 169  bucks. Does that include the Z-Wave radio?  That doesn't have a Z-Wave radio. Oh, you still have to get a  separate radio. Yeah. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  both Home Assistant, Open Hab,  and Home Bridge or Hoops,  you're going to have to buy. Yeah, that's the other thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I told them about Open Hab. I didn't  know about the dongle. But I just said running your own server  that you wouldn't have to worry if they go out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right? I feel like you should run  if you're going to do anything, run Home Assistant.  Because there's more people. I like  Open Hab. I've used it. It was kind of a  trial. But it has  the biggest community. And when you're working with  like drivers for  weird devices, having a large community  really helps when you're like trying to  troubleshoot. Home Assistant. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  can you do your own hardware? Do you have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  buy their? You could do your own hardware.  They have a device called the Home Assistant Blue.  And the Blue is actually very powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this you don't  need to buy a dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do still need to buy a dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's alright. How much is a dongle?  Come on. How hard can that be?  It's a  Z-Wave dongle that has a Z-Wave radio  in it so that you can control.  If you don't have any Z-Wave, you don't have to worry about it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you don't have any  Z-Wave, then, or  yeah, if you don't have Z-Wave, dump Wink  tomorrow. Like today. Yesterday.  Get it out of your house. So was that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  purpose of Wink is to bridge Z-Wave  to Zigbee and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the others? So Wink when it came out  was actually really cool because it had  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Z-Wave. Which  was all the major home radios.  But it also had the Lutron  Caseta radio. So if you didn't  have the Caseta hub,  which I'm pointing behind me like it's still there,  but it's not. It was  living there for a while. But if you have that,  or you didn't need that  because they had the radio  raw, not raw to,  they had the Caseta radio,  I can't remember the protocol they use,  in that, which was really  kind of very unique and super

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  cool. So if I got  so here's a $45 Z-Wave  USB stick.  If I got that and stuck it into  Hoobz or Home Assistance Blue,  it would just work.  They would know about it. They would say, oh yeah, I see  you have a Z-Wave radio. Do I have to do anything additional?  You're going to have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pull a driver in for that. So you're going to want  to Google whatever Z-Wave. It does get harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and harder, yeah. Yeah, so whatever,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but that's why I think Home Assistance is great. Because  they have all these lovely  forum posts that are like, here are the dongles  that work. That's what you want. Something that's widely

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  supported. That's exactly right, yeah.  And this is your own  server. You're not connecting to  somebody's third party server out there in the  real world. All of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  these have the, I shouldn't say  all, most of these  have the ability, so Open  Hab, Home Assistant, and Home Bridge  are your own server. That's what I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was my suggestion to the guy.  Why depend on Wink  for five bucks a month when you could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it yourself? The reason is  because these, and they're all  getting better, but none of them are  as easy to use.  Yeah, so it's just easy, ease of use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Home Assistant Blue just came out  in December, so  they're trying, I mean, they're gradually  moving. The problem with all of this  is you have like the super nerds who want  to like configure everything and spend a lot  of time on it. But then you have  everybody else who's like, look, I just  want to set up a movie thing and I want to spend like  15 minutes setting up my movie  night set up and that's it.  And  as you meet those people,  you leave the other people behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a company  that sells,  so they don't sell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the, who's the company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is, I'm looking at, I'm looking at the  Blue, right, the Home Assistant Blue  Bundle is sold by a variety of companies.  Here's one, Ameridroid,  it's the only one in the US.  And this is  the bundle that they sell.  Oh, now they, yeah, some people might

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have a bundle with a US

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I'm wondering. Yeah, this includes a whole  bunch of additional little  things, including Shelley stuff.  Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's a whole automation package.  Yeah. I've got some Shelley stuff coming  today. But,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  New Order's expected to ship in April.  So, yeah, you're going to be  offline for a while.  Yeah.  Wink might be, not online now if you're with Wink.  Wink might be back. Oh, no, that's not true.  No, you might be, because it says, I'm looking at February 3rd,  they posted on their website, that's today.  A fix has been implemented, we are monitoring  the results, most hubs are back online.  So, 10 days later, they're back online.  But that does not give one confidence.  If for 10 days you can't turn on your  lights, open your blinds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you could always do local stuff.  And to be clear, Z-Wave is local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they said, don't unplug your hub.  Because if you unplug it,  then it has to be authorized before you get  local control again.  So, they said, local control is not affected, but don't unplug.  That's not a good solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for everyone who's  arguing for the clapper,  I think that's actually a wonderful product.  I'm not kidding. Clap on.  There's no joke about it. Clap on. Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how far we've come in home automation  in the last 50 years.  Basically, a lot of it is a more expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  clapper with software glitches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I'm not going to ever do this.  I've learned my lesson.  Okay, so  that's some very good advice.  I'm so glad you brought this up, because I had meant  to ask you about it.  Actually, it was one of the first things I wanted to ask you  because of this question. There is a full  article about all of this at Stacy  on IOT.com. Where have  all the smart home hubs gone?  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the time passing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, that's like my car trips  when I was a kid with my parents  and their hippies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kumbaya, my lord.  Kumbaya.  So you have every one of them here  and pros and cons on each and links  and so forth. So that's really a  great article. I'm glad you wrote that and I will  mention that on the radio show this weekend  because I gave Leo's  half-assed answer. This is, your  ass is full on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? That's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I better switch over to Jeff  Jarvis and his number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So,  open up, I put down  six slides from Ben Evans' Mondo presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I started to go through it and there's just so many

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  slides. So slide five, I'd start  there. Hold on.  Hold on. Give me a moment.  Give me a moment. I'm finding the link.  What happened? I put  it down in my numbers. Oh, you put  it in the, oh, okay.  I was going to give you a line number but you hit that so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you moved it. You moved it. That's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  happened. No, I knew where it was earlier.  I had it open. Okay, slide  five.  Five. Five. Of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  great unbundling. So e-commerce  steps forward five to ten years. The pandemic  accelerated e-commerce by  half a decade to a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I don't think it's going to revert. I think this is  the new normal. Yeah. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On to seven. You can go one at a time  if you want. Seven. Online grocery

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is UK. These are habits  that are changed. This is the UK numbers.  But it's not going to change. Slide

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  nine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  glad you're not telling me line numbers. This is so  much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. That's why I wanted to overdo you.  So proportion of adults making  video calls at least weekly.  Right. Any is now about  73 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the UK reflects though use in the United  States. Like I don't think this is going to be the same.  I think we're bigger. Yeah. Yeah. But I don't even know  if the platforms  would be the same. Like WhatsApp is definitely  going to be lower in the US.  Yes. Absolutely true. I've got a question about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that. Because like who wasn't FaceTiming  or doing anything like that before. I mean like  we were all making video calls

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  before the pandemic. No. You're young  whippersnappers maybe. But not us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. Yeah. No effect. Even  with with young people. I mean  it was hard to get people to do video  calls. It was hard. We're so used  to it now. It's a grandparent thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just like  I think it's your business. I didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  spend all day on them. No. But I think it's your  business in particular. You were working  at home as opposed to family. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is business. This is what made  the huge change. Business. Slide  23. See I jumped ahead  here. Oh my God. I don't know if I can  sit there. Okay. You can go. You stop at any  time you want. No.  Amazon now delivering a third  of the parcels

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in the US. Ah this is US. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically equal to the  almost equal to the post office.  Phenomenal to me.  Slide 26.  Delivery employment has  already doubled. Crapy jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. No. They exist.  They're jobs.  Warehouse is the  red line and the black line  and delivery is the red line.  So both have gone up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  33 after we were  extolling. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  33. 33.
