I can smell the apple pie cooking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, it's pre-turkey twig.  The apple pie is in the oven, the turkey is brining.  Good day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know though, I bet you miss, I don't know, maybe you don't, a Brooklyn Italian Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do.  We did the traditional American meal growing up at Thanksgiving.  Christmas though, Christmas Eve is when we get crazy.  We could do the seven fish meal, Sicilian seven fish meal.  So yeah, I miss my mom's pasta because you know there's pasta at every meal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and Thanksgiving we would have the traditional, we, not me, but Italian types.  I'm Italian but we didn't ever do this but I wish we had.  You have the traditional turkey and everything else but you have like five extra courses with pasta and any pasta and all that stuff because you're not full enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, my mom's on any pasta.  Oh, me too.  Maybe I should catch a flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Capagool and you got your salami, your Genoa, your, oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Man, I'm eating Whole Foods tonight because of you, Leo.  It's my fault, my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a good Italian deli in San Diego?  That's what you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's, yeah, there's little Italy, there is a little Italy in San Diego but I'll tell you the truth.  I save it for when I go back to Brooklyn.  I, you know, I'm a snob about pizza and bread and fresh mozzarella here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like you can't have bagels in California.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had this conversation, Sarah Lane, she denies it.  She said, no, we have excellent pizzas, cornmeal crusts and I'm saying, that's not pizza.  That's not pizza.  That's a nice baked good but it's not pizza.  Wolfgang Papp.  It's a lovely pastry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the heretic of pizza.  You know, duck sausage pizza was the downfall.  It was the shark pizza that jumped over the pizza or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Jeff Jarvis sharking himself.  He's at home, obviously, taking a little time off but normally he's a professor at City University of New York.  I want to ask you about CUNY because I know there's been some protests there and some issues going on there too,  as with many universities across the country.  He's also the author of a fabulous new book called Public Parts about living in public and its benefits.  Thanks for being here, Jeff.  Do you smell any turkey cooking in your house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we're having friends over tomorrow and it's a culinary.  My wife, it was her idea and I can't cook.  I poison people and she said, oh, I'll work it out because they have,  one is kosher, one is vegetarian, one can't eat starch, vinegar or other things and one is picky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Only one? Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what we're having tomorrow.  I think we're having scrambled eggs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scrambled eggs.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is the original title for Paul McCartney's Yesterday, by the way.  Scrambled eggs.  All I want today is scrambled eggs.  That's actually true.  He wrote the melody without a lyric and he just vamped using the word scrambled eggs.  Trivia that's completely useless.  You learn something every day here on Twitter.  That guy with the beard, ceiling cat over here is actually Dan Patterson.  Oh, hi.  Oh, hi.  He's a frozen picture today because his Time Warner cable sucks.  So we couldn't get a Skype video and audio, but you sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, that's what matters, right?  Yeah, that's all that matters.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We only send people pictures because they demand it and because we have such a beautiful studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Silly audience.  Silly, silly audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dan, formerly with ABC Radio News, now you're starting your own podcasting business.  Damn your eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, that is correct.  I have decided that I should stop talking about the revolution and start joining it.  So we're not doing technology focus, but we're doing world political and business news for technology.  Awesome.  So in that case, Leo will bring your picture back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now you can have video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, actually, I'm always thrilled when I hear people doing it because I think that this is ripe for transformation, the media business.  But what scares me is that there are only a handful of us doing this and it's not good to be the only person in a category that scares everybody, including listeners, advertisers and me.  So I welcome it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you do, Leo, is validate that this is an absolutely essential medium.  I think so.  And good content is medium agnostic.  So you can do this as a podcast or a TV show or a video show.  If it's quality, people will come.  Do you have a name for the new business?  Well, there's a corporation.  It's called CoPoint.  But again, this doesn't need to be a plug fest for this.  We'll have several shows that start around the first of the year.  And I will be on the presidential campaign is my core competence.  Oh, how exciting.  This is Dan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is huge because you did a lot with Occupy Wall Street.  And I wondered, in fact, as you were doing this, how ABC radio news felt because you really were freelancing on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, nobody cared.  I would cover that.  And frequently I would talk to you and I would send Jeff messages on Google+.  And this community cared.  The technology community cared.  I would send it to my editors and crickets, crickets, crickets.  So, you know, there's an audience, but that audience may not be.  Well, I don't need to say disparaging things.  All roses and sunshine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's exciting.  And so follow Dan Patterson on Google+, of course, where you'll see the same beautiful picture of him and and find out more about what he is involved with there.  Google plus Dan Patterson with two T's.  So let's talk about the week in the Google News, starting off with more funereal music as Google kills even more stuff.  Jeff Jarvis on the mouth trumpet.  I know. I don't think you wanted to say that.  So Wave was already dead, but they're actually officially killing it.  I don't understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the steak through the heart.  Yeah, they just had to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They had to re-announce it.  Just to remind us.  I'm not dead yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They announced that they were stopping development, but they were just kind of keeping it around for a few months, which turned into a whole year.  Now they're saying that wave.google.com will no longer exist and that you can't you won't be able to write to waves after the first of the month.  And you should you should export your waves.  I think everyone who used wave is is pretty well warned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The rest of us has moved on, right?  They're not they're not still at Google.  The guys who did wave Google Maps is at Facebook now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sure what his brother's doing, but yeah.  And most of the wave team has disbanded and moved on to other other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Killed by app, will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go to Facebook.  How do you feel about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, TechCrunch is reporting that, you know, in addition to these products, Google is also at the very least downsizing, if not cutting a lot of their green tech initiatives.  Yeah, this is a little disappointing on the what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is they're going to kill all of their internal development they were doing, but keep open the external investments.  And this has been a yin yang in terms of Google.org is Google.org originally started by deciding there were invested outside things.  And then and then they got the technology hubris to say, well, we can do a better job.  So they did a lot of this effort in-house and now they're turning back around again in this focus thing.  You know, it occurs to me that under the irony of this is that that under Eric Schmidt, he was the adult supervision.  But under Larry, Google's becoming a grown up company.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is really interesting.  I find these these product, you know, these product cuts to be really satisfying.  Like, yeah, we all knew that Nala wasn't working.  It makes complete sense that it's not there.  And we all knew that buzz and and wave and Google Plus and all the social stuff and reader was all redundant.  And it's very clear that they're going with plus.  So it makes it makes sense to trim trim the rest of these things.  So I'm not sad about any one of these in this announcement.  I think that they all make complete sense.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This this really communicates self-confidence that Google knows what it is and why it exists.  And the 10 years prior to this, we all knew what Google did, but we didn't really know why it existed.  And now they're this focus is is communicating to the world.  Look, we are doing this and we are confidently pursuing this.  We're not just washing, you know, really wagging in this direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, although some things, you know, there's, for instance, saying, OK, what was it?  Was it null? Use Google Plus instead.  But some things to Google Plus doesn't do right.  Or Google Reader, Google Reader.  And Google. Oh, no, even more.  Google Connect, which I was using on my blog.  That was Friend Connect.  They said, well, just use Google Plus, but it doesn't do the same thing at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really. Right. Right.  And the Google Reader functionality is not completely available on Google Plus either.  So they are making some and we talked to Matt Howey about that.  He was pretty upset about it because it's something that he used a lot.  So, yeah, they laid off people with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question.  They're also getting rid of people when they get rid of beyond the ones who leave because you killed my app.  This isn't a cost cutting thing in any way, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It sounds like it's a focus thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, I think they're right.  Because they still need the talent.  They're still probably hiring talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would bet. Yeah, I would bet.  So Google Bookmarks.  This is what's really interesting is as you read this list, a lot of people are going to go, huh?  What? They did that?  Google Bookmarks lists, Google Friend Connect, Google Gears.  We already knew that was gone.  Google Search timeline.  That was a graph of history.  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it was kind of nice.  I don't think it required any maintenance, but fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but you want to keep the search results page simple, right?  Yes, you're right.  And you can still go to Google.com slash Trends if you want to see that.  And they still have the Ngram viewer, which I'm sure they'll call any day now.  Google Wave, Null, which was their, I guess their Wikipedia.  They started that about four years ago.  Null will work until April 30th, 2012.  You can download your Nulls.  See, there's a problem right there, by the way.  What? My what? Your Nulls.  My what? Your K-N-O-L-S, your Nulls.  It sounds like something out of World of Warcraft.  You can download your Nulls to a file or migrate them to WordPress.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they're partnering with these two other companies to kind of to move the Null functionality onto a WordPress based platform.  They're working with Solvatar and Crowdfavorite to create Anotum.  Anotum.  Anotum.  Which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least that's open source, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, and it's based on WordPress.  So I guess that's why they have some, they're cozy with WordPress or they're familiar with the format.  So that makes sense.  Sidewiki and Null on this show have been sort of representative of these 20% projects or side projects that no one used, that we talked about one show and that we'd ever brought up again.  Is there anything left in the Google sort of products list that we think should have been cut?  They killed labs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They killed labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I think you have to do that and I think you're exactly right.  It's a focus issue.  And that's, you know, Apple's a good example of a company that just said we're going to make these eight products or whatever.  It's not even that many.  Four products and that's...  Four focuses, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's a certain Orchid.  Orchid is no longer number one in Brazil.  Even in Brazil.  Yeah, even in Brazil.  Oh, now Facebook does.  Yeah.  And it does seem like it's pretty redundant with Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'll kill that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem, well, but here's the problem there.  And this happened years ago when my daughter was on American Girls site and Mattel killed it.  And the problem is that once you start a community, it's not your community anymore to kill.  It's the communities.  And so Orchid is the communities.  And there's some responsibility that follows there that you've gotten people into it.  They've got the connections there.  They're addicted to it.  And then, sorry, rug, pull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think, Jeff, while I would absolutely agree that that is the correct way to proceed, I think it is still good.  And that's actually one of the core issues with putting so much of your trust and your brains, your smarts, your energy, your creative output into a system that you don't control.  I know.  This is Google's to kill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the web now.  I mean, unless you own your own lamp server and running WordPress.org.  Right.  That's the web.  I mean, how many people have Tumbl logs, WordPress.com blogs, blogger blogs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  It's a discussion of principle, I think, you know, in local government opens a park and then decides to close the park because it just don't want anymore.  And we're all little kids do.  Yes.  This is common space.  This is a new tragedy of the commons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the misconception, though, is that this is a common space.  Right.  But it's a common space that is owned and controlled and operated privately.  And so without the ability to take that and go.  And of course, there is Google takeout.  But one of the things that they really, really need to do is stress how you can do something with this data once you've taken it out.  And we make the mistake of saying, well, it's a common space.  It's our community.  We can do what we want here.  And a company comes along and says, no, we own and operate this.  Get out.  We're close.  I mean, I agree with the reality check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what I'm trying to say is something different that I think that we have the opportunity on a lot of things like net neutrality and other principles to hold a company to a principle.  And at some point, if a company creates a community, creates something we depend upon and if they go bankrupt, they go bankrupt.  That's life.  But if they if they decide to toy with you and just do it, you know, I think they need to suffer more ire than they do.  I was very mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have right is that if you break this trust relationship with us, your community, we may not come back.  But but you can only do that if you have leverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think I think, you know, look at look at delicious Yahoo, you know, language and what nowhere was going to kill it.  And then people came along and got it.  And Yahoo let them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I would just say that this is a lesson learned for all of us.  And it's not a bad reminder to have that most of the stuff we do on the Internet, we don't own or control.  It's our content.  But Twitter, Facebook, I mean, ninety nine percent of what people do on the Internet is owned by an individual corporation.  I mean, that's why I like the idea of diaspora.  I don't know if it's going to go anywhere, but that because it was federated.  That's why I like the all the things I I for this reason, I preferred status net, for instance, identica over Twitter, diaspora over Facebook, you know, Linux over any.  And, you know, it's like it's nice.  It's politically and philosophically nice to say it should be open.  It should be distributed.  No one should own it.  But it doesn't work or something.  Yeah, it just doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just not easy for regular people.  There's not an easy way to set up federated nodes, a federated network and get the kind of users that you get at Twitter, Facebook.  I mean, we deal with this I think up all the time after the ThinkUp 1.0 release.  Everyone said, well, no one has a server.  And it's like, well, I mean, we could start a hosting company.  You know, we can have a hosted solution that sucks in all your data and host it for you.  But that doesn't solve any of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a perfect world, each of us would have our own lamp stack server in the closet and run all of our stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  But then Time Warner will come along and you won't be able to get to it because there's no bandwidth.  Right, Dan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly what I'm doing.  I don't have a server in the closet, but I have a server.  You know, I have hard drives and I serve my everything is backed up to those and I serve my own WordPress site from there.  Yeah.  Now, to the...  But I use...  I do the same thing with my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a WordPress site on...  And SoftLayer is a web hosting company that I'm on.  But I'm also...  Well, I guess if SoftLayer went belly up, I could just take it and move it to another hosting company.  So they don't have their fingers in that pie.  We're all interdependent.  You can't be...  You can't help but be interdependent.  Right.  You're not an island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Dan's point about, you know, Google offers Google takeout.  So great.  So I export my data.  Then what?  And Facebook, you know, gives you...  You export to HTML.  Then what?  Then what?  It's basically useless without being connected to the community.  Hey, I've got a bunch of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got a massive ad.  I've got a massive XML file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or even worse, an HTML file with your assets.  So the images, the video, the audio in different places, in different folders.  So trying to find something that'll recompile that so you can import it to work.  Like just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's not their fault.  I mean, I think...  I mean, with all due respect, I mean, there's only so much we can expect.  They at least give it to you.  And then if you're a true geek, you can write your own routines to make something out of it.  Or somebody else can.  You know, Tumblr or somebody could create a routine to import it.  I mean...  Well, is it really Google's job to make it usable in some other form?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It isn't, but it sort of reveals the flaw.  I mean, it's great to say, hey, we liberate your data.  But the reality of your data liberation is that you wind up with an XML file.  I don't want Fitz to be mad at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just don't want Fitz to yell at me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I admire and honor what they do with the data liberation front.  Oh, I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I absolutely do.  I was asked when I gave my spiel about...  Yeah.  ...at Google in New York.  Jeff has just held up his public parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to say it out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, somebody said, OK.  Somebody asked, you know, what do we do about this?  And I said, that's the moment when you say good questions so you can buy yourself time to come up with an answer.  And, you know, I think what we do is we do create more and more and more open source things.  We need more Apaches and more even though I use Chrome, I always know that Firefox is there.  Wikipedia is there.  And it makes me wonder that if you were a foundation or someone like that, the investment in helping to support a Mozilla is miniscule to nothing.  You know, this goes to Clay Shirky's cognitive surplus thing where, you know, if you have the right people who really know what they're doing, what could we build?  It also excites me about the notion that a hashtag now cuts across platforms and you can move it.  We do have to worry about this architecture.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're talking about Google, the cloud, architecture, federation, all the important things in life this show covers.  And that's because we've got such smart panelists.  Of course, Dan Patterson joining us.  I want to say from, from Dan Patterson.  That's where he's from.  What's your website?  From the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From the Internet.  DanPatterson.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  From Dan Patterson.com.  That's all I need to say.  Jeff Jarvis of the City University of New York and Public Parts.  That doesn't sound right either.  And Gina Trimani of SmarterWear.org and ThinkUpApp.com in a bit.  I'm going to receive some affirmation, some personal affirmation of, for my opinion, from a major celebrity.  But first, a word from Ford.  Ford.com slash technology.  You got to go there and find out more about what Ford is up to.  We talk about all of the great things that Ford Sync does.  You know, you could talk to your car like Siri.  You could tell it to call somebody.  You could tell it what music to play, what temperature to make the car.  You could tell it, say, where's the nearest gas station?  What are the best gas prices?  But I got to, I always forget to say the most important thing.  And by the way, it's a great GPS that really gets you where you're going.  It's the best I've ever used in any car and I've used them all.  Standalone or car, this is the best.  You got a nice big screen in the center console.  It tells you where you're going.  You even get with my Ford Touch arrows behind the wheel so you don't have to look down.  It talks to you.  It says turn left here and then the arrow shows up.  I mean, there's some really nice features to this.  They've also added, and I like this, in Sync Services, they've added a whole new online account.  So for the first time, your car has a web page, basically.  Actually, with syncbyride.com, you always had a web page.  So this is even more.  This is Sync Services, something new.  For instance, you could be using Google Maps or MapQuest and send your destination to your web host.  You don't have to, to the car's website.  And then from there to the car.  So you know, oh yeah, I'm going to be going here and you send it and the car picks it up.  They've got now a new database with over 40 million businesses.  Everybody's in there, including telephone number and directions.  So all you have to do is call up the business and it'll say you want to call it.  It's very easy to use.  And they have an app for Android and iPhone that lets you manage this account and even send yourself traffic alerts.  So you say, well, I'm going to be going home later today.  And your phone will text you if the traffic's getting bad.  I mean, things like this are just awesome.  They've really got to focus on consumer electronics.  You can find out more about it, of course, by going to your Ford dealer.  Drive that 2012 Ford Focus.  It's got all the do-hickies, all the features.  Or visit ford.com slash technology, a great website with descriptions and videos on everything we're talking about,  like that great EcoBoost engine that gives you the fuel efficiency and performance you're looking for,  the electric vehicle that's next in my Ford future,  that Ford 2012 Focus electric, the hybrids, the plug-in hybrids, safety, security, connection.  It's all there.  Ford.com slash technology.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  So I told you last week I was talking to PubCom, formerly WebWasterworld, big SEO convention.  And I said Google is dead.  I said Siri and other technologies are going to re-intermediate search.  And I don't think, because of social search and technologies like that,  there's not a whole lot of future for Google.  And they hated me because they spent their whole last four years figuring out how to optimize for Google.  Well, I'm not alone.  Look, Dexter agrees.  There might be a little profanity in this.  Listen carefully to Dexter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's not much I can do with any turned puppy dog watching my every move.  You know, Google's kind of five minutes ago, right?  Try Elliot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Elliot. It's the new Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It uses a targeted algorithm to aggregate content and not get tripled by my CPA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any turned puppy dog has skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, so five minutes ago, try ElliotSearchEngine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So five minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that hysterical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  What's funnier to me is what we have in the rundown is that someone gets self-righteously mad about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, uses an algorithm to aggregate content without getting tripped up by SEO BS.  I'm in trouble.  Actually, I have to say Robert Lloyd-Lewis, who produces Dexter, is a big fan.  And I wouldn't be surprised if Robert just stuck that in there for me.  Thank you, Robert.  No, I'm sure he didn't.  This show was written, I'm sure, long before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's that TV conflation of SEO with spam.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know what, Gina?  Yes and no.  Okay.  Yes and no.  Two illustrations.  One, some media sites I know go so nutty about trying to get page views, page views, page views, and use SEO that they lose.  This is the discussion we have with Leo.  A post I started writing and never did.  And you can grow too big.  And Leo is too smart for that.  And he grows twit to the size of actual relevance and people caring about it as opposed to junk traffic.  That's example one.  Example two.  I was just looking for a doctor for a specialty, right?  It is impossible to find anybody.  Now, first, because doctors are idiots and they don't create web pages and they don't create blogs and that's their professional mistake.  But even within that, then, all you have is SEO bait.  You have list these directories of doctors that actually tell you absolutely nothing one after another after another.  So it's the fact that SEO created this this industry of baiting SEO.  That's the problem.  Now, is that is that the search engines fault that cuts?  No, it's not.  Don't worry.  I'm not going to say that math, but it is the result of the phenomenon of being able to bait the search engine.  Well, that's that's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Search and the rules of search are like a framework.  Kind of like, you know, Rails framework.  Right.  There are certain rules and those rules will will attract two primary personality types.  One is like a used car salesman.  Now, there's there's lots of good people who sell used cars, but it will attract that quick hit.  I want to to figure out how to make money and how to reach an audience very, very quickly.  The other type is the engineer, the geek, the nerd, the person who likes putting puzzles together.  Unfortunately, one personality type is far more in greater abundance than the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to Elliott search engine dot com, by the way, you'll get a Facebook game.  Talk about talk about SEO.  It's all about Dexter.  But I think that that's it.  It's cross marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I just thought I'd throw that in so that we could.  That's a little I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the TV Easter egg.  Yes, I think you see more and more of that.  I'm sure the creator of Heroes, who's doing something for getting delighted.  Thank you, Tim Craig, delighted in doing that and put in, you know, he would put in a business card with a small email address and know people would have to stop the video and blow it up and figure it out.  And then he had something there for them when they went there.  It's really smart, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  I think that that's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a smart way to give a nod to your really loyal, interested viewers, super engaged viewers, which more and more of us are because we're all getting nerdy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  And we all have DVRs where we can pause it and blow it up and get to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, in the long run, these engaged viewers are the most valuable viewers.  Those are the ones you really want.  So you're going to play to them more and more, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Leo, you're the one who's smart enough to see that.  Crane is smart to see that.  But media as a whole is not.  That's where SEO comes in.  Right.  Numbers, big numbers, mass.  Right.  We'll sell it to dumb out.  It's media's fault and advertisers.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right.  It's all about mass numbers.  But that's going to, I'm convinced that's going to change.  Google Doodle this week is Thanksgiving.  They launched it early.  And this is just the G-plusification of everything.  Look at that.  G-plus share right on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First shareable logo ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's, I mean, when they said we're going to put G-plus everywhere on Google, they meant it.  They weren't kidding.  It's on the Google Doodle for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a fun Doodle.  It's a fun Doodle for the kids.  But there's a really cool Doodle going on in Europe right now.  And I wonder if Google timed this so that the Europeans didn't feel left out of the Thanksgiving Doodle.  If you go to google.co.uk, it's a really neat Doodle that's homage to a science fiction writer.  Oh, Stanislaw Lem.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is wild.  Lem is an amazing guy.  He wrote Solaris, which people might have seen the George Clooney movie of the same name.  There's actually been two movies of that.  And I know about it because Audible just commissioned, there never was a good translation of Solaris.  It was translated from Polish to Russian to English.  So they commissioned the first direct translation of it.  And you can listen to Audible.  So what do I do if I click it?  You click on the play button on the lower right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  There's a video that has somebody playing it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there goes the robot.  Is there audio on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel sorry for our listeners who don't have video.  This is really cool.  So it's a pen and ink drawing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the bot is walking along.  Here's a giant robot.  Lem was a science fiction author, as you might have guessed from Poland.  You have to answer the question, Leo.  Oh, two plus two equals four.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We know that, but it's going to be a tricky way to get there.  The next one.  Okay.  Oh, I thought better of you.  What?  I got it.  No?  What?  Next one's trickier, how to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, look at this.  I see.  I get it.  I get it.  It's the segment.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Okay.  Got it.  Wow.  This is a very elaborate doodle.  It is extremely elaborate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Holy camole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this Flash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's not.  It's got to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not?  Oh, it's HTML5.  Of course it's HTML5.  HTML5.  It's got to be.  Yeah.  Yeah, but this is impressive.  Wow.  So when it slams like that, does that mean I got it wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you got it right.  Let's do the next one.  I only know this because I watched the video.  Cheated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, this makes me love Google, but it's not a search engine.  It's an entertainment unit.  Yeah, it is.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know Google search used to be a place where you wouldn't stay very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I haven't even done a search and I'm stuck here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll be back in a half hour, audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, really?  Forget the show.  Can I do this for a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For those of you on audio, Leo is trying to go through a logical headache right now,  remembering his days of geometry and logic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fun.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm just doing trial and error.  It's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, that's cool.  The chat room, I'm sure in a second, will tell you what to do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is great radio, says 40 Thieves.  Wow, that's cool.  And all we got is a turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and all we got was an interactive turkey that you could share on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just tells you what Google thinks of US of Americans versus Europeans.  Oh, that's too hard for you.  You might want to click the turkey's feathers and they change color.  It's pretty.  Yay.  Share that on Google+.  Is this all it does?  Really?  Oh, I got a football helmet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you can customize.  You can change the feather colors and the headdress.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a randomizer too.  Look at that.  You pull the lever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Gina, the question you asked before about what else they should kill, turn it around  now.  What else could you imagine gets the Google Plus treatment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What else gets the Google Plus treatment?  Yeah.  I think, I mean, everything can get the Google Plus.  I mean, you can put a plus.  Everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everywhere.  Well, they've already put the plus bar everywhere, right?  That black bar is on top of everything now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, but like the plus sign and being able to share, you know, places and maps, you  know, the doodle results.  I mean, I get most excited about the things where you can make something unique and then  share it in the spirit of Mixel, which is that iPad app I was showing you earlier.  I mean, that's kind of what the turkey doodle does, right?  You customize the collage, you know, the customize the picture and then you share it.  And so I like to see more of that because I'm just interested in.  Oh, see, I'm an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I shared it without customizing it.  Look at my pretty turkey.  It's so good.  So Google Plus has also added trends, right?  Trending topics.  Where are those?  Oh, are those on the left or the right?  I couldn't find them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that for you to do a search?  I think.  Oh, I couldn't find them either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was reading the story and I didn't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Try this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me read the story.  This is from Search Engine Land as usual.  Danny, Danny has it first.  He nails it.  Let's see what Danny wrote here about how to get trending topics.  I've always thought Google Plus was a lot more Twitter than it was Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's once you do a hashtag search on the right hand side.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you know, if I just I just searched for the word Facebook and on the right, just to be funny.  And on the right hand side, it says trends that now they all have to do with Facebook.  No, they don't.  Unless well, Green Bay Packers.  I don't know. Maybe they do. I don't know.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Breaking Dawn, Dancing with the Stars.  Yeah, this is just these are basically Twitter trending hashtags, but they're not hashtags.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're just how funny that you don't see until you do a search.  Google's not being pure about the hashtag by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something's really slowed my system down.  I can't type anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, hashtags are just search terms.  Right. I mean, and the hashtag itself is kind of kind of geeky.  I mean, it's been embraced by our community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I saw Christmas scene is post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got other things, slashes and dashes and, you know, abbreviations.  I was like, Oh, God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really already. I can't read Twitter.  It's gibberish to me.  Maybe it's my age.  It's like there's too many.  It's all this people are using hashtags as ironic commentary now.  Yeah. It's like, stop that.  Stop that. Don't do that.  Use word. Use your words.  Rose, please.  All right.  My there it is. Trends breaking down.  Yeah, I mean, the same ones breaking down.  Dancing with the stars, Green Bay Packers, Lady Gaga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why would the trends only come up on search?  Why wouldn't they be there all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and of course, we didn't mention it, but they've got this new little tab bar on the right right now.  It's just YouTube.  But eventually, I imagine other Google features will be over here on the right, too.  You know, that that weird tab that as you scroll down comes back.  It's so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it is a little.  That is a little weird.  But I mean, I'm really interested in those collaborative experiences like that, watching a YouTube video with friends.  That's me. I'd like to see more of that.  Right. Like I want to screen sharing pair programming.  Hey, take a tour of my favorite city on Google Earth or Google Maps with me or be able to replay it, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I have a feeling it's one of the reasons my browser is getting so slow is because Google is filled with these.  You know, look at this.  Now, when I move my mouse over YouTube, it slides open and says, what would you like to play?  That is not functionality that belongs on Google Plus.  No, you're right.  That's that's nutty.  And it's slowing everything down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, I'm sorry.  I'm getting old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The BBC just had a story.  I didn't put it up on the list because I thought it was such BS, but they just were asking the question.  It is one of those journalist tricks.  Ask the question.  You know what the answer is?  Right.  Is you know, is is is Google Google?  The other second thing is you have somebody to deny something that doesn't exist.  So Google denies that Google Plus is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google denies it ever stopped to stop beating its wife.  No, it never started.  Google Plus is now in Google News.  Two, they're going to be social tools in the Google News.  We already have the plus one button.  But now when you sign into Google Plus, you'll see articles your friends have been read.  This is just it's over.  It's overloaded.  It's ridiculous.  And it's just going to get worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you search for the way for plus now, how do you get the New York Times brand page?  You just search for New York Times, right?  You just call New York Times.  But I'm not getting it.  Well, I guess you search Google for plus New York Times, not Google Plus.  Oh, that's weird.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It works for me in plus.  Yeah, plus New York Times.  Yeah, it even knows to add the the like I just type plus new and it it knew to show me.  It's not showing me.  It's doing a search.  It's doing a search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not doing that.  Are you putting spaces?  Yeah, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did it on Google.  I did a Google search, not a Google Plus search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I did a plus.  That didn't work for me.  That didn't work for me.  He W.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had to go to another page and outside of Google Plus and search there.  Are you following them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they in your circles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you have to follow them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know.  Well, that's yeah, you shouldn't have to because how would you find somebody new to follow?  It is an awfully long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're they're they're they're slogans is all the news that's fit to plus.  This is not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not working for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New York Times is a search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They'll go to a plain Google search, go up to your bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that doesn't that's there.  See, I know that's wrong.  I know it's doing a search.  Do you mean New York Times?  No, I mean, oh, all right, Google, let's try it from here.  This is I don't know.  Your times to the plus plus.  New York.  Yeah, now I know.  Now exactly right.  It goes to it won't work in Google Plus, but it'll work in the Google search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The point of all this, which was not worth the travel, was notice the slogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the news is fit to plus.  Boy, yeah, Arthur Oaks Salzberger is spinning in his limousine, stretch limousine.  That's interesting.  He said we won't be a print newspaper in 10 years, and he said that about five years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So all right, here's the next one we have in the rundown.  There's now a Barack Obama Plus page, which is his campaign.  So it's fundraising.  I can't figure out how to get to it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't just Barack plus Barack.  No, no, no.  Plus Barack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plus Barack.  No, it doesn't work for me either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it just works for you, Gina.  It's working for me.  I have both of those in my circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have both in your circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, once you've circled them, it should work, but you should be able to do a plus search.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just did it both.  Uncircled and circled work just fine.  Click the first name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Click this.  See, this is going to give me a search for Barack Obama.  Yeah.  That's what it gives me.  Dan Patterson's article.  Outstanding.  Yes, it has good taste anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clearly.  What I think is most interesting about this, I remember 2007 and 2008, I was covering the  presidential campaign at the same time.  Twitter was out.  I was using Twitter, but mainstream America.  If you remember, it wasn't until around the time of President Obama's inauguration in  2009 that Twitter really tipped, that the social web tipped.  And that wasn't that long ago that that OFA or that that President Obama's campaign has  set up a Google Plus page.  We kind of take for granted right now.  It's not a news story.  Yeah, right.  It's not a news story.  But but we have changed so much in such a short period of time.  When we look when history looks back at this period of time, we will be remembered as you  know, this this recalls what you just said about the New York Times, that that we've  experienced so much change.  The dynamics of our conversations have changed so much in three years that this is, you know,  it's unprecedented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want you know, I was thinking the other the other day, if if you can say that things  are changing in a linear fashion or as Ray Kurzweil says, an exponential fashion,  exponential, it seems to be.  But I don't want to make it a given just because Ray says it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is where I argued last week that the changes actually slower than we think.  That's what I'm wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting, Jeff.  That's that's what I've been wondering, too.  You know, through through, of course, human history, it's been a lot slower than it is  right now.  There's no question that it's going fast.  But is it really exponential?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe that it is exponential, although culturally the change will happen at different  tempos and different speeds.  I can see this with the organization that I just left.  I mean, trying to get a damn Tumblr share button on one of their websites was three  weeks of negotiations and meetings.  Right.  And by the way, I mean, well, all right, it may be that the distance between us, right,  that our culture, the web culture, the tech culture is experiencing accelerated change  and the world is experiencing this change.  But but it's reflected in us as though it is very fast and it's reflected in other cultures  like traditional news at a much slower pace.  So the distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, all right.  That's fair.  But I also think that that assumes that we kind of know what the change is.  And if you if you believe what I think I are saying is that if you instead say that the  change is much vaster than we've yet seen, then in a hundred years you'd look back and  say, well, actually, no, the change was slow.  It was Gutenberg years.  We think it's huge and it is huge to us.  You're right.  But, you know, to an ant, a giraffe looks big.  But what if it's, you know, a sky elevator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this notion that it's exponential is predicated on Moore's law, primarily the  you know, Gordon Moore of Intel said that the chip processor transistor count would  double every 18 months, which is exponential.  And it seems that maybe not everything changes at the same pace.  I don't know.  I don't.  Sure.  And I think you make a good point, Dan, that culturally things change at very differing  paces.  You know, we got a lot of blowback on Twitter this week because we were talking about Google  Music and the panelists, Kara Swisher, Mike Elgin, Rafe Needleman from CNET and Kevin  Rose.  These are all, you know, cutting edge people.  They all just agreed.  Oh, well, it's too late.  Too little, too late.  Nobody.  We all.  Everybody's going to use subscription services.  Nobody wants to own music anymore.  And I got a surprising amount of pushback from the audience saying, what are they crazy?  They just accept it as given.  I accept it as given.  I think that is the case.  But I think there's an example of a cultural mismatch.  But there are people who are moving a lot faster and they've already seen it.  They've already said, no, no, Spotify.  Who's buying music anymore?  We don't need music anymore.  I mean, obviously there'll be a small number of people who will continue to buy music,  but I think it's pretty clear that subscription services mean that Google Music is too little,  too little, too late.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also think that there are some pretty qualifiable cultural benchmarks that we can look at, right?  We can look at a particular time frame and take some data sets and see how people communicated,  how they acted and how they consumed not just information, but products.  Right.  And we can look at the last five years and measure against those those benchmarks.  Right.  Say, take 1950 to 2000.  Right.  Very, very little change.  Now, of course, Jeff, what you're saying is true is, you know, the further out, the closer  we get to a 30,000 foot view, things are going to look a lot smaller.  But in terms of the context of contemporary history, right, say since the Industrial Revolution,  I would argue that we have made more change in the last five years than we did since the  Industrial Revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not judging it on that scale, Dan.  I'm judging on the scale of how much change is is still being caused by the the causes  we now see.  I don't understand that.  In other words, well, the example I used last week, and pardon me, I'm going to repeat for  sorry, chat room, it's we're going to get a get your glasses ready.  Obama's moment.  It's Gutenberg, Gutenberg moment.  That if you ask people in Germany in 1472, whether they thought Gutenberg would tear  apart the Catholic Church, change our notion of nations, change our spark, the scientific  revolution, change our notion of education, thus of childhood, they all say, yeah, you're  nuts.  We've been changing like crazy.  Look, the whole political structure has changed.  My God, we're almost done with the change.  Right. Change was much more than anyone then could see.  And I think we're in the same case now.  There's a wonderful book out ebook out called The Race or called Race Against the Machine  by Eric.  I'll mispronounce this Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee.  And I just read it.  And the example that they give is the old chessboard and grains of rice.  Yes.  Why? Right.  Right.  And what they said was when you get to the second half of the chessboard is when it gets  just so freaking beat.  It's the hockey stick.  That's what Kurzweil calls the hockey stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  It's the inflection point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they argue that we're there now.  So that's what Kurzweil argues as well.  We're undergoing a lot of change and that change seems very quick.  But I think that we're judging that pace and extent of that change on the analog of what  we knew in the last world, in the industrial world.  I think that I won't live to look back and say, yeah, that was the beginning.  That guy Jarvis got to live through the very beginning of it.  Man, he had no idea what was going to happen.  And the reason that matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I absolutely agree with that.  And that matters because I got criticized again recently.  I don't know why people criticize me.  I'm a nice guy.  In Colby and Jarvis' review, I went after Shirky and Jay Rosen and me for these future  news guru people and trying to protect the past.  And my response to that was going to, well, the response I haven't written, but the response  is, do you remember that great scene in broadcast news when Holly Hunter is with her boss and  her boss says, it must feel good to always be right.  And she said, no, it's awful.  An old mentor and boss of mine asked me about a year ago, well, it must feel good, Jarvis,  you were right.  And I said, no, I wasn't right.  I was wrong.  I never would have guessed the extent of the change.  I was obnoxious arguing that we were going to change like crazy.  And I didn't go far enough.  I wasn't loud enough.  And that's where I think we are now.  So the danger of saying, oh, my God, we've really seen a lot, a lot of change is that  I think we may think that we're at some, you know, arc right now.  And I don't believe we are.  Oh, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't think making that argument is a binary.  I mean, I think that you can absolutely say we have experienced a ton of change in the  last five years.  And I don't think that excludes the change that we will see.  It's not a binary.  It's not an either or.  It is.  Yes, we've seen a tremendous amount of change.  But you're absolutely right in that predicting the types of changes that we will see with  these will it's like comparing chess to go.  Right, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, you're younger than a couple of us here.  Yeah, I must be really impatient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like the change isn't happening fast enough.  Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I wanted to know.  OK, perfect.  You're in a hurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get really frustrated when I see things like like Google+, which I feel like should  have innovated a lot more when I see things like the Nim Wars and and and conversations  about whether or not bloggers or journalists happening over and over again and whether  or not there should be more women in tech.  Blah, blah, blah.  I get like, oh, you know, I get frustrated because I feel like, you know, I want things  to move faster.  I want innovation to happen more often.  I don't I wish that the end now.  I'm very deeply embedded into the web culture and the tech culture.  And and I do feel like we're on the verge of a lot of, you know, wonderful big hockey  stick kind of change culturally, like widely culturally.  But I get frustrated with our tech community for not moving as fast or innovating as much  as I would like to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good Lord, if it goes any faster, my wig's going to fly off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you crazy?  You know, I don't know.  Maybe.  Well, I mean, Google Music, this is interesting.  So, Leo, you think that Google Music is is, you know, it feels like this catch up to  something that happened a few years ago because they're trying to do it to the future.  So does that frustrate you?  It's like, well, you know, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it doesn't frustrate me because fortunately we have Ma Gardeo, Spotify.  We have all these subscription choices.  So I don't feel frustrated.  But I wonder if this is a sensible strategy for Google or Apple.  You know, where I do feel frustrated is that and this is where change is too slow, is that  entrenched powers that be like the record industry don't get it, don't support it,  pull out, try to kill it.  You know, Time Warner's trying to kill your Skype, Dan, because they want to sell VoIP  products, you know, all of these entrenched powers that are saying, you know, they're  they're they say the barbarians are at the gates and they're holding the door closed.  That's frustrating.  But in some ways, I think change happens so fast that that's you know, I personally I  think I love change.  I think that's why I got in this business.  But most people don't feel that way.  And even our audience change the website and see what happens.  You know, I think a lot of people wish things would not change, you know, or we get used to  stuff and we wish it wouldn't change.  I just I don't I think we've accepted it as canon that change is exponential and that we  are in the hockey stick, you know, at the elbow of the hockey stick.  And I just wonder, I mean, yeah, there's evidence for that.  But I think you hit the nail on the head, Dan.  It's not uniform.  It and in fact, who was it said that the future is already I think was William Gibson said  the the future is already here.  It's just not uniformly distributed.  All right.  That kind of says it all.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more in a bit.  I'm going to show you I love Samsung because they they have come back with such a slap to  Apple that I and I'm very curious to see what the reaction is going to be from the Apple side.  I just think you're going to get trouble for showing that.  I know.  And I hope I do.  I think John Gruber's head must be exploding right now because it's aimed actually at him.  But before we do directly before we do that, let me just briefly say Netflix.  Here's an example of the future writ large.  Netflix started as a DVD by mail company.  Right.  And you can see they've struggled a little bit with this as the content companies, mostly the movie industry, have said, no, no, no.  You can only have three copies of that popular movie or you can't have it for a month after we start selling it in the stores.  It's been very difficult with physical media.  But you know what?  They're smart.  They saw greed Hastings.  He's a brilliant guy.  He saw the physical media is history.  Again, when I say stuff like this, people go, what about we need our DVDs and CDs?  No, streaming is the future.  Let me tell you.  And Netflix streaming, they've doubled down on that.  Not only is it only seven dollars ninety nine cents a month for just a huge amount of content, but now did you see they just they're bringing back arrested development.  They're going to produce it.  They're producing programming.  This is the future right here.  And if you haven't yet been watching Netflix streaming, you've got to check it out.  It's actually what's killing Dan Patterson's bandwidth right now, because everybody's doing it.  I just read it.  I read somewhere one third of all Internet traffic is now Netflix, one third of all Internet traffic.  And why?  Because it's great.  Now, I know all you already have it.  So here's my thanksgiving prayer.  My wish for those of you in the U.S.  I know Canadians, it's too late for you and the rest of the world are going, thanks.  But for those of you in the United States, please, when you sit across the table tomorrow from grandpa and grandma, uncle Jim, sister Betty, all the people who don't use Netflix yet, just do this for me.  Just say, hey, you know, there's this great thing you can do on your computer.  You can do it.  Most Blu Ray players.  You could do it on your computer, your iPad.  You could do it on your Xbox 360, your PlayStation, your Android phone, your Android tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you can watch movies any time you want.  It's only seven dollars, ninety nine cents a month.  But uncle, uncle Jim, aunt Betty, Netflix dot com slash twit.  It's free for the first month.  Don't tell anybody.  And of course, they'll tell everybody Netflix dot com slash twit.  Help us spread the good cheer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This Thanksgiving holiday.  Tell all your out of touch in laws about have you told Gina?  Have you done your mother in law about Netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Good.  I will do that right after the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Netflix.  Then she won't be hogging your TV.  Say here's an iPad.  Go in your room.  Netflix dot com slash twit.  And you're going to give her some Dr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dre headset.  It's a beats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She needs the beats.  You know, thank you, Netflix, for your support.  I was wondering if those Dr.  Dre headsets were any good because I tried to I tried to figure because I thought, oh,  this is just these are probably terrible headphones.  They're actually I read some reviews are pretty good.  Yeah.  Howard's really monster.  The monster.  I don't like monsters.  I don't know if there's a company mostly because they sue people.  We use the word monster.  Yeah.  And they were selling those thousand dollar HDMI cables or whatever.  But actually, apparently they're pretty good headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not doing it.  Yeah.  Well, the Joe Frazier grill of the age.  Yes.  The George George Foreman George Foreman.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did the same George Joe Frazier.  George Foreman except it must be an age thing.  Because he won one of them just died.  That's right.  And so I was talking about the fact it was a Netflix ad.  In fact, great documentary on Netflix called When We Were Kings.  And it's Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.  No, I'm sorry.  It's Muhammad Ali and Joe and George Foreman.  It's the it's the rumble in the jungle, not the thrill in Manila.  So that was my confusion.  But it is an amazing it was it was an early Ali fight.  It's an amazing movie.  If you've not seen it, just a great documentary.  But it was against George Foreman grill man, not Joe Frazier, the guy who just recently  passed away.  Sorry, that was a detour.  You know, this whole show is a freaking detail.  We don't know where we're going.  We have no idea.  It's all my Ford.  So we're enjoying it.  It's all my fault.  How many of you seen the new Samsung ad?  It's worth it.  Let's play it.  Yeah, it's worth playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just watch.  I shouldn't even say it's a Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so amped I could stay here for three weeks.  Nine hours down and we're almost in the Dilla.  I think two people just left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would they be leaving when we're only nine hours away?  Yeah, I mean, this is an event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, blogs are saying the battery looks sketchy.  It looks the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How will people know I upgraded for G's for G's?  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She got there.  Not sure.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guys.  Whoa.  Hey, bro.  Can we see your phone?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a difference.  Have you seen this thing?  Check out the screen.  This thing is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty massive.  And it's got 4G speed.  It's magnificent.  Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung?  That's a Samsung.  Yeah.  I could never get a Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm creative.  Dude, you're a barista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why don't you guys just get 4G phones?  Why do you just get 4G phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For Galaxy S2, this phone is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Samsung's 1984.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Dude, you're a barista should be the wazapa of the age.  Dude, you're a barista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could never get a Samsung.  I'm creative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I disagree with that, Leo.  I don't think this is Samsung's 1984.  In fact, the 1984 commercial designed to convince you to come to Apple, right?  Right.  It's aimed at a market of people who are new and saying it's okay to come over here.  I think this ad is targeted at people who already own Samsung or Android devices.  To make them feel good.  Yes.  To reaffirm how they feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That might be.  I love how they put all the Apple fanboys behind bars.  They're in line waiting for their iPhone, but they're trapped behind these barriers  as the real people go about their real life.  They're looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're pretty relaxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  4G, 4G, 4G, 4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gruper was saying that this is sort of similar to the I'm a Mac, I'm a PC ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what it is.  It's a Switch ad.  It is.  But I think Dan's right.  It is to reaffirm your Android choice.  It's certainly not going to switch any Apple iPhone fans.  If anything, it's going to make them irate.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  I mean, the ad is really mocking iPhone users, which I don't love so much.  I mean, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love it.  It's funny because I use Android.  Fan girl.  Fan girl.  It is ironic because I'm using an iPhone right now.  But don't you think that the vast majority of people do feel that way about this small  percentage of Apple kind of hipster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even Apple people feel that way.  If you can't have the sense of humor to laugh at yourself.  And okay, who owns an iPhone, lives in a major city and has not waited in front of a store?  It's exciting.  It's an event.  You feel like a jackass.  I do it every year.  I feel like an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  I feel like these guys standing behind this barrier, looking at the world.  Look, they all have the white headphones and the lattes.  Oh my God.  It's it's it's a you got to admit it's kind of pitch perfect, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's pretty it's pretty good.  But Dan's point is really is good.  I mean, it's it's targeted toward people, first of all, who are better enough in the  tech community and know that this goes on.  I mean, you know, I mean, I guess most people know that this goes on, but it is about sort  of making us well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think this is a broadcast ad.  I don't know.  Do they?  I don't think they brought this is a YouTube ad.  They don't need to.  You just did.  Right.  Well, but that's my point is nowadays you really can slice the audience.  And when you put stuff on YouTube like the Old Spice guy responding to Twitter,  Twitter, Roddy, that's something that, you know, outside of that group, nobody would  get.  But it was a very effective campaign because they knew with a medium and they and they  work with me.  I suspect this is only a YouTube.  This is a YouTube only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Samsung doesn't need to buy.  They know this is the holidays.  Tons of human interest stories are coming up.  And somebody when some producer needs to fill 30 seconds of a human interest story on  network news and goes, oh, you remember that snarky ad?  We need to do something about Black Friday.  Let's put that in there.  This is the king of snark, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never seen a snarkier in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a Super Bowl quality creative without the business cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there is, you know, it's like a past.  I do think there would there were there might be, though, a business cost in the sense  that there could be some backlash from this.  What did Gruber say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He he said that this was reminiscent of the PC Mac.  All right.  The key difference was that Samsung is mocking iPhone users where that it was in the Apple  PC and the Mac PC ads.  Hodgman was the PC.  Right.  They're mocking the PC.  They weren't mocking the users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he was kind of lovable.  You didn't.  It wasn't mean in the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  I don't know if Gates would agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no.  In fact, Paul Serrata, our Windows, our Windows Weekly host, hated those switch ads.  I mean, he liked them, but he felt insulted by them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  But so I think there's a big difference between attacking the product and attacking the products  users.  And I think that's important.  You're very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This could be a very risky thing for Samsung.  In fact, I wonder if they weren't in such bitter legal action with Apple if they would have  done this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chris DeBona.  You got to love Chris.  Responds to.  I love this guy.  And all his hair.  I love him.  Yeah.  He's been on the show.  He works at Google.  McAfee says that malware, Android is a malware magnet.  New report says 2011 was the busiest year in history for mobile and general malware.  I agree with you.  Mobile malware.  I mean, yeah, there was some mobile malware.  It wasn't exactly an epidemic.  The amount of malware infected, according to McAfee, infecting Android devices during  the third quarter grew 37% over the second quarter.  I've been waiting for a mobile malware apocalypse.  I don't think that's happened yet.  Remember McAfee and the companies like this want to sell anti-malware solutions for mobile.  They see that as a huge opportunity because they're losing their windows market as Microsoft  puts out its own free antivirus in the next version of Windows.  There will be a built in antivirus.  So they've desperately got to find a new profit center and where better than mobile.  Although we've seen malware and we see malware on on on, you know, the Android market, Google  kills it very quickly.  Chris to bonus response.  He says the problem is that they say that it's it's inherently insecure because it's open  source.  And of course, that's not the case.  And we know that.  And so his his responses, as usual, right on a Serbic and and very nice.  I would agree with every point he makes.  And he did it where Google Plus and Google Plus.  Six hundred six pluses, seven hundred fifty six shares.  That's unusual.  You get more reshares than pluses.  That's very interesting.  And one hundred six comments.  A lot of engagement on that.  Good job, Chris.  He says every single consumer electronics devices uses uses tons of libraries from open  source.  There is no non open source mobile device, says especially open SSL.  Most C device apps are built with GCC, including the iPhone.  That's the open source C compiler.  And I have to say that I agree with him.  We said no major cell phone so far, no major cell phone has a virus problem in the traditional  sense that Windows and some Mac machines have seen.  There have been some little things, but they haven't gotten very far.  And this is why user sandboxing models and the nature of the underlying kernels mobile  is more secure by its very nature.  He says virus companies are playing on your fears to try to sell you BS protection software  for Android, RIM and iOS.  They are charlatans and scammers.  If you work for a company selling virus protection for Android, RIM or iOS, you should be ashamed  of yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like that.  I like that Chris kind of just tells you exactly how he feels.  There's no mincing words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I and I've been waiting for this virus apocalypse and I think he makes a strong case  that maybe it's not going to happen at all.  And certainly you don't need to worry right now.  Android or iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the base thesis here is I think it's easy to think that open source is less secure  because it's easy for hackers or evil hackers to see inside that your security model and  exploit it.  But it's actually the opposite is true.  The more eyes makes it more secure.  And that's been proven over and over again with the software that we all use every single  day on the web.  So this is a great piece though.  I'm glad that I'm glad that Chris posted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's get to our tip.  Our picks, our numbers.  In fact, we're going to get Dan to do a guest tip in just a second.  But first, Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Google search app for the iPad just got updated.  I know that a lot of our viewers don't have iPads.  If you have an iPad, though, this is basically I feel like Google's way of getting Chrome  to iOS.  It's really incredible.  Get the update.  Do a search.  There's really neat sliding tabs back and forth.  Image search results you can page through like a gallery.  It's really, really beautiful.  Android did not get this app.  And I think that's just because Google search on Android, you know, in what isn't really  Chrome, but I think will probably be Chrome eventually.  And their browser kind of works this way already.  And you already have that if you're using the Google search widget on Android, you sort  of have this already.  But if you're on iOS and mobile Safari drives you crazy like it drives me crazy, you definitely  want the Google search app and put front center home screen.  It's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you tried it, Leo?  I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really, it's really interesting.  They've got voice search in it.  I mean, they've had that before, but they have all of the apps, as you said, and you  know, and it's a browser.  So you mean it's the WebKit browser.  So you never really have to leave it.  I know actually a number of people who don't use Safari.  They use Google search as they think it's a browser.  A lot of people think it's a browser.  So yeah, highly recommended.  Well, you'll get it anyway.  I imagine everybody who has an iPad has the Google search app on it and you'll get it  as an update.  But get the update.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mobile Safari drives me crazy.  I still can't get used to having to tap into the search box, you know, that there's a  different search box.  You know, I'm so, Chrome has trained me now.  The bar is just so old fashioned.  It is.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The universal bar.  You search or URLs.  Why the distinction?  It doesn't.  Right.  And Apple of all people, you know, why?  What's get with the program?  Do you want to do a tip, Mr. Dan Patterson of danpatterson.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's it's less of a tip and more of just a gentle reminder.  And actually, we covered a lot of this at the very beginning of this discussion about  Google Takeout.  I just wanted to, you know, a gentle reminder instead of a tip that takeout exists.  And especially I was thinking about this with the sun setting of a lot of these these Google  products, particularly with things like Google Plus.  You know, Leo, I know you've been on this and everyone within the family and audience  has been on this for a long time.  But any time I enter even a single character into something like Twitter or plus or Facebook,  I go, that's not on my servers and it's not on an open platform that I can control.  And I discovered within the word.  This is for WordPress dot org users.  So if you're running your own servers within the plug ins, add new menu, if you do a search  for Google Plus import, you'll find a number of different tools that will import many of  your different platforms, but particularly the Google Plus stream.  It is buggy.  You do have to be kind of a developer and be able to modify some things and make sure  that that HTML file is properly formatted.  But if you do, it will go into your site on your platform that you can control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is cool.  And it formats it.  But so this would only work for a blog blog post.  Google Plus.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there are a number and I'm sure any wordpress dot org user knows that there are tons of bad  plug ins out there.  There are I've found three plug ins that are OK.  Nothing that is like a five star review.  But again, if you're comfortable with Google or with the wordpress dot org, you're probably  very comfortable formatting things yourself.  Which ones do you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the names of them?  Do you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Off the top of my head, I don't.  I don't want to.  But I'll put this up on Plus when I find it.  I'll put a link and I'll drop a comment in the show notes or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's a good thing just to know about.  I don't imagine there's a mass exodus at a Plus wordpress right now.  In fact, I doubt there ever will be.  But it's a good thing to know.  I think it's a good thing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the tools aren't that robust, but they're good enough.  And that's all we really need before the community can start working on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, for that exact reason, I've always imported my tweets into my wordpress blog.  So I have a weekly wordpress post that's all my tweets.  That way there's a record of it.  This was before Think Up and I just I still do it.  And so that's a good idea.  I do cross right now.  I cross post using Publish Sync.  So I publish everything Google Plus.  It cross posts to Facebook and Twitter and then is picked up from Twitter and brought  over to my blog.  So I guess in a way, in this indirect way, I have this happening already.  That's probably what you want to do.  It's not like you're going to move off Google Plus, but you might want your blog to something  you own to reflect the content you're putting elsewhere as a repository of it.  Right.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I found this about a week ago.  And with that exact that Twitter tools plug in, you can click and it'll take you over to  that tweet.  You know, Twitter search goes back four days.  But if you click the hashtag next to your tweet from, say, five years ago, I found stuff  from 2006 and 2007.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You search my blog, you're going to find everything I've posted on the blog, but also everything  I've ever posted on Twitter.  I think that's that is important.  Absolutely.  Good.  Good.  A good reminder.  Thank you, Dan.  Gina, you had a second tip.  Do you want to do that, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure.  I can I can mention it for sure.  The there's now a way you can restrict search results in Google.  Google search results just to applications.  And this is iOS, Android and not just Android Market, but Amazon and app app.  I forget the name of that other market, but several different third party markets.  So if you just do a Google search, it's on the left column.  Let's see. I'll do to do text and you can drop down in the drop down.  You have to click on more.  And there is a link now to just applications.  So you can see. Right.  So you can see results from the Android market.  So great.  From Android, zoom dot com.  There's a bunch of places listing.  That's generous of them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not just their app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not right.  And this works for iOS apps as well.  If you search for Mixel, which I was talking about earlier, which I really love, you'll see the link to to Apple's Web Interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And while we're doing sort of backup and just general PSA's before you go see your family for Thanksgiving, grab a thumb drive.  And save the Firefox or Chrome installer onto it before you arrive.  Your parents. Good.  They ask you to clean up their computer.  Next year, I'm going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do a campaign.  I was talking with Steve Gibson.  We all go home for the or if we go home for the holidays, that's the time to clean up, to upgrade, to install.  And I think that this is I want to start a campaign like Geeks Home for the Holidays campaign where where we this is a perfect advice.  Bring a thumb drive with the tools that you'll need.  The you upgrade them to Chrome, get them off of IE five, five, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the Atlantic declared Friday upgrade your parents browser.  Good for you.  Upgrade your parents browser.  That's great.  Get the installer on the thumb drive because if your parents IE is hijacked, it's just hard to get the installer.  So if you show up with the thumb drive, you're brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brilliant idea.  Brilliant idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've almost flown Jake down to Florida more than once.  Yeah, I bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jake said Jake's just geek son.  You're you're a number of the week, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I kind of like this when I was I was desperate for a number.  I spent I swear an hour looking for a number.  I was nowhere.  I go to Twitter and I beg and I say, you got any numbers for me?  And a guy named Rich Goodwin, Richard Goodwin, rather, are good one at Twitter came in and gave me a wonderful one from a guy named Rich Jones.  Thus the confusion about an OSHA app for Android and iPhone that he says is a sticking pile of that's all surprised.  Yeah, that's all about the heat index.  You know, that silly index.  Is it hot?  How hot is it?  It's really hot, man.  And it was to explain that to you and have a little temperature converter tell you how hot you feel you are and all this other stuff.  He said it's just just god awful.  But here's what I love about it.  He used a fairly new site called Muck Rock dot com, which is a site to enable people to file foils.  Freedom of Information Act.  Wow.  Right on.  We filed one with OSHA and found out that the application cost more than two hundred thousand dollars, which is he for about two thousand dollars worth of non-functional temperature converters.  So as all the documents are up there, it's really kind of nice.  It's a little little slight moment of citizen journalism that does exist.  Wow.  And the number of the week is two hundred thousand dollars of your wasted tax money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would have written it for one hundred thousand.  Yeah.  Gina and I would have done it for fifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina would have said, oh, it's the government.  OK, I'll do it for free.  Yeah, you see, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would have gotten a grant from someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought your number I thought your number might be four point seven four.  Ah, that's right.  I thought you were going to steal it.  So I didn't go there.  All right.  That's the number of degrees.  It used to be six degrees of separation between.  That was the theory anyway in the in the 60s that everybody was connected to everybody else in the world by no more than six degrees.  Well, they've done the study on Facebook.  Remember, Yahoo did this too.  I haven't heard the results of the Yahoo search or result of the Yahoo study.  But there's a study from the University of the studies of Milan and Facebook.  And they found that the average distance in 2008 between Facebook people was five point two eight hops.  It is now four point seven four hops.  So Facebook does bring us closer together with people we've never met and couldn't care about.  So there I don't have an application.  I just want to thank Microsoft for hiring.
