Transcript:  This is This Week in Google. We are Leo-less this week. It's painful, it's horrible. It's not the way the natural way things should be, but of course, at least we have, I'm back.  I'm Jeff Jarvis and I'm back and we have, of course, always the wonderful Gina Trepene. Over to that direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, we got the Brady Bunch set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do. And below is Kevin Marks.  Hi there.  Hello. And see if I get this right. And that way, did I do it right? Yeah, that way. Hi, is Denise Howell.  And we're here. Hello. Hello.  Yes. Hello all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great to see you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great to be here. Great to be back in New York with power and all is well here.  So I figured we'd start off this week with, are you ready, Chad? The changelog.  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the week before Thanksgiving, which is really good news because it means that everything gets released.  There's tons of new stuff in the Google world this week. Let's get it started.  Google Plus now allows users to directly download Android apps from the stream.  So if you link to an Android app you love, which I found out the other day when I was promoting my app to do text,  other users will see a by link. They click on the by link and choose the device they want to install to.  And they get their Android apps directly from the Google Plus stream.  Gmail got a couple of new search parameters. I really like this.  Gmail has a ton of search parameters like to and from and subject has attachment. Got a couple of new ones.  You can find messages that are larger than a certain size.  So if you want to find messages that are really big, you want to clean out your inbox, you can search for size colon,  let's say 5M for messages which are 5 megabytes, or you can search for larger colon 5M for messages that are larger than 5 megabytes.  You can also find email by date. So if you wanted to find a message that was older than a year,  there's a new search parameter called, you use it older underscore then colon one Y for older than one year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a great concept, cleaning out your inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just in case you're topping out your 10 gigabytes of Gmail space and you need to clean out some bigger ones,  you can do that now with a search parameter.  YouTube for Android, the YouTube app for Android, adds AirPlay-like functionality for Google TV.  So if you've got your Nexus 7 or your Android device in your living room and you've also got a Google TV and you're watching a YouTube video,  you can send it to your TV and watch it on the big screen.  This is really similar to AirPlay for the Apple universe and really similar to actually what the Nexus Q did,  but so few people had the Nexus Q, it's kind of nice to see that built into the YouTube app for regular Google TV devices.  Google says that Flash is now fully sandboxed in the latest release of Chrome.  Sandbox just means that each Flash plugin or any bit of content on any web page where Flash is being used is completely,  it's completely, it's sandboxed, it's contained within a process that you basically can't run malicious software on your computer.  So a little safer, a little more secure in the most recent version of Chrome.  Google also updated the Play Music app for Android and they announced European availability.  The new Play app adds the ability to keep thumbs up last added and purchase playlists on your device.  And it also has this new auto-generated instant mixes in the recent tabs based on your favorite songs and also has improved offline music access as well.  Google Shopping gearing up for the holiday season.  They add a new feature called shortlist, which is a lot like wishlist.  So when you search in Google Shopping for a product, you can add a product to your shortlist and the shortlist are really nice.  They include product images, prices, you can add comments and notes and you can share shortlist with other people.  So if you're making wishlist for the kids or if you're shopping with coworkers to give a gift to someone else, you can share and comment and discuss each product on your shortlist.  And Google Shopper 3.0, which is the Android app, also adds some new features.  Local deals based on your location, deals online, and new good guide ratings, which tell you how eco-conscious a product is.  Also just redesigned home screen, which is very image heavy, makes it easier to shop for products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does this say where they get the data on the eco-conscious stuff, Jenin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good guide, good guide ratings. I'm not sure if it's third party or if that's a Google thing.  I think so, yeah.  Finally, Android 4.2, the new flavor of jelly bean, quote unquote, has gone, has an over the air update has pushed out to the Galaxy Nexus phone, the Nexus 7, but not the Nexus S.  And we talked about this last couple of shows that the new jelly bean update includes new features like multiple user support, switching users, the swipe feature in the keyboard and the photosphere feature in the camera, which lets you take 360 degree views of pictures.  So we could talk about a little bit more about that later on because I think a few of us have gotten the update.  That's it. That's it. That's all I got for the changes.  Wow, that's tons of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I stepped on the outro.  Jenin, can I ask you a follow up question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Do you know if the AirPlay functionality for YouTube is, is there any thought that that might just work with Chrome?  That you're on a laptop, whether it's a Chromebook or some other laptop, and as long as you're using the Chrome browser, that might work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be really nice. No word about that, but that would be really nice.  I mean, the thing about the AirPlay thing is that you have to have a Google TV.  So there's that. Yeah, it would be nice.  You know, I've been using the watch later feature in YouTube.  So I add stuff to watch later if I'm on, if I'm in browser and then on the Google TV, go to the YouTube app there and then go to watch later, which is super clumsy and requires lots of clicks.  It would be really neat to see that send to my TV in Chrome. I would love to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be good. Well, speaking of Google TV, we might as well go to this one.  It too has updated in the never ending Google effort to finally make the product actually decent.  So now it has voice search and a new primetime guide.  Is that something that is already automatically on your Google TV, Jenin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the Logitech review. So the review didn't get the voice search feature.  It did get the YouTube update that I just talked about.  And I think that it did get the the primetime guide update, although my setup is a little is a little messed up.  I'm not quite getting cable listings correctly for for reasons I won't get into.  So you have to have a newer Google TV device.  So I think that those updates that the voice search particularly is rolling out to Logitech TVs and then the second second generation, what they're calling second generation Google TV devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unfortunately, the other two of you have Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't I have an Apple TV and it's one of the older models.  So I don't have airplay on it anyway, but I love the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a TV and a TV.  Pardon me. I have the Apple TV and the Nexus Q.  So I've got both those options.  Now, this is the release notes for jelly beans.  Jelly beans say you can share anything on your screen on HDTV, but there's no but there's no clue about how you do that.  Oh, what's on your screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huh? But I always have Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I can't say I can't see how you would do that.  I can't see any settings for that.  So that there's a maybe that's a promise rather than a delivered thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or maybe I think you're on the right thing where you were you're just up across.  I have now gone or I have my Nexus seven.  I have my Galaxy Nexus and it has arrived at last.  I have my Chromebook.  So I have begun my bold experiment to live only in Google Ville.  I'm going to I'm going to live only in Chrome on computer stuff and I'm going to live only in my Android devices on my things.  And I will report back in a few weeks to see how it goes if I haven't killed myself between now and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think you're going to be alone in that too long, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think I'm liking it so far.  The quick note is it's stupid to have a search button, not a caps lock button.  It actually crashes a little bit.  But of course, it's just a browser.  So it comes right back.  You know, the screen is a little tinny, little plasticky, but it's pretty darn amazing that everything I need for two hundred forty nine dollars.  And Google today announced a new Chromebook for only one hundred ninety nine dollars with three and a half hours of battery power.  So it's pretty remarkable.  I just came this week too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just got this for my son because his school is all Google Docs, Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, the whole universe of work they do at school is in the Google ecosystem.  So it's really going to make sense for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you two power users there.  Are you looking down your nose at us for having these talkatois?  No, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, someone in the chat room said Web 6960 said YouTube Airplay thing works with PlayStation 3, TiVo Premiere, Xbox 360, Google TV and other smart TVs.  But the stories that I saw said that it was Google TV only.  Kevin, do you know if this is true, does it work with Xbox 360 and those other devices?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to find something other than this press release thing to explain what the feature is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry, y'all.  We're frantically Googling as we talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chat room will provide a momentarily, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we need a link chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the other part of the other news, of course, is this week Google released finally its new Nexus 4 and Nexus 10 for sale for about 30 friggin seconds.  I tried desperately.  I don't know why.  I have my Google Nexus phone.  I'm happy with it, but I just can't help myself.  I'm feeling like Leo this week.  So, of course, I have to justify buying any new gadget as soon as it comes out.  And I was going to buy the Nexus 4.  I saw across the world in Australia and then in Europe, people were cursing and growling because they couldn't get it.  They got on and they were refreshing, refreshing, refreshing, refreshing.  Report was it was going to go on sale here at noon Eastern time, 9 a.m. Pacific time at about 1135 a.m.  My time, it turned out to be on sale.  So I refreshed and refreshed and refreshed and refreshed, trying to constantly go to every step of the buy process.  Finally, once for the 16 gig, I got all the way to the end, I got my credit card done.  I hit it.  And then it says, boom, basically it was sold out.  I stupidly then go to that.  I'm going to read some advice for you guys in a second.  I go to the eight gig.  I do it again and again and again and again.  And apparently I don't get it.  Then two hours later, I find a purchase confirmation that I have an eight gig coming my way.  First thing is Google can do everything well, but it can't run a store better than friggin Radio Shack.  Why can't they do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this hard really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just too much of a brick and mortar thing, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really remarkable how hard it is.  Now, they might have had, you know, five units and thought the scarcity was great.  You can go on. You can buy the new Nexus sevens.  You can buy other things right now, but you just cannot.  And the 10, I think, is still available, but you can't buy the Nexus four.  And so maybe they wanted that because it looks like they're popular.  But it really was a very frustrating experience.  I saw some guy put up on Twitter a list of five canceled purchases.  He said I either have zero or eight coming.  I can't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, I think this is a Jarvis Easter egg.  I think Google anytime you try to purchase a Google device, as soon as they see your name there, there's some sort of snafu pre-programmed.  Right. I have an idea from you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it worthwhile having an eight gig or should I just return it and wait for the 16 gig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's worthwhile.  I mean, I'm finding that more and more on tablets and phones, storage is becoming irrelevant.  There's not so much that I need to store there because so much is streamed.  Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, more is always better with storage and RAM.  But I haven't, you know, I've got the egg version of this and I haven't run into problems with it.  I think they're getting better at sort of paging stuff in and out as you need it.  The way the Google Play stuff works with music is pretty impressive on this now because it will cache stuff if you ask it to.  But generally, as long as you've got some kind of connection, it'll pull stuff down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Gina, which phone are you using regularly now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I switch between the iPhone 4S and the Galaxy Nexus.  Mostly just kind of keep up with what's going on with both and I test my app on both.  You know, it's funny, I've been using the iPhone a lot just because the camera just feels really fast  and I've just been taking a lot of pictures of the baby and I have to get her that one second that it looks like maybe she's smiling.  But I have to say that this Jelly Bean update is really, really cool.  So I think I might switch back to the Galaxy Nexus.  So I'm kind of between the two of them, but they're both live and I grab one or the other.  I'm using the voice, so it rings in text to both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you talk a little bit more about what you've seen so far from the update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the bit of the update that I was really excited about was the multiple user support.  So you can switch users and that doesn't make very much sense on a phone, but it makes a ton of sense on a tablet.  So the Nexus 7 is kind of our, you know, in my house is our living room computer.  My wife and I both use it.  And I really like the idea that she and I can both have our accounts set up, separate home screen, separate app, separate email accounts, the whole thing.  And so we pick it up, we can log in as whoever it is and have all of our stuff.  And it's done really nicely.  You know, if I download an app and use it, it collects data.  But then if she decides to use that app, it doesn't redo the download, but all the settings are new.  That's really nice.  The other kind of big difference is the keyboard has that swipe functionality where you kind of drag your finger from one letter to the other.  And it guesses what word you're trying to type.  And I actually I really like this.  I really like the swipe swipe with a why app keep alternate keyboard on Android a while back.  I wrote a piece about it a while back.  And it's actually really nicely done in this just jelly bean update.  I've only played with it a little bit the last few hours, but you can have a choice.  You can use the swipe or not.  And it's and it looks very similar to the regular keyboard.  It's nicely done.  And of course, the photosphere feature, which Kevin was just trying to take a 360 photo of his backyard.  I don't think it went so well.  It's different than panorama.  You kind of need to kind of walk around and and take your picture, take your photo kind of as you go versus a panorama.  You kind of move the camera.  It sounds like you have to kind of move your whole body to get a picture of them still still trying to get that right.  But once you get it, you get this 360 view and you can upload it to Google Maps tied to your location, which is really nice.  And I think those are the major features that I did I miss anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you pretty much got it.  Yeah, different clock.  People notice when you sign on, it has a big size on it, just a different font.  These are the kinds of silly things that Apple people usually care about.  We don't different different clock there.  So, you know, really minor.  The Galaxy Nexus S will not have this update, right?  But the Nexus will.  So I don't know what other units will get and won't get the update, which probably very frustrating for folks.  The other news out in Nexus land was that, of course, as I said, the Nexus seven is now on sale.  They have the cell phone enabled version of it for what is it?  Two nine nine three two gig plus online connectivity unlocked.  That's on sale and available now.  They have the the 10 available.  And there was one report I put in the in the update that said that the Nexus seven is actually has some new small changes in the hardware inside and that it's allegedly faster.  So I don't know if that's true or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, allegedly it is faster than this.  Is it the larger?  I thought someone in the chat room said the one that had more gigabytes was supposedly faster, but I'm not I'm not sure.  There was a speed test on the next web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's up on the chat.  It's up on the rundown under Android.  You know, so I don't know.  It's but it's minor.  It's not a big deal.  I'm you know, I haven't touched my iPhone now in two or three weeks.  I haven't touched my iPad in probably two months.  So I've really found myself switching from Apple disease to to Google disease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think you're kind of unique, Jeff, that that you were already so entrenched in the Apple universe and you're extricating yourself and adopting a whole new paradigm as it were.  But I could in our household, I could definitely see it being generational because with my son with his Chromebook and then ultimately when he gets old enough to have a phone, it would be logical to keep him in that ecosystem.  And, you know, I could just see, you know, it'll be sort of like having Republicans and Democrats living under the same roof, which we also have.  So is the technological Alex Keaton?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  My lights go off.  I've got to go.  I've got to go dance and prove to them alive.  Sorry.  I'm back.  I'm back.  Leo doesn't do this only when you get the the backups and Gina didn't do this either.  All right.  So I thought because we have Denise here, there were a couple of law stories that were pretty interesting and related to the law and rights and so on.  And oddly enough, I find the portrayal story besides being odd and tawdry in all kinds of ways.  The questions that I thought might be interesting for us to explore are the privacy issues.  You know, I've argued that the government is not our best protector.  It is our greatest threat to privacy.  And if you look at what happened to the portrayal story, we're just to recount is that I guess correct me if I get this wrong here, but there was a complaint from I think the the Florida socialite named Miss Kelly.  She was getting threatening emails.  And so she called on her friend at the FBI who later and I don't understand this part at all sent shirtless pictures of himself.  Whatever.  And turned out to be of course the biographer of Petraeus who was sending allegedly the threatening emails that revealed the affair that lost Petraeus job.  Then there's the connection of his number two general in Afghanistan to the socialite again.  Gawker has a whole chart trying to explain all this stuff.  Fine. So that's the tawdry part that everybody's covering.  But the part that that concerns me here is that I think the public is going to be very concerned about the privacy issues.  But the part that that concerns me here is if this these exchanges had happened in snail mail or even if they'd happened on the telephone, they wouldn't have been so easy for the FBI to come in.  And what does this mean for all the rest of us?  Is it just different because this is the head of the CIA or does this reveal a security risk for all of us when it comes to our communications and illustrates how we do not have the right of secure and private communication in email as we know versus the mails.  Counselor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. Well, you've hit on a problem that exists offline as well when the government is investigating something when law enforcement is as happened here that if someone is cooperating with them and providing them with a bunch of evidence, you know, they're going to come through it.  They find other tidbits in there that may be criminal or, you know, prompt some separate investigation.  They don't have to get a separate warrant. They don't have to turn away and pretend they didn't see that thing.  They can go ahead and use it. It's, you know, in the real world, you know, say you have marijuana on your car seat and you're stopped.  It's called the plain view doctrine.  And I think that we're seeing it carrying over here to this woman's email account.  And that's that's how, you know, this whole thing unfolded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would that be true if they had print emails, print mails?  I mean, I mean, you know, snail mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. You know, as long as she had provided all this stuff and said, you know, here's here's everything I have on the issue.  I'm being, you know, stalked or whatever it was she told them.  They clearly can go through it and they don't need a warrant.  They don't really need any other permission of the people whose data is in their hands being provided by this woman who prompted the investigation.  So, yeah, it's kind of a big security leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. There was also more metadata, of course, associated with the emails where you could track it back in a way that was harder to be anonymous.  I read one story I wish I were aware, I think it was in the New York Times, that explained that the spy craft that Petraeus and Broadwell evidently used was to create a separate email account.  Rather than sending emails to each other, just sharing the password to that one account and you left a message there like a message drop and the old spy craft and then along with it and read it as opposed to kill it.  But the problem was that then Broadwell created another account and started using stuff in ways that I don't know exactly where it goes.  Should I be troubled by this or not? Technology geniuses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of this illustrates a gap in the law in that the ECPA means that this stuff isn't subject to the Fourth Amendment so people can search it without getting a warrant.  That is an issue.  It's a huge gap, yes.  This is because that law was written back in the 80s and they assumed that anything still on a server after 180 days was abandoned and therefore they could look it up.  Gmail blows that up completely because they keep everything forever.  There's a legal definition of email that dates from the 80s that is now being used to let them troll every email you've ever sent or received.  It looks like there was initially some, she handed over some accounts voluntarily and then they got access to other accounts partly because they'd seen some of the emails back and forth and then they went and looked on the servers for this stuff.  That was the impression we got from this, not just that some of the stuff that's been received.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the rule is James Fallows of the Atlantic said of course never put anything in an email or electronic that you wouldn't have problems with out there.  The other statement of that rule is if you put it in an email, make sure it's okay if it appears on the front page of the New York Times.  Little do you know.  Beyond that common sense rule, Gina, what advice would you have for people here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's just kind of a matter of awareness of these things.  I think it's a matter of upgrading our laws.  I'm going to say upgrade.  Upgrading our laws to sort of match the technology.  But yeah, I don't know.  It feels kind of like a cop out, right?  If you're doing something you don't want people to know about, then don't do it electronically.  I don't know.  I've been rewatching The Wire, the HBO series, The Wire, and it's a fascinating sort of study on how to communicate without getting trapped.  I say everybody just get pagers and have some sort of scrambled combination that nobody knows and only talk on pay phones.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think it's just an awareness.  And I think people are still sort of learning that.  Whatever I put online, I have to be aware even if I think it's private, it might not be.  That there are lots of ways that it could not be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's such a clear case to me that making laws based on technologies is so wrong.  And in essence, our protections on mail were made to a technology of print and physical delivered.  And the principle should have been there that we have a right to private personal communication.  Period.  Full stop.  But it doesn't work that way, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't.  There are some tools.  There are some tools for digitally encrypting your email.  Weren't there?  I have to say that I have an eight week old, so my brain's kind of mush.  I've only followed the story sort of a little bit.  But wasn't Petraeus and his mistress, weren't they writing draft emails and saving them in a draft folder and then logging into the account without sending them?  I mean, there are sort of this OE sort of a little bit of a hacker way to go around or to try to protect your stuff or to send encrypted files.  But nothing is absolutely and completely secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does this do to Gmail's brand?  People who aren't sophisticated like you guys, are they going to look and say, oh my God, Gmail's easy to do?  Do you think this has an impact on them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I was going to say I don't think it impacts Gmail any worse than any other standard kind of email program.  It maybe gives rise to an enterprising opportunity for developers to come up with a kind of mail system that they could market as more secure.  Hushmail is out there.  What is there?  Tiger mail as well.  But those things just don't seem to get much traction except for people really hardcore interested in security.  And I think that there's there's an opening for the general public to have some sense of, yes, this is a more private way to go.  And it's also got all the convenience that I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I didn't plan it this way, but I cannot imagine a better segue to our first sponsor, Stamps.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Over to you, Leo.  I might like to interrupt for just a moment to talk about this intermediating the post office.  I got my U.S. Postal Service mug here, but I'm going to talk about Stamps.com.  Actually, the Postal Service loves Stamps.com because Stamps.com means you can do everything you need to do at your desk instead of going to the post office.  I mean, everything print legal U.S. postage.  And by the way, you do not need a postage meter or special link.  You're going to save up to 80 percent off what you're paying on a postage meter with Stamps.com.  You've already got what you need, which is a computer and printer and Stamps.com Mac or PC, by the way.  Stamps.com lets you print real U.S. postage right from your desktop and do everything you would do at the post office right from your desktop,  including things like fill out the forms for international mail, express mail, priority mail.  I love it because you can use Stamps.com to manage your shipping as well, you know, send an email out when something gets shipped with the tracking information, all of that with the click of a mouse.  It'll even take the mailing address from your QuickBooks or Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Page, Etsy.  So if you do if you're a if you do fulfillment, if you do a lot of mailing, Stamps.com is such a great solution.  You always have exactly the postage you need when you need it on demand 24 7.  You get discounts you can't even get at the post office, including up to 21 percent on express mail, up to 15 percent on priority mail.  They fill out the forms, they print right on the envelope. You got to just try this.  Now, I want to give you the 110 dollar bonus offer.  Frankly, that's fifty five dollars in postage coupons, a free digital scale, a five dollar supply kit and a four week trial.  But you can't get that if you go to Stamps.com without following these instructions.  Exactly. Click the radio microphone in the upper right hand corner and use the promo code twig.  All right. It's an 80 dollar value on the front page of Stamps.com unless you know the secret Easter egg.  Click the radio microphone, use the offer code twig.  And that's now suddenly worth 30 bucks more. You got to love that.  Stamps.com user offer code twig. You're going to you're going to thank me later.  You'll never have to go to the post office again with Stamps.com.  Now back to Jeff, Gina and this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How was that for a segue? Huh? How was that smooth?  That was awesome. The postal service retains its relevance.  And now Leo can make the commercials and also add that if you use Stamps.com in the mail, you will be caught in your affair if you do it well.  You can stay in charge of the CIA for God sakes.  All right. I'm going to go ahead.  Just use postcards.  Oh yeah.  I'm going to dance around. I will get back to some Google stuff.  But but I will think that fascinating me this week in the world of video was Mozilla released what they call Popcorn Maker 1.0,  which is an online video editing platform that lets you take a video online and then add all kinds of events and things to them.  So for background, Chad, you want to play just a few little bit of the demo piece?  It also played for me. Sorry. I thought I was going to be smooth.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says press play.  Popcorn Maker lets you enhance video and audio you find on the web by layering in your favorite web services and then sharing these remixes with the world.  The first thing you'll notice in the Popcorn Maker interface is the video itself.  Look at me.  Now imagine this video is something you've imported from the web.  Videos of the news, your favorite performers, your favorite show or just your favorite cat.  The most important feature of Popcorn Maker is the event editor.  By dragging one of these events either onto the video or onto the timeline, you'll create a new event.  Here's what an event for a piece of text looks like on the timeline.  Imagine we're creating a newscast.  Here's a pop up.  Here's an image.  Here's a Wikipedia article about Africa.  Here's a map of Africa.  Get it?  The position of the event on the timeline indicates when it will appear in the video area.  You can drag these events anywhere on the video as well as resize them to fit your composition.  I want you to try this now.  I've put a pause event on the timeline that will stop this tutorial.  While it's paused, drag an event onto the timeline and when you're done, press play to continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We won't do this much longer, but just drag something on chat for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I dragged on a Twitter node.  I can do a search or username.  Let's say Jeff Jarvis.  Click away.  There we go.  I've got all of Jeff's tweets in the video.  Some things that I can do with this are come down here to the timeline and drag it to make it longer, make it shorter so it's really fast.  I can also resize the...  Actually, I believe Twitter is kind of stuck in this size, but I can move it around or whatever I want.  That's just Twitter.  There are a whole bunch of events like text pop-up, Google Maps, Twitter, images.  You can do a loop or skip or a pause or even a Wikipedia article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was enthralled with this.  A, that it came from Mozilla, which is Mozilla getting way out of browsers and email and the applications we know.  B, when they get to things like the Chromebook, the fact that you can do video editing of those kinds of things just through a browser.  That was fascinating.  Am I just a video geek?  What did you guys think?  This is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is really cool.  I want to see a twig episode annotated like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Chad, you just got more work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can do that.  You can actually change the source media.  So if I wanted to go grab a YouTube video, so let me open up a new tab, go to YouTube.com slash twit.  This will be fun.  Yeah, so let's check out how to.  I'm going to go to, of course, this week in Google and I'll choose the latest episode.  Math wins.  And we can grab the URL from the top and then throw it into the source video area, apply it.  And now, it will play.  And of course, this is probably the long.  There we are.  The longest way, you know, possible video that we could have ever given it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can annotate all the moments I desperately wish that Leo was in studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Put a picture of Leo.  He'll just fly in from time to time.  Totally right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so there's a little pop up about breaking news.  There's an image that didn't load fast enough, but then some maps and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Links in.  We're talking about a link.  You can put the link in there.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or like, say we talk about Ting.  Let me go to my events.  Let's grab.  We could say we could grab some text or even a Wikipedia article about Ting.  Let's see.  Oh, it looks like you have to have the article link.  It's sort of the Wikipedia syntax.  Right. Yeah.  I mean, it's pretty.  I mean, look, here's a picture of a cat over the Squarespace.  Pretty amazing.  And especially as a video editor myself, I looked for this when I reviewed the first Chromebook.  And it's a very powerful tool for taking a video and then annotating on top of it.  And then on top of that, once you post this, you anyone else can remix the creation.  And it kind of skirts around copyright laws because you're not actually changing the base video.  The base video is sort of like a background that's always there.  And then you're layering information on top of it.  So if so, you're not stealing the content and making it your own video.  So it's always sort of these separate pieces that you're creating a collage of instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless you take this week's episode and you say Jarvis is boring across it.  Denise, what do you think the law goes with this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, fabulous. Very useful.  You know, if you're doing commentary or otherwise adding to the original,  I think that there's definitely all kinds of opportunities to use this in a fair use kind of way.  There are probably some people who would look at this and say, you know, depending on what use was made,  if it wasn't commentary, if it was some kind of more of a derivative work based on the original,  that just the fact that they've made that one copy and then layered things over,  there would probably be something to talk about under copyright law as to why that that might not be OK.  I don't know enough technically about how it works to really parse that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it really plays with the whole notion of a remix.  And you're right, fair comment, that if you make a comment directly on that piece,  it's like being able to scroll over a column you don't agree with in The New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nonsense. Right. What happens to this video once you're done?  Can you do you can you export it? Does it live on this?  The popcorn does it live on the on this, the Mozilla site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happens to it? So, no, you can't ever download the finished product.  And that's one of the reasons why I think that this sort of goes around.  Copyright claims is that you can only watch it when it is streamed through a embedded sort of situation.  And so it is my belief that if the original video creator were to take their video off of YouTube,  you could no longer play this video because it's going it's pulling it directly.  Right. Right. Because you can't actually hold linking everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. But the amazing Hitler video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. This could be the tool to make the new captions for the Hitler video. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then you couldn't upload it. But you can screen record it.  You could always render this thing through, you know, through analog means or fake analog means.  You can you could you could take the output of this and feed it into a compressor and then have a rendered version that that's doable.  They just don't make that easy at the moment because they're trying to encourage that the hot linking stuff.  And the problem is you can make something with this, but then it's as fragile as a web page.  And if any of the things you've hotlink go away, you get a sort of empty box there instead.  I'm not quite sure if I link to a search on Twitter for Jeff Jarvis.  Will I get the current search on Twitter for Jeff Jarvis?  Will I get the one that I made at the time, which, you know, will have expired by the time you play it next week.  So there's there's there's some trickiness about attaching to live web assets.  But that's it's still a very interesting, powerful tool.  And hopefully the answer to that will be better caching and the ability to sort of link to things at a particular point in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was amazing. And I was also interested in Mozilla doing this.  Why do we think they did this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's they've got a little JS that was designed to let you do dynamic web stuff.  And this is an example for that.  And they're interested in this because their agenda is keeping the web open and giving you access to it.  And so they want to make sure this stuff isn't locked up in proprietary silos, but can be done as part of the web.  So doing it in a way that requires you to link everywhere is very much in line with their values.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Chad, you do have new work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Right.  And so whenever whenever we mention your Twitter account, I'll have to show the live feed of what you just tweeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds like a job of the chat room, actually.  Yeah. Yeah. And anyone can do this. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the other thing will be to take the ILC record of the chat room and feed it through this.  So you get an auto annotated one.  The chat room is throwing up links and stuff and commentary that we don't always get to.  So you could have a little like running here's some extra stuff that you might want to click on as you watch this.  Like Web 696 just sent us a YouTube to Xbox 360 answer to our question earlier.  There we go. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yes, we were talking earlier about about YouTube to smart TVs and to Xbox 360.  And that is possible. You have to pair the device.  So we talked about earlier the AirPlay feature, which is just send to your Google TV as a one tap thing.  But you can currently pair your Android device with smart TVs and Tivo and Xbox 360.  Thank you very, very much. Web 696 for the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was fascinated by that.  I'm going to jump all over the map and you guys could just, you know, there's no such thing as a host with me here.  I jump in with anything. Who put up the link to the Niantic project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was actually me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was you. That's that's that's the I found it.  I found it fascinating because it's the hell.  Now I can't get it up. Who is it?  Well, we'll go up because I'm like, can you look at it quickly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let me forget where I put that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's under Google. Oh, good. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So so this is it seems like it's a it's a project that that Google is keeping semi-secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like a the first outcome of it is the is that is that thing that neat things around you at.  Right. What's it called?  The Field Trip, right?  Thank you. So this is an employee, John Hanke.  I guess it is there, right? Who wanted to leave and start this company.  And he was talked in disdain by Larry.  And the first thing that came out was was Field Trip.  And part of his argument was, as I as I read the story that he was disturbed that people were just down in their in their screens just doing that all the time.  So you want to have a reason to look up.  And so Field Trip tells you what's around you and as you look around, what do we think Google's up to with this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it's it's part of the information as you as you move around things.  And this is this is the Eric's Trousers discussion of like your phone suggesting things as you as you go past them.  And this is an iteration of that.  So it's trying to say here's here's some stuff you might want to look at nearby.  Now, I turned this on last week and I was in Las Vegas for a for a company meeting and it was going mad.  And it was firing off every eight seconds because there's so many like tourist attraction things around there that I couldn't you know, I was like, will you stop doing that?  Whereas if I try and run it here in suburban San Jose, it goes, oh, well, there's sort of a park over there maybe.  So they've got some stuff to work with about what it triggers for and when and some settings for that.  But the idea is nicely the idea of this sort of there's some something serendipitous nearby to you that that you might want to look at is interesting.  And I think that makes some sense.  And then there's also a findery, which is Katerina fake's new thing, which is encouraging people to put interesting markers on the map and explain why they matter.  So using the earth as a means of communication. So there's as you've got different places on the on the earth.  There are stories to be told about that there's history there's things you can look up there.  This is a way of discovering that but doing it as you go through the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's got Google Glass written all over it.  Right. I mean, every single time I see any of these apps that are just like things around you, it's like, oh, clearly this is built for Google Glass.  By the way, they've been sort of things have been quiet on the glass front recently.  But aren't they shipping glass to Google I.O. attendees?  Was it January that they said, Jeff, do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just about to ask you when you're going to get it. Yeah, I think I think it is January, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that they said early early next year.  So, yeah, I've got my number. It's up.  We just haven't heard a whole lot about it recently.  So, yeah, I mean, whenever I see these, it's like, oh, of course, you know, this is class for glass to related stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also a Google Glass competitor coming out.  There'll be a few of those. We'll see.  Where'd that go in the.  Leo, how do you do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not easy, isn't it?  Jesus, it is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somewhere in this run down, there's a story about a competitor for Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's on the very bottom of other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Music's music's right.  So, yeah, that's tempting. But I'm thinking.  But it's not Google.  I guess the hardware doesn't matter, right?  I mean, it depends on what operating system it uses.  And can I use Google Maps in it? And what else?  The advantage in that picture, for those of you who are on audio, it's more like a cell phone earpiece with a very, very long microphone that comes out to be a screen.  So you don't have to wear it as glasses anymore. You wear it on your ear, which is pretty cool.  Very Star Trek, I think.  Google Glass is more data.  This is more communicator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This looks like a Bluetooth headset, a really long Bluetooth headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With a stick on it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With a stick on it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Instead of a stick for your mouth, it's a stick for your eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the opportunity is like somebody could make glasses that look better than Google's version, but these are not it, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Google Glass is absurd, too. You got to admit that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they do. They do. Yeah, absolutely.  But I was just thinking, if you could buy a pair that had maybe software that wasn't as good as Google's, but that were less conspicuous or looked nicer, wouldn't you buy those over the Google version that had the great software?  I wonder if vanity is going to be the biggest issue for Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't wait for the episode where you put your Google Glasses on on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Me neither.  That's going to be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But of course, in our world, vanity decrees that you wear them all the time.  They'll be beautiful, magnificent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As long as I can push them up on my head when I don't need them.  That's what I always do with my glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the thing that's striking about these is that it's an extra prosthetic, like having an earbud, like having something whisper in your ear.  But from what I've seen of the Google Glass, it's you can't.  It's not you can just look up and glance it and then look back.  But I can see that that would be very awkward for other people watching you.  But we're going to get used to it.  The thing is, it's the point is, is less intrusive than doing that, which is what we do at the moment.  You know, we're walking around. I was doing it.  I was doing a service in Vegas.  I was in Vegas on election night.  So I was walking down the Vegas strip with this in my hand, reading the election results and trying not to bump into people as I went from one hotel to another.  And I realized this was actually quite good because people stopped handing me the little cards for the strippers and things.  But it was it was I was surprised by how practical it was as a way to sort of do two things at once.  So I can sort of see the attract.  You know, I was I was sitting there watching Twitter go by and the NPR election results and all that stuff as I walked over to see Paul Carr's crew and this FW who are covering the election in their hotel.  So when I got there, I was up to date on what was going on and didn't have to say, oh, what's what's happened in the meantime?  Because it was right.  It was right about the time when all the results were coming in.  And that was that was interesting in that it was it's the parallel information thing that we all do.  And we're sort of used to doing with our phones, being able to do it in a less intrusive way with a little thing in the corner of your eye may be a good thing in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's also dangerous to Kevin, right?  That you can still bump into things because your eye is just concentrated on something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you know, I mean, and it's the same problem as texting while driving.  If there's another screen there and it's actually taking a big chunk of your attention, you've got to be careful what you're doing.  So, yeah, there's that you end up if you get drawn into that, it was the same thing as we're doing this show and somebody clicks a link and they'll go over and read it.  And then you want to say, what do you think, Kevin?  Oh, crap. What am I supposed to think?  Because you we think we can multitask more than we actually can.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also the argument, of course, that it's rude to be looking at your phone in a conversation.  But the other truth is the conversation you're having on the phone may be better than the one you're having in person.  Who's to say being in person is necessarily better, except when the Internet goes out and you're not there in the studio and twig?  How are we doing, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doing good.  That was a really weird.  We had a weird bug where everyone dropped off except for Kevin at the same time.  I'm still trying to get Denise back.  That was wacky.  That was really wacky. Yeah, crazy.  Oh, technology.  Well, I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Chad, would this be a good time to go off and hear from our next sponsor, American Express?  Yeah, that sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, what do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We interrupt this program for a word from American Express.  The American Express company wants to tell you about a service they're offering online.

And Google, we continue now with Jeff, Gina, and the gang. Back to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's so smooth. And that's so hard to do so many of those before he went off on vacation. It was the price he paid, Leo. Thank you.  So while we're on this idea of connectivity, there was one other story that fascinated me that's somewhat related in the rundown that a French cellular company called Sigfox  is creating a network just to connect physical things. So bathroom scales and lights and sensors and all that kind of stuff.  I found that really interesting because we've talked about that a lot, the Internet of Things, the connected world, the Web of Things.  But it doesn't have to be a 4G network to connect your dishwasher, right? It doesn't have to be that.  And so it becomes a special purpose cell network, which I imagine can use access capacity on lower cost networks.  Am I right or wrong here? To connect millions of things and what that reveals. What did you guys think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm somewhat suspicious. I mean, there's a bunch of these. There's Zigbee and a bunch of these other like local area network bits and pieces.  And the challenge is always getting enough devices on it. And actually, Wi-Fi is pretty pervasive.  The problem is we end up locking it all up too much. So you end up with the stupid challenge of I have a device, you know, like the Nexus Q is an example.  I have a device. I want to get on the Wi-Fi network, but it doesn't have a network.  So I have to whack it over the head with a thing that has a screen so I could type in a password.  Whereas if we use Wi-Fi the way we originally designed it, you can find anything nearby and connect to that and assume that that's the right thing to do.  So we have a lot of good pervasive wireless stuff going on in the Wi-Fi world.  But people are reinventing new things to go on top of it or trying to find a new way to sell us yet another cellular contract.  And that I find a little frustrating. An app I have been using is Open Garden.  I don't know if you guys have seen that.  This is it creates a distributed network using either Wi-Fi direct or Bluetooth between a set of devices that you have.  And if anyone any one of them has connectivity, it shares it with the others.  And I was using that when I said I was walking down the street in Vegas.  Obviously, there isn't Wi-Fi down the street now.  But my phone was connected and the Open Garden thing was connecting between the two.  So in that sort of person area network thing that works quite well.  I haven't had as much success on the laptop.  But for a bunch of different Android devices, one of which has connectivity, it works pretty well.  Hold on there. Explain that to me.  Is it not a hotspot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a hotspot.  It's basically scavenging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if I let me see if I can set this up.  I'll turn off Wi-Fi on one of them.  What it does is you sort of connect your devices together.  It's using Bluetooth chipset, but not the Bluetooth protocols.  Because it doesn't do the annoying pairing bullshit that Bluetooth does.  So if I let me see.  Let me turn off Wi-Fi on here.  This is where I should prep this demo.  So I've turned Wi-Fi off on this one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And then connect to Open Garden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I say, so I say connect.  And I've now both of them got both of them saying connect.  The Nexus 7 is not currently connected to the net.  So I've got both of them saying connect.  And I've got both of them saying connect.  I've now both of them got both of them saying connect.  The Nexus 7 is not currently connected to the net.  The Galaxy Nexus here is.  And after a little while, they go, oh, we found each other.  You're connected.  What does it should do?  Have I got Bluetooth turned on?  So there's a little bit of bugging around the first time you use it as they try to find each other.  And then once that's done, they stay connected.  So I think because I software update both of these, it may have lost its settings for a bit.  But then what happens is if either of them have connectivity for whatever reason, the other one can pick it up as long as they're close enough.  And it's using, as I say, it's using Bluetooth and it's using Wi-Fi direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then what can you do?  What's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The point is you've got connectivity where you didn't have it before.  So the Nexus 7.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're sharing an Internet connection.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, gotcha.  It's not as heavyweight as doing the Wi-Fi sharing on the phone, which tends to turn on all the radios on your device and drain the battery really quickly.  This is just doing it sort of in the background and scavenging.  But also, once they're actually connected, they realize that they're paired and they don't lose it again.  And you don't have all the bullshit with Bluetooth where it's like, oh, have I got you?  Have I not got you?  Right.  So it actually has worked out quite well realizing these devices should be part of the same network.  I suspect we're going to see more of this stuff.  A lot of these mesh network ideas have been around for quite a while, but they sort of failed on density of devices.  And as we start having more of these gadgets lying around all over the place, that's going to become less of an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's not what this French thing.  The interesting thing is that you would have a cellular antenna in all these devices in your scale and your washing machine or whatever.  Right.  And rather than going through Wi-Fi, they're saying that whereas a cellular connection consumes 5000 microwatts, a two way connection device is 100.  So they say they can cover France and area larger than California using just 1000 antennas.  So instead of the assumption that we had, which is all these devices are going to go into Wi-Fi and all that,  if devices came with very light cellular antennas and could go through a cellular network and had an addressable address, a phone number basically, right.  Or anywhere.  You know, that seems to be possible.  Gina, it seems to me that as a developer, if you really could address 20 things in your home, you could invent all kinds of new things.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm usually bullish about new kinds of technologies, but it's weird with this with the Internet of Things.  I'm a little bit like get off my lawn because I don't think I I don't think I fully see what what you can do.  Like, why would I want my microwave connected to the to the Internet?  I mean, I guess I see some examples, you know, turning my lights on before I get home at night or, you know, turning on the heat or the cooling, that kind of thing.  If I had a dog, I mean, I've seen really cool projects with little dog doors being programmed or whatever.  I backed a project on Kickstarter called what's it called?  Smart Things, which is little sensors for different for different things in your house.  But and I know that, you know, as a developer, I should just be like, you know, lit aflame by all the possibility.  But this might be because I'm just getting old.  I just kind of feel like it would add a layer of complexity for maybe not that much payoff.  I mean, Jeff, what is there something that you're dying to do with, you know, an inanimate object in your in your house that you could do if it were connected?  I think there's a few ways to look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One is at the individual level. Yeah.  If my if my oven could download a new program to do the perfect turkey.  OK, OK. The guy, the guy cuts my hair.  We were out of power. The guy cuts my hair was absolutely delighted that he managed to put his turkey in foil and all the freezer was going to go bad and do it on the fireplace.  So it really happened. So it's the opposite of the world.  But if I could if I could download data into certain appliances, that's one way to look at it.  The other way to look at it that excites me is tons and tons and tons of sensors that know stuff that share that stuff and that data.  And we're seeing all kinds of Kickstarter apps that are doing this with with small and very cheap sensors that are now going Wi-Fi, but could also go through other means.  You know, that if you had outside in New York, sound sensors all over, you would have a sense through data analysis of how much traffic there is.  You'd have a sense of where something bad happens somewhere in a news idea.  If you had sensors all around New Jersey with you, you could know which houses had power on.  For example, we can have a people's network of that because believe me, the utilities here have been just awful, especially in Long Island, especially like has just been terrible.  And there's data that they don't give to us. We don't know anything.  Well, we could suddenly start to get a sense network of who has power and who doesn't.  We could get a sense network of more weather things.  I don't know. It just it just strikes me that there's there's possibilities for data that we just don't know.  And if we could connect all these things via cell, that means they don't have to be near a Wi-Fi.  They don't have to have the passwords. They have a way to address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Well, for devices that you don't need to update all the time that you'd like to work a really long time, I could see this being very good for conserving those devices, making sure that they're getting whatever updates they need.  All the Chromebooks that automatically update themselves.  We had a washing machine that had a very high tech LCD display, you know, basically had a computer brain in it.  But when that thing failed, because it was not communicating with anything, because it was standalone, the tech who came out to fix it said, well, you know, it'll cost us six hundred dollars to go in and monkey around with this thing and see if it can be salvaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You may as well go out and buy a new washer. So that's another idea you mentioned is that if you had and this could happen on Wi-Fi too, but if you had smart appliances that don't need to be on all the time, they could go on when the power grid tells them to go on and you end up with a much smarter grid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, but it still ends up being are you building a centralized network, decentralized one?  I mean, the thing is, you know, you can do this with Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi was built to do this. And then we imposed all this password bullshit on it. It was born free and is it were in chains.  Now, what I think could be interesting for this is if we have more open spectrum like the Wi-Fi bands like the white spaces stuff we talked about, reusing the old TV bands, you'll be able to do more experimental networks like this without having to buy spectrum licenses.  One of the reasons why if I work so well, it is the same band everywhere in the world, which means you can carry a device around and have it work anywhere. Whereas all the cellular networks, you there, there's variation between countries.  One of the big problems they had with the Nexus four was that they couldn't they didn't put an LTE radio in it for the U.S. because that was a different frequency from the ones in Europe and so on.  And so you end up having to in the U.S. particularly, you know, having to build specific models for each specific carrier because they're using both different encodings and different frequencies.  Whereas the Wi-Fi stuff, we ended up with a chunk of bandwidth that was the same everywhere and in a protocol that was agreed that was the same everywhere.  And we've we've we've broken that we've we've through paranoia about people using your network and things like that.  We've imposed passwords and bullshit man in the middle things that make you type stuff into the web first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, don't get them with it with a red mark.  Yes.  Hmm.  Bad words on YouTube.  Oh, sorry.  Yes, we have all that BS on top of Wi-Fi now and it's broken.  That's why I just wonder whether a cell network because it has a different structure that has a number.  But yeah, OK, I get it.  It's new technology on it.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's some there's the there's the campaign to reopen Wi-Fi.  And if you saw that, if you guys cover that, it's like, you know, well, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You cover the campaign to reopen Wi-Fi last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't think we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find the name of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I'm someone buzzing Kevin from the sky above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a plane going over.  Sorry about that.  I've also got a poodle who seems to come out of the house.  So the open wireless movement, open wireless dog is a campaign by the EFF, the Internet Archive and lots of other nice people.  To say, why don't you open your Wi-Fi networks?  Things aren't so bad and find ways of doing this that aren't as awkward as giving everyone access to everything.  And then it comes down to we've been scared because, oh, people can get onto your network.  But this is actually a flawed worldview of wireless security.  This is the failed firewall model where you assume that inside the network, everything is lovely.  And outside the network, there are enemies.  And therefore, the boundary of the network is the thing you need to worry about.  And actually, this isn't true.  Each of the devices are connected to everything else.  And you need to you need to actually have security on each device and use secure connections when you need to.  It doesn't matter what the network looks like.  So the point of point of this is to encourage you to set up an open Wi-Fi network whose name is open wireless dog without a password.  And many of the routers that you buy, including the Apple ones, will let you set up more than one wireless network, a closed, a passwordy one and an open one and balanced traffic between them.  And so they're encouraging you to do this so that you can actually people can can roam onto Wi-Fi in different places.  I think I think this is this is a really good idea.  I think it's it would be it's something when when parts of New York had connectivity, some didn't.  There was still the problem that you could you could walk around town and see Wi-Fi networks and not be able to connect to them because they everyone's locked them all down now.  And having that kind of availability of this as a public resource, I think, is extremely valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, do you think there's any hope that anybody is going to do that or is another one of those goody two shoes, things that ought to happen and nobody's going to listen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I hope so. You know, it's funny.  We were right on Lifehacker a lot about how to secure your stuff because you hear these cases about people, you know, park outside your house and use your wireless network to to do a legal thing, you know, download music or to copyrighted music or to download porn or whatever.  And that you would take the take the hit for that because it was your connection.  I mean, I like the idea that this is an organized movement and that there's a you know, that there's a standard network name, which is pretty cool.  And I like that they're, you know, that they're encouraging you to use the guest guest network functionality of your router, which I've actually never used.  I'll do this. But yes, I do think this is the kind of thing that geeks will will take will take.  Excuse me. We'll take and run with and maybe not maybe not normal people.  But then then again, given what just happened in New York, this is, you know, all the more reason for people to share resources.  And and this is one way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it wasn't just, you know, electricity, which was vital, but also, you know, trying to get a mifi.  We were lucky to get a hotel, but the hotel had no Internet.  And so there were mifis scattered all around, but they weren't working that well.  And that was an issue. So but we have Denise here.  Answer me a question, counselor.  What's the one when I go to I go to I go to Starbucks again and again and again and again.  And I have to constantly sign on and agree to the checkbox for signing on to the God bless it.  That's very nice of them to give me a free network.  But but it's the pain and my devices can't do it.  And I want to get my email and it tries to hook into the Wi-Fi and it stops me from checking my email until I go off and do that or turn off the Wi-Fi app.  What are they afraid of?  Why are they having me check off that I've agreed not to do whatever I've agreed not to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, gosh, I can think of lots of reasons why they're, you know, they don't want you being able to come after them for some sort of shortcoming of the Wi-Fi service they're providing.  They don't want to be held responsible for anything you may do while using their network.  Those are two biggies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, OK. That's that's that's it.  With all respect, that's kind of the legalese of, oh, my God, things could happen.  What could really what could I really what can we imagine a doomsday scenario for the Starbucks network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what was the thing with the sheep?  Oh, fire.  Yes, fire sheep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But would that be would that be Starbucks?  That was real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let me talk about fire sheep.  Fire sheep. The point about fire sheep was that was saying if you're not using secure HDP, anyone can snoop on what's going over the network.  And that was true.  And it's still true.  And it wasn't anything to do with Wi-Fi.  Particularly, it's just it's easier with Wi-Fi because you're in the same room with radios.  The same if you if you were using HDP without HDPs, then anyone who's in between you can eavesdrop on the packets.  And that can be done in many different ways.  It can be done by being part of the ISP.  It can be done by putting fake roots in and tapping that way.  It can be done by being, you know, the FBI's box at the ISP.  And people can tap into into things like that.  Or, you know, or it can just be the thing in the coffee shop sniffing every packet as it goes by.  So the point of fire sheep was to point this out to people and say encourage companies to turn on HDPs by default.  And it has been largely successful in that.  If you look at Twitter and Facebook and Google and all the sites that fire sheep targeted, they now do default to HDPs,  which means that you've got an encrypted connection between you and their server.  And you have some sense that it isn't the you aren't being man in the middle.  It's not completely safe against that because of some subtleties about how certificates work.  But broadly, you're safe against somebody intercepting you because it'll your device will tell you that isn't who you think it is when it's HDPs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. OK. Back to your question, Jeff.  You know, could could a provider be held responsible?  I think they could. You know, I mean, it would be something that people would fight about in court.  But, you know, the standards for for what sort of Wi-Fi is required to be provided under the law are a work in progress for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's the problem is that it's broken. Right.  I can't just wander in through a Wi-Fi zone at the Starbucks and say thank you, Starbucks.  Thank you, AT&T and use it. I have to stop and I have to go through McGill.  There's no mechanism for me to sign up once and for all and say, hello. OK, I take responsibility. All right.  You know, if I sign on your network, let me in. And it's my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that should be something they should be able to fix.  If they can identify you or your device.  Right. But the problem is doing that between different Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. What they're trying to do with the open wireless.org is instead of having one of these click through contracts of adhesion that you have to go through every time, they are saying, well, by calling the the Wi-Fi network open wireless.org and putting up a sticker on the wall or a poster, you are saying the terms of use for this are this.  But a contract of adhesion as getting somebody to click something, you know, it's just as like to stand up in court.  And they and obviously you can you can do I.P. banning or something if you if you find people abusing it.  So what they're trying to do is like as a sort of creative commons like thing of defining a standardized license that that open wireless.org defines that you can just then refer to.  And they're saying they they hope to.  They're not saying they will defend you in court, but they said they have in the past defended open wireless networks in court and have some case law and they're going to keep trying to do that.  So that's the there's a there's a long sort of here's what we're trying to do disclaimer on the open wireless.org side.  But they're basically trying to effectively trying to change the norm such that people say, well, you have to secure your network and push back against that a bit.  And I think that's that's a very encouraging thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would be a great thing. All right. So we're going to lose Denise in a few minutes.  So there's one other story that you put up in the rundown, Denise, about California workplace laws and privacy and social stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to talk about that for a second? Yeah, it kind of goes back to the Petraeus story we were talking about earlier.  We've got kind of a sort of a perfect storm of things happening here.  People definitely are concerned about these privacy issues and at least three states now, it's California, Illinois and Maryland, have addressed the problem of employers asking people for their social networking passwords.  And, you know, there were a lot of stories cropping up about that.  And those three states have said, no, that can't be a condition of employment or anything.  You know, you just can't do it. Employers don't ask your employees for that.  You can't snoop on them that way. So, you know, we see some movement there responding to people's concerns.  But then on the flip side, recently we had a court in it was the Supreme Court of South Carolina interpreting the Stored Communications Act in such a way that, again, it was getting into someone's email account.  This time it wasn't the government. It was, you know, just just as bad as the government, right?  The disgruntled ex who wants to dig up dirt on you.  They either guessed or socially engineered someone's password and got into their account.  The person sued under the Stored Communications Act saying, hey, you know, they have had unauthorized access to my storage device.  And the court found, no, no, this isn't something that the Stored Communications Act actually will prevent.  And there was a big debate about what constitutes storage and whether email is storage in today's day and age.  And, of course, you know, you were talking about cleaning out your inbox. We all use it that way.  So it's just kind of a big mess. And I'm not quite sure how it will all resolve itself from the litigation or legislation standpoint.  But people sure aren't happy with the way that their privacy is exposed in today's day and age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it makes perfect sense. In Finland, you're not allowed employers not even allowed to Google employees to find out.  I think it's wrong. I think that at some point you have bad employees and you have the ability to find out about them.  The idea of the reference is dead because everyone's afraid of liability of saying anything bad about anyone.  But that's all a different world than actually demanding that it's like asking you to hand over the keys to your house so I can go snoop on you.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Indeed. So, you know, I think it's just a thing that's going to continue to unfold and we're going to see lawmakers and courts continue to struggle with it.  But, you know, this Petraeus thing is just another way of getting the issue in front of people.  And the more that happens, the more we might see some change that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we're about to lose Denise. So I want to say thank you very much for adding in here to our Leo this week.  We will continue on after after that. You want to plug this week in law?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This week in law is Friday at 11 Pacific 1800 UTC.  So definitely tune in. We'll we'll probably talk about the Petraeus case again.  And we've got Larry Downs and Jillian York from EFF joining us.  So that should be a really fun show.  And also I have a twit live special up on the network that people should check out if you're interested in seeing what happened at on Hollywood,  which is a conference where Hollywood folks and technologists come together to hopefully not kill one another,  but figure out how they can work together.  We covered that on the network and I think it just went up.  So check that out. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Chad, why don't we hit the next commercial for our friends at Ford and then we'll come back and we'll do kind of a lightning round of some stories that each of us wants to hit and then depart with our tools and tips and such.  So over to you, Chad, and over to you, Leo. I'm driving in my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, guys, let me just briefly mention one of our sponsors.  If you don't mind, we get back to this week in Google and that's Ford Motor Company.  I love I just I love you saying that.  Oh, yes, our sponsor, Ford Motor Company, one of the great American companies.  And I've been I've been watching.  Have you seen the TV ads lately where they say the Ford Focus?  It's like a computer in a car.  What do they say? Like driving a computer?  It's very interesting.  They really I think Ford really realized that consumer electronics and automotive technology belong together.  The problem is, until Ford came along with Ford SYNC, you you really weren't connected to the outside world.  You were in your car and that was it.  The issue was, how do we connect you with the outside world without being distracting?  And and what Ford did and they did a lot of testing.  I know this because I've talked to them about this is they did a lot of research and they found that you have plenty of cognitive ability to drive and do something else.  The issue is taking your eyes off the road or your hands off the wheel.  That's what's really dangerous.  So they created Ford SYNC.  Basically, everything is voice controlled.  So your hands are on the wheel.  Your eyes are on the road.  You don't have to look at anything.  It reads you back any input you need and you talk to the car.  And I just think it's brilliant.  And it means you can do so many cool things in a Ford.  Best of all, Ford is now offering SYNC on any every 2012, 2013 Ford vehicle in the U.S., including that beautiful 2012 Ford Focus.  Shannon just bought one of those.  Shannon Moore, she loves it.  Go to Ford.com slash technology.  You can find out more about what SYNC can do.  It lets you control your music player completely.  Via voice.  Browse your music collection via genre, album, artist, playlist or song title, all with voice commands.  In fact, go to the web page and read the commands.  It's kind of amazing all the things you can do with SYNC.  Basically, their goal was to make it possible for you to control everything in your car with your voice without looking away from the road, without taking your hands off the wheel.  Voice activated control of your media player to even play a link list of music you're in the mood for.  You can say play similar music with a voice command and it will it will do that.  Almost any device to voice control music, whether it's on your smartphone via Bluetooth streaming on a USB drive on an MP3 player.  Ford.com slash technology.  It's just amazing.  And then there's some really safety stuff to find a police station, fight a hospital, call roadside assistance, call 911 nearest veterinarian.  Ozzy just barked. Did you hear that?  Nearest pet hotel.  I just love it.  I want you to visit Ford.com slash technology right now.  Learn more about what SYNC can do and then go to your Ford dealer and test drive Ford SYNC.  Go further in a Ford Ford.com slash technology.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google and we return you now to Twig.  Thanks, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Back.  So we're heading toward toward the home run here.  No, not the home run.  I'm just such a non man.  What do you call it?  You're heading toward the home plate here.  Home plate.  Jesus, I'm just pathetic.  Anyway, we're heading, heading slowly there around what is it?  Four or five bases you got?  I don't know.  I wanted to mention a few government stories that we have here.  Last week, I was supposed to be out of the country in Baku and then Istanbul.  But Sandy kept me here.  Nonetheless, I got up at two in the morning in the hotel to do a video conference with the Internet Governance Forum in Baku.  And here's the wonderful obvious irony of it.  The Internet there sucked and it cut off the entire presentation halfway through.  This is what's going to happen if governments run our Internet people.  It's going to be a real problem.  And we see in the stories this week a couple of things about about government involvement.  One is that China going into its party, Congress blocked Google entirely and then returned them there.  I blog, Google, dot com, Gmail, G plus Google, plus maps, stocks, analytics and more.  It, you know, just was able to take that away and put it back and what they give if they take it away.  And then we also have Google releasing its transparency report, which shows nothing but a huge increase, some of it attributable to Turkey now being on YouTube, but a huge increase in government censorship requests to Google.  And that's just what Google tells us. We don't know what happens on some other services.  So I just wanted to have my usual sermon net here of just saying that that I fear what's happening with government control of the net.  Meanwhile, we also have France and Germany and Brazil publishers working with government all trying to cut off Google, Google News and not allow pardon me there because it's dark and I'm pink again.  I'm back.  Not allowing them to do snippets because they want basically to have a piece of Google's taxes.  And one last piece, I watched an appalling, I thought, hearing this week in the UK with Google, Amazon and Starbucks about what's so called tax avoidance.  And it's quite irksome that countries, companies like these operate in the UK and countries around the world and pay little taxes because of accounting things.  But it's it's tax minimization. What no one gets is that it's Google saying in the end of the day that they have a fiduciary responsibility to minimize taxes, maximize profits, maximize value for their shareholders.  If you don't like the law, change the law. And you have a lot of countries now that are trying to look at Google and say, we want a piece of your pie or else we're going to cause you big trouble.  So a little around the world government and the Internet still aren't getting along.  Any reaction to that rant or we can move on to the next story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Strong going challenge. I mean, the the IGC thing was was interesting to see some of the stuff going on there because that was originally attempted by the ITU to rest back control of the Internet.  And it was good to see that a lot of the government types who were there were actually pushing back against that and fighting for the Internet to stay open again.  Now that piece was good. The taxation and financial stuff is always going to be tricky.  And some of the things that the companies do do seem a bit fishy.  But you can see why they do them. They end up saying, but the things that Google does to make sure it doesn't pay tax in lots of the world by moving money between Ireland and Holland and the United States.  And the Dutch Antilles and whatever else is they do this like elaborate selling mythical services to other subsidiaries.  So they don't end up paying corporation tax anywhere.  And then they sit there with all this money overseas. They can't bring back to the US if they do, they'll have to pay tax on it.  So there's a lot of weirdness going on in that field.  And I'm not sure what the answer is to solve that.  I mean, the US solved it for individuals by saying, well, we'll tax you wherever you are in the world.  So screw you if you're American. You if you go to France, we'll tax you.  We'll tax you twice. But they haven't done that with corporations yet.  And if they did, that might make it a lot trickier for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but the problem is that the issue there is not with Google with a corporation.  The issue there is government to government.  And they all want their slice of the pie and they all don't want to give up their incentives to have companies do business there and sort of somewhere else.  And so you see Google called on the carpet. I really don't like defending Google all the time.  I'd rather criticize Google. It gives me more credibility.  But it was a rather ridiculous display, I thought, of trying to make Google into an enemy and just say that this is immoral when they're following the law that the MPs who criticize them wrote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the Dutch sandwich and the Irish double Irish that we're talking about.  I mean, this is bigger than Google, right? This isn't lots of companies do this, right?  I mean, this is an issue. The taxation issue is happens to lots of companies, right?  This isn't Google specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they go after Google because Google is such an easy target, right?  That's that's that's the thing that gets me my dander up that, you know, Google's a big bad American company.  And one of the things that the head of his name is Britain, ironically, I think of operations in Northern Europe, as he called it, the wet countries said in the end,  I wish the Google he was British. He said, I wish Google were a British company.  I wish Larry went to Cambridge, but it isn't. And he didn't.  And it's an American company. And the real value of Google is in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Right. Do you feel like Google being what are the things that Google can do something about?  So that's a government to government issue. Do you think that Google being issuing their transparency reports about government requests?  That's that I think, again, not to pat Google on the back, but that's that's a good thing.  Right. What else can they do?  To deal with these kind of issues. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's good. I think the more transparency about about what it is, Google has knowledge around the earth.  And and really, it's probably not Google's job as a journalist job to explain it.  Seemly, the tax structure that goes on around the world, it does, in fact, have Google play, pay very low taxes in the UK.  And I understand why people emotionally are upset about that.  But what they don't understand is Google's fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders.  That's the way we're set up. It's the structure.  And what do you expect them to do to voluntarily pay more taxes than their shareholders would sue them?  So it's really kind of a journalistic story, I think.  But I like that idea, Gina, in that Google stands in a position to compare things around the world.  They could they could probably compare what companies pay and taxes and things like that around the world.  Be rather uncomfortable for them. But. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, even I don't expect them to pay voluntarily, pay more taxes.  That seems crazy. I mean, I'm generally pretty nice and think that Google should go out of its way to to to do the right thing.  But paying more voluntarily, paying more taxes seems an insane thing to expect from a company that, like you said, has a responsibility to maximize profits.  And this is all legal what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The same with bit Robbie.  I think, again, yes, you know, he was only paying 13 percent tax or whatever it was.  And then the argument becomes, well, OK, that was legal. But was it nice?  And that was that this that's what's happening in the UK.  I think they've actually looked at how much tax big companies are paying.  Starbucks, I think, was the one that they made the most case for because they actually got a lot of employees in the country.  It's not like it's a virtual company that can be anywhere.  They're actually selling coffee, but they were still doing some kind of shenanigans to make sure they didn't end up paying any tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're paying 20 percent cost to for for a brand and other services to a subsidiary, I think, in Netherlands or somewhere like that.  But but even so, part of the argument that was made by a defender of Starbucks, and I don't know the Starbucks and Amazon stories well enough,  but Starbucks is investing in more and more and more stores in the UK, employing more and more people, paying payroll taxes for them.  And the argument there is the net is good for them.  We should have this week in taxes, which would be a very boring show, even worse.  But it does end up with with the demonization constantly of the of the big technology company now.  And there's there's there's ancillary danger in that, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what part of this is that is the tension between the nets inherent global nature and local laws?  And that's playing out in lots of different respects.  So the the ITU transfer fees that were negotiated for phone companies that help subsidize state telcos was part of the the rant at the IGF thing.  And there are the similar things with territoriality in rights distributions and things like that.  The discussion that Corey Doctorow has been promoting about the problems of selling ebooks because the history was if you don't have rights in that territory, anyone can sell on it.  And ebooks is reversed that.  So therefore, suddenly, you can't buy English language books in non-English speaking countries when they're ebooks.  So there's a whole bunch of this stuff that is we're trying to go from stuff that is inherently territorially focused and naturally bounded by geography to stuff that is not that is naturally connected to the to the entire world, because that's how the Internet was designed.  And the sort of boundaries between the two are very, very messy and being sorted out the moment.  This is going to go on for a while.  And it's you know, it's back and forth between the two of them as to as to which is valuable.  But obviously, my bias is towards the global nature of the net and finding new ways of dealing with it.  But I can see the opposite perspective from the from the country is going, wait a minute.  Why why have these companies suddenly become immune to being taxed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I think what it does is it shows how the net challenges the very essence and existence of governments.  And that is highly disruptive.  And governments are going to fight that.  And it goes back to I think we have to constantly defend technology against its demonization by people who are threatened by it or disrupted by it.  All right. So we've got about 10 minutes left.  Why don't we do around Robin and Leo to start this before I thought it was fun of just doing the stories that we want to do on the run down anywhere, anywhere.  Why don't you start, Gina?  Yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is I didn't include this in the change log because it was kind of developer heavy.  But I wanted to mention it.  Google introduces a six month trial for Cloud SQL, which is their Google App Engine database section that they're upping the storage to 100 gigabytes.  So you get a free six month trial, 100 gigabytes of storage and a MySQL database.  This sounds really developer heavy.  But I've got kind of my tongue hanging out here because I feel like Google App Engine is an opportunity for Google to to let users or I mean right now it's for developers service for developers.  But I would love to see it to be a consumer product where people can deploy their own web apps, their own server side web apps into their kind of personal cloud.  Right. And that's kind of what we do with ThinkUp.  ThinkUp is a web app I build.  It's PHP, MySQL, unfortunately.  So I'm not you can't actually deploy it on Google App Engine because Google App Engine only supports Python and Java at the moment.  And there's some crazy hacky way to get PHP to work with the job with Java.  But I haven't I haven't actually done that yet.  But this is 100 gigabytes of MySQL storage, which is pretty amazing.  Super fast reads and writes.  And I don't know, Kevin, have you have you played around with have you done much with Google App Engine?  I think the last bit of dev work I did with App Engine was was a Google Wave bot back in the day.  It deployed it on App Engine and haven't done anything since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to have to start with it in the past.  Haven't done much stuff recently.  And obviously I should say I have an interest here.  I work for Salesforce that owns Heroku.  And so we have our own cloud hosting stuff that that is more generous about what it lets you host.  That's pretty that way.  I think this is this is this is always interesting.  I think I agree with you.  We had a conversation about this when we were driving up to Twig about the difficulty of being able to deploy something into somebody else's cloud and whether that's that's still fairly painful.  There is still be able to there are sort of closed business with force.com.  You can do it this way.  You can say, OK, I want to deploy this thing, this app in my domain.  But it's quite hard to do it as a consumer to say I would like to deploy this thing somewhere.  And what's happened is the hosting companies have, as you say, standardized on PHP and MySQL.  But that doesn't you know that those aren't necessarily the most secure things to deploy in the world.  And I think that Matt Biddle said this week says that the price of a self hosted WordPress installed is eternal vigilance.  You're always sitting there trying to find out where the leaks are and what's what's gone wrong this week.  So the challenge is to come up with a way of saying, yes, I'd like to deploy this thing and have your own instance of it running in the cloud somewhere.  So that's that's something that all of us who are doing this cloud services would like to do.  But it's still not straightforward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And model for that.  I mean, Gina, my dream is that is that is that Amazon, Google, wherever I can put up a module and say, yes, give me my own cloud based instance of thick up.  And when you need to put out an update for security update, just like an Android app, it just pushes out and I can keep using it happily and paying you or whatever.  I don't understand why that's been so difficult.  Why it doesn't exist.  Kevin, if you would think of be doable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of doable, right?  I mean, it's sort of doable.  Like if you maintain a WordPress installation, you know, right?  Every once in a while you have to hit update.  I mean, I mean, the goal is that you be able to deploy not only deploy, but seamlessly roll out updates and have those updates kind of happen in your cloud automatically without you having to think about it.  And that's a little harder to do.  And we're working on that when we think up and with various cloud providers.  But but yeah, we need to get there.  But when you don't own the whole the whole stack, right, it gets harder to do updates and easy deploys because every environment has kind of just different different variables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Kevin, why isn't there a retail version of Salesforce?  Pardon me, lights again.  It's Halloween.  Where? Yeah, even if I don't use Salesforce because I don't, you know, do the thing Salesforce does.  I know Mark better off say we all do things Salesforce does.  But let's just get past that.  Where you do have an environment where where you couldn't you do this?  Is this going down?  Is this you going down?  Oh, we've lost Kevin.  Okay.  Well, I was going to tell you his story next, but he was seemed to be losing his bandwidth as we went.  So I want to mention two quick things real fast.  One is maybe it's one actually.  So sorry, I'm back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I can try and respond to that.  Go ahead.  Well, in a sense, we have that for Salesforce.  You can deploy apps into our cloud that then go out to to to users.  We've got a marketplace for that.  But as you said, it's not a consumer.  You have to you have to sign up for Salesforce account to get access to that.  And similarly, Google has that for their if you do apps for your domain and set stuff up there, they've got a store there that will let you install stuff in the cloud.  And you're right.  The challenge is making this something that makes more sense on a consumer basis because we've managed to do it to install to local devices, which in some ways is harder.  So it will be good to be able to do that.  So, yeah, I agree.  It's something we should work on.  There's one thing while we're being extremely geeky, the one thing we did release is being built is Heroku pipeline, which is designed to make it easier to do this kind of stage deployment between different  between different devices, sorry, different instances.  So you can just say, OK, deploy this and then upgrade that one upgrade that one upgrade that one.  But it's still command line based.  It isn't fully automatic yet.  So there's still work to be done here.  The challenge with this is it's all configuration management stuff and making sure that you can have different configurations running in different places and then keeping track of all those configurations and what they're doing.  So it's not it's not the world's hardest problem.  It's more of a it's not.  But it's more a database administration problem and authorization problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if Gina's told how to write an app in a way that that you or Google Apps will allow it to happen and allow her to update it regularly, then it becomes a lot easier to retail level for dummies like me to get it.  Which we got.  Kevin, we're running toward what is it called home base again?  You have a story you want to hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanted to mention the the Mark Cuban ranting at Facebook story.  I think that's interesting.  So this so this is what's happened is is people are seeing this seeing Facebook as bait and switch.  So when Facebook was encouraging companies to create brand pages on Facebook, they said, well, if anyone likes you on Facebook, you get the right to then send emails and status updates to them and they'll see them in their timeline.  And that's that's how it will work.  So you should encourage people to like you on Facebook because that will give you access to them.  So they were trying to create a sort of knowledge network within Facebook of that.  Then as they improved their I think they were edge rank algorithm that decides which stories they show in your feed, because if they try to show you all the stories that potentially in your feed, it would scroll faster and you could read it.  They found that a lot of these corporate messages and a lot of these other things were not things people were interacting with.  And so they were getting deemphasized in their feed.  So now Facebook is selling promoted stories to you to say, well, if you want people to actually see these things you're posting, you should pay us money and then they'll show up as promoted things in the same way that Twitter does.  Most tweets and there's been a huge backlash from the from the brand people who feel betrayed by Facebook for this thing.  Wait a minute.  But you told us we could talk to people and now you're saying we have to pay you to talk to people.  And this is this is nasty and and Cuban has posted a big rant about this and said, I'm going to take all my NBA TV.  NBA teams and my personal HD networks and blah, blah, blah, and whatever else he does off Facebook and put them on my space, which is interesting threat.  But the point is, it is this tension between what is it that I've chosen to see and what is the algorithm trying to see me this sort of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is true of Twitter, especially of Facebook and also Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's less true of Twitter because Twitter doesn't shows you everyone you subscribe to by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but it acknowledges that you don't see everything.  So it tries to do other random things now and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So for Twitter, the promoted tweets come to you even though you don't subscribe to them.  Whereas for Facebook, they're saying you already subscribe to Mark Cuban business, whatever it is.  But you won't like likely won't see it.  But if he pays us three thousand dollars, then that many people will get to see it.  It'll show up in their stream at some point.  So there's there.  There is a tension here between what's who gets to see what.  This is also potentially both Facebook and Twitter's way of getting around the we can't sell ads on mobile problem by selling ads that are actually part of the stream.  So there's there's there is that tension between the two there, which is how much of your stream would you like to be taken over with that?  So they do need to charge enough for that that people don't give up reading Facebook or Twitter entirely because their stream gets gets completely flooded with it.  So it's a messy dynamic.  It's going to be interesting to watch it play out.  But it's interesting to see that there is such a strong revolt against it from from some of the content providers who suddenly feel they've been held hostage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. I didn't understand that.  Gina, you have any reaction to Cubans rant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was funny.  That was about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to mention one story and then we'll get to our tools and tips and stuff.  And it is not exactly a light topic.  It's not at all, but it was fascinating that the Israeli Defense Force, the IDF, announced a military assault on Hamas in Gaza today, not in a press conference, not in a press release, but on Twitter.  And what is also fascinating is that Hamas came back and then attacked the IDF on Twitter.  So IDF said, We recommend that no Hamas operatives, whether low level or senior leaders, show their faces above ground in the days ahead.  And the Al Qasam Brigades came back and said, Our blessed hands will reach your leaders and soldiers wherever they are.  You opened hell gates on yourselves.  Well, I guess my only reaction to this is I wish that Twitter were the only place they were fighting.  But I find it fascinating that even a global war starts to be played out in our little world.  So that was all I had to say about that.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty incredible. We go from Justin Bieber and UFC fighters calling out fights and the president basically accepting his reelection to that.  I mean, it's incredible really what goes on on Twitter now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's amazing. It's an acknowledgement of the power of Twitter for good or bad or whatever you think of it.  It's the way to go directly to people and directly to media as well.  So, all right. So I hope we survive pretty much without a few technical glitches.  We'll do tools, tips, and whatever we call it.  Kevin, do you have any contribution in that end or you don't have to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, mine was Open Garden. That was my tool of the week, which is the sort of personal area networking.  And this is a ridiculous luxury here, which is if you have two Android devices and one of them has connectivity, the other one can get connectivity too.  Which is like, hmm. But as I do, I found it really useful.  That was something that was actually very practical for me this week.  So I'm recommending that if you have, particularly if you have a Nexus 7 that's Wi-Fi only, but has Bluetooth and you have a phone that has other connectivity,  you suddenly find you can use them both as you're wandering around, which is nice.  Beautiful. Gia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that is nice. A cool new Chrome experiment really quickly called 100,000 Stars.  The short URL is g.co slash 100,000 stars.  It visualizes 100,000 stars closest to the sun using data from an array of sources, including NASA and the European Space Agency.  And you kind of zoom around and click around to sort of explore the galaxy and look at different star names.  It's a really, really neat Chrome experiment. I think it runs only in Chrome.  I think that that's it uses the experiment makes use of Google Chrome support for WebGL, CSS3D and Web Audio.  So really cool. G.co slash 100,000 stars.  We got a moment and you want to take a look at the sky and it kind of walks you through a little narrative at first, which Chad is showing us here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cool. I'm really cool. Yeah, but it's cool.  Oh, it moves. There's music.  Folks on audio, what you see is a whole bunch of stars. You look at the sky. It'll work too, but it's really very neat. Music. Oh, wow.  Google is fascinated with outer space, aren't they? Yeah. They love stars and all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is fantastic for kids, especially kids and adults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. So number of the week. Very quickly. Google's worldwide ad revenue reached 10.9 billion dollars in the first half.  And somebody came in and noticed that that was more than all of the U.S. print ad revenue.  So it's a big apples and oranges, apples and con quats. It's Google worldwide versus U.S. only print.  Nonetheless, it's why everybody is so jealous of Google and going after their butt because Google is making more in ad revenue than all print media now make in the United States.  And that is a pretty astonishing stat in and of itself.  So I think that we made it.  Chad, thank you very, very much. The indomitable, amazing Chad has brought us home here.  Kevin, we want to thank you for joining us in our Leo this week. You want to plug tumblevision.tv, correct? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're still on hiatus. But yes, there's there's a hundred shows in the archive there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you want to do a Kickstarter to pay for the production assistance that Kevin needs to bring back to tumblevision, is that would that be accurate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be something that could be done. Yeah.  The challenge is we lost our producer and between the three of us, we're not we're not organized enough to produce it ourselves.  So we need to get someone else to help us out with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You use popcorn. Gina, you want to plug it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My daughter is doing great. I actually I issued a new release of the of my Android app this week.  It's got a few new translations, Czech, Russian, Italian, German.  And you can find it in Google Play Store. And it's also out for iOS.  It's a to do text dot com. It's a text based task manager.  And that's all I got. Thank you so much, Jeff. You did. You did great. You did great this week.  I mean, obviously, we all really miss Leo, but it was really fun show. It was a great panel.  We hope thanks for taking the reins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in. Is it Australia, Chad, where he is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's in Australia. He's on a boat right now.  They watched the eclipse the other day, the solar eclipse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really neat. That was yesterday. Yeah. I saw the same photos of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I think we can call into the show, Darnit. But that's none of the matter.  So thank you all out there for suffering along with our Leo this week.  He'll be back in two weeks and near two weeks.  Next week, we do the show again right before Thanksgiving.  And then the weekend for that will be thankful that Leo returns.  So that's it. This week in Google. We'll see you next week.
