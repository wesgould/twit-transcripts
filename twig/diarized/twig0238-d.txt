Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  We have a very interesting conversation coming up.  When Comcast got Netflix to pay a little more money  for access to Comcast customers,  I thought that was a violation of net neutrality.  Turns out the story's a lot more complicated.  We've got an expert who's gonna explain all  and a whole lot more coming up on Twig.  Netcast you love.

I have unfortunate news.  Gina Tripani has the day off.  She's working on Think Up.  Had some stuff to do unavoidably.  How dare she have a job?  But I have very good news from Giga.  Matthew Ingram is joining us.  So it's nice that you could be here, Matthew.  We appreciate it.  And then I wanted to point out an article or a blog post,  actually, I read on the streaming media blog,  streamingmediablog.com, about how pretty much everybody  who covered the Netflix Comcast story got it wrong.  The author Dan Rayburn is an analyst at Frost and Sullivan.  He's an EVP at streamingmedia.com,  which is a magazine, an online site,  and also a conference, throws conferences on streaming media.  And this blog post really raked everyone over the coals,  TechCrunch, Wall Street Journal, NPR,  for not understanding the Netflix Comcast deal.  And most of us, and I'm going to include myself in this,  treated it as Comcast squeezing Netflix  for access to Comcast customers.  And as data points, for instance,  Netflix offers an Open Connect system,  which many other ISPs, including Google,  are members of that give direct access to Netflix data  to those ISPs and their customers at no charge.  And that Comcast had been, well, I shouldn't say it this way,  that Netflix had noticed a drop of streaming speeds  of 27% since October on Comcast.  As a Comcast customer, I had really noticed  that Netflix became almost unusable on Comcast.  Some had even said, and there were some data points  to demonstrate it, that Comcast was actively blocking Netflix  in violation of their agreement with the FCC.  So Dan, where did we get it wrong?  Well...  In every respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a confusing topic.  The thing that people don't understand is,  and it's understandable they don't get it  because they're not from the industry or the networking spaces,  people are using a lot of terms like transit,  peering, interconnections, CDN,  and they don't really understand how it all connects with one another,  who's responsible for paying whom,  and that's where the big breakdown here is.  The other thing is, Netflix is currently delivering video to ISPs  using three different types of CDN networks,  using all different types of providers in that ecosystem.  So the easiest way to think about it is that  Netflix has a lot of options for delivering video to the ISP.  The ISP itself, Comcast, Verizon, whoever it may be,  does not control how Netflix sends that traffic to their network.  What they do historically is they use middlemen  who are called transit providers.  So you've read a lot about Cogent.  Cogent is a transit provider.  So the way it works very simply is  Netflix has their own servers that are sitting  in third-party co-location facilities.  They buy transit, they pay Cogent for that transit,  and Cogent gives Netflix a guaranteed level of quality.  Cogent then goes to level three and says,  we want to connect to your network for free.  Level three, sorry, Comcast will let them connect for free  under what's called settlement-free peering.  However, all transit providers have to abide  by the peering policy that that ISP has.  So if you go to comcast.com slash peering,  you can see Comcast peering policy.  Comcast treats Cogent just like any other transit provider.  When the transit provider wants to send more traffic  than the peering policy allows,  that transit provider has to pay for it.  However, Comcast has been very adamant,  and their CEO still to this day is going out and saying,  we should not have to pay.  It's interesting to know that Cogent has also had  eight or nine of our other public disputes like this  over transit with ISPs, but other transit providers haven't.  So it's really an issue of where Cogent is trying  to push everything to Comcast and blame Comcast.  And Comcast basically has cut Cogent out of the deal,  gone to a mutual interconnect agreement  with Comcast directly.  So it's Comcast and Netflix directly, cutting out Cogent,  which does two things.  It increases the quality for consumers,  and it lowers Netflix cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think one of the things that people assumed  is that this was bad for, this is an anti-net neutrality agreement  because I think the assumption is that Comcast squeezed Netflix  and made them pay more than they would have otherwise.  And I think many of us feel like, well, I pay Comcast,  shouldn't my access to Netflix be the same as everything else?  Is Comcast next going to ask YouTube for money?  Or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've already cut those deals.  So a lot of people in the media said this is the first time  a deal like this has been done.  It's factually inaccurate.  Back in 98 and 99, we were covering in the market  when guys like AOL and Yahoo were cutting deals like this  with ISPs.  So Microsoft cuts these types of deals.  Google cuts these types of deals.  AOL does.  Yahoo does.  This isn't new by any sense of the means.  Also, keep in mind what you're paying your ISP for.  You're paying your ISP for that last mile piece to the internet.  However, the ISP does not control the content that's  coming into their network.  The content owner or CDN controls that.  So Netflix controls where they ingest it into the ISP's network,  which transit provider they use, how many different links  they connect, what the quality of service  is with that transit provider, and what they're willing to pay.  Now, an interesting thing to note here is if you have an Apple  TV box and you're on Comcast, you don't have a problem.  Why is that?  Well, the reason is that level three and Limelight Networks,  which are third party CDNs, are doing the delivery of Netflix  content specifically for the Apple TV box  because Netflix has made the decision of how they get content  to specific devices on specific networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting.  So I can use Comcast on an Apple TV and get better Netflix?  Yes, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Comcast doesn't control that.  Netflix controls it.  So people don't realize that Netflix is the one who controls this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there are a couple of reasons that I believe the notion that  Comcast was squeezing Netflix.  First, of course, because Comcast is in the same business.  They stream movies via stream pics.  So it made sense to me.  It might be an anti-competitive move.  But the other one is that Netflix offers this Open Connect  which many ISPs are members of, but not Comcast and not Verizon,  by the way.  Verizon is going to also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And not AT&T.  And not AT&T.  Warner and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So why would Comcast not just do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what people don't understand again about Open Connect.  Open Connect is a program.  If you just Google Open Connect, you go to Netflix page.  Open Connect is a program where Netflix places servers that they  own and operate inside the last mile of the ISP.  Now the idea is, okay, just the ISP should let us come in,  place our own hardware in there, let us control it, let us manage it,  and it's completely free to the ISP.  It's not free to the ISP.  The ISP has to give you space.  They have to give you power.  They have to give you handoffs.  They have to give you engineering resources.  It's a direct cost to them.  Now, guys like Google Fiber, Cablevision, CenturyLink,  they've agreed to Open Connect because they feel it makes sense  for the business model that they have.  But...  And perhaps for their customers too.  For their customers too.  Let's not forget them.  Absolutely.  But Google Fiber has less than million subs.  Comcast has more than 20 million.  So we're comparing two completely different ISPs in terms of size  and shape.  So each ISP has to look at what makes the most sense for them.  Do they want to connect via paid peering?  Do they want to do transit connections?  Do they want to do third-party CDNs through Akamai Limelight  Level 3 and Edgecast?  Or do they want to do Open Connect?  There's a lot of options in the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Dan, can I ask you something?  Sure.  So let's say this particular arrangement doesn't actually have  anything to do with net neutrality.  But it seems as though what got people was the sense that Comcast  is becoming too powerful and its control over the last mile  in so many places is too powerful and that customers are going to  suffer or that the internet in general is going to suffer.  What do you think of that?  Would you agree with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so here's what I've said quite a bit publicly for a long time  is I'm a firm believer that more choice in the market is good for  consumers when it comes to telecommunication services and wireline  services.  I mean, I've always seen from this industry from 15 years ago when  we had more providers in the space.  If you think of the days when Real Networks was around, you know,  Real Networks and Microsoft were battling it out over the video war.  And as a result, they added so many new improvements to their player  and their platforms every couple months.  They were eager to outdo one another.  So I think it's better that we have more options in the market instead  of less.  But now we're talking less about net neutrality and really talking  about the whole time Warner merger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the duopoly that the FCC has foisted on the American public  that, you know, most people in the US can only get internet service  from one cable company and one phone company.  True.  And there is no competition.  So Comcast, you know, I'm a Comcast customer.  If I'm not happy, I don't have a choice.  Right.  Which is where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is one way or the other.  It does become a net neutrality argument in the broader sense is  what I'm arguing.  I sat in rooms in Silicon Valley way back in the day when at home  argued for premium period arrangements.  And what was evident then is still evident now is there is a moral  hazard here.  And the moral hazard is those who pay me those who do a deal with  me, those who let me control will get better service.  And so the issue here isn't so much the specifics of this case.  The issue that I'm arguing is that FCC you got to step in and set  principles and and and and well now we know that the FCC under Tom  Wheeler isn't going to that's that's what I fear.  That's my problem with all this.  That's why I say about things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  You're talking about a bigger picture.  I mean, the other interesting thing to note here is keep in mind  that Netflix never had any quality of service issues of any kind until  they decided to build their own CDN.  Why did they do that when they were using Netflix limelight and  level 3 and splitting traffic amongst all three providers for years?  We didn't have these problems because the CDN is are already connected  to the ISP's what they do.  That's their whole business.  So Netflix made a business decision to stop using third-party CDN's  build their own servers get colocation space by transit.  Why did they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question.  Are you saying that among the ISP's who participate in Open Connect  their QoS issues?  It's only on the ISP's who are not participating in Open Connect.  Am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because keep in mind it's based on transit.  So if you're a content delivery network, think Ackermeyer limelight  Level 3 what you're doing is you're buying transit from multiple  providers.  There's about 15 major transit providers out there.  You're probably buying transit from half of them.  And what you're doing is anytime there's an issue in real time, you're  watching the performance of that video in real time.  You are using multiple providers to get around any type of bottlenecks  you have and that's why the CDN's really worked so well.  That's why Netflix and everybody else was using CDN's and today everybody  who doesn't build their own CDN is using third-party CDN networks.  So Netflix decided they wanted to take more control and try and put  servers inside the last mile and in places like Europe Open Connect  did really well.  In Europe Netflix was able to stop using third-party CDN's for almost  all their video delivery because the ISP's in Europe said, okay, you  can come into our network and play servers.  In the US the large ISP's didn't go for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why did it work so much better in Europe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they went for it.  There's no issue of transit if you're in the last mile.  There's no issue of transit.  You're there.  You're delivering the content from the ISP's own operation center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes and no.  Sure, transit's not involved, but you still have QoS issues inside the  last mile.  Well, that's my question.  Do you?  Yes, absolutely.  That's why SLA's exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're saying that with Open Connect they didn't solve the QoS issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Open Connect did not solve the QoS issue by itself.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that because they had to transit the information to the Open Connect  servers in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Open Connect is two different things.  Open Connect is a platform, but Open Connect is also...  There's two ways to think of Open Connect.  Netflix has their own servers running Open Connect platform, which are  sitting in third-party data centers like Equinix, which are then connected  to transit into ISP's.  That's Open Connect.  But Open Connect is also the server with the software on it that goes  inside a place like Google Fiber or Cablevision.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have the other story we're not talking about.  Sorry, Matthew.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I just wondered.  You asked the question, why did they build their own?  Why do you think they built their own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think primarily they wanted to have more control.  If you look back at what Netflix talked about, one of the VPs who  really spearheads the whole content delivery at Netflix last year came to our show  and did a 30-minute presentation, which I just posted on my blog yesterday.  Yes, I see it here.  Explaining, here's what our approach is to the market.  Here's why we want to do it.  Also, this is the second time Netflix has tried to build their own CDN.  In 2007, they tried to build their own CDN and they failed and they went back to  using CDN providers.  So this isn't the first time they've tried this and had problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My question is, do they fail because there's a technical issue?  Or do they fail because Comcast and Verizon and others don't want them to succeed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not a technical issue, but they failed because the business model that they  had at the time didn't work for every single provider and not every ISP is the same size.  Now, keep in mind too, people say, okay, Comcast doesn't want them to benefit in any way.  But if Comcast were to do that, Comcast would also lose subscribers.  That doesn't help Comcast business.  And then you have ISPs who don't compete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, that's the question.  Would Comcast lose subscribers?  Or would Netflix lose subscribers and then Comcast serve content from another content  company that was more cooperative with Comcast business model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That implies that subscribers have somewhere else to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  It's a monopoly.  So who's going to lose business?  Comcast, they can't.  It's a monopoly.  Netflix, they can because there's other competitors out there who may well have deals with Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the other issue with a merger, which you mentioned, is that Comcast is in a killer  negotiation position with all content holders.  They're dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, this agreement with Netflix and Comcast does include an SLA now, right?  They have a service level agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two SLAs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, from the point of view of Netflix subscribers on Comcast, they're going to be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Not overnight.  It's going to take a couple of weeks, but yes, they're going to be happy.  And the price isn't going to go up because Netflix is actually saving money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's an interesting point.  And I understand this is tough.  Netflix is now 32% of all bandwidths during prime time in the US.  So, you mean you talk about big, you talk about dominant.  A third of all the bandwidth in prime time in the US is Netflix traffic.  Yeah.  So, I understand why this is an issue for everybody.  Is it really Cogent that is being intransigent here?  Cogent says we will not pay anyone anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem.  That's not the way the business works.  So, Cogent wants to be a transit provider like everybody else out there, but wants to be treated special.  They don't want to have to apply by, play by any of the rules that every other transit provider has played by for 20 years.  And it's one of the reasons why the vast majority of the major CDNs out there absolutely refuse to buy transit from Cogent because they're so difficult to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why does Netflix use them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd have to ask Netflix.  Netflix doesn't just use Cogent though.  Keep in mind that they buy transit from multiple providers.  The two major ones that they buy for are Cogent and Level 3.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm interested that European ISPs went for this deal, but American ISPs didn't.  What is the crucial difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know offhand.  I haven't spoken to a lot of the European ISPs, but one thing to think about is that the vast majority of Netflix traffic is still inside the US.  So there's more problems delivering video inside the last mile here simply because of the capacity.  Whereas in Europe, there's not as much traffic being delivered to those ISPs and they're not having as much of an issue with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other story, pardon me while I'll stay up in high altitude, low oxygen.  The other story, I think, not being discussed as part of this is a copyright story.  The other thing to think about is that the need to resend the same movie over and over and over again, rather than being able to use better technologies like peer-to-peer technologies, the amount of streaming that occurs through BitTorrent now, and yet it's not really available on the commercial side of things.  And so that's an issue too, is that the legal situation is stopping us from finding efficient transit for content in ways that I think we could fix if we could sit down and figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, peer-to-peer technologies doesn't work very well for something like Netflix because of the content protection.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  That's precisely what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If we could fix that and get around content protection but get in a way that still protects the holder.  It's the same absurdity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Netflix has to stream a single copy of each movie for each subscriber.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so what happened with, for example, on a different level, on the DVR level, the virtual DVR, it was Cablevision that was the first cable company to experiment with a legal shot across the bow to say that we're going to keep a single copy.  If you're all watching Big Bang Theory, rather than having to record the same exact show 100,000 times, we'll record it once.  But you'll have the rights to record it and the rights to watch it.  So we have to get to a rights management structure.  What we're doing right now is an insane, insane and wasteful kludge around antiquated copyright laws.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I would agree.  The biggest problem outside of copyright, I mean, the biggest problem we have in the industry as a whole is there's no standards.  There's no standard video format, bitrate, codec, aspect ratio, player protocol, nothing.  And the only way you're going to have that is you need Apple, Microsoft, Sony, Google, you need all these guys to work together.  And the problem Netflix has is they have to take one piece of video and transcode it 25 different times, times 50,000 videos, and then build a separate player or app for every single device in the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's crazy.  We're talking with Dan Rayburn.  Dan Rayburn, he is executive vice president of streamingmedia.com and it was his post on the streaming media blog that caught my eye on Monday.  And I, you know, I'll fall on my own knife saying that the media got this story very wrong.  And of course, you can see why.  It's a pretty technical story.  And Dan himself, even though this is his beat, said he had to ask some network providers for clarification in some cases.  But your salient points are that this these commercial interconnects are how the Internet works.  It doesn't have to do with net neutrality.  Do you not feel that Comcast in any way has put the squeeze on Cogent and or Netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because what people don't understand is Cogent is selling a service to Netflix and they're guaranteeing a level of quality.  And then they're going to Comcast and saying, even though I've sold a service, I can't deliver.  You need to give me more access to your network than I'm allowed to have via your peering policy.  Oh, and by the way, give it to me for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And by the way, this is, yeah, and by the way, this is something Verizon is now is dealing with as well.  And you can expect a similar, I imagine a similar result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Verizon and AT&T have already publicly stated that they will do similar deals with Netflix shortly.  Is Netflix happy with this deal?  Absolutely. Their cost goes down. The quality goes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I mean, if it were a net neutrality issue, the first thing you'd expect is that Netflix would be upset.  The second thing you'd expect is Netflix competitors to say, well, you see, we're disadvantaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netflix would be happy to do this deal. What about you?  Right.  What happens if you're expected to do things that you can't do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the fact that Netflix is OK with it doesn't mean it's not a problem, a competitive problem.  They've just paid the guy who controls the pipe for access to your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I couldn't get these at Netflix for my cable at some point, I'm going to there's going to be riots in the street.  Right. So Netflix knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the problem, though. It's not competitive because you don't go out and build your own CDN unless you're the size of scale of Apple, Microsoft, Netflix.  There's less than 10 guys who built their own CDN out there.  So if you want good quality video and you're smaller and you can't cut a deal with Comcast like Netflix can,  you use a third party CDN like Akamai, Limelight or Level 3 or Edgecast and you get the same level of quality at a cheaper price because you're a smaller provider.  So it's definitely not a competitive issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So just bottom line, you say I should watch Netflix on Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, for now, you know, now it's going to get improved.  Let's get to the important point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chromecast, is that a good choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Chromecast isn't really a streaming box, per se.  You know, Chromecast is really different than, say, a Roku or Apple TV.  How? OK, you're right. How's Roku? Is it good?  Roku is the best box in the market in terms of content choices available.  If you go to streamingmediadevices.com, you can see a breakout chart of all the devices in the market and all the content choices they have.  Is the throughput good, though?  Well, that's not on the Apple TV.  So but I don't think you have to worry about that because now that the deal is signed and it's already underway,  it's going to be good on everything within a couple more weeks. All this will be gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And then and then poor Voodoo will have to suffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Walmart? Yeah, I don't know that anybody really cares about Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, to me, that's kind of the issue is that the other streaming companies competing with Netflix now need to make the same deal, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they don't, because keep in mind, Hulu doesn't run a CDN.  Hulu uses Akamai, Limelight level.  And they've made those deals.  Right. And the CDNs already have transit in place through providers to get into the ISP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's why it doesn't it doesn't affect me, Jeff, because I don't have my own CDN.  I am on you, Stream and Justin and Bit Gravity.  And those providers have deals with, I presume, Level 3 and others.  Yes.  OK, well, I think, Dan, you have made everything clear as mud, but it's not your fault.  Because it is really complicated stuff, although you've done the best job explaining it.  I've heard yet. And I think you've made a strong case why this is a separate issue from net neutrality.  I'm not going to go so far as to say it doesn't impact net neutrality, but is a separate issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But I think you could see, given what Dan described, you could see the sort of pinch points.  If Comcast starts tightening the screws on those CDNs and on those providers who are pushing stuff like from Netflix,  if that starts to become an issue, that's where Comcast control over that last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember, they can't put the screws on them, though, because Netflix has a guaranteed SLA with Comcast that's covered for multiple years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the key that they got in this.  They got a service level agreement that guarantees them a certain performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm not thinking about Netflix specifically. I'm thinking about other content providers.  I mean, companies like Netflix are always going to be able to cut deals.  I'm concerned about companies that we've never even heard of or content providers that come up that are new.  You know, if that starts to be a bottleneck where Comcast controls the access to the last mile, that's a potential problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, because they don't have the traffic that Netflix has.  So there's no bottleneck there because there's no throughput issue.  So if you're an up and coming video company, your traffic is so small that you wouldn't want to cut a deal with Comcast because you're not running your own servers.  You're not a CDN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, apparently Comcast is going to go to Cogent and ask them for money, too, still. Right.  This doesn't eliminate that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, sure it does. Cogent's not going to be the middleman between Comcast and Netflix anymore.  So the money that Netflix was paying Cogent, Cogent's not going to get that money over time.  Cogent has come out and said that about 2 percent, around 2 percent of its total revenue comes from Netflix.  But the interesting stat is somewhere between 70 and 80 percent of all the traffic on Cogent's network is from Netflix.  So what does that tell you about the business model that Cogent is in or any transit provider?  It's not a great business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dave Schaefer, who's the CEO of Cogent, told Ars Technica, and maybe this is his spin on it.  The Comcast wants everybody who they can possibly extract a payment from to pay them,  even though the traffic that's reaching their customers has been paid for by their customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it hasn't been paid for by their customers. It's been paid for by Netflix, the Cogent, not by the customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he's kind of, it sounds like intentionally misrepresenting the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but Cogent's been doing that. If you look just Wikipedia, Cogent, one of the first things that comes up is here's a history of all their major peering disputes with AOL, Teleglow, France Telecom.  The list goes on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really interesting. Wow.  Hey, thank you, Dan. I really appreciate you taking the time.  And if people want to read more, Dan Rayburn's column is at streamingmediablog.com.  And lots of good information there, for instance, prices on transit, which apparently is as low as a buck a megabit.  A lot less than it is in other countries.  Japan, $25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's even lower than that.  And maybe that's something to also just quickly cover is there's been reports out in the media that Comcast wanted $400 million from Netflix for this deal, which is absurd.  And then there were some that were saying, well, the deal size, the Comcast is $25 to $50 million per year.  That's not accurate either.  Last year, Comcast went on record to say that the amount of revenue they got companywide for all these beneficial interconnection agreements that are paid was between $30 and $60 million between all Contenors.  Total.  Total. That's public record. So Netflix is not paying $50 million to Comcast for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they might be paying a significant fraction thereof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're paying. You could run the numbers.  Look at how much capacity they need and look at transit pricing.  And it's not transit pricing you could use as an estimate, because keep in mind Comcast is giving Netflix wholesale pricing.  Right.  But it's not the numbers people are putting out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just looked up Susan Crawford's Twitter feed, because Susan, I think, is brilliant on these issues.  And she wrote a book called, was a captive audience, I think, about the Comcast.  And she's one little fact here, which just gives you an idea of the changing business.  Comcast numbers for the periods of 01 to 05 versus 09 to 13. Revenue up 112 percent, but CapEx up 14 percent.  And her point is that Comcast is now in a position where they're not investing more in growth of capital.  They're harvesting the incredible market position they have.  And so, you know, we hear sometimes that cable is a bad, is great for cash flow, bad for profit.  But the gross revenue, the gross profit on Internet access, as such as that, is very, very high.  And when you own the monopoly, this is where the business starts to go.  So the dynamics of the business start to change for Comcast.  And that's what's worth watching here, is that this is just one small, very small part of Comcast business.  But Comcast is worth watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Susan Crawford's Twitter feed is S. Crawford, if you want to follow along.  And as you mentioned, her book is called Captive Audience.  Thank you, Dan. Really appreciate your time.  Thank you. Appreciate being here.  Really interesting stuff. We'll have you back soon.  Thank you.  Yeah. It's nice to have an expert on this.  And we've been trying really hard to get people like Milo Medin, who runs Google's gigabit project and was formerly Comcast at home.  Formerly at home, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not going to come and talk about that.  No, they don't want to talk about it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we have a shot at Dane Jasper at SonicNet.  He's been very outspoken on all of this, too.  And we will continue to cover the story.  Thank you, Dan.  He actually responded to Dane Jasper, and his thoughts are in the note.  Ah, good. So he couldn't be here, but he did send us a...  Yeah, he did send a little blurb on his thoughts.  A little blurb. All right. Well, we'll talk about that when we come back.  Thanks, Dan.  Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.  Take care. We will continue this week in Google, lots more to talk about.  This is, I think, a great subject, but Google's been kind of busy, too.  So we'll talk about that, too, in just a bit.  Matthew Ingram is here from GigaOM.  Great to have you, as always, Matthew.

If you hover over that cell that says it has the note in it, that's a note.  So, Dane Jasper, who some of you...  We're learning how to use Google Docs today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This fancy technology stuff.  Tool tips.  I always wondered what that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at that. You hover over it.  Hello. That's what you call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dane is a friend of the network he's been on many times before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's regular on This Week in Enterprise Tech,  and he's the CEO and founder of SonicNet,  which is an independent internet service provider that is one of the best in the country,  consistently ranks top in protecting its users.  I just think they're a great company, and it's local.  It's just up the road a piece, so he's been a really good advisor for us all.  And he has a car with a license plate, Linux.  So that's a good thing.  Right, because you asked him about all of this.  Right. We wanted to get an interview, and he said he couldn't be available,  but he sent over...  He says it's an interesting development.  One thought worth discussing may be whether an evolution of the internet into a two-sided model  where both subscribers and content providers ends up,  which is what we're moving, in some ways, moving towards.  You know, you pay for internet access, and then the people who get to you pay for their access.  And it doesn't have to be that the burden is on me,  because it goes upstream to your transit providers and your CDNs.  But he says the question is, does this may benefit large incumbents?  If a competitive entrant can't get content to pay them something,  while the incumbent is collecting money which subsidizes internet access, what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and this is the key issue.  I got into two discussions with Andreessen on Twitter.  T-Mark has been going crazy on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He doesn't want any government regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not sure that's true.  Oh, okay.  Well, Matthew wrote about this, and he'll give us some more in a second.  But I think that the issue remains that we don't have a competitive marketplace.  And we all want a competitive marketplace,  except those who are incumbents in the non-competitive marketplace.  And there's disagreement about how to get there.  And do we need some steps along the way, like regulation,  to protect the consumers who are stuck in a monopoly?  But even those of us who, and I think Susan Crawford will be included in this,  who at some level believe that there's some need for some regulation along the way,  the ultimate solution is competition.  No question about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and you can see why this would worry Dane,  because he's a small guy relative to these guys, although he's becoming bigger.  And he worries that he just cannot compete or new people in the...  You never see a new internet service provider,  because the incumbents have all the deals and it's so done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, to the contrary, you have states passing laws preventing cities...  Where you can't...  ...from creating their own competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's something the FCC should be... like that should not be allowed.  If it's not easy for a region or a city or whatever to fund  or to help develop their own competitive internet service, that's a serious problem.  Then you're basically just relying on Google Fiber to solve all your problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let's talk, because, okay, so Mark Andreessen said,  it's weird to have a debate in 140 character chunks.  Probably not the best format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's an expert at it, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He manages to get a lot in there.  His Twitter handle is PMARCA.  Pmarca, you should follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he did it, and then today Kenny Lehrer, who's an investor in common stuff,  did his own little list, and now there's mockeries of their lists going on.  But you know what he didn't do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What Mark does really well is respond.  If you go back through the thread, it's not just him posting thought after thought after thought.  People challenge him, and then he responds.  That's the crucial difference, and that's where it becomes much more of a debate or a discussion than just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it started with a remark from Matt Iglesias, who was a former Slate writer  and now writes for the new First Look media pier, Omidyar's project.  The internet was nice while it lasted.  And he links to an article on The Verge.  Actually, I don't know if this is...  We're trying to get Neelai Patel as well on this because...  He links to Netflix's paying off Comcast for direct traffic access.  And I love Neelai Patel's article from last year.  I can't say the name of it out loud.  The internet is effed, in which he goes into greater detail about everything screwed up.  So Iglesias says the internet was nice while it lasted.  And then Mark Andreessen responds, suppose...  Well, I'm going to let...  Matthew, you wrote this great article, so I'll let you do it because I'm referring...  Why should I read you your article?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You wrote it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I did was try and take some of the tweets and put them into context because it is hard to follow.  It's if you see one or you see them out of order and then you have to go back and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He basically wrote the Bloomsday book for Mark Andreessen's tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I turned it into a blog because he obviously didn't want to or didn't have time.  He finally did.  He finally did.  Yeah, he finally did.  He did one on media.  You beat him, as usual, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You beat him to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So his point was...  And I talked with him a bit about this after I wrote it.  And then I tried to include some of his responses and just a sort of never ending process.  But his main point was not so much that he doesn't want or think there should be some regulation.  What he's afraid of is that if it's just your common carriers and so you have to do whatever we tell you,  that Comcast and other providers aren't going to invest, and not just Comcast and other providers,  but new companies aren't going to invest the money that's required to create competition.  One quick second, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why Susan Crawford's little data point there is really interesting.  They ain't invested in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  And he admitted that he doesn't actually know how to produce the competition that he wants to see.  It's just his fear is that if there's too much regulation,  it's going to disincentivize anyone from providing the bandwidth that we need.  And his sort of vision of the future is we have a thousand times the bandwidth we have now.  We're all doing virtual reality, 3D, teleconferencing, whatnot.  That's kind of the future he wants to get to.  So it's not so much about who's providing our Netflix shows right now.  It's about who's going to provide the massive quantities of bandwidth that we need in the future.  And he tried to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't understand his point.  Maybe you did, Matthew, where he would say, well, OK, it's one matter if you're talking about this today.  But if we have a hundred times the bits traversing, then that becomes very different.  You know, kind of who pays.  And isn't that the classic argument that no one's going to build this unless they get paid twice?  But the truth is the Internet has gotten faster and faster and rates have gone down and down.  And we're taking advantage of Moore's law here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's one good response is that people have invested and they have.  But we also have monopolies on those last miles.  And that's and now they're like like you suggested with Comcast.  They're basically harvesting the fruits of that of that monopoly.  So the question is how to get.  So his analogy was the trucking industry highways and so on.  Let's say, you know, Netflix is a is a company that's basically taking up 80 percent of the highways.  Should they at some point have to pay more because they're using up so much of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's actually worse against him, doesn't it?  Because because the highways are one, they're built by government and couldn't have been built by private industry.  They were built by government controlling and contracting the private industry to do it.  But but government was controlling control. A. B.  If Netflix was filling 80 percent of the highways, they would only be doing that if there was a consumer demand for what they were carrying.  And so the consumers would say, yeah, let's have more highways because there is a demand for it.  If you can't get your your whatever the goodies Netflix is carrying to you, that's an issue.  They're not just going to fill the highways. The second film, the highways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. And so Dan Gilmore pointed out the highway issue that you just mentioned, which is that if we had relied on private industry, we probably wouldn't have as many highways and they'd all be toll roads.  So so ultimately he didn't get at the central issue, which is how do you take what we have now and turn it into something more competitive?  And so that then new providers can be.  And one of the things that that a couple of people suggested, including me, was was making it easier for local towns, municipalities, regions, whatever, to to bring in competitive providers to do high frequency microwave, to do high frequency microwave.  To do whatever to pull in fiber or bring in Google to something that can blunt the force of those monopolies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There actually has been a movement. In fact, we've talked to a good friend of mine, Tim Poser, who is an activist in the Bay Area for community Internet.  And remember, we talked to was that we talked to that was a big community Internet supporter.  Those own well, all has community in his in his apartment.  It's a commercial thing, but it was the guy who one of the one of the guys who wrote Visi calc.  Oh, Brooklyn. It wasn't Brooklyn. It was the other one.  Can't remember his name, but this is his big thing now is, you know, it's completely doable technologically for a groups community groups towns to Bob Frankston.  Bob Frankston is big in this community Internet by wholesale Internet and wire their towns and eliminate this.  And, you know, that's the way to get competition.  The cable companies really only have a monopoly thanks to the friend, you know, the willingness of local communities to give them a franchise.  Exactly. The local communities don't have to participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And recent also mentioned freeing up unlicensed spectrum, which is something that hasn't been happening as quickly as I think most people would argue it should.  There's theoretically unlicensed spectrum out there that new providers could use to provide all kinds of competitive, which I absolutely agree with and which is critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'll go back to Susan Crawford once again, because she's brilliant.  And I've never wrong quoting her is that, yes, we want that.  And yes, we need that. But she says that does not substitute for fiber that that what we're going to do.  We're going to carry that 100 times more bits that in recent predicts it can happen over mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of the fiber that is that is out there is was built much like the United States Highway System by the U.S.  government or funded by the U.S. government.  And it's not all commercial by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you have to admit that a lot of the fiber that we're using that's super cheap was created by companies that went bust.  Yeah.  1999. Yeah. Yeah.  And thank God they did because they blew their brains out on all this fiber that we're now using super cheap.  Maybe we need another bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about Mark? And by the way, for the young people, we need another bubble.  Bubbles always build infrastructure.  It happened with the railroads.  It happened with the Internet.  Electricity. Yep.  And bubbles. So bubbles are good in that respect.  They're not wasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bring back the bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For those of you who are too young to know who the hell Mark Andreessen is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that hurts when you say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was a graduate student at the University at Urbana, the University of Illinois at the National Computer Supercomputer National Center for Supercomputing App applications, NCSA in Urbana, and wrote one of the very earliest Internet browsers Mosaic or co-wrote it.  And then, of course, Mosaic was brought commercial as Netscape made a lot of money when Netscape was one of the first big bubble IPOs.  And 95.  Yeah, 95. It was the one that started the bubble, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I started writing about technology stocks when Netscape went public and I created a Netdex, as we called it, of early Internet companies, none of which exist now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's awesome. And of course, now he is a venture capitalist and runs Andreessen Horowitz.  But it's still, I think, a very, you know, he's respected by everybody, not merely as a venture capitalist, but as a pioneer and a smart fellow.  He does have one idea, he tweets to you, Jeff Jarvis, one more practical idea, no discrimination on type or content of bits, just volume.  And isn't that what we're talking about here is not kinds of bits, but the volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eisenberg came back and said, no, that doesn't work because video is volume.  And so you can discriminate against video by just, yes, exactly.  All your little slow bits, show you little bits, no problem. But those big bits.  Right.  Gotcha.  Those are video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good for us tech people.  Right.  Gigg homes happy.  Ask him, man. Ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did like Stacey Higginbottom's suggestion that one thing we could do is get the FCC could do is to say to Comcast and others, you've got to be you've got to you've got to reveal the details of the deals you're making.  Right.  Right.  Transparency would help a lot here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sure would. Because what do we know about those deals? We know the tiny little details the guys like Dan or whatever can uncover.  What if there was a public auction market?  What if it was a all that information was publicly available?  You could see who was bidding for space and who was selling.  I mean, that in itself would make it more comprehensible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are we all these all pipe dreams, though?  Really? I mean, there's so much money now going on.  The FCC cannot be trusted to regulate this.  The government can certainly not be trusted to regulate this.  Any thought of making this more rational or better?  Is there any hope at all of doing that?  Very scared.  I hope so.  I really hope maybe I'm just old and cynical and jaded.  I just feel like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think we have to we have to sort of pick certain things like you can show at the FCC and say you need to beat up on Comcast.  But realistically, that's probably not going to happen.  But I think it's much more realistic to say open up some more spectrum.  That's an easy thing to do.  Make it easier for municipalities and regions to start or help fund competitive providers.  That's a relatively easy thing to do.  You know, that's a low hanging fruit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Neelai Patel says the solution is to treat the Internet as a utility.  Like water and electricity, that's kind of what Bob Frankston was saying.  Just as municipalities run water and electricity in most towns, they could run the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's you know, I wish Kevin Mark should be on here because he got into the argument with Andreessen and and push the British model, which is that, you know, BT is the mild of the home.  And then there is open access across that.  Right.  Which which seems to work pretty well and is not discriminatory.  But the issue then is BT going to invest sufficiently.  And I think will a Google Fiber come in then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Andreessen actually at the last sort of at the end of the discussion, he seemed to agree that that was not a bad model, that if you had a kind of utility provider that was either wholly subsidized or partially subsidized,  then you could have competing providers on top of that.  But the sort of bedrock, you know, the pipe would be something that was either public or publicly funded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's where we've gone to with electricity in the US and a lot of states.  Right. Right. So I can buy the wire into my house is, you know, whoever paid for it going in.  I don't know. But now I can buy electricity from various players.  I can choose to buy green electricity. Right. But it's all.  Yeah. Hydro. Yes, of course.  Oh, Canada. Hydroelectricity. Of course, I could do that, too.  Lots of water in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have tons of water. If you want any, we'd be happy to.  Oh, he does. He wants it. He needs it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, you know what else you got in Canada, Tim Bray?  True. Google will not let him work from Vancouver, so he quits.  Yeah, I found that really surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I would have expected that from Yahoo, but I guess it surprised me that Google wasn't willing to sort of accommodate that.  Who is Tim Bray?  Geez, who's Tim Bray? He's a legend. Tim Bray. He's a legend.  The Tim Bray. The Tim Bray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's quitting as of March 17th because he wouldn't move to California.  He's a software developer, co-founded Open Text Corporation.  He was one of the authors of the XML spec.  Yeah, he's kind of one of those. He's one of those guys.  And his blog is down, man.  Too many people are trying to read this story at tbray.org.  I keep trying to pull it up and I can't get it.  Anyway, yeah, that's kind of a shame.  But I also can understand, having been in the same position myself, how hard it is sometimes to have offsite employees.  It just depends what you need that employee to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did say he understood. He said that he didn't blame them for making that decision.  But it's interesting that his sort of love of Vancouver and his dislike of San Francisco just made it.  He just couldn't bring himself to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's smartwatch. We thought we might see some announcements at Mobile World Congress.  We did see new smartwatches from Samsung.  The gear, the new gear, the Neo, the new gear and the Gear Fit.  Some pretty, actually that Gear Fit looked pretty sweet.  Kind of a curved band and so forth. Super AMOLED scrolling touch display.  But no word of a Google watch, although the rumor is Wall Street Journal and others have said that LG will be making a Google Now kind of a watch for Google.  Apple, of course, working on a watch too.  Nothing to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wearables, oh, wearables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just, I feel like any minute now, it's just going to all take off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you going to get one, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I have a Pebble and was underwhelmed by its utility and its attractiveness, so I don't wear it.  But on the other hand, if somebody made a nice looking watch that did some of the things that the Pebble did, or I thought the Gear Fit looks pretty good.  What are you wearing, Jeff? Are those, is that Google Glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, this, I got, so these are the lenses. I'm just realizing the first time I put them on during the show and the, because it's curved, evidently that affects my prescriptions.  And so when I watch you, you're all fuzzy now.  And you have to look up like that.  Which just does not work either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they look good. I got to say that looks pretty good. You don't look quite so dorky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, dorko meter goes higher when you go over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely. Yeah, the big band on the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The funny thing was that I wore it in class this week and the students, you know, I thought I'd go, oh, it's cool, can I put it over there?  No, nobody cares.  I said all of them, you're acting like I have cooties. And they said, yeah, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I knew that would happen.  Did anybody take a swing at you?  You know, whenever I asked people for a year now, and I've said to people, oh, glasses, they said, oh, no, you walk down the street, everybody wants to see it and touch it.  Yeah, that wore off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now they just did any of your students take a swing at you like that lady at the bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, we have a story of San Francisco, the lady in a bar.  Did that really happen? It doesn't feel like it really happened.  I think I think it's oversimplified a bit in the news reports.  But I think I think it's just simply that she had she was showing it to a friend.  Somebody came over and you can imagine what this is and says, is that taking pictures of me?  You know, why would I?  And then they got into us and she said, you know, I'm creating video on now and I'm telling you it's on, you know, so you can tell it's on.  And then the woman got all pissed off with her hand up at it.  And then there was some kind of fight around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sarah's locum wrote in her on her Facebook.  Oh, M.G. So you'll never believe this.  But I got verbally and physically assaulted and robbed last night in the city, had things thrown at me because of some wanker Google Glass haters and then some bleep tore them off my face and ran out with them then.  And when I ran out after him, his bleep friends stole my purse, cell phone, wallet and everything.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a discussion we had last week in a sense is that this is this is a I think it's part of this larger San Francisco Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe a witness told the local news channel here the crowd was yelling, you're being an asshole.  Take those glasses off.  She did manage to videotape it with her glass and she says she's turned the footage over to the police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're next going to be going through the streets of San Francisco banging on and destroying all the looms.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this the video?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, how does she she must have gotten the glasses back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I think everything else was stolen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She thinks I think they took the glasses there the glass, but she got it back.  Oh, is that it?  OK.  I mean, my my sense is if you're going to be if you're going and I'm not saying anything about her behavior, but if you're going to wear glass and be kind of really obvious about it late at night in a dive bar when people have had a lot to drink, it's probably poor judgment.  I'm just going to say, well, not blaming the victim here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a punk bar.  Right.  Molotov's is a punk bar.  So I think you're kind of I mean, I don't do you know Molotov's Sarah is she goes there all the time.  Is it a punk bar?  Matt Honan says it's not.  Matt Honan says it's not a punk bar.  Sarah says Sarah knows every bar in the city.  What is what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it's a it's a non techie bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm techie.  There you go.  Where is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's a punk bar.  If it's in the lower hate, it's a dive.  Don't go in the lower hate and wear glass.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  You're telling me.  So that's all I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little judgment maybe.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, we're not if you look, if you were on Union Street and got beat up, then I'd say it was something there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just being so serious.  She's shaking her head.  It is interesting, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think this is going to be the last by any means.  There's a good this is going to happen more and more often the way I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it was anti-Google, right?  Because there's more footage in which a woman's well here, I think I this is some more video.  See, she keeps taping people as they're talking to her.  Can you get can you get my audio?  It's a long story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is channel four.  You may want to get accustomed to seeing people wearing that Google Glass item.  As a tech reporter, you are here to tell us tonight.  Not everybody is comfortable when somebody's wearing Google Glass in their presence.  OK, why is that?  Well, Gabe, what is that saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't believe this over and over again the whole night.  I just was the only thing that could come out of my mouth.  It was the weirdest event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sarah was out with her friends when they entered a bar in the Haight-Ashbury area in San Francisco.  It's kind of an art bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She captured through her Google Glass.  And we were there maybe about 15 minutes and two girls that were there.  They started showing a lot of animosity towards me because I was wearing Google Glass.  And at that point, I turned on the video.  Here it comes.  So I started recording.  So they're drunk.  I walked up to the bar just saying like, oh, Google Glass, like, you know, negative kind of comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, Sarah, this is when you leave.  You don't stay there and record it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wasn't even, you know, wasn't on.  I wasn't using it.  You know, I mean, they clearly didn't understand.  Well, wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She has a right to be there and not to be harassed.  I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Grew and got more vocal.  But if she says you're killing the city, but she says it with a smile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you see, that's the anti-Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to the LA Times, the altercation accelerated or after a friend who was with her took a swing at and or punched someone who was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like there's I do feel like there's more to this story.  Yeah, I agree.  And it's a little ginned up.  You know what I'm saying?  It's a little too much.  Let me tell you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on, glassholes.  Knock it off.  It's your fault.  I do have to say I feel a little bit like it's or you are you kicking me off the show?  No, no, I this is here is a good this is a good venue to you should wear your Google Glass here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're amongst friends that are going to be like this the whole show.  Yeah, these are progressive lenses.  Yeah.  And and mid-range is there.  Sounds like you got bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The lenses were wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the no the glasses.  These are curved.  So it all is different for me.  In fact, when I look at my tablet, it looks like a shape like this.  It's a problem.  It's another problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to courts, Google does not want to hire top college graduates.  Actually, it was an interview with the New York Times, Tom Friedman, Google's head of people operations, Laszlo Bach.  And I'm Laszlo Bach.  I'm head of people operations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As opposed to the other man, my colleague, who's the head of robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says Google has determined that your GPA is worthless as a criterion for hiring and test scores are worthless.  They don't predict anything.  The proportion of people without any college education at Google has increased, not decreased in time.  Chad and I are going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now as high as 14 percent.  He says good grades don't hurt because many jobs at Google require math, computing and coding skills.  But he says people who come out of top colleges are kind of kind of arrogant.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They lack.  But the funny thing was Google at first insisted you only came from one of the top colleges and only that you had perfect grades and only the highest test scores.  So this is just so opposite of where they were.  But this this notion of intellectual humility, I quite frankly agree with you.  I do like that.  If you're if you're intellectually hubristic, then you think that the greats know everything because you're so smart.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you think you know everything because they mentioned specifically the learning ability is one of the things that I look for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Says for every job, this is the quote.  The number one thing we look for is general cognitive ability.  That's not IQ.  It's learning ability, the ability to process on the fly, the ability to pull together disparate bits of information.  We assess that using structured behavioral interviews that we validate to make sure they're predictive.  That's what I get South Africa South.  Huh?  Press this button.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The second attribute after learning ability leadership in particular, emergent leadership as opposed to traditional leadership.  Traditional leadership is where you president of the chess club.  We don't care.  We don't care.  What we care about is when faced with a problem and you're a member of a team, do you at the appropriate time step in and lead?  And just as critically, do you step back and stop leading and let someone else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So your skull and bones membership is not going to cut it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I don't care.  They don't want me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want them.  So now we're going to see people trying to hide the fact that they would.  Yeah.  I know community college.  I did some local place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm telling you, I'm the best of all worlds.  I went to Yale and I dropped out.  So there I knew when to step back.  Got in and then you said, is that all there is?  I was president of the chess club and then I quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there.  The interesting thing, though, is that Google, they do do, you know, we can make fun of them for it, but they do do a huge amount of sort of  data analysis, even on stuff like this, like what people eat in the cafeteria, when they come in and when they leave, when the parking lot is empty and when it doesn't.  So I'm sure they've looked exhaustively at the performance of new hires and figured this out.  It's it's refreshing in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He also says that people who are the most successful successful here have a fierce position.  They'll argue like hell.  There be zealots about their point of view.  But then you say here's a new fact and they'll go, oh, well, that changes things.  You're right.  He says you need a big ego and a small ego in the same person at the same time.  These are, by the way, I would say these are 100 percent right.  This is if I if I could say what I was looking for when we hire here, it would be exactly this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't remember if it was Keens or somebody asked a famous economist like that why he had flip flopped on an issue.  And he said, when I'm presented with evidence that contradicts my what my views, I changed my mind.  What do you do? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It always drives me crazy that we accuse politicians of being flip floppers when in fact,  don't you want somebody who will listen to information and then adjust his opinion based on that information?  No, I don't want to hear anymore.  Made up my mind. I know.  I know what's true.  In fact, maybe we should use this to elect politicians from now on.  None of them would get a job.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt for president.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Talent could come in so many different forms and be built in so many non-traditional ways today.  Hiring officers have to be alive to everyone beside brand name colleges.  Because when you look at people who don't go to school and make their way in their world, those are exceptional human beings.  And we should do everything we can to find those people.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is part of the debate these days.  Should you even go to college?  Should you incur the debt?  And I'm saying this with a college professor in the room.  Should you even incur the debt of a college when, you know, when in fact many people say,  including my good friend Don Tapscott, all college does is prepare you to, you know, is groom you to be part of that class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don, who's also at our university.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he's a professor too, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got tenure, man.  I can say whatever I want now.  We absolutely, absolutely need to be disrupted like media and retail and other industries.  We deserve it.  We deserve it.  We are.  We are.  You know, one of the things I learned in universities is we do a lot of talk here about outcomes, but we ascribe the outcomes to what we already want to teach.  I tried to start a research project where we went in and did ethnographic research in newsrooms and startups to find these skills that are really in the marketplace and then back into what we should teach.  But I couldn't get anybody to fund it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're actually good because you are you didn't come from academia.  Oh, no, I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a bachelor's degree and I'm teaching master's.  Yeah, perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're the kind of professor they need because you come from the real world.  So that's fine.  I don't have a problem with that.  It's the people who, you know, come up through the system.  They get all the degrees and they never leave the school.  They make their entire lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's less the people that also the reward structures that get built around that.  Right.  The cementing that occurs.  Now, there's a reason for tenure.  I was in a discussion of a bunch of people who had chairs.  I don't have a chair.  I'm sitting on a ball.  I barely have lights.  You know, I'm looking here.  They turn them off like an Iraq.  Anyway, anyway, folks, anybody here?  So where was I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will always be a good audience.  If you want to do share, just go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so the chairs.  So there was talk about a foundation from saying, you know, let's get rid of this idea of tenure.  A couple of people in the room said, you know, well, I wouldn't be able to do what I've done because I would have gotten fired long ago.  And the truth is that when I came here to CUNY, the story of my dean has told my former dean has told in his memoirs, Sarah Bartlett's predecessor, that I quit on the first day on the job.  I was the first professor hired that was announced in the New York Times.  I started here.  I have a faculty meeting that day about the curriculum.  And I go in and I try to say the professors all need to be trained in new technology and I get shot down and screamed at.  And I say, oh, my God, I've made a terrible mistake.  I let it fester for a week.  I send the dean an email saying we both made a terrible mistake.  I quit my job.  I don't know what I'm going to do, but I don't want to be the thorn in everybody's side.  And he came back.  He said, what are you saying?  You idiot.  I hired you.  That's a committee from the rest of the university.  We're going to hire faculty who are going to do this.  Are you crazy?  And he was right.  And I stayed.  But I said at the end of that, you know, I was thinking that tenure was a horrible thing.  Maybe we should talk about that because I saw what it was like to be, you know, to be controversial, to try to take a stand that the rest of faculty didn't like.  And what could happen to you as a result?  And so for academic freedom, there is a rationale behind tenure.  But as an entitlement and the other issue we face, and this is this could be said of me, too, in a field that changes so rapidly.  Should I stay here forever?  No, not unless I stay up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was interesting that Nick Kristoff, I know we're going off on a tangent here, but he talks.  That's what we do in the show, Matthew.  He wrote a whole thing about, you know, how it'd be nice if more people in academia took part in discussions about their field outside of, you know, journals that only five people read.  And he got a lot of pushback from from academics about it.  But I think his point was a good one that a lot of there's a lot of potential knowledge and sort of useful debate and points of view that are locked up inside universities and inside journals.  And it'd be nice if more of that was available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was also a piece in, I think, Foreign Affairs, somebody saying none of the smartest people I know is on Twitter or Facebook and all only basically only dumb people are there.  It wasn't for the like foreign affairs.  Wow.  That that that, you know, but that was the old horrible snotty attitude.  If I don't want to talk to the public, you know, all the argument was all the biggest ideas, all the best ideas.  No, you don't know those.  You're not good enough to know those.  Well, that's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't have Gina to do a change log here, but I'll give you.  There is a new Google Plus coming.  Look for it sometime in the next day.  If you have four point two, four point three will come out.  Lots of new stuff, non destructive photo editing across all your devices.  So you can start an edit on one device and continue or start over on another.  You can back up full resolution photos from your desktop, edit them on your phone, then finish on your tablet.  I like that.  New filters, new creative tools, crop, rotate, one touch filters, snap seed inspired enhancements, a single view of all your photos.  The all view.  I don't have it yet, so I can't show you this.  The new all view displays your entire photo library, whether it's on your current device or backed up in the cloud.  If your library is really large, the app won't show all your photos initially.  But if it's more than ten thousand photos, but larger libraries over the next few weeks and an easy way to browse photos by date.  Swipe through your photos and all view.  Look for the scroll bar on the right.  Drag the scroll bar up or down will view you backwards or forwards in time.  So look for an update to I think there was an update to the Google launcher, too, if you're on a Nexus or Google Play device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't see what they're pushing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're pushing their auto backup software to write.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that's there's your change log.  But bump bump bump bump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, one story that's on there that I think there's a lot of discussion going on online that a federal court just forced Google YouTube to take down the horrible, ridiculous anti-Muslim video because over a copyright claim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so here's something that has major, if awful, news value, ridiculous news value, what it spurred and inspired.  But now copyright is taking it down from public view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a weird really.  It was a really weird ruling because the judges decided as far as I can tell that because the creator of the movie had altered the work that this actress was involved with had changed things, had added things, had changed the whole nature of the of the work that effectively copyright reverted to her from the creator.  And so then if she didn't want it, it's even weirder.  Yeah, it's very strange.  And the dissenting judge, you could tell, thought the whole thing was just ridiculous, at least from the parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said, if I could retain copyright for everything that an editor butchered.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd have I'd own a lot of worthless stuff, but I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a two to one decision.  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the dissenting judge.  The dissenting judge.  Actually, the chief judge who voted to pull down the video said, this is a troubling case.  Actress Cindy Lee Garcia was duped into providing an artistic performance that was used in a way she could never foreseen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Artistic is a stretch for anything that was in that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But she did say from the very first, this is not what I thought I was acting in.  Not what she would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a fraud case.  That's a different case.  That's not a copyright case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So basically, the judge said it was not a work for hire.  Right.  Because that changes the rules.  Right.  So because it was not a work for hire, she only gave an implied license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And therefore, since they she had been cast in a different film, Desert Warrior, but that film was never made.  But this but the footage was then reused.  Well, it was known with her voice dubbed over with an anti-Muslim.  And it was a sham from the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There never was a Desert Warrior movie.  But nobody was going to make the horrible anti-Muslim thing that they made.  So they they just got people to shoot stuff so they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fraud. Yeah, that's fraud.  And our Jeff.  Google, by the way, says that they strongly disagree with the ruling and will appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Jeff Roberts pointed out in our post, the dissenting judge said that it was a strained interpretation of copyright.  No kidding.  And added that the court had never made a similar ruling in any other case and said that it could constitute prior restraint of speech and that public interest would side with Google keeping it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Julie Arends at Stanford said the idea that a copyright is a tool that's going to be used to censor speech we don't like.  That's very dangerous.  Yeah, it's pretty frightening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing is it's going to bring attention back to this piece of junk, stupid thing that was by one schmucky idiot.  Oh, yeah.  And God help us, it could be more violent.  Striking the effect.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt's given a million bucks to solve problems through technology.  Seems like a small, a paltry amount for a man with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh, look, the gift horse in the mouth, will you?  Well, I think we argue that technology scales.  And so a million dollar technology is better than, you know, a billion dollars to anything else.  I'll grant you that.  I wrote a post on Medium today arguing that this is part of the out of my trip to the valley that I get in trouble with people for this like crazy because I'm saying that I would rather see philanthropists put money into scalability and journalism rather than just supporting more stories.  And that and the scalability, innovation, investment in infrastructure and platforms and things like that is where I want to see the money go.  And so all the nonprofit news things are coming after me and whining at me today right now on Twitter.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think your point guy, your point is a good one.  If you just give millionaires and billionaires just give money to nonprofits, there's we're not going to see any new either technological innovation or sort of new platforms or new because who's going to fund them?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so there's a competition for capital that occurs and the capital I think should go to innovation and scalability.  But that's boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should I should correct myself.  The Google Now launcher, which was previously available only on Google Play Edition and Nexus devices now can be downloaded from the store for any device.  So that actually is a big deal.  They released the launcher that this is the beginning of what some have worried about that Google would slowly release all the Google services.  All the Google service applications to the store.  And even if you didn't, you know, you could basically replace your, you know, crappy Samsung launcher and your crappy Samsung apps with all the Google apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is that worrisome?  Doesn't worry me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seems like seems like an improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The S5 and I think in the rundown about how half the memory is gone with all the all the Samsung.  So this was a complaint I had with the Galaxy S4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the reasons I didn't use it.  I bought a 16 gig Galaxy S4 and I only had nine gig free because of the cruft uninstallable crufts that Samsung put on it.  It's even worse.  It turns out on the S5, although Samsung didn't show off any of that cruft.  It's eight gigs free.  So there's even more stuff on the Galaxy S5 that you can't remove that messes things up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's to help you, Leo.  It's not crap.  So I want to make your life easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the note so much.  I love that big screen, but I can't use it because I don't want to use Samsung's S voice.  I want to use Google voice.  I don't want to use Samsung's this and that.  I don't want golf mode in my camera.  So we have been talking about WhatsApp since it happened because it's just so stunning that number.  Nineteen billion dollars.  And we had heard a rumor that Google had offered 10 billion.  Now word comes from Sundar Pichai.  No, that's simply untrue.  He said WhatsApp is an exciting product, but we never made an offer to acquire them.  Press reports to the contrary are simply untrue.  That's 10 billion would be a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although there are other reports that they would have paid more than Facebook paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm kind of glad to be honest.  Like I it sort of made me nervous when they said when those reports first came out saying they had bid 10 billion and were prepared to match it and all that.  I thought that's a crazy amount of money.  Like I know Google has lots of money, but it's a crazy amount of money.  It's crazy for Facebook.  But at least whatever Mark Zuckerberg has talked himself into believing that it's worth that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he went to mobile world and said it was cheap.  It was worth more.  You got to say that.  I got a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't care how expensive my $9,000 OLED TV was worth.  It was worth twice, but twice the amount.  I would have paid 20,000 for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you know, Facebook stock has already gone up enough to account for a third of that price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So and that's the important point that people ignore the 12 billion of it was stock inflated already inflated stock.  And and all it really mostly what Facebook paid was dilution.  They they diluted their stock value is mostly what they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know, Ohm pointed out when that deal came out that Cisco did very much the same thing in the last sort of movie where they used their stock, which was incredibly highly valued.  And they bought I remember them buying a company.  I can't even remember the name of it.  There were like two guys and a scribbled network diagram on a napkin and they paid two and a half or three billion because why not?  You know, it's almost free money.  Yeah.  Right. And it got something into their HQ and out of everybody else's hands.  Couple billion in stock.  You know, three days later, it was they probably paid for it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's app will be adding voice calls.  And that's going to be, you know, I think if you think about what it is, it's mostly they're they're paying 42 bucks for purchase.  For per user for 450 million users, Facebook itself is worth more than twice that.  And and, you know, and Instagram, they paid 45 bucks per user.  So it's really right in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think they were I don't know about now, but Mark Zuckerberg said they were they were adding a million users a day.  Right.  In some countries where they've never even heard of Facebook or where Facebook is not.  That's what I'll be at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Skiff said that every one of his relatives in India is on WhatsApp.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. Yep.  And it was interesting to watch when you talked about it, even on Twitter.  And I talked to people in real life as well.  And people who didn't either know someone or or were related to someone in another country had never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's why I used it, because I was talking to somebody in another country is exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you knew someone or a relative or even someone who you knew who was from a different country, they use it all the time.  Literally all the time.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have an alternative to WhatsApp that people who are a little nervous about it now that it's owned by Facebook might be interested in.  That's actually great.  I'm not going to tell you yet, because it's going to be my tool of the week.  So stay tuned for that.  A couple more stories and we will get to our tip and tool and number of the week.  I liked I thought this was a very good column.  I wanted to just point to it from coding horror dot com.  Apocalypse Now.  Hey, the the author shows and for some reason the image is not coming in on my browser right now, but he shows the thing you see every time when you visit on the browser a website for a publication.  Install our free app.  Gosh, I wish this were here's an XKC.  So right. It's not just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We killed the pop up.  Right. Remember when pop ups were a new window, we killed that dead, dead, dead.  And now site after site after site.  I've got it.  You know, I don't know what it works.  I got to go in and kill these goddamn little.  Oh, it's so annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the XKC cartoon.  Want to visit an incomplete version of our website where you can't zoom?  Download our app and then you have two choices.  OK, or no, but ask me again every time.  So true. It's so yeah, this was this was a I thought a very good article and he really says, you know, yes, there are a million plus apps on the Android Store.  But how many of them are any good?  Most of them, he says, 99 percent of them are awful junk.  Nobody would ever want.  And what he points out is, yes, apps are cheap.  But what you the real cost is your time.  He says, and I identified with this.  How many times do you install an app and hover your finger over the uninstall button?  Because you just know something's going to happen.  You're going to say, no, get rid of that app now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a great piece.  You know, the point I think he makes that's really that really hit me was this sort of vision of our at least near term future where and messaging is a great example where you've got multiple sort of siloed, inaccessible, proprietary platform based horrible, you know, things that don't interoperate.  You can't share things between them.  It's it's it's terrible.  And that's the way lots of the Internet was before we kind of got standards and before people decided to remember early chat with aim and MSN and so on.  It was it was terrible because you couldn't talk to someone unless they were.  It's like not being able to make a phone call to someone unless they have a specific phone.  You know, it's it's ridiculous.  And we shouldn't stand for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  More silos when we had this great thing called the World Wide Web, the open, easily transportable web.  It worked so great.  I blame you, Steve Jobs.  And by the way, credit to Jeff Atwood, who is a co-founder of Stack Exchange and is a really great guy.  And this is a great blog post.  And I just wish the images were coming in.  I don't know why they're not.  I don't have them either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, what did you do?  You messed up your code.  Blog dot coding horror dot com.  The place to go.  Yeah, I just want to say, you know, I agree.  Been there, done that.  And let's bring back the Web.  Such a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't see anything else, unless any of you have something you want to see.  Talk about in the rundown.  We have a first look from GigaOM dot com at the Toshiba 13-inch Chromebook video.  I'm not sure.  Is this from Mobile World Congress?  Kevin Toffle, who, by the way, is so great.  Good acquisition.  He's really good.  Yeah.  He is great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin got a...  I think it was Kevin got...  No.  Somebody got a...  Here's the machine I'm waiting for.  The affordable pixel is going to be the Acer 720p, which has a touch screen.  Okay.  And it's going to have four gigs, not two gigs.  That's hard to get.  And it's going to have LT.  I figure that adds up to about $500.  Yeah, I wish they'd make a mid-range...  That's a workable machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a workable machine.  There's just the...  We mentioned this before.  There's two choices.  You've got this crazy expensive pixel or the ridiculously cheap $200, $300 netbooks, basically.  Put two something in the mid-range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a version with four gigs.  And I put an order in for...  I'm not sure why since I have a pixel.  But anyway, I put an order in for an Amazon and Amazon killed my order.  And other people in the chat room said before the show that that happened to them too.  And so I guess it got pulled as a product.  But four gigs and LTE and touchscreen, and you've got a mid-range pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And nine hours of battery life because a pixel's battery life is not so high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Right, because now you have Haswell.  Yeah.  And I think Google should make that actually to show what's doable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Come back if you wish, Matthew, to provide us with anything you like, a software you like  and something you want to tell people about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matthew Ingram had a good time at the Boston Park Plaza.  Oh, now how do we know that?  Because we know that from Twitter and the hotel had a nice little conversation with  them on Twitter.  Very smart hotel, eh Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never talked to a hotel before.  Yeah, it was kind of cool.  I thought that was interesting.  Yeah, they said, did you enjoy your stay?  It took them a while because I think that was February 7th.  Oh, so wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you went to the hotel, you stayed there.  Did they ask for your Twitter handle when you checked in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I...  What if you had been there for an assignation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I checked in on Foursquare.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they knew to go to your Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I shared it on Twitter.  Aha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's Matthew I on Twitter.  And what did they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just thanks for coming to stay with us.  Did you enjoy the conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Matthew being the nice Canadian said, sure did.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I love Matthew's Twitter feed.  I'm just reading your tweets now.  Fred Wilson on Bitcoin.  I always feel good buying when there's blood in the streets in any market.  That was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  God, Fred.  Reddit's adding a new real-time reporting feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that was an interesting one.  I got a lot of feedback, mostly negative, on that.  They've got a new feature that basically allows you to live blog a breaking news event.  Oh, that's neat.  And you basically become the editor of that live blog,  and then you can allow other people or bring in contributions from elsewhere into that live blog.  So obviously, everyone brought up the Boston bombing and how they identified the wrong gun.  But, you know, so did CNN.  So I still think more people doing those things is better.  I keep going back to what Jay Rosen has said, you know, journalism gets better when more people do it.  And so, yeah, I'm sure there's going to be screw ups.  I'm sure there's going to be mistakes.  But we have those every day in the regular media.  So why shouldn't Reddit be part of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I, you know, you use as an example the Ukrainian conflict Reddit live updates.  This is a perfect place to do it.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they have a great they actually have a great Syrian Civil War subreddit that's run by a guy.  I think he's a law student and he runs two or three other subreddits, one about Venezuela.  And they're excellent.  Like the Syrian Civil War one is really good.  I would I would say it's one of the best resources about the Syrian Civil War in any media form, you know, traditional professional amateur, whatever, next to Brown Moses and his blog and places like that.  It's quite well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wikipedia has done that for a little bit for a while.  I mean, this is a similar model.  I think crowdsourcing news is not a bad thing at all.  As long as you understand the potential pitfalls.  Right. Right.  But you know, a human mob can form anywhere, anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure. And I think that lots of people said, well, they're going to make lots of mistakes.  And and how could that possibly be better?  But if you look at what happens on Twitter, lots of those mistakes are corrected and hoaxes are are are corrected a lot faster than they are in traditional media.  So you've got you've got benefits and disadvantages.  Yes, there are more errors, but they happen faster and can be corrected faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I completely agree.  And I think when it works, it works so well that it just justifies any, you know, potential issues that come up.  So there's a tip.  Follow Matthew on Twitter.  M-A-T-H-E-W-I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One T. As I learned the hard way, Matthew, you slap people like nuns with rulers to teach them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's one T. Is that how you spell it for real, though, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's only one T.  Is there a story behind that, Matt, too?  No, not a comprehensible one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, my mother, I asked her, you know, when I was old enough to figure out that it was weird why she chose one.  And all she could come up with was that she didn't want me to be called Matt.  She hated the name Matt.  Well, now, if you called Matt, it's it's really confusing.  Right. And I said, you know, you can't say the name Matthews, but it only has one T.  So anyone who only hears it is obviously going to call me Matt.  So that didn't really work.  She actually used to people would call our house and say, is Matt there?  And she would say, no one by that name lives here.  Oh, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's awesome.  That was fun.  Well, I've known you for I don't know how long years and I didn't know the first time I noticed there was one T.  Oh, really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I felt sorry for the guy who was at Matthew I with two T's.  Yeah, I think he's actually left Twitter because it's got too much.  People are replying him instead of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, anything else you want to plug before we wrap up here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't remember if I mentioned this before, but I've got I use the photo Google photo backup thing reminded me of it.  I use a service called Trove Box.  It was originally called Open Photo and I do all I back up every photo from my devices to that service.  And one of the interesting things about them is they integrate with Amazon's S3.  So if you have an account there, which I do, it automatically dumps all that stuff into S3 repositories.  You don't have to worry about it.  So you're not relying on them for storage.  They basically just handle the uploading and handle all the other stuff.  And then you can go to your Trove Box site and see all the photos and turn them into albums or share them or whatever.  It's quite simple, but it really it works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You prefer that nowadays Facebook, Google, Microsoft, everybody wants to give you free backup space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I do do that.  I actually back them up to Dropbox and to Google and in some cases to Facebook as well.  But I like to have one that isn't kind of isn't associated with a specific platform that is just me and Amazon kind of deal.  And that's where my stuff is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in case something happens for whatever reason, for the longest time I was using back up a fire and they've kind of slowly dwindled in terms of things that they do.  Yeah, I use them too.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm looking for something else.  Trove Box.  I'll have to check it out.  T-R-O-V-E-B-O-X dot com.  Thank you, Matthew.  A number of Mr. Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my friend Chuck Martin, an expert in mobile, put up an interesting post on LinkedIn today with data from Monatate that says that  in the last quarter in the Christmas quarter, average order size from Android exceeded average order size from iPhones and e-commerce.  One thirty six dollars versus one twenty six dollars, reversing a previous trend, which I just found interesting because I hear complaints about.  Well, yeah, there's a lot more Android than iPhone, but I make more money from iPhone.  I hear people say make apps and such.  So I found that interesting.  It was at two billion dollars in sales.  Cyber Monday was the biggest gross, the highest gross in online shopping day in history.  Wow.  One out of three visits to leading e-commerce websites now comes from a smartphone or tablet.  I believe tablet average size as opposed to the one twenty six one thirty six for the phones.  The tablet average size order is one hundred fifty three dollars.  So it's more than anybody.  Yeah.  Wow.  So that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tablet users are affluent, lazy people.  Yes.  And they order more online.  Yes.  Actually, that's my numbers.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.  We talked yesterday about secure messaging platforms on security now and spent some time talking about Telegram.  Telegram is a Russian secure messaging platform for Android and others that is funded by Pavel Dorova, who is, according to Mark Milley, in the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia and claimed a million new users when WhatsApp was sold.  A lot of people fleeing WhatsApp, apparently, because they don't trust Facebook.  I don't know why.  Telegram makes a big deal about being a secure encrypted service.  But Steve's analysis and many others, as it turns out, is that this is far from secure.  It is just bizarre and he doesn't recommend it.  But he did mention and this all came up because of one of the critics of Telegram is a well-known cryptographer security expert named Moxie Marlin Spike.  He has the most Dickensian name.  What a wonderful name.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's his real name, but it is.  It's a great handle.  And Moxie has a open source implementation of security and his company, Open Whisper Systems, offers a free secure messenger, which Steve says is very good.  I install it.  In fact, I found it not only it's free, it's easy to use.  It offers all the features of WhatsApp group messaging, audio, video, text, pictures.  But it but it's very easy to use.  And in fact, I liked it so much I replaced my standard SMS app.  And you could do this on Android, which is really great and made text secure my default.  So texting looks like regular texting on text secure unless you exchange a key with somebody and then all of your conversations are protected by strong encryption stored on the phone encrypted, never spends any time on their systems servers.  I mean, it's true strong encryption.  And I have to say I've started using it now as my SMS.  It's really great.  And it's you know what?  It does everything WhatsApp does.  And the same company Open Whisper does a phone service called Red Phone that is a secure voice communications.  So if for some reason you're fleeing WhatsApp, this is a great a great alternate choice that is in fact secure.  Is it just for Android?  Yeah.  Right now, just for Android.  They say they're doing an iOS version of it.  And the nice thing about it is that the encryption technology is open and freely available.  You can federate with them so others could write apps that work with text secure using federation, which I even like better.  It means you're not stuck with just one implementation of it.  And Moxie is really one of the good people.  So this is a great choice.  Text secure.  Highly recommended.  My friends, we've come to the end of another This Week in Google.  I'm so glad you could be here, Matthew Ingram.  Thank you.  Yes, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really appreciate it.  And anything you want to plug?  Just everybody should read GigaOM.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we do have some of our newer writers.  Sina Brewster, for example, writes a lot about 3D printing and sort of really cutting edge stuff.  I find it fascinating.  I always learn something from her.  She writes about drones and stuff like that.  It's just incredibly fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have a lot of people from O'GigaOM on this show because it's some of the best tech journalists out there.  Really great.  And I don't know Sina, but I will look her up.  Or him.
