He's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  He's got his 360 and his Mevo and he's videoing us right now.  He's turned the tables on us.  You used the Mevo for .NYC last week. It was really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I used it again today.  And yeah, it's great. It's great.  It's really amazing to work with.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I turned off the auto features though and just do it by hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the case.  Oh, no, the auto is a neat concept, but no, you want to do it by hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you were all alone, then because auto follows your face and follows your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even then, so Leo, I was thinking about this.  I don't want to delay Stacey's intro, but I was thinking about this.  When you were in the cottage, you switched yourself, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still do when I'm in my studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Of course in your office. Yes.  So I wonder what it would be like to use the Mevo as people look at this.  Oh, I have to have a producer.  I think, well, no, Leo does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, in fact, I did it on Windows Weekly when I first unboxed the Mevo.  I had my iPad.  iPad is perfect for this, by the way, better than an iPhone because you get a big screen.  And yeah, I was switching while I was talking. Easy peasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what? Even on the iPhone, the guy who came over and did our first demo of the Mevo from Livestream at CUNY,  huge as iPhone. It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I delay the important moment of the show.  The most important moment. Stacey Higginbotham is with us.  Stacey on iot.com.  She's giga Stacey on the Twitter and Jeff and I obviously, as old men, have a crush on you, Stacey.  Smitten. We're smitten. Our network is smitten.  We adore everybody adores Stacey Higginbotham.  Hello, Stacey. Hello.  We don't get out much. It's going to feel bad for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, wow, really exciting people out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, you're great.  No, we're such a good addition to the show.  Everybody. We love you because the network loves you.  Everyone. Everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody loves it. The comments that I may you see them too on Twitter, but I get them every week.  So happy Stacey's there.  I've never listened to you as much Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I love John Oliver's.  Yeah, I think owed to local journalism, although there were some who did not think this was an ode to local journalism.  This was on his this week tonight.  He talks about the fact that he his show our show.  Most of the 24 hour news networks depend on small local newspapers for the reportage.  And there was one point where somebody is talking speaking to on a panel and says the day that we see a Huffington Post reporter in City Hall covering the City Council meeting is the day journalism will have survived.  But of course, you'll never even Ariana was that she was on the panel.  Laughing will play a little bit of it because it's kind of a nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the funny thing.  I was at Aspen Institute had a wither journalism thing when I was out on this weekend.  And so we get there Sunday night.  We have dinner and we drink and then we all go off to our rooms.  And then the next morning we all woke up.  And if you didn't see the night before I saw it on my feet immediately.  You have to watch Oliver.  You have to watch Oliver.  So he he rakes over the Coles the company we've talked about here trunk formerly Tribune publishing.  The owner of trunk was at the event.  Oh boy.  Michael Michael Farrell was a very nice guy.  He took it with with with great grace and it was a good guy.  However, the newspaper Association of America has no sense of humor whatsoever.  Well that guy didn't understand it was a Valentine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's not and by the way, he didn't come from journalism.  He didn't come.  Farrell.  Yeah.  Oh, you mean the NA guy or the guy from the Association of whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, oh, well, oh, it's newspaper Association of America.  And efforts to take the paper out have failed.  Yeah.  Anyway, there are the old farts of old farts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but also the guy who runs it is not a newspaper.  No, he's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, so I knew his predecessor who I think is probably happy to be out.  Yeah, he didn't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't know how much of this.  I want to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's 20 minutes.  The Oliver videos 20 minutes, but it's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very both of you were in the in the news and reporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The heroes that we root for in movies like all the president's men, the great Muppet caper and most recently spotlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got to nail these scumbags.  We got to show people that nobody could get away with this.  Not a priest or a Cardinal or a freaking Pope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now remember spotlight actually won best picture at the Oscars this year,  meaning newspapers finally received the recognition that we normally reserve for subjects of such importance as the incredible bravery of real life Hollywood filmmakers,  the incredible bravery of fictional Hollywood filmmakers and the incredible bravery of wanting to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me jump to the end because he then does a parody of spotlight.  And it might go all the way to the top all the way to the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They knew and I think we could prove that they knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is at the editorial meeting.  Yeah, I'm just not sure what kind of clicks we're going to get on that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anybody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a thing about a cat that looks like a raccoon.  Or it could be a raccoon that looks like a cat.  Wait, I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we're talking.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's great.  So the one reporter left wants to cover corruption in City Hall, but the raccoon cat ends up winning.  It's kind of true.  It's crushing actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's someone who sat in newsrooms and the meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he also plays and I have to be a little careful on this.  This is a clip.  Well, I'll let him set it up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sentinel and the Chicago Tribune.  This is his...  After acquiring the company, he spoke to the Sentinel's nervous staff outlining his vision and listened to one particular exchange with a journalist.  This is the prior owner of Samsung.  His last two words are perhaps the most illuminating.  Before Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My attitude on journalism is very simple.  My attitude on journalism is very simple.  I want to make enough money so I can afford you.  Which is reasonable.  I'm sure Jeff Bezos says that.  It's really that simple, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You need to, in effect, help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need to help me.  By being a journalist.  By focusing on what our readers want.  Now this is the challenge.  By being a journalist that focuses on what our readers want and therefore generates more revenue.  A very brave young woman in the audience.  We also need to inform the community.  Asks what if readers want to know about puppy dogs.  We also need to inform the community.  He says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I can't...  You're giving me the classic, what I would call, journalistic arrogance.  Of deciding that puppies don't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He then proceeds to cuss her out.  So...  And says, eventually we hope that we get to the point where our revenue is so significant we could cover Iraq and...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Puppies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Puppies.  They're both right and they're both wrong.  I mean...  To say that we...  But you've got to survive as a business.  You've got to, right?  A. And B. To say...  All the readers want is puppies.  Then why bother doing journalism for them at all?  That's a gross insult to the public we serve.  It's not true.  And it is arrogant to say that.  Yeah.  I don't want to defend Sam Zell who ruined the company but...  No person...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no.  I was just...  I'm going to disagree with you a little bit in the sense that people...  People value journalism, but they don't want to pay for it.  And there's...  In the models associated with journalism today...  Make it really hard to find people who are willing to pay for or sponsor your content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But nobody ever really paid for journalism.  The journalism was paid for by the banner...  By the giant full page display ads that the journalism was meant to separate in newspapers.  And by the classifieds ads in the back of it.  That's what paid for it.  Even those of us who subscribe to the newspaper didn't pay for the newspaper in any appreciable way, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Subscriptions, well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's Jeff holding up his book Geeks Burying Gifts Reimagining in Future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In which I address that, Stacey.  And what I argue is that the problem is we fancy ourselves entertainers.  We think we're making unique products like Game of Thrones.  We're not.  We're in the information business.  And information, once it's known, is quickly commodified.  And a free society wants it that way.  And you can't own information.  You can't control information.  And so we are trying to keep an old business model that just simply doesn't work anymore.  And this myth that people paid for our stuff.  A, Leo's right.  It was always subsidized.  And B, they paid because there was a monopoly involved.  And once you're in this world saying people should pay for what we do, well why if there's a free copy?  It gives me the same value two clicks away.  No.  So we've got to find other structures of value.  And I work with newspaper companies trying to do that.  But...  And there are some things people will pay for if they're really specialized.  If they're unique.  If they're really high value.  But generalized information.  There's a guy climbing on the Trump Tower.  I don't need to pay for that.  I can find a hundred places telling me that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interestingly though, the Olympics are going on right now.  I just saw a report that said people were more interested in the presidential election than in the Olympics.  There was a lot more interest in the presidential election than there was in the Olympics.  People do.  I think people are interested in news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the dope and the doped.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's...  I wonder how many people are less interested in the Olympics because they can't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well they're doing a terrible job aren't they?  But they always do.  I don't know why people are so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just curious.  Have either of you watched much of the Olympics yet?  I have a lot.  I haven't seen any of the Olympics.  I'm with you Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't seen a minute.  I've watched hours.  Oh you don't have cable?  You can't.  Right.  Actually you can.  There's ways you can get the MBs.  Oh no you can't.  It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I can...  There are ways.  I could legally actually...  Well okay.  I could quasi-legally get the Olympics.  But it's just not worth it to me.  It's a lot of work.  I mean it's a lot of...  If you have cable...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First of all the first thing you realize is how much cable real estate Comcast actually owns.  Because there's NBC, there's NBC Sports Network, there's USA, there's Bravo, there's MSNBC.  They have half of my cable is Olympics right now.  So which really kind of brings home the fact that Comcast kind of is...  Kind of really shouldn't be intermingling with NBC.  But that's too late now.  I think the Olympics are...  Well here's what happened to me.  I was watching and I was thinking about it.  We always complain.  But if I were a network executive here's what I would say.  The Olympics have no value minus the value we add.  It's just some people seeing who can swim the fastest.  You could go down to the local rec center and see that.  In and of itself it isn't interesting.  We add, I'm speaking for NBC, a huge amount of drama and interest to it.  That's what we're doing here.  And we're crafting it with editing and time delay and pauses and we'll be back.  And all of the preview stuff that lets everybody know that Simone Biles is the best gymnast in the world.  I did not know that.  In fact I think I'm saying her name wrong.  I did not know that if NBC hadn't told me that.  They make all the value of the Olympics.  They're actually creating the value.  The athletes are but there's the Paralympics right after that.  I don't see a lot of people squammed in on that.  Would you make the same argument about football?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  You can go down to the high school and take a ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you're complaining about, oh well the way NBC's doing it, you're missing the point.  It's all about the way NBC's doing it.  That's what's paying for this.  That's what's making this happen.  That's what it's all about.  It's like, you know, saying I just wish they wouldn't cook my steak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it.  There's a lot of people who hate the packaging.  Oh, it's highly packaged.  But as I said, minus the packaging it's not that interesting.  I would beg to differ.  I think there probably wouldn't be as wide of an audience, but it's a huge social phenomenon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So people would watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, that's the thing.  I know journalists who were down there at the time and they're tweeting and I'm saying what's going on?  And of course I remember it's time delayed.  So it takes away the social phenomenon by syncopating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I know.  And by being all cranky about using the hashtags and everything else that NBC is proposing.  Well, the IOC is a horrifically corrupt tool.  The IOC is horrifically corrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As bad as FIFA probably when we get down to it.  But the reason they're corrupt is because there's a lot of money flowing from NBC and the other networks all around the world.  It's manufactured as much as a movie is manufactured.  And it would be like saying, well, I really hate the way that the born identity is being delivered to us.  They really...  That's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't, you know...  No, no, it is real-time sports.  It is packaged.  It is not as much packaged as a movie is because it's more packaged like a newspaper or anything because they're still dealing with facts.  I mean, they are eliciting people's life stories and they're telling that to you and I think that's great.  And there is value there.  But it's not like complaining about how a movie is delivered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm just saying, first of all, neither of you are watching it, which kind of proves my point.  So I should point out, you can say that, but you obviously have no interest in it, even with the packaging.  And you could watch an unfiltered stream of this stuff with no commentary.  Have you watched that?  There's nothing...  It's boring.  It's like...  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did that for ice skating, for figure skating during the Winter Olympics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Without Dick Button going, oh my God, she just did a triple Lutz Axel.  I've never seen that before in my life.  It's just somebody doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually pretty cool.  Okay.  You must know something about skating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think gymnastics is awesome to watch, both men and women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love watching it, but I think that we love watching it because of the drama that is at it.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I covered the LA Olympics many, many, many years ago.  And so, oh goody, I can go and watch the swimming meet and...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should have gone to watch Fencing.  That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually...  Only if you know...  You have to know the sport so well that you know why that it was dramatic that he did this and the thing went...  Otherwise, it's just a bunch of guys jumping around with pieces of metal in their hands.  It has no meaning.  It's meaningless unless we gloss it, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so let me ask you this, Leo.  What if you could have...  And this idea has been talked about a lot.  What if you had the Mystery Science Theater 3000, the chat room, the Twitch chat room, of other...  Not NBC telling you what's going on, but people you would like and enjoy.  They won't do as good...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They won't, I think, do as good a job, frankly, because this is a whole...  I think it might be a lot more amusing.  Maybe.  Oh, so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some of those announcers are like idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hear people saying that, but I think this is what it is.  That's what the Olympics is, is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Idiots talking about sports?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, hyping it up like crazy.  That you otherwise wouldn't possibly care about.  Right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if you...  I agree.  If you're like an archery buffer, a fencing buffer...  All three of you.  You love...  Yeah.  Then you're going to want to just...  And you should go to the events.  You should go.  But for most people, if it weren't for the networks ginning it up, it wouldn't be that interesting.  And so it's...  I agree.  I complain.  But I think if you think about it, what we're complaining is what we say we want is not...  This is, by the way, a huge problem in general.  People say they want something.  They don't really want it.  People don't know what they want.  And this gets us back to journalism.  We all say we want journalism, but we still really prefer puppies.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can prefer puppies.  I mean...  Yes.  I mean, there's just not a model for monetizing quality journalism.  Especially public service.  Like, I can monetize my stuff because there's insights about business.  So that's less problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Business is always monetizable.  Yep.  Because you're making somebody money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  But stopping corruption at City Hall, which was part of his point, that's good for a wide number of the population.  But there's that whole concept that they're not all going...  They'll get value from it, but they don't want to pay for that because it's kind of a...  Is it tragedy of the commons?  My God, I can't remember what the...  No, that's something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's when everybody overuses free resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Overuses something.  Yeah.  There's an economic thing that I cannot remember where if you don't...  Okay, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, that was John Oliver's point.  I think you're right.  I think that was a very strong point, which is...  In fact, I don't know.  He had somebody on tape saying this is going to be a field day for the corrupt politician because...  That was David Simon.  David Simon, the guy who wrote The Wire.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who himself gets very old farty and defensive about the old ways of newspapers and all that.  And mind you, I teach journalism.  I care about this deeply, but we've got to find new models.  We shouldn't be presuming that we're preserving the old models is the right way to go about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if there's no role for journalism in the new model?  What if there's only a role for puppies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think that there is, but I don't think...  The problem is you're not going to be...  If you rely on mass, on reach and frequency, then puppies is it.  That's it.  Puppies and cats will fight it out.  That's all there is to it because we know where that goes.  If, however, we see journalism as a service where there's a valued relationship, which is my argument in...  Sorry for the plug.  Then there are other things...  He held up the book, Geek Sparing Gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry. Yes.  Yes.  There are a lot of audio listeners who have no idea what...  I was bad enough.  I didn't even video people.  True.  I guess the sound effect wasn't too good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's opening a door.  What the hell are you doing?  So my argument is that if you know people as individuals, members of communities, you can serve them with greater relevance.  You'll make more ad money because they'll come back more often because it's valuable.  You'll have higher targeting value, which is also good, but you'll also have other opportunities like Texas Tribune has with events.  I have to believe someday soon that Jeff Bezos is going to turn his knowledge about Washington Post consumers into a store.  You have membership, which the Guardian is working on.  You have a hell of a lot more efficiency.  You don't have to...  In the mass media world, you've got to rewrite everybody else's story to have your own page and page view.  In a quality-based service business, then you won't.  You can't afford to do that.  And so we're going to fundamentally change.  I was just writing a post.  I haven't put it up yet.  Arguing this is heresy.  This is high heresy.  If you know I got shot at a journalism school, this is why.  So I said journalists are not storytellers.  We think that's our highest art, our great values.  We tell stories.  No, we impart information and we help people get to their own information.  And there's a lot of ways to do that more efficiently and effectively, but it's going to take time.  And we can't presume that our old models of mass media advertising and circulation revenue are going to do it.  We have to reinvent.  Sorry, end of spiel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I wonder is if we're not in a time where we're in the ultimate democracy, where the mass interests are what count?  Because what you're talking about is an elitist model versus a democratic model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not necessarily elitist.  I mean, a paywall is an elitist model.  If you can afford to pay for the news and others can't, that's an elitist model.  Bill, I actually argued the contrary, Leo.  I've been thinking about this a lot lately.  This is the end.  What the internet kills is the mass media business model and with it dies the notion of the mass.  No, it's not about the mass.  It's about how four million Americans can vote in Donald Trump to be challenging the White House right now because they can find each other and organize and do things.  Black Lives Matter on the good side of this can organize in a way that the big media didn't tell the truth of their story.  And now they can tell their own story as a community.  That's what's different.  That's fundamentally different.  Stacey wants to argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't.  I actually saw a segue into one of our stories.  Oh, aren't you the broadcaster?  This is me, man.  I'm like, boom, let's move it.  So with Facebook, this ties in because you called it the end of the mass.  But Procter & Gamble this week basically threw a bomb in Facebook's business model and was like, you know what?  You're targeted advertising.  It's not necessarily working for us.  We actually want mass.  And so I'm not going to argue with you.  I'm going to let Facebook and Procter & Gamble do it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  So Procter & Gamble, the worst of the big old huge mass manufacturers who force you all to use the same toothpaste and all to eat the same snack, even though we don't like it, they are dependent on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK, that makes sense because a company that produces a commodity.  Yes.  And I would submit that dish soap, clothing soap, toothpaste, those are commodities.  The difference between Crest and Colgate is really minimal, right?  So those companies, it's all about brand and convincing you their brand is somehow magically better than the other guy's brand.  And maybe just it's really all about impressions, just a lot of impressions like Tide, Tide, Tide, Tide, Tide.  That's their argument is they still need to just convince you to buy it.  They don't have to say Tide is better.  They just say Tide, Tide, Tide, Tide, Tide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is why it stays here at the exact same time.  Facebook is saying enough of Tide, Tide, Tide, Tide.  You know, we're going to let you get rid of detergent ads if you want to because you have to have more control over it as they of course institute an ad blocker blocker.  But they've got to give you more control over that because you do get irritated by all that mass stuff that's irrelevant to you.  Here's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Procter & Gamble.  This whole show is what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Procter, yeah, sorry. I should shut up.  You don't have to label it. Go ahead and just say it. I'm sorry.  Would you like to know what I think?  Yes, I would. Yes, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there is, remember when Procter & Gamble speaks this way, this isn't the chairman of Procter & Gamble, the president of Procter & Gamble, the chief marketing officer of Procter & Gamble.  This is the agency, the ad agency.  Yes.  And what ad agencies probably don't like the chairman and president of Procter & Gamble to know is how ineffective and inefficient their television ads are.  The problem with direct ads, the kind of ads you do on Facebook, is you can measure them very carefully and it's probably scary for them.  They'd much rather work in ignorance and in mystery than have real numbers about effectiveness.  They changed their mind though because they saw sales of a certain product, and I'm looking to see what it was, go down.  Because they advertised on Facebook?  Well, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they took the same amount of money and they tried to focus and they didn't get the reach they needed for a commodity product.  A. B. They had to spend more money on the actual media buying than on the actual media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it's harder to buy targeted advertising. It's a lot easier to buy mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't get brand advertising on this show or I think most podcasts probably don't get much brand advertising either.  It's almost all direct response. Facebook's probably all direct response, right?  That's just the nature of the internet. You do well when...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're provable. You're RR-wise, unsterable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't know. I think ultimately in the long run this is kind of a retro point of view.  That ultimately 10 years or 20 years when the next generation gets into Procter & Gamble they're going to say, but we have to...  A lot of our advertisers say, we want to know more about your audience. We want to know more about the direct response.  We want to measure our response more, not less.  May I interrupt with something here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So ABC7NY is broadcasting the Trump guy on Facebook Live.  Yeah, the guy's climbing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I didn't see that happening.  He's climbing the Trump Tower with suction cups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, that was just a little Facebook Live note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, is he wearing like a superhero costume? Is he like the tick but the gecko?  No, he's wearing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Donald hired him to distract people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He might have. He's wearing... what do you call those shorts that are now out in the center of the streets?  Cargo shorts?  Yeah, he's on cargo shorts. He has to run away in shame because he's wearing cargo shorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where you keep your suction cups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute. No one told me cargo shorts are out.  Did you not read the Wall Street Journal?  Did you not read this?  I just bought a bunch of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why they're out.  I'm probably not the height of fashion.  I'm noting the baseball suspenders that I'm thinking.  You noticed. They're baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, they're lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Stacey, let me see if Leo and I are going to do an old man moment for a moment.  So, in my childhood... we don't do that all the time, I know Stacey, but you're too nice to say that.  In my childhood, Leo, I had a craven to go wear a Nehru jacket.  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might have actually owned a Nehru jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My parents wouldn't let me until Johnny Carson wore one.  Then they said it was okay. And I said, that's now why I don't want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want one now. I wore a cape.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  How do you have pictures?  Like as a child?  In high school.  By the way, the only reason that this is in the Wall Street Journal is so that they could make the pun in the headline.  Nice cargo shorts, you're sleeping on the sofa.  Fans of the roomy summer staple meet pockets of resistance.  Is there actual news in this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's like the typical summertime... I think it was a Friday news story, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was like a New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Relationships around the country are being tested by cargo shorts.  Loosely cut shorts with large pockets sewn into the sides.  Men who love them say they're comfortable and practical for the summer.  Detractors say they've been out of style for years.  It's true. I did wear cargo shorts to my son's father's son frat day.  And he said, you're not going to wear those, are you?  And that's all I have.  And he said, oh, I know they're flat out ugly and uncool and bulky.  Even if a Wall Street Journal says they're uncool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what happened is she got such a response from this.  She actually did a follow-up article.  So there's the article declaring them out.  And then there was debate all over the world, apparently.  And then a follow-up article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a Twitter meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a data journalism piece on where they're bought.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This ties back to journalism that is both clickbait and apparently servicey enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're trying too hard on that one, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're in an unusual place because I think people are so...  The real news is so aggravating and upsetting and emotionally charged that we kind of want to have light pieces.  That's I think why Pokemon Go took off.  True. All right.  Facebook says we figured out how to get around ad blockers.  As of yesterday, your ad blocker no longer works on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't it only on the website?  Not if you're on the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somehow I think, yes.  That desktop website, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the reasons people love ad blockers on their phone is because by God, it's so much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where you need one. It's slow and it bogs it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where Facebook and Google Amp, dare I bring that up, are trying to speed that up so that the experience is not so god-awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of ironic because Facebook's ads, in my opinion, are not very intrusive.  They're not bothersome in the same way that a lot of blogs are just so unreadable because of ads.  On Facebook, at least, just the ads on the side, you could kind of ignore it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you see the sponsored things in your stream as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think, you know what, the stuff on the side does not work.  I think the stuff on the stream does work.  I noticed that I've bought things on Instagram because every tenth Instagram post is, if it's well done, as interesting as the real post that preceded it.  And sometimes I actually end up saying, oh, I want that. I've done that a couple of times now.  So they work, but banner ads, I don't think, work, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to make my plug for Google Now's ads because those things are freaking amazing.  They're ads in Google Now?  So they're not exactly ads. They're based on stuff you search for and then they'll tell you if the price goes down.  And then you get a notification or a card, basically, that pops up and is like, hey, you know that thing you were searching on two weeks ago?  It's 33% off. And then you're like, oh, yes, click, buy.  Are those paid?  No. I mean, I'm kind of like, dang, that's a really interesting opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's all the downside of ads with none of the revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say none of the downsides of ads.  None of the downsides.  With none of the revenue.  They should be monetized the heck out of that.  You know what they call that? Content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. Silly me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I should be using now more. I'm just looking at it now.  There's stories that I care about here. So I should be using it more. I don't think to use it.  Using what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, now. Oh, yeah. They've done a really good job now of surfacing stories you're interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, they surface your commute times if you ask them to. They tell you, they remind me of like my trips.  So it's telling me I've got six days till I go to San Francisco. A day before I go, it's going to give me the weather there.  When I arrive, it pops up with like all this data about tourist sites, which I don't need.  So and it ties into my week system. So when my door is unlocked at home, it's like, by the way, your door is unlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I didn't do any of that. That's all Google.  Yeah. Here's the Olympic medal count.  Oh, yeah. I killed all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But it's the nice because you have control. Actually, Google is trying other things.  This one's really interesting because I let Google read my email.  Don't forget this tomorrow. A recent email mentioned that you should remember you only have one day left to watch this screener.  Zero days. It's about the Stuxnet flaw. I guess somebody sent me a screener. I didn't even know. I didn't see that email.  So this is hugely valuable. This is hugely valuable. This surfaced something from my email I didn't even know about.  Stuff I'm getting delivered, recaps of the Olympics, which I did not delete, stock updates, weather updates.  And then here's the lots of news. Tesla opens flagship San Francisco store. They somehow know that I'm interested in Teslas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, mine knows that I'm interested in Kim Kardashian because I can't help clicking every time it shows me stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the signal you're sending. But there's an example of, see, that's better because, right, instead of asking you whether you like puppies, it just notices you like puppies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although, I feel better because I've got hydrogen molecule falls to quantum computer because I've shown interest in quantum computing.  So those I don't feel as bad at. I also get every time the cocktail enthusiast updates their website.  And none of this you signed up for just happens.  None of it. It's just like sends. That's why I love this. And it also, I'm sure people, this is not new, but you know, when I'm going to be late for an appointment or there's a traffic jam, it actually pings me.  It's like, yo, you got to leave. Like actually now.  Oh, and Google Home. Sorry. What's so exciting about Google Home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the excitement, Stacey.  And if it comes, their video shows Google Now interactions happening, like it'll ping you. So that little cylinder will be like, that's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Ry Crist, who is a CNET journalist, did a tweet like two days ago and he was like, you know what should happen?  The Echo could do that sort of notification with color on the top so it could blink a color and be like, yo, something's happening.  So now I want Google Now to build something for the Echo and it turns the Echo colors. And I want Amazon to let that happen.  I used to have, this was 15 years ago maybe, it was a globe that glowed and you could program it to glow different colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like if your stocks were up, it would be green stocks or red. Remember that?  If this, then that with Hue lights does the same thing.  Same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's a story on the rundown about if this and that is going to basically compete with Google and Amazon and Apple on trying to run the home.  Well, it already is really middleware that's huge, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's already in there. They own that space.  There are others, there's Zapier, which I actually like. It's a little more business focused. But if this and that's making all the deals, right?  They are. They've got a business model. So you now have to pay to integrate with them is my understanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not everybody, they've got back end deals. But if you remember, there's a twit dude pin board. People loved it.  Basically, if this and that was like, hey, here are the rules for continuing to work with us as we scale. And it required him to do all the work on his side.  And he was like, everybody was up in arms.  I was a little disappointed because I use pin board. I love pin board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do too.  He calls it my heroic and lazy stand against if this and that. This was last April.  But Lyndon said, so the CEO of IFTTT said, there's a family. Here comes the dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said that they worked it out. So I don't know what the deal was between them.  I'm giving my little shruggy.  Yeah. I don't think it was because he had to pay. It was just because he had to do the work.  Okay, yes. He had to do the work. I think some people do negotiate is what my developer friends say. So I'm not sure what negotiations entail exactly.  He didn't want to do the work and they would own the work that he did. And there's no guarantee. And the data. And there was no guarantee that they wouldn't change it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I kind of understand. At the same time, I kind of understand if this and that can't be expected to write interfaces for all the things that it operates with.  Well, that was kind of the plan in the beginning. And we were all like, what? How are you going to scale that? That's crazy talk.  And now it's kind of shifting as they've, I mean, they've done the same thing everybody else does, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You gain an audience, you gain people, and then suddenly the power shifts to your court and then you make other people do the work.  And then you have to do the work. And then you have to do the work. And then you have to do the work.  It's not nefarious. It's just how the world works.  I have a new model for this show. We put a whole bunch of stories in there and you guys pick what you want to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're the aggregator. We're the curator.  Why should I be the one telling you what to talk about? So let's take a break. When we come back, Stacy, pick a story that you want to talk about.  How about that?  Leo's not doing his job.  I'm getting lazy.  Like Stacy has opinions. All right.  You know what else I'm lazy with? Investments. I used to be like very ambitious, right? When I first started, you know, when you're young and you should be doing this, I hope you're doing this.  You start doing this. You start doing this. You start doing this. You start doing this. You start doing this. You start doing this. You start doing this. You start doing this. You start doing this.  When you're young and you should be doing this, I hope you're doing this, you start saving for your future. You put aside money for the, you know, for college fund for your kids or for old age for you or maybe you put aside money for a house, rainy day fund.  And when I first started doing this, I was young and I was ambitious and I read all the books and I said I am not going to hire a broker. I am going to learn how to do this and I'm going to manage my own investments.  And it really went well for the first, I don't know, maybe a year. The problem is it's really important if you do this that you constantly monitor and rebalance.  Because, well, let's say the stock market does really well for a period of time and now you're 90% of stocks instead of 70% in stocks and that's not where you want to be.  And so you got to kind of, frankly, it's like a garden. You don't tend it. You're going to have a lot of weeds. And I did not tend my garden.  Ten years later I went, oh, now there's another way. You could go out, you could go down to Main Street and there's a guy with a shingle out front.  He's probably in a strip mall there. He says, I will help you. I will do this for you. I have learned the mysterious ways of the stock market.  And for merely one, two or even 3% of what you invest every year, I shall manage your money.  First of all, that means you have to make one, two or three percent more, which is not easy.  And if this guy's so smart, what's he doing managing other people's money?  It didn't work so well either. Then I found Wealthfront. Wealthfront is brilliant. Wealthfront is exactly what you're looking for.  They manage your money not every month or every quarter. They don't rebalance every year.  They manage it 24-7, every minute of every day, because it's computers. And because it's computers, they work cheap.  Not one or two or three percent of what you have invested. One quarter of one percent. 25 basis points with no commissions and no hidden fees.  Wealthfront does it right. And if you're wondering, well, how does the software work?  They've encapsulated the best brains in the business. Burton Malkeum, who wrote the Random Walk Down Wall Street.  Charles D.

All kinds of long-term investment, including 529 college savings plans, which are kind of like Roth IRAs.  They manage $3 billion now in client assets. They're growing rapidly every day because they really work.  And now I'm not asking you to invest, although you can start for as little as $500.

She's in Austin, Texas, joining us from New York City, from Manhattan.  It's Jeff Jarvis. He's, I'm sorry, from New Jersey. He's in Jersey.  Everything's legal in Jersey. He is a professor of journalism at CUNY down there on Times Square.  And also the author of many great books, including Geeks Bearing Gifts, Public Parts, What Would Google Do, and Gutenberg the Geek.  All right, Stacey, fire when ready. What's your, what's your story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. I'm really excited about two stories. So we'll see if I can get to both of them.  You will, I promise.  It's okay if I don't. Okay. First story. Intel bought a company this week called Nirvana. I think it's Nirvana Systems. That's N-E-R-V-A-N-A.  Oh, like Nervy.  Yeah, like not, not Kurt Cobain and Grimtrap.  No flannel.  No flannel.  No flannel to my knowledge. So this is a cool deal because Nirvana is a company that is doing two things.  It's making a cloud for machine learning and it's also eventually going to make a specialized chip for machine learning.  And so there's a couple cool things here. One is Intel has been kind of like where, nowhere when it comes to machine learning.  And everyone's kind of like, wow, artificial intelligence, that's going to be the next big workload Intel Miss Mobile. Is it about to miss machine learning?  And the answer is maybe. So this looks like a way to kind of stave off some of that talk. It also brings more Qualcomm people into Intel's fold.  Intel actually hired a guy named, oh, his whole name is really epic. His name is Murthy.  His name is Murthy. He was like, let's see if I can look it up and say it because it's a beautiful name.  So Murthy Renho.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the thing to understand is it's just pronounced exactly as it's spelled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a Southern Indian really long-lasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like Higginbotham is easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Higginbotham is maybe, well, that's pronounced, I guess.  To us it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dr. Venkata Rendekintala.  Very good.  I bet that's perfect.  Anyway, so Murthy, who was at Qualcomm, he left. Intel paid him a lot of money to go.  And it was during when Qualcomm was having all their kind of like executive turmoil with their board of directors being like, oh, no, it was an activist investor.  So Murthy was like, I'm leaving, going to Intel.  Nirvana was founded by a couple guys who used to be in Qualcomm's R&D division building a neural chip for them.  And so these guys left Qualcomm because Qualcomm didn't really want to make it a functioning processor.  And so they went over, formed Nirvana Systems, got some money from Steve Jervitsen and lovely other folks.  And now it looks like TechCrunch has Intel paid $350 million for it.  So woo on them.  So that's kind of that.  Other big thing to know, this last big thing, is they're using Nvidia's GPUs right now.  And big question is, will Intel actually accede to using other people's GPUs? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What other ones could they use? I mean, AMD owns Radeon, owns the ATI technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Intel tried way back in the day to build these chips called Larabee that were going to be...  Oh yeah, Larabee. Yeah.  Yeah, I remember Larabee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember Larabee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you're building a machine learning chip, you've got to have two things that right now chips don't really have,  which is massive parallel processing and really fast I.O. so the data can move really fast.  Right now, chips are designed to kind of make a tradeoff between one or the other.  So GPUs are massively parallel, but they're I.O.s and all that.  You also have to think about energy efficiency.  So that's like big picture what Intel needs to do.  And I don't know if they're going to be able to do it.  This is not like I look at this and I'm like, heck yeah. It's where they needed to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Rendit Chintala is there really about for Internet of Things, right?  I mean, that's what his expertise was. Small devices.  Small devices. All the stuff that goes into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because Intel was like, I.O.T. it's going to be big. We should really talk a lot about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would you connect this to buying a machine learning company?  Do you think they want to put more intelligence in these I.O.T. devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I connected those two because Murthy was from Qualcomm.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We may never know why she connected those two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's that moment.  Do you sometimes wake up in a cold sweat thinking you're in a Skype?  No, I don't actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Freeze.  Because I never freeze.  I'm always here. I'm the one who doesn't freeze.  I'm the one who doesn't freeze.  I'm the one who knocks.  We'll just call her back.  We're never going to find out what Murthy was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a little teef.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How's the car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just got a text message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The person you're trying to reach is currently unavailable.  From Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do love that accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With a picture apparently of the car screen.  Here it is.  She says, this thing is a P.O.S. and I'm not driving it anymore.  This thing is a P.O.S. and I'm not driving it anymore.  Oh no.  Touchscreen unresponsive press scroll was...  She's had a lot of trouble with it.  You know what? I think I don't have as much trouble because I'm used to driving a computer.  Driving a computer, yes.  It's kind of like a computer where it just...  Hey, touchscreens freeze. What are you going to do?  As long as the steering wheel works.  Ah, Stacey's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were vamping Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's okay. That was Time Warner Cable.  Really? What did they do?  Nothing. It's because it's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh. You know, I hate that when the internet goes out because it's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See? Exactly. It's like the plot of The Stranger.  It's so hot in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, so you think... I'm sorry.  You got caught off at the most inopportune moment.  You were going to explain why these two stories go together.  Oh, linking the stuff in my brain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the link? Between Nirvana Systems, which is artificial intelligence hardware, I guess,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and Venkata Rendhu Chintala, who is really about chips.  So, Murthy came over from Qualcomm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just teasing you by saying his name. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I cut my teeth on Siva Vajanathan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, what did Rendhu Chintala have to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, stop it. That's just mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was simply making the point that he came from Qualcomm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The founders of Nirvana were also developer or engineers at Qualcomm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that. Okay. So, it's a reunion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like Intel's pulling all these Qualcomm guys in, which could be good for them  because they really need to ramp up with the Internet of Things and everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Intel's big challenge, frankly, is that they missed mobile.  And they were so dominant for so long in desktop, and now the end of the PC is nigh.  And they haven't really figured out a way to transition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As Stacey can speak best to, I heard from somebody this weekend  who works very closely with Intel, who said the whole strategy is to be in three quarters of IoT devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not going to happen.  Because ARM doesn't really...  So, this actually does make sense because...  So, Qualcomm and that kind of knowledge gives them at least something they can do to compete with ARM.  But what they will make, which would be unique, would be an artificial intelligence engine, basically.  Yeah, if you imagine what's going to happen, the way the world's going to go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you're going to have all these low-power end nodes, right?  Sensors, tablets, whatever. And those are all going to be powered by ARM.  Intel kind of has to give that up.  They did have the basis peak as actually an ARM-powered watch, but they had that recall.  So, that's not going well.  Right.  So, then all of that goes up into the cloud where magical machine learning algorithms say,  oh my gosh, this data, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, means this.  And then they shoot an insight down and then actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Crunch the data again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, that is my magical crunching data noise.  I love it. I love it.  Intel's kind of given up on the end node piece for now.  Really?  Well, they don't...  You have to be low-power.  Yeah.  And they don't have that.  So, they're talking about security.  They're looking at being in gateways.  Right.  They have a wonderful chip that powers a lot of the gateways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but Broadcom owns that market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The gateway market?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, not the IoT gateway market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, IoT. Oh, you mean like SmartThings, the hubs.  Yeah.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, in industrial IoT...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those are ARM. Are they mostly ARM chips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, inside the SmartThings hub is an ARM... I want to say it's an A9, Cortex A9.  So, it's a pretty powerful ARM chip.  I'm actually talking about in the industrial kind of business application...  Oh, okay. Yeah.  ...where you're going to send like hundreds of thousands of sensors are going to send their data into this computer.  Lots of transactions. Yeah.  And it's going to crunch, crunch, crunch the data in that box.  So, you need a powerful Intel chip and that's going to be plugged in.  Yeah.  And then in the cloud, you're actually going to need... where Intel's doing great, the servers, that's lovely.  It's got like 96% of that market.  But where that's going to go is machine learning.  And right now, they're like, Xeon is not a great chip for that.  So, they're going to go... they have to have machine learning or else in like five or six years,  instead of saying Intel is mobile, we're going to be like, God, Intel is mobile and machine learning.  And then you can't make two mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Are you sleeping, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you've actually made me think something I rarely do.  And so, I had to lean back, get some blood to the brain.  So, Stacey, can I bring up our lady question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, at this Aspen thing where I was this weekend, it's under Chatham House rules.  You can't say who said what, which I hate because I want to give credit.  But a very smart person there with a lot of experience talked about the civic Internet of Things  separate from the medical Internet of Things and seeing these ecosystems and who could control what.  And the person was arguing that we in local news should be trying to have a major role in the civic Internet of Things  and how that operates if we had any smarts.  How do you see the ecosystem of IoT data breaking down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's a really hard question because it's too broad.  Can you get a little bit more specific?  I can talk about news, how news is using sensors.  I can talk about architecture, like how people...  I have a thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a kind of more meta thought.  Oh, okay.  And I'm going to make an analogy to the computing revolution that we've been through  where it started with discrete CPUs that weren't really talking to each other, the PC, the personal computer.  And the explosion didn't happen until they could communicate and the rise of the Internet.  And that was the real digital computer explosion.  That's really when it happened. It wasn't them as individual pieces.  And IoT is very much in the same situation.  And currently we're in that early stage where I have a doorbell and I have a thermostat.  I have colored lights. And you can cobble something together.  But that's not ideal. That's the base station hub spoke model.  What you'd really like is more of a mesh model where all of these things have enough intelligence, not much.  You don't want to make these expensive chips to communicate with each other and create an intelligent kind of mesh.  Wasn't that what Google tried to announce at I.O.?  I think it is what they were trying to announce.  And I think that that's exactly what this acquisition, what these two acquisitions are about, or the guy and this acquisition are about.  Which is how can we make each individual item smart enough to communicate with all the other individual?  Stacey, you think we could go hub free or do we have to have a hub?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For the home, we could go hub free.  We could go hub free, but if we do that, we risk losing everything when our internet goes up, which still happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, that's the advantage because the home doesn't have to be connected to the outside world. They're talking to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I talked on my show last week about a light switch that runs Erlang because everything is going to be distributed to computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. I'm sorry.  Who would put Erlang on a light switch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A company called Plum. And the reason they're doing it is exactly that.  Smart.  Yeah, that's their goal. So that is one model. We haven't come up with another model.  Sorry, we have other models. We haven't picked one model for the home.  And for the industrial, there's a lot of security stuff that people are worried about.  So we're probably going to get a little bit of a mesh, but it's all going to be not connected to the actual internet.  It's going to go back to that gateway and then it'll go back.  All that data will go then to some cloud thing with the Intel stuff inside.  I did want to say someone brought up in the chat room Google's TPU, the TensorFlow, the Tensor Compute Units.  Yeah, Tensor Compute Units, which is Google has developed a chip that they don't talk much about the architecture, which makes me so sad, that is running their machine learning cloud.  And it's more efficient. And I imagine that is the sort of thing.  Well, it is the sort of thing that Nirvana Systems is doing right now.  They've kind of customized the firmware on an NVIDIA GPU and run their own compute cloud, much like Google is doing.  So if that helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Leo, you just answered the inverse of the question I'm actually asking, which is not what's going to tie the devices together, but instead, where's the data exhaust of all these devices going to go?  And how is that ecosystem going to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's two issues that have to be solved, in my opinion, in the IoT space.  And Stacey, you're more of an expert, so correct me if I'm wrong, but security is one and privacy is the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but let's say you solve them.  Then what I'm trying to get to here is that then there are classes of devices and data, right?  There's health ones, there's all kinds of sensors in your body and things like that.  There are public space ones, traffic and crowds and noise and things.  There are transportation ones, how fast is something going?  These become nodes in a larger IoT ecosystem and nobody's going to control, I don't think, all that data and have the access to all that data.  But some players are going to find the ways to pull together to say, Waze is going to try to say, we're going to get every darn street sensor there is, maybe they aren't, but I'll just make it up.  We're going to get all this other kinds of data. We're going to know which gas stations people go to because they're cheaper.  We're going to know all this public stuff versus somebody else is going to say, we're going to do the best job of comparing you to your peers about your health, that kind of thing.  That's what I'm trying to understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of similar to what's going on in the smartphone market right now.  Apple says, we're just going to keep everything on device, you keep it to yourself, but we'll have all those things talk to each other.  Versus Google, which says, everything will go up to our cloud and we'll give you insights based on all of the things we can produce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the question, who gets the insights and who doesn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Data is going to be a commodity because it's so cheap to add a sensor.  Everyone originally thought that I'm going to be the sensor inside the car.  But really, I can buy an OBD port monitor, shove that in, and I've got my own sensor versus my insurance company might put their own black box in and they get their own data.  The data is a commodity. The value will come from aggregating data and building really smart algorithms on top of it.  So you'll see interesting things like Apple with not health kit, care kit, the medical device.  Places like that are really interesting because you're going to get a lot of data that's really useful to different parties and it's freely accessible.  I'm looking for someone like Google to say, hey, that's awesome. I'm not going to build my own because that's stupid.  I'm just going to work with Apple on that. I don't know if that's actually going to break down.  This is what people are fighting about all the time.  But Jeff, because you asked, there is an IoT project that you should pay attention to. It's called How Hot Is It in Harlem.  WNYC is doing it. They put sensors in Harlem in various different places and they're measuring literally how hot it is because there's no green space there and all this.  It's like a public works kind of thing. So check that out because there is a thing called sensor journalism and some of the projects are really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And John Keefe of WNYC is a real leader in doing this and getting people to build things for that.  They also, when we had the cicadas come, and WNYC had people build sensors they put in the ground so they could predict where the cicadas were going to come out because it was all temperature based, which is all cool stuff.  I'm fascinated by what you said. I'm really fascinated with that idea that people thought, oh, if I can control the toaster data of America, that's going to be really valuable.  But what you're saying I find fascinating is that no, the data is the commodity. The data is not going to be any big deal at all.  How you pull it together and how you act on it is going to matter.  And who's best positioned? So I guess what this smart person at Aspen was saying, that there are going to be players who are positioned well in certain domains.  And that he was arguing that local newspapers could try, even though we have absolutely zero skills at this, zero, but could try to say, listen, we want to play in the civic internet of things.  We want to be a trusted player between private parties and houses and local government. And what we've always done is gather information. So why don't we gather this information?  And I was thinking about it, is there a business opportunity there or not?  Yes.  When we get to it or not is another question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the Texas Tribune is actually working on some interesting things here around that. The Daily Dot has been looking at data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a lot of data journalists. I bet you even teach that a little bit at CUNY.  Oh, we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you pull in...  John Keefe at WWC comes in and teaches. He's the only thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But again, the value is saying it'd be something like, I'm going to scan and have all of this information from City Hall on, let's go with pulling permits for, give me something that's sort of a building permits.  Building permits. So building building permits. The value that news organizations would bring is coming in, getting a reporter to say, these are the keywords that you should look for, that you would want to flag as notable, in building kind of that reference in the algorithm that would say...  That would actually allow you to input data and then get something useful. So I can see a tool, like I could put in some mogul's name and then find out all of their relationships based on Secretary of State data.  That would be really hugely valuable. You could sell that and a newspaper could manage that.  I'm having a hard time thinking of cool citizen things like FOIA requests you could actually only make once.  Maybe you could get the people who like school districts and places to actually agree to send their FOIA stuff to places, then you could act as a repository for those.  Here's another example. Here's an example. Four Square did some really neat data work last week, which we don't have the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they used their own data about who goes into what stores and the foot traffic and said that Trump's campaign is hurting the traffic to Trump-branded businesses. That was really cool.  Now, so Four Square has that data because it's in your phone. Who else has that data? Well, obviously the phone company has that data because they know exactly where you are on your phone.  To an extent on the road, not foot traffic, but car traffic, Waze and Google Maps have that data. Google has that data because they're tracking you. Tracking is an emotional word.  They know where you are in other ways. In New York, we have these new obelisks going up with sensors in them that can probably just check on where there's more action by this door front or that door front or that front.  So they all have that data.  It's really going to be valuable to stores to know how many people walked by, how many people stopped for three seconds and then kept going. That they weren't drawn in, but they could have been. Where was this person before they came here?  You can imagine a lot of that. That might be civic data to the extent that it could come from the fact that they were not drawn in.  But they could have been. Where was this person before they came here? You can imagine a lot of that. That might be civic data to the extent that it could come from public place sensors. But it could also come from private devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's why I say data is a commodity because all of those places can do it and I can name companies that are doing all of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think though that given the awareness people have now that this will all just kind of go ahead without intervention or that people are going to say, whoa, hold on a second?  Oh yeah.  I mean they're already saying that about all the cameras everywhere, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes and no. I think those cameras have been around for a very long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read a story about Kansas City's connected Wi-Fi probably a month or two ago. They launched, Kansas City put in a Wi-Fi network and a new street train. Is that what they're called? Trolley? Something? Streetcar.  So they put this in and I talked to the CIO of Kansas City and he told me and I quoted him that they're taking the software they're using can see whose phone is walking down the street and they give that to I think it's called pin drop, which is owned by Sprint.  And they give all that data over to them. The city actually never sees this data.  Terrible.  So I was like, if you, I was like, so you know, if I'm walking down the street, what if a crime was committed? Could you, could you get that? He's like, no, I'd have to subpoena the data from them. And I was like, whoa, so you get all this data and you just sent it right over.  And this is not uncommon. There's companies like Euclid. There's others that like, God, Peter Thiel put money into this Wi-Fi company and it's, I want to say it's Senefits, but it's not. It starts with a Z.  It's a San Francisco Wi-Fi company and they're basically tracking you individually using your phone and the Wi-Fi address, Wi-Fi hotspots that when it tries to ping a Wi-Fi hotspot, it's also leaking data about other Wi-Fi hotspots that you've been on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So all of this is actually happening kind of without our knowledge, without our cooperation. Often city governments release this information in ways they shouldn't to private business. Is there going to be a backlash or do people just not care and just go, yeah, whatever, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wrote that story and I thought people would care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is value. You and I know there's value, but even then, I think if there weren't value, they don't care. It's like, I got enough to worry about. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem, Leo, is that this is an argument I made before, that we shouldn't control the generation or the gathering of data. What you have to control is the use of the data.  Right.  So having cameras on the street.  So data is going to happen no matter what.  It is anyway.  Having cameras all over everywhere, right?  It would be bad if this was used to out people having affairs, but it's good when it finds missing children.  It's good when it finds the criminal who did something.  It's bad if it just reveals people and violates the privacy.  So the question, the data is not bad.  The use of the data is the question.  And I think that we get into a position where we risk getting into, especially in my European arguments, of saying that data is bad.  You want the data.  Yeah.  But what you do with it is quite another matter.  I don't question that.  But wise regulation that allows the good to also occur.  I have very little hope of any of that happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then we'll have these major reactions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If we even know about them.  I mean, if it weren't for whistleblowers, we wouldn't have known that the NSA was gathering all the phone traffic out of AT&T in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We wouldn't have known that unless one guy came forward.  I can only imagine how many things we don't know about.  I mean, I think it's a good thing.  The fact that for most people, I think it's a Stacy's point, for the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of people, there's no impact on their lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd say, oh, that could happen.  Or I find that creepy or I find it wrong.  That's right.  OK.  But when it comes to this actually affected me.  You know, here's another one.  So, the fact that you're going to be doing something like this because of this.  You're going to be doing something like this because of this.  You're going to be doing something like this because of this.  You know, here's another one.  So, what should we call it?  Easy Pass.  Do you have the same brand?  Yeah, well, we have Fast Track.  Fast Track.  So, those things.  Austin has Easy Pass.  So, obviously, the government knows exactly where you've been.  And, you know, they could send your husband or wife a map and a timetable of where your car has been all the time.  Or Tesla could do that in your case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I have a map of my Tesla.  I know where my Tesla is at all times.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, in certain circumstances, you can imagine that being used badly.  And so, to maintain the trust and allow the system to operate, government has to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me just tell you, it's a lot harder to have an affair than it used to be.  My wife has an app that shows where I am at every minute of the day.  In my case, Leo, it's harder just because I get older.  I thought it was less hard as you got older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Did we go there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just hit me.  Hit me and hit me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might show up at the studio next week just to hit you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just to smack me and just say, you are bad and wrong.  I always go there. I always go there, Stacey. You learn this about me.  I have a very bad habit of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'll just be like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always go for the bad, dirty joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There needs to be a little punching bag right next to you that when you say it, Stacey, hit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I could totally connect something for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, with a little electric buzzer in my seat.  The Pavlov.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would help me a lot, actually, if you would do that.  No, that's what I have Twitter for.  There you go.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I talked to somebody this weekend, too, who is a fan of this show, listens to this show, who is an investor in ShotSpotter.  So ShotSpotter has microphones on rooftops of buildings.  This is interesting. Because of privacy concerns, they don't put them street level for the fear that people can hear actual conversations.  They put them on rooftops and it triangulates the sound of a gunshot.  Oh, yeah.  And sends the police to that. And he said there were all kinds of other great uses of this.  For example, people who use dynamite to hunt for fish and destroy coral reefs so they can locate where that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that very sportsman-like? Is it dynamite fish?  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, speaking of sportsman-like, poachers.  So they did an experiment in, I think it was South Africa, with poachers.  Do police use this ShotSpotter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, they do. It's in Chicago and I believe it's in Washington, D.C. or maybe it's Baltimore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's in parts of New York as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, look, here's the map. It's everywhere. In fact, it looks like it's in Petaluma. What is that dot?  Wow, there's a lot there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, yeah. The salesperson must live there or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Because I doubt there's a whole lot of shots being fired up here.  Wow, that's interesting.  Yeah, I go back and forth on this. We won't even know what benefits or interesting things can happen unless we just let it all happen.  I hate that they say, well, we don't want to put it on ground level because we don't want people to worry.  We don't want to have face recognition because people will know. Let's just do it. What could possibly go wrong?  I feel like we're missing out on some really interesting things we could find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, South Korea, they've implemented some crazy stuff. Oh, we talked about this already. We talked about the property values going down. We talked about the affairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that was some other show you were on. Or maybe I wasn't here.  It was while I was gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, yeah. I was like, I remember this.  I missed it.  Yeah, you did. It was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dang. I have to listen to that show.  There you go.  Although I wasn't here last week.  Steve Martin Us.  By the way, great show. Go see it if you're in San Diego at the Old Globe. Very funny.  Play it again.  Meteor Shower. Very funny. And it'll be on Broadway. You'll get to see it.  The actor is apparently already fighting over whether they get to go to Broadway or not.  I dibs this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Are you kidding? Get to go to Broadway with a show written by Steve Martin. It's like gold.  It's like gold. You can't go wrong.  All right. Let's take a break. Come back with more. Lots of stuff. Okay. It's your turn, Jeff, to pick your story.  Oh, okay.  Did we get both stories you wanted, Stacey, or just one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because actually the story I want is the other story Stacey wanted, I think.  Oh, well, that's perfect.  You need broadband?  Oh, no.  Okay.  All right. We'll do Jeff, then it'll be your turn again.  It was the...  We've got plenty of time. Half an hour left.  Yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah, Stacey, you're right. Kismet. Kismet struck us.  High fives!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to have to do it over my head. Wait a minute. I'll just duck. Wait a minute. Just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait. I don't know which side I'm on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to go the other way. I'm so confused here for me. I have no special...

I love actually having products that are aimed at the digital literati, the digerati, the people who understand technology, who love it and embrace it.  I love that kind of advertiser. And actually, I think it's all of our advertisers. They're all kind of changing the world thanks to digital technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your advertisers have to hit a certain mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do. They do. Although I think we've got an underwear sponsor coming.  Well, we use that too.  Hey, we got to use those too.  Yep. All right, Jeff, your turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacy's story. I want to hear what she has to say about this too.  It pisses me off. What did I just do? Oops.  No, you look good.  No, I just turned on something there. I got USA Today. Damn you. Puts on auto play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No auto play. CNET's doing that too now where video starts, noise starts.  Is it Bloomberg that's doing this too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CNBC does it. They all do it and it just drives me nuts. Luckily, I can only hear it but it was driving me nuts.  Speaking of being driven nuts, I'm very, very disappointed to see that the FCC lost its effort to enable states and localities to build municipal broadband.  And in fact, now states win the right inclusion and corruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  States didn't win the right. Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T won the right.  It all started with Philadelphia doing municipal Wi-Fi in Comcast's backyard.  And the big Internet service providers went with bags of money to the state legislature and then they realized, oh, this is a good strategy.  And they went to 40 different state legislatures have now passed laws against municipal Wi-Fi. Shocking.  The rationale is, well, you're competing against private enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's not what the laws say. The laws are like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the rationale in the law then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no. Sorry. The legal rationale is things like they have to make certain amounts of money. They have to.  People play Pokemon Go. Shocking.  No, they're things like, oh, man, I used to write about this. They have to. OK, getting my brain back in order here.  It's the heat. It's the heat. It's the heat. It's the margaritas last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The heat and the margaritas. That's a deadly combination.  Well, we're having a party for the staff tomorrow at our house and I'm trying to decide what mixed drink to ply them with.  I'm thinking daiquiris. I'm going with the rum.  That's so dainty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dainty. Dainty. Dainty. Oh, yeah, I remember my parents. That was a 60s drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I wanted to. You know what? The Washington Post got me started with this because they did a whole thing on Havana Club, which was Castro's, actually before Castro Hemingway's favorite rum made in Cuba.  And then, of course, when Castro came into power, the makers, the family fled. They live in Florida and they decided to stop making rum.  So the Bacardi family, which had also fled Cuba, said, all right, we'll make Havana Club.  We'll make Havana Club. Well, now, Castro is making Havana Club in Cuba and now that Cuba's open, there are going to be two competing Havana Clubs.  And so I'm reading this great story, which is fascinating. And then the Washington Post does the right thing.  They have a panel of rum tasters taste the two and some other great rums.  And that guy, and they talked about daiquiris, which Hemingway, Hemingway has a daiquiri that he invented. Doesn't have any sugar in it.  Just maraschino, liquor, grapefruit juice and lime juice. There you go. The rum war.  Anyway, back to Stacey. I was just giving a little time. I was filling for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I enjoyed the cocktail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And I ordered, I went online and I went, there's a rumtasting.com or something, and I ordered the top.  There's one rum that's $30 that everybody says, this is the best deal in spirits. It's the best rum for nothing.  And then I bought, I thought, well, I'm going to try one like a hundred dollar bottle and we'll see, we'll compare.  So maybe mojitos, but I think there's too much muddling involved. The nice thing about daiquiris, you can squeeze the limes ahead of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were you considering margaritas too or that's dangerous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa loves margaritas, but as you know, it should be a controlled substance.  Margaritas, tequila makes your clothes fall off.  Yeah.  And this is a work event. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, don't do that to your staff. Don't do that to you.  Okay. So Muni broadband laws. So a lot of these laws are things like they have to give the telecom operator a chance to build a similar network.  So that's one way to get around it. Another one is to require different voter referendums, which can be hard to do.  And then, so it costs money to do the referendum. And then the ISPs oftentimes will pull out massive amounts of money.  It's like Uber did in Austin. So to get that done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because nobody would vote against free municipal Wi-Fi. That's like God in country. That's like apple pie. Why wouldn't you want that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that was also a long time ago. I mean, people were like, Wi-Fi? What? I think I saw an intel show about that. They were not watching your show.  And then the final law is laws that really suck and are written poorly. And they're just so you can challenge them in court and make it just like, you don't even want to bother doing Muni Network because you're going to get a lot of money.  ISP is going to come after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they figured it out. Basically they've rigged it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it's very highly rigged. 21 states have these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I thought it was more than that. It's only 21. Okay. I thought it was 40. I had read 40, but that might be old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it's 21 with certain types of restrictions.  Texas has one that says no municipal agency can have its own wireless network, which screwed our ISP up. Not our ISP, I'm sorry, our utility up when it wanted to do some smart grid stuff.  So these aren't just Muni broadband. As more things become broadband enabled, they can actually, you can get into these.  Run afoul of the law.  Yeah. What is the network? What is the server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I guess, I mean, you could make the, the only case you could make is the kind of traditional conservative capitalist case, which is, well, you're competing against private enterprise.  And wouldn't it be better if private enterprise did it? Which would be fine if private enterprise did it, but private enterprise doesn't.  And they don't do it, right? I mean, for the most part, private enterprise says there's no money in that. I'm not going to do free public Wi-Fi. And so they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go the full libertarian Monte with a double twist, you know, you say this thing about private roads and public roads.  Right.  So is this the road of the future? We've had that argument.  I am a strong...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you come to Texas and you will see that in action, it's terrible.  Yeah, they have private roads, don't you?  Yeah.  We have private roads. We have things the government refuses to serve. It's special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really feel like I am a big supporter of the idea of, and I should give credit to, I think it's Bob Frankston, one of the guys who created VisiCalc, who's been lobbying all over the country for this, for municipal Wi-Fi.  But not municipal Internet, not municipal Wi-Fi, not free Wi-Fi. But the town, and maybe even using eminent domain to take over existing wiring, but the town should own the Internet infrastructure in that town.  And then the town should invite private companies to provide over-the-top Internet services.  Seattle has that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that the way power operates now in many places, like here in New Jersey?  It's how power operates.  And how BT operates.  It's a utility.  It's a utility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the UK, right?  Wi-Fi is a utility. But we add the competitive layer. And you want the competition. You don't want just one incumbent providing Internet access. That's too dangerous.  So infrastructure is provided and maintained by the city, who then leases it out to private enterprise, and anybody can play. And then you have people like SonicNet and Comcast and AT&T all competing for our custom.  I think that's a great system.  Isn't that the way it works in the UK?  Why is that not going to work, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sort of works that way in the UK. It's a little different. The Netherlands actually has a wonderful, Amsterdam has this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they have much better Internet than we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do. The city owns the conduit, and then people run their own wires through.  That's interesting.  But Seattle actually owns its own broadband, like its own dark fiber. And even then, they were going to do a network with it, a gigabit network.  The mayor that pushed that really hard actually didn't get re-elected. Instead, someone who Comcast and others helped fund his opponent.  So another thing that we're kind of forgetting about is the limited time frame of a lot of the elected officials.  But the big macro thing is when we decided on the 1996 Telecom Act, we decided we were going to have facilities-based competition, which is cable companies versus the DSL Telecom.  And when we decided that, we basically said they're going to own the infrastructure and be able to do what they want.  And get a monopoly, a regional monopoly as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm surprised there hasn't been a proposition or a referendum in California.  That's the one place in the country where the citizens could say, no, we are going to use our voting power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To what? To take their fiber? I mean, that's like-  To enable a local government to do so. And the telcos would lobby like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you could imagine, especially in Silicon Valley, where there would be money to counteract that. Google would counteract that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I'm looking at this decision and it's kind of complicated.  So the FCC wanted to preempt those laws that would prevent municipal internet in Tennessee and North Carolina.  The federal appeals court says the FCC lacks the legal authority to do so.  That's often, by the way, the way courts stop FCC mandates.  Because the FCC can only do what Congress says it can do.  But this is what's weird. This comes from the decision.  The FCC order essentially serves to reallocate decision-making power between the states and their municipalities.  Judge John Rogers says the FCC is attempting to reverse the pecking order.  Counties and cities must follow state law, contends the court.  And if that state law forbids local governments from building networks or selling access, then the FCC has no business to say otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So this is basically saying the state law trumps the federal laws in this case.  And I mean, a lot of people would say that's the way it should go. I mean, if this weren't about mini broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, the state laws trump the city laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. State laws trump county laws. And the FCC can't dictate any of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. The FCC's federal has nothing to do with it. And you can't upset that pecking order.  That apple cart.  Yeah. And that's a purely legal decision. And I'm wondering if maybe there's a way to figure this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet there is. I can talk to people and tell you next show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's something I have a great interest in because I really think that this should be fixed.  Chattanooga is the classic case where Chattanooga's utility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's who started part of this is they wanted to, a couple cities near Chattanooga were like,  Yo, can we get some of your broadband? And they were like, Yeah, I guess so. But we got a lot of your way.  And then that's how this all came around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chattanooga schools and students, students in formerly underserved areas have also benefited from the broadband service.  EPB is the power utility in Chattanooga.  Initially notes the judge by introducing EPB to the marketplace, it's resulted in lower rates and improved service from existing providers.  In the area competition is good.  And counter to claims made by opponents of municipal broadband who say it's always a money losing venture.  The court points out that Chattanooga has also put more, the EPB has put more money in the Chattanooga's coffers.  Which upgrade and as a result, their bonds were upgraded to double A plus in 2012.  So it's a good thing. It's a good thing for everybody who doesn't win except, well, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It can be, it can be money losing for the city if you, it depends on how you think about it.  It's an economic development. Yeah, it's an investment.  It's also more efficient for the city if they can manage the stuff on their own.  But again, that's one of those like highly nuanced subtle things that when you're voting or trying to explain it to like the average citizen, they're kind of like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, fixing the roads is also a times money sink for municipal governments, but they need to do it.  It's their job. It's why we pay taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you're going to both both Clinton and Trump are arguing for major spending on infrastructure, believe it or not, Trump is to even more than Clinton is.  And it's one matter to rebuild some bridges and roads. We need that.  I don't think we need that. But to me, if you if you truly built out world class, best of class broadband networks and enabled commerce to occur on top of them, business as a whole would benefit.  And it could even reduce the cost. The problem is the cable companies want to hold a strangle hold on it.  But in the long run, it would reduce their capital cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it can happen.  So this is a blow to Chattanooga and North Carolina. But,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but there's good news on the broadband front.  Yes, Google, Google in San. I always get my sans confused.  Is it San Francisco or San Jose that they're doing a fiber network?  It's like I get, I get Austin and San Antonio confused too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, boy. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was kind of hurtful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was confused Brooklyn in the Bronx. So there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there we go. I can use my left for my right too.  So this is kind of interesting because there's kind of some new technologies that are in Google fiber is one of these like,  this is why cable is actually getting so much faster and Comcast is telling people it's going to be, you know, super fast by 2017 that everybody should have like a gigabit.  I think it is. Don't quote me there. But Comcast is making some crazy predictions.  And it's because Google fiber started coming in and pushing them.  So this market does need competition, but we may not have to dig fiber anymore.  We might be able to do this via kind of microwave and gigahertz wireless, like point to point gigahertz wireless.  That doesn't have to be point to point anymore because of phased array antennas. So new antenna technology.  If this happens, it reduces the capital cost of putting fiber in.  And we could have gigabit connections like tomorrow.  So that's exciting. Sorry. I like it. That was a random segue, but all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we get to kind of like the little nitty gritty stories like new features. For instance,  Chrome, according to the Google blog, the official Google blog is starting to deprecate flash going forward.  They write Chrome will deemphasize flash in favor of HTML five.  I didn't know this. Not kill it. Not kill it. But boy, get close.  90% of flash on the web, according to the blog, loads behind the scenes to support things like page analytics.  I did not know that this kind of flash shows slows you down.  And starting in September, Chrome 53 will begin to block it. Block it. That's behind the scenes flash.  In December, Chrome 55 will make HTML five the default experience except for sites that only support flash.  For those, you'll be prompted to enable flash. It won't just run. Remember those videos you didn't like, Jeff?  They won't just run. You will be prompted to turn on flash first.  Aside from that, the only change you'll notice. Aside from that.  Besides that, the only thing you'll notice is safer, more powerful, efficient browsing experience.  Flash does suck battery. It slows it down. It's a privacy problem and a security problem as well.  So, I guess good news. People are going to then say, but Leo, you only use flash on your website to play Mac video.  I wish we didn't. I wish we didn't have to. We do pay for one server, Flowsoft, that does an HLS stream, a non-flash stream.  And that's for iOS and iPad. But Ustream and Bitgravity, we have a number of providers on our pages and you can switch between them, are still flash based.  I think this will hasten their move to HTML5. And as they go, so go we. We're dependent on them because we don't do our own stream.  We can't afford to. So we use those great people at Ustream. They have some HTTP streaming. I'm not sure why they don't.  I don't know exactly how it works. But we'll get there. And this helps, in my opinion. So, good thing.  Do you want to talk about? I don't want to talk about it. Emails?  Inbox?  Inbox? We can talk about inbox. There, thank you.  Inbox, this is neat.  I was going to talk about the Clinton emails and the close relationship.  No, please don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no. No politics. Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not politics. Google's involved.  Okay.  No, I don't want to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But inbox. I'd love to hear your opinions because I hate inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love inbox. I don't think Jeff likes it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. I'm a convert. I'm a convert now. I'm fully in.  Yeah, yeah. Once I got over, it's like switching from a stick shift to an automatic. You feel like you're out of control for a while, but it turns out you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tried it for like six months and I just finally was like, ah, no more.  Well, and I liked some features, but I like the automatic replies.  Yeah, I love that. That's a good reason to use inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you use now, pine?  I use mutt. It's like pine only. Even more geeky.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but they, so they're adding Trello and GitHub integration.  So that means that when you get, this is where, this is why eventually you're going to just kind of want inbox because they are, as they scan your emails, they can do into it. Google Now.  We kind of things.  Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine how.  I did.  Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This feels very dev focused too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it is Trello, but is a project manager.  GitHub is a code versioning system.  So neither of these will you probably use, but you might use, you might like having, you ever use Google alerts to scan for your name?  Wouldn't it be nice if Google alerts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they, I, they do, and they pull your shipping data and all your packages in together.  I mean, I know what it does.  I just, I didn't like it for.  You didn't like the categorization.  I didn't like trying to find things and get to things just by looking at my phone.  When I, when I would pull up my phone, I want actually to see the most recent news items because of my job.  And instead I would see like this clustering of things and they would pop back up to the top and I don't know, but I am, I suck at email.  I've got like 36,000.  Everybody sucks at email.  Email sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not you that sucks.  It's email.  It sucks.  If you use Google drive, you can insert drive links into emails, check and fix permissions for those links and save email attachments to drive drag and drop contacts between two CC and BCC and compose on web.  Delete right from the inbox just as easily as you can mark done.  I think, I think they're going to get, this is, this is, this is the new Gmail.  It's also the new Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This, this goes back to what I've said on the show for years.  Marissa Meyer talked about the hyper personal news stream.  You tie inbox to email.  The hyper personal news stream.  You tie inbox to Google.  Now, Stacy's beloved Google now and amazing things can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, that's a bingo card.  You can all have a think.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, two drinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, how many for the book, the book show?  There were two of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, she got back at me for the Texas crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dun dun dun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see what else.  Self-driving car unit losing three key execs at Google.  So what does this mean?  That's a good question.  I mean, I think Apple's self-driving car initiative is also kind of struggling a little bit.  I think sometimes people just get tired of it.  Chris Urmson, who is the CTO in technical leave, has been there for seven years.  What's interesting is he doesn't have another job.  I don't know.  Maybe he's made enough money and he has kids.  I don't know.  And then also Jia Jun Ju, which is a great name by the way, Jia Jun Ju.  Jia Jun Ju.  Jia Jun Ju, the team's, it sounds like something wrong with me.  Jia Jun Ju, the team's principal software engineer, is founded his own startup.  I think this is all kind of normal.  I think so too.  I think people are making a big deal out of it.  This is such a long-term venture.  I mean, when you hear that he's been there for seven years already, it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what I didn't know, I was with the head of Consumer Reports and also Craig Newmark this weekend, who's on the board of Consumer Reports.  I didn't know that Consumer Reports had gone after Musk.  Tesla.  Yeah, they said they should call it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Autopilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  It's not really that.  And she said that all the, it was fascinating, is all the fanatics from Tesla out in the field, you know, argued with him.  But then Musk said at first, no, and then he thought about it a little bit and said, in fact, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's a smart call because it's driver assist.  And that sets up different expectations in people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You saw the story of the guy who's maybe it saved his life.  That's such BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Such BS.  I think Elon planted that story.  It said that Tesla drove him to the emergency room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, it drove him to the exit.  He had to take over then, couldn't go all the way, but he just decided...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you understand that the nav system on a Tesla is not in any way connected to the autopilot, right?  Right.  So it didn't drive him anywhere.  It just kept him from...  ... plowing into something.  Yes.  And he at some point had to sit up and go, oh, there's the exit to the emergency room and drive himself the rest of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The argument is that if he didn't have that aid, if he had to drive the whole way, he couldn't have done it.  You would have had to stop and get an ambulance.  Right.  So the argument is that this got closer to the hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it sounds like an attempt to counter...  Yes, I think so.  ... all the negative publicity myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My mom, she actually had like crazy thing happen to her that caused internal bleeding.  She passed out, ran her car into a guardrail. She survived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But with a Tesla, that wouldn't have happened.  If she had autopilot, auto steer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what I wonder is, Stacey, so if God forbid your mom had lost consciousness, would the Tesla...  She did.  ... would have just kept going?  Yes.  At some point in time, it stops. Doesn't it stop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if she loses consciousness and her hands aren't in the wheel, eventually it will slow down and stop.  Or it will at first alert you.  And I think also if the road gets more curvy, it alerts you.  I've gone long distances without it telling me to put my hands on the wheel, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say it's supposed to, but yeah, I've heard from people who are like...  It doesn't seem...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have autopilot in yours, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't.  Which is a shame, because I pass out a lot.  So, it could be handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think those are called the Vapors.  I'm a swooner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A swoon. Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think it's really oversold.  It's a very good cruise control.  It has some steering capability.  And it has... This is probably the weirdest one. It has auto lane change.  It is not by any sense of the word autonomous.  And I think that Consumer Reports is right.  And Elon was incensed about what they said, but I think they're right.  I think calling it autopilot is a marketing term.  And it's really designed to make you think you have a self-driving car.  And so naturally, there are going to be some buffoons who will get in the back seat.  Or take a nap. Or why not?  Or watch a movie.  Terrible idea.  It's not. It's just more assist.  And by the way, computers crash.  My wife, I showed you the picture. My wife sent me, she says...  She really doesn't like the Tesla.  She makes her nervous, all the computerization.  And the touchscreen crashed while she's driving.  And says, press and hold the selection wheel until it reboots.  She said, I pressed it a really long time.  You don't need the touchscreen. It's not a critical system.  But it doesn't inspire confidence when you're driving what is essentially a high-powered go-kart with a big computer running.  And if the computer isn't reliable...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's several computers. So think about it that way.  It's not just one computer. It's a bunch of computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like it says, it doesn't bother me. I love my Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some of them are more hardened than others though, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if I have to go down driving, I'd like to go down driving in my Tesla.  That's all I'm saying. I enjoy the Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I need it for, Leo?  I need to do autopilot going across the Golden Gate Bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, then you could close your eyes.  Yeah.  The thought of it right now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thought of that scares me, but that's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use it all the time. I use it all the time. I love the autopilot.  Yeah, it doesn't bother me at all.  Think of it as really good cruise control. That's all.  That slows down and keeps the distance between you and the car in front of you.  That's good. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And a lot of other cars offer stuff like that.  My Audi did that.  Yeah.  Although I had a friend who was test driving my Tesla and he started running it towards a brick wall.  And I was like, what the heck are you doing?  And I was like, he's like, oh, it doesn't stop like my Audi?  And I was like, no.  No, it doesn't.  Don't find out the hard way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My Audi, it actually scares the hell out of you because it jams the brakes on.  The Tesla does the same thing, by the way, even with autopilot not turned on.  Maybe yours doesn't, but mine does.  But it will only slow you down to 25 miles an hour. It will not stop you.  The idea being they don't want to come to a full stop in the highway if that's a mistake.  So it slows down to 25 miles an hour and they presume that you noticed that it jammed the brakes on and are now taking over.  Rear-ended, however.

Transcript:  Google Maps for Android.  Getting some nice new features. A Wi-Fi only mode.  This is good if you travel and you're worried about using data.  And SD card download options so you can download the maps for offline use on your SD card.  That's nice. Some nice new features.  I like maps. And maps is great for travel.  This is really mostly for entry-level smartphones that don't have a lot of storage.  And for people who have to pay extra for their data.  Let's see, Facebook we talked about.  You can now email the White House over Facebook Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, if you're using Eve for Tesla, they now have an If This Then That channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need to use Eve. Everybody tells me I should use Eve. Do you use Eve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've used it before. It was really slow. But hey, assure me it's gotten faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gives you Android notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It connects your house to your Tesla. If you have a Wink Hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't really want to do that.  Sorry, Facebook Messenger.  You don't want to do that either, right? I think this is all risky.  You should pay attention to what you're doing on the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The connecting your house is things that you can automate.  You can set up a recipe that says, when my Tesla comes in, open the door.  The Tesla already does that. You can say unlock a door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do love it when I drive up, my garage door opens.  And when I back out, it closes behind me. I really like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got a steep driveway, so it opens this much.  And then the Wi-Fi signal or the signals are disrupted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of annoying.  It's super annoying.  So you turn that off, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sometimes it works.  So I haven't turned it off. I just laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's probably why Lisa is less enamored of the Tesla than I am.  I'm used to technology not working very well, having issues.  And I don't mind because the value it adds and the coolness is worth it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is part of this because you also have an early off the line X?  No, it's not that early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's his doors won't open. That's that issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's another issue. They fixed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  Probably my husband loves the Tesla though, and he hates like 90% of the gadgets I have in my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you love the Tesla too, right?  I do. I love it.  I just love it. It's so nice.  Google used virtual poker dogs to find a way to stop VR trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know there were VR trolls.  Are those the people who run up to you and show you gross things that you can't see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're griefers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Online harassment is nothing new, but when it comes to VR environments, users can get extremely close to one another.  And that can lead to uncomfortable infringement of space and a bad experience that drives people away from VR.  This is Ashley Carmen writing in The Verge.  Google's experimenting.  So here we are in a virtual world.  Apparently we're dogs playing poker.  You and me.  Oh, that was it.  Google's Daydream Labs.  That's their VR initiative.  Experiencing ways to combat abuse in VR.  One successful test involved the creation of virtual poker dogs,  demonstrating that one way to deter users from harassing fellow players is by creating personal space.  When players left the poker table and Google's experiment, their screens turned to black and white and their avatars disappeared from their opponent's view.  A glowing personal space bubble then guided them back to their seat.  This is so not my world.  I don't even know. You know what? I have all this stuff and I still not my world.  Okay, let's see if we can see.  They're playing now. They're playing poker.  Waiting for your opponent and soon he's going to leave the table and a glowing personal.  Oh, no.  Oh, oh, oh, glowing.  I'm done here. I'm done.  See, I'm out of here.  Glowing personal space bubble and he can't see me because all he sees is a glowing personal space bubble.  Okay, you're right.  Welcome to the future.  Jeff, this is what's coming.  Stand back.  These moments make me feel like an old fart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That and Snapchat.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Quad router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should talk about this, I guess.  This is a flaw that involves the internet.  We should talk about this, I guess.  This is a flaw that infects Android phones.  You probably heard them talk about it yesterday on All About Android.  Almost a billion Android phones are infected or I'm sorry are affected, not infected.  There are four exploits.  Three out of the four have been patched.  The fourth won't get a patch until the security fix next month.  Quad router is what it's called.  It was discovered by the security firm Check Point.  They showed it off at DEF CON on Sunday.  Of course, the attacker would have to talk you into your trick in installing a malicious app.  The good news and this you should really remember, you probably have it turned on.  It's on by default.  Your Android device and most Android devices will scan.  Google will scan apps before you install them.  That scan will detect quad router, Google says.  As long as you have that scan turned on, you're not going to have to worry.  You should probably not, at least until this is fixed next month, download apps from third party sites.  The attacker would get full access to your device including its camera, microphone and all the data.  And by the way, the new BlackPerry, the DTEK 50, the company calls it the most secure Android phone.  Yeah, it's vulnerable.  It's hard for Google because they would love to force to push this Android update.  It's why at this point I would not recommend getting an Android phone if the company that makes a phone  doesn't commit to accepting the monthly security updates.  And by the way, so far the two smartphones I really like that are $400, the OnePlus 3 and the ZTE Axon  have not said that they are going to do that.  So Samsung says they will, LG says they will, and of course if you buy a Nexus phone, that's a guarantee.  In fact, I'm starting to wonder if we shouldn't just say if you're going to use Android, use Nexus.  Well, except if you want to use the latest camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This operates with a Samsung phone.  I did order the new Nexus 7, the Note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Nexus, I was going to say the Nexus 7.  No, Nexus, I wish they would give me one too.  And I wish that they would just offer as they did once the Google Experience ROM for the Galaxy Note 7  and that's what I would do because I want the hardware.  DisplayMate just today said it's the best screen ever made on a smartphone, the Note 7.  Best screen ever, it's a Super AMOLED screen, gorgeous, 518 dots per inch.  I will get mine in about nine days, so I'll give you a review in two weeks.  Now here's, we'll wrap up with this one because I want you to explain, somebody will explain.  Remember that the FCC has proposed that cable companies allow you to use a third party set top box.  In fact, you don't even need a cable card.  So these set top boxes that are rented to you by the cable companies in most cases are terrible.  I actually bought a TiVo and put a cable card in it.  It's my set top box. It's so much better than Comcast's really terrible X1 system.  The FCC wants to make a rule change that would require cable companies to allow that kind of thing.  It will cost cable providers $21 billion a year in rental fees,  which by the way, aww, too bad you're gouging us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, exactly like Bob and I have been running you the phone, which was a whole lot of work out for years and years and years.  And some people will still use their existing cable box because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It will be from the AOL of the future.  Most people will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By far.  Because most people use their modems. I mean, they charge a modem and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They take what they get.  Yeah, they're like, okay.  By far.  So the copyright... So this is the FCC's proposed rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the Copyright Office weighs in and they say, oh, this is an attack on copyright. We are not for this.  This is Mike Masnick writing in Tech Dirt. And by the way, highly recommend you read Tech Dirt. Mike is super smart.  Yeah, and he's got Carl working for him too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he says the Copyright Office is lying. Lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also a very good post on Public Knowledge's blog with a list of all the ways the Copyright Office has failed us.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Endorsing SOPA. I will hold you down, but this is just one more in that string.  The Copyright Office writes, the Office's principal reservation is that as currently proposed, the rule could interfere with copyright owners' rights to license their works as provided by copyright law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In other words, make it easier for pirates.  And restrict their ability to impose reasonable conditions on the use of these works through the private sector.  This is it. By the way, the private negotiations that are the hallmark of the vibrant and dynamic MPVD marketplace. MPVD is of course cable operators.  The hallmark of the vibrant and dynamic. Do you not think that somebody from the cable industry is going to be able to do this?  I know.  Mailed it?  And said here's a thousand dollars, would you make this your opinion?  Vibrant and dynamic?  I think that probably we could make it so that there are copyright protections and DRM and these things.  Oh boy, they're just, oh they're dragging the guy. He's in.  Oh, you were watching this the whole time?  Well, I have dehydrated my palms sweating.  He was just going on to the side.  What was he wearing? Suction cups?  No, he was wearing a suit.  So he was wearing a suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was wearing a suit.  And he was wearing a suit.  And he was wearing a suit.  And he was wearing a suit.  He was just going on to the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was he wearing? Suction cups or was he just free climbing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was using suction cups, yeah.  That's such a stupid thing to do.  So they grabbed him and he tried to hold on but they got him in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think they can't really, what are they going to, trespassing is all they can charge him with, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Public nuisance. If anyone does something stupid while he's in, there's some other things.  Okay.  General idiocy. Is that something?  Yeah, idiocy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Idiocy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, too bad. SeaWorld took down the picture of the dolphin taking the iPad out of the lady's hands.  Oh.  I didn't get to see it.  I didn't either.  SeaWorld Orlando, a woman tries to take a picture of a dolphin with her iPad.  The dolphin, clearly an Android fan, jumped up, grabbed the iPad and dropped it.  Like took it away from her, unfortunately.  This video has been removed by the user.  Okay.  You are a violation of a copyright of taking pictures inside SeaWorld.  Is that why it was removed?  I bet you. I bet you. It was taken by another patron.  But don't you, I'm pretty sure they have rules about, you know, you are on private property, right?  You can't just take pictures.  What would this world come to if you just take pictures willy-nilly, violating my copyright?  You might as well, next you'll be taking pictures of the Eiffel Tower.  How dare you?  Alright.  Let's take, oh no, no, there's no break to take.  Tell you what, let's wrap this sucker up with the back of the book here.  Stacey, you want to start with a pic or a tip or an IoT thing or a rock band or anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh gosh, so I was slacking.  I'm going to be honest, totally slacking this week.  I could show the ring, but I haven't tried it out.  Yeah, the stick-up cam.  This is the stick-up cam, which looks exactly like the Ring doorbell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clearly, they've just, they've basically taken just the doorbell part off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. It's just as heavy. I'm trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got a battery. But then if you use the, by the way, we should say this is a sponsor and we're not doing an ad for it right now.  But Stacey has a review.  I have lots of these crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like cameras. I like testing a bunch of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they make you paranoid though.  I have a brother-in-law who has cameras all over and he's, and you go to dinner with him,  he's always doing is looking at his phone and seeing if somebody's bothering his house the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know what? Actually, I lied.  This one isn't my camera. This is, or this isn't my pick.  So my pick is the Netatmo welcome camera, which is $199.  I don't have it with me because, and I can't show you my visual because there are people down there and they would be saying,  Oh, you're so bad.  So it's kind of lame pick, but it's awesome because it has facial recognition.  So it disarms itself and arms itself based on the length of time it's been since it's seen a recognized person who lives in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow. That's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing that everyone would love is Netatmo is very privacy focused.  So what I do is all of my data doesn't go to the cloud.  I can store it on an SD card or I can run it from my own FTP server.  So let me just, I'm checking.  Back, back. It's asking me to validate people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the idea is once it knows it's you, it says, okay, fine.  Yes.  That's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm looking to see if anyone's there.  It's yeah.  And it works with if this and that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I hope my Jibo does this. It'd be nice if my Jibo does this.  Oh, hi, Leo. It's okay.  Then I won't bring out the guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The nice thing about it.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does it do if it doesn't recognize you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It vibrates to alert me.  So and then I go to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's somebody in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, your brother-in-law's going to be getting this any second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it basically is like someone's in the house and then you go to and it shows you video, which it stores.  It takes the video and then it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just makes me more paranoid. I don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. I was going to try to show you what it looks like.  I see.  Can't do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here.  It's hard to do. I know on a Skype call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is so difficult.  Okay. So this is what it looks like.  It's green because my blinds are down and there's kind of that's not what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lovely home you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got night vision.  Very modern.  It is very modern.  And there's pictures of people.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool.  Did you train it to recognize you and your daughter and your husband?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did.  No one's there though.  It's not vibrating.  See there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Without all the.  Are you upstairs and that's downstairs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is downstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  I found by the way the video thanks to the chat room.  Here's the dolphin.  Just because it'll make you feel good.  Oh God.  Here's the dolphin about to watch closely to this lady's trying to take a picture with an iPad and the dolphin quite rightly says, I'm sorry, madam.  No one should take pictures with iPads.  Boom.  Splash.  Slams it in the water.  And goes.  It's like he's laughing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Dolphins are real jerks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can see that happening.  Yeah.  I kissed a dolphin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I realize it's.  They say it's cruel and blah, blah, blah.  I kissed it off.  It was a very cool experience.  With that.  This was earlier this year in January.  It's really fun.  OK, there you go.  That's just a little something, something.  Not my pick or anything.  Jeff Jarvis.  Do you have a number?  I think I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't talk about occupied Democrats last week today.  No.  OK, good.  So I don't know if you see this passing by your Facebook feed, but there's a Facebook group called Occupied Democrats.  And they make memes.  That's all pretty much all they do is make memes.  They made like 15,000 of them.  And they're.  As memes go, they're very effective and very good.  And so I was curious about this because I wanted to teach a lesson to my media friends that we've got to stop thinking we always make destinations.  We have to make things that people can use as part of their own conversations.  A point I've made about YouTube videos.  These are social tokens.  So these guys do a really good job of it.  Clearly they're they're partisan.  So I talked to.  I'm going to forget his name suddenly.  Rafael Rivera.  Who is the co-founder with his twin brother Omar, their 29 year old Mexican-Americans.  So they're really enjoying going after Trump right now.  And they make memes that pass around.  So every each meme gets about a million impressions.  A total of 100 billion memes.  A.  I'll explain that in a second.  A week and much higher as well.  Wow.  What's fascinating to me is that they.  My point there Leo just showed a front page of the New York Daily News.  When I was a journalist friend of mine argued that that's actually the original meme.  Yeah.  A tabloid front page is a meme.  Yeah.  What it is isn't it.  Topless body in a headless bar or whatever.  Jim Rich who's the current editor of the Daily News has been doing a brilliant job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very anti Trump with his page one.  I'm with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really making.  Yeah.  People pass him around.  So I was fascinated that they also have a web page.  But to them it's just it's a byproduct.  A big deal because that's where the ads are.  And the ads are sufficient that both brothers quit their work.  They hired another I think about three people including fact checkers now to put out the memes.  And they've made a business out of it.  And I found this utterly fascinating.  So today on dot NYC the second half of it we interviewed Rafael Rivera.  Oh fun.  On it.  And using and you can see it on my Facebook feed.  Oh I want to see it.  Mevo.  And also you know the dot NYC feed.  Dot NYC show feed.  You'll see the nice cameras feed.  We're doing both.  But anyway so I found occupied Democrats really really interesting.  They have three point five million likes.  He says that it's the most popular political page on YouTube being both Trump and Clinton.  And only one media company has ever approached them and offered them a web TV show.  But they also said no we don't really care about that.  We care about our names.  So interesting things that we do is make it looks like a destination with articles on it.  Yeah.  Can we do that.  But no big deal.  One TV show.  Not too busy.  They make memes.  And so I was I was at this Aspen thing this weekend and it's it's chat about its rule but I can say somebody can say who was there.  And so I'll I'll quote myself.  Not him but I saw Nick Kristof.  The New York Times who's incredibly advanced with social.  And he asked me you know what's what's next for me.  What should I do.  Because Nick's been great on Twitter and great on Facebook.  And I said I think that you know the Washington Post and the New York Times are going to be the most popular show.  You know the Washington Post and New York Times need meme desks.  I think they need to be able to take some of the ideas out of columns and stories and put them out there in a mechanism by which people can share them on their own.  So I just found that interesting.  And if you're interested too I wrote something on Medium and there's the interview on dot NYC today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo.  Leo.  How the hell did you come up with that observation.  I just.  I think you need to be reported to somebody.  I'm not sure who.  But looking at corgi asses and coming up with that conclusion frightens me Leo.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh dear oh dear oh dear.  Well I was gonna do a quick unboxing of this.  You already have it if you had it for several weeks.  This is the Samsung 360.  Cam and you know the downside to this is you have to have a Samsung phone like Galaxy S7 or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can record the video to the card and then use software on a PC.  But you don't get all the benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the one thing I was interested in is it is better than.  The Rico Theta S which I've really loved.  Also have right here.  Yeah.  And it's a little bit cheaper I think it's 300 not 350 something like that.  No I think this one is 350.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe that's the official price now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bought at VidCon they brought 500 of these Samsung's you couldn't get them in the states until about now.  Right.  So that's why I was.  Yeah I think I got mine from Korea or somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're coming soon.  But the quality seems pretty good.  Very good.  Which is kind of nice and.  You can record to the phone when Samsung showed this with the release of the S7.  They demonstrated live streaming from the phone to the S7.  Kind of a couple of guys.  Walking around Paris and their friend couldn't come and so.  Their friend was wearing his VR helmet.  And it was as if he was with the guys in Paris because they're walking around and.  They're taking him with them.  But you said it doesn't do live streaming.  I don't think so yet it's coming.  Okay.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's well done.  Quality looks pretty good and I saw a friend Dana Bernetti's stream of his office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I was so impressed I thought well.  That's pretty good.  I love these ideas.  This is the ideas of these 360 degree.  Images and videos as well.  I think this is where.  In our school at CUNY.  You know.

Transcript:  Our Dean Sarah Bartlett and I were talking a few weeks ago.  Where do we start with all this because we're we're we got to worry about this.  My view is that we start with.  360 photography.  Students and just get them to think in a different.  Still photography.  Yeah I think.  Still still and then and then advanced video and then AR VR will eventually come but you don't need to.  All those tools.  Stacy.  You know I hope.  Yes.  Yes.  I was looking at something else and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Minor minor Leo.  Came up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh but you know what you should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every every VR camera or the back of all.  Phones now with VR.  Oh yes.  Google a.  Must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So.  Speaking of.  You think the next generation of.  Phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will have 360.  Two equal cameras on either.  Because you have to look how big the.  It has to be for the fish eye you know I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well.  And that's a double the data.  And that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We still haven't.  This is the perfect compromise where if you want it you can buy it and it ties to your phone and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These it has a weird built in tripod although you can remove it.  Yeah.  Regular.  In fact I bought the mevo tripod so it'll go right on there.  As well.  You know I'll do some more images with this and recording.  It's not as compact as the theta you know but.  Though the theta.  It's you know it's as tall as a theta.  Yeah.  Almost.  You see the bulge and the theta lens that's the problem with putting that on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay all right but but imagine it's a little small that's not that bad.  But.  It's a little small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a little small.  It's a little small.  It's a little small.  It's a little small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little small.  It's a little small.  That's not that bad.  And.  I'm.  I'll bet you there'll be a specialized phone.  Maybe.  Before you name it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google would probably do it because daydream is you know a big initiative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Maybe the new nexus will be a 360 nexus huh.  Nexus 360.  I'm hoping that.  I want to bring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had good experiences traveling in Europe with the Google Fi stuff right.  Yes.  And so did Mike Elgin.  He's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not perfect.  Some places faster than others.  But this was before they moved up to the 4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now you pay the same price in most of those countries that you would pay if you were at home.  Which I really like.  You don't have international data expense.  So I'm hoping that a new nexus phone comes out before we go to Europe on September 22nd.  I might make that.  We might be able to do that.
