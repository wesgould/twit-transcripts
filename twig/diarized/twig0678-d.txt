Stacey is here because it is World  Waffle Day. So Stacey Higginbotham and her waffles have appeared. Actually, we have a big story for  Stacey coming up. Stacey on iot.com. She's our iot guru at Giga Stacey. Jeff Jarvis is also here,  the Lenny Towne professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark graduate school  of journalism at the City University of New York. Hello, Jeff. Hello, hello. And then as half as

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  good as Stacey. Well, her new hairdo. I like the new blouse. Yeah, I try not to comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't comment on appearance. You can say I like your haircut. Yeah. I mean, unless you don't say  it and then I automatically assume if you don't say anything, I'm like, Oh, he must hate my hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so I don't see. This is why you can't win Leo. This is why men are confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And is also here with a fabulous haircut. All the hairs are cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was inspired by you, and I was like, got to get rid of that hair sucking to closer to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  heart. Because I know sometimes if you have long hair, longer hair, cutting it off is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I cut growing my hair out hard. I only have short hair. That's a really good look though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very trying to think who it is. It's a it's a style. It is a style. Yeah. What do they call it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bob's? It's a pixie. It's a long pixie. Pixie. Okay. I don't know. I want to say it's Tilda here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very Tilda Swinton kind of. As long as you don't say Caitlyn Jenner, because that's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  how I feel like it is. It is not Caitlyn Jenner. No, that's not it at all. It's Tilda Swinton kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't know who Harry Styles or Olivia Wilde is, but you know who Caitlyn Jenner is? Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody knows who Caitlyn is. Of course. Yes. Okay. On to tech news. I guess this is Tilda. It's  kind of a little Tilda Swinton. It's that sweep over the right brow that kind of gives it a Tilda  Swinton kind of a feel. I like it. That's Tilda right there. Yeah. Oh yeah. I was just showing you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah her sweep. And her cheekbones that could cut glass. Oh yeah. She's gorgeous. I love her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a good article recently about her and how she has, despite being kind of indie,  become a real star. Oscar, BAFTA, and so forth. Three Golden Globes. Even though she's so indie,  right? She doesn't do mainstream characters or anything, but she's so good. This is from  The Guardian. She disappears or goes blank like Garbo, the enigma of Tilda Swinton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I ended up, I never watched network TV and I was in a hotel last night or the night before last,  and I ended up watching the TMZ one hour special on Richard Simmons. Oh my God. And you wonder where  this is going to go. What happened to him? Wait. Oh. Well at the end they say that he's Garbo.  He just chose to leave. That's it. He's okay. Good. Good. As long as he's okay. They think so,  but they don't know. They didn't know a damn thing. He just kind of disappeared. I've heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the same thing that he's totally fine. He just wants to sort of be away from everything. I've  heard that too. But there was the rumor that it was unwillingly he was disappeared as opposed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doing it on his own. There was all these rumors. I just want to tell you when I disappear,  be it a couple of weeks, it was my choice. I Garbo'd. It'll be a Garbo. I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just wonder whether anybody will look for you. I know they won't. That's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you I'm trying to stir up some interest. Speaking of stirring up interest,  Mudge. So I remember when Twitter hired Mudge. His real name is Peter Zatko  as their security chief. And it was kind of an interesting story because Mudge was widely known  as a hacker, kind of a white hat, good guy hacker. They hired him in the face of massive security  problems. You may remember breaches and so forth. And I think a lot of people said, yeah, finally  they got somebody who knows what he's doing in there. This will be good. Six months later,  he's gone. After Jack left, Parag fired him. Yeah, but he fired him for not doing anything. I mean,  it was kind of fired for cause, it sounded like. Well, both things in this story can be true.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. We're going to get there. We're going to get there. I want you to know  what led up to it, the backstory. So he was fired, it's about six months ago now.  I think, I'm sorry, he was two years at Twitter, I think, and then fired six months ago. Was it  a one? It wasn't long. It wasn't long. Six months later, he files what he calls a whistleblower  complaint against Twitter. Now, I don't know, is it a whistleblower if you don't work for them and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they can't rep? There's no. Well, he used the same, he used the same organization for help that helped

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  out. Okay. So it's a, it's a whistleblower complaint. The Washington Post has the exclusive  cause they got the complaint itself. The most serious accusation according to the WAPO is that  Twitter violated the terms of a, of an 11 year old consent decree with the FTC who said, you know,  it's a weird consent decree. You have for the next 20 years, it said, this was in 2010. So that  would have gone through 2030. You will be barred from misleading consumers after 20 years. Go ahead.  But for the next 20 years, you'll be barred from misleading consumers about the extent  to which you protect security, privacy, and confidentiality of non-public consumer information.  One of Mudge's complaints or allegations, I guess is what I probably should call them,  is that Twitter collecting phone number as we've kind of known about, Facebook was accused of  doing this too, collecting phone numbers and real names and other things, extensively for  account recovery was actually using that to sell ads. And we knew that from a couple months ago.  Right. Mudge also, I'm going to call him Mudge instead of Zatko because I think he's better  known as Mudge, right? He says- That kind of makes him more cuddly. I don't know.  Like Zatko, I know, he thought Zatko doesn't, yeah. He was an open source programmer, a hacker,  writer, pretty well known in the security community. He founded the Cult of the Dead Cow  and was in Loft, which did a lot of cracking stuff. So he was a very well known guy. He actually,  2010, started to work at DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Administration,  a government position. He oversaw cybersecurity. He worked for Google after three years in their  Advanced Technology and Products Division in 2020. He was hired as head of security at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's an hilarious picture of Mudge testifying before Congress. Hell, I just lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In 98, yeah, as one of seven Loft members. Yeah, and so his name tag says Mudge

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  next to a guy called Kingpin. Yeah. You could be sure Congress took that seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He met with Bill Clinton at a security summit. So he was a well respected guy. He was a division  scientist at BBN where the internet was invented. So he's pretty well known. He was sought out by  Jack Dorsey, who was the CEO at the time, to lead the company's information security approach after  a big hack in July of 2020. You may remember that hack. A lot of big name accounts were  co-opted, right? Was that the one? Yeah. It was the one, I can't remember, but it was all those  famous... Was this the one that led to the death of the... No, no, it was the Bitcoin one where  Apple said, we're giving back to our community. We support Bitcoin. Right. Okay. All Bitcoin sent  to the address below will be sent back to you doubled. And Elon tweeted it. Apple tweeted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A lot of people tweeted it. That was bad. Twitter, a few idiots did it, but I think more for the yucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was bad. Bill Clinton, I think, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos,  MrBeast, Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Kim Kardashian, and Kanye West.  All their accounts had been compromised and tweeted that Bitcoin thing. Uber, Cash App, Apple.  Twitter said that 130 accounts were affected, but only 45 were actually tweeted out that scam.  As I remember, they think it was because Mudge was able to use Slack... Not Mudge, the bad guys.  Mudge came to save the day. We're able to get into a Slack account and get the credentials.  Remember, we talked about this. Get the credentials for an administrative account,  which allowed them to do this. Anyway, it was such a black mark that Twitter hired him.  But then, when he was let go, it was because he didn't do a good job. He was causing problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Were they public about that or that's come out now in his allegations?  I don't think there was a public about why they fired him. I don't remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There were two executives fired at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Let me just Google, Twitter fires Mudge.  All those stories are the current story, unfortunately. Oh, here it is. Twitter shakes  up its security team. This was the story we read in January of this year on this show,  because it's been visited already. Peter Zatko, head of security, no longer at the company,  Twitter confirmed. Chief security officer, Rinky Sethi, was also fired following,  quote, an assessment of how the organization was being led and impact on the top priority work.  Let me see if they have anything else.  I think this background information is important because I think you need to understand this,  that he was fired in January. Six months later, he does this whistleblower thing.  It's, I feel ethically bound, said Zatko. This is not a light step to take. He declined to  discuss what happened to Twitter except to stand by the formal complaint. Under SEC whistleblower  rules, he is entitled to legal protection against retaliation as well as potential monetary rewards.  However, he's not guaranteed to be believed. Everything is alleged, and this would begin  an investigation. Casey Newton said in the piece that he wrote that he heard from people who were

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mudge's fans, but he said, I had an equal number of people calling me and telling me,  but you can't use this story, and then telling him the story is about Mudge. So he has his fans,  he has his detractors, don't we all, but, you know, great assault. Agrawal, the CEO, says,  let me see, I want to get all of the whistleblower complaining now, and then we'll talk about-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Washington Post story summarizes it. The merits of it. It says that thousands of employees still had  wide-ranging and poorly tracked internal access to the core company's software. Remember, that was  part of the problem that allowed this hack two years ago. A situation that for years led to  embarrassing hacks, including the commandeering of accounts held by such high-profile users as  Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. In addition, the whistleblower document alleges,  this is all from the Washington Post, the company prioritized user growth over reducing spam,  are you surprised? Though unwanted content made the user experience worse.  And he says it's because executives stood to win individual bonuses of as much as $10 million  tied to increases in daily users, but no rewards for cutting spam. He says the CEO,  Parag Agrawal was lying when he tweeted in May that the company was, quote,  strongly incentivized to detect and remove as much spam as we possibly can.  Zyko told The Post in an interview that his decision to go public was an extension of his  previous work, exposing flaws in specific pieces of software.  I felt ethically bound, said Zyko. That's that quote. A redacted version of the 84-page filing  went to congressional committees. That's how The Post got it. So they got the redacted version.  Zyko is represented by a nonprofit law firm called Whistleblower Aid. The FTC is also  reviewing the allegations. So stirred up a hornet's nest. And chiefly among those,  besides the fact that it lacks security, was this whole thing about bots.  And this is why I get a little suspicious, because apparently, according to The Post,  Elon Musk, before the whistleblower  accusations, had subpoenaed Zyko to testify in the trial, which is coming up in Delaware in October.  Zyko had accused Twitter of lying about bots to Elon Musk.  And to me, that's pretty damn convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can I explain the Maznik?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so let's go now to Tector, where Mike Maznik's headline is,  Twitter whistleblowing report actually seems to confirm Twitter's legal argument while pretending  to support Musk's. Yeah, you better explain that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what Mike explains in a Bible-length post, it goes into much, much detail, is that,  number one, this still isn't a factor in the case, because again, let's not forget, Musk bought  Twitter site on scene. So that rests over this. But now Musk is out there trying to say, oh,  but you're lying to the FTC about your spam bots, your spam accounts.  SEC, not FTC, SEC.  And what Mike explains, details, is that what's at issue here is Twitter's MDOWs,  Monetizable Daily Active Users. And the MDOW is not a view of the entirety of Twitter.  It is, they're telling the FTC, this is what we're telling advertisers of the people who  might actually be human and could click on an ad. Taking out spam, taking out legitimate good bots,  too, because they're not going to click. This is the Monetizable Daily Active Users. And yes,  we've already cleared out the spam. We've already gone through all that.  That number is post-spam reduction.  It is post-spam reduction. And importantly, it's important to keep in mind that Mike points out,  is that Twitter and their executives are very motivated to keep that number low,  because the higher number that number was, if they put it too high, the advertisers would say,  well, your efficacy of your advertising is crap, because the proportion of people clicking is low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's two sides to that story. We deal with that all the time, too. You want to accurately  report how many impressions an ad is going to get on your platform. And you get paid by the  impression, right? But they also look at how efficient-  Return on investment. So if your ads are too expensive, regardless, they're going to say,  well, it costs too much to get too little result. So I guess it's true, there is some incentive  to not make that number too high, but there's also incentive to make it higher,  because you make more money. So you want to find the highest number you can get  that will not be so high that they say, well, this isn't working.  Honestly, the best thing to do would be to say the actual number, but who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The actual number, which is what Mike says they're actually trying to do and have a methodology.  He says Musk confuses-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And all Perry has done is explain that.  Exactly.  Musk confuses the total number of spam bots on the platform with the numbers Twitter's giving  after in its MDOW report, which is what-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what Twitter has warranted is that we've done this. So what- And I lose Mike's logic  a little bit here, but what he emphasizes is that what Mudge says backs up Musk actually backs up  Twitter's case. And so he's just saying- And Mike being Mike, bless his heart, gets just outraged  at the media coverage because they just gobble up the Musk line on this and don't question it  and don't analyze it.  Yeah, they're not that subtle. They don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not educated on this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And Mike is-  Who would expect them to be?  And we try to be educated and certainly educate our audience on this. Remember, for the most part,  companies don't report anything. MDOW is something Twitter made up. They report monthly active users,  MAU, M-A-U, and MDOW or daily active users, MDOW, is monetizable users. In other words,  a different number, lower number that reflects the actual users that are seeing your ad that  could buy your product. In fact, Mudge says this in his complaint until 2019, Twitter reported  total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a  variety of reasons, including-  Like when they got rid of a bunch of bad accounts.  Yeah.  Yeah. Instead, Twitter announced a new proprietary opaque metric they called  monetizable daily active users, defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and  actually buy a product. Yeah, I understand why Twitter would do that. And as long as advertisers  accept it, that's fine. There's no legal requirement to use monthly active users instead of daily  monetizable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think Musk is trying to say that Twitter is defrauding people there and without the evidence,  and in fact, what's happening is Twitter is saying, no, this is our methodology. We've explained  this to you many, many times, and you're choosing to be confused. And now you're using Mudge to try  to enhance that confusion. But I think when it gets into court, that's not going to stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is also irrelevant to the case.  There's a few possibilities here. One is that Mudge is absolutely up forthright, honest, and is  doing the right thing and is telling the world what Twitter's really up to and that they're not  secure and they're just pretending to be. There's also the opposite, which is that he's a disgruntled  employee because he was fired six months ago and perhaps suborned by Elon Musk who thought, ah,  here's somebody I can use as a witness in my trial, or perhaps just motivated by other reasons and  isn't telling the truth. And the truth is, I don't know and I don't think anybody knows.  Just because he says it's so doesn't mean it's so, is I guess what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I say he has a documented history at Twitter of being  outspoken about security risks. And some of them are very real, like access to the servers,  or not having running unpatched versions of Linux on the servers, having employees have access to  account credentialing stuff that they shouldn't after the hack. All of that is very real. And I  can see if you are a security person. Is it real? Do we know it's real?  Okay. If that is the case, then that makes sense. We don't know it's real. It's probably verifiable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In other words, in an investigation, we could probably find that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if you say that, if it were true, the Twitter was kind of screwed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. Yeah. So hold up though. If you're a security person and there's a very  real persona that goes into security, and you feel aggrieved, and then you're also going up  against management who has no interest in listening or updating things that don't feel like... Remember,  they're in crisis. Six months ago, they were still in some sort of like, how are we going to make  money? What are we going to do? So having some security guy come up, guys, guys, we have to do  this. I can see why he got fired. I can also see how he is still a person who desperately cares  about the security of something that journalists, activists, et cetera, use every day to try to  influence people. That's scary. So you think him being fired was justifiable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because he raised awareness or attempted to raise awareness?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not justifiable, but understandable. I think he was probably, yeah, not diplomatic.  And I say this because I talk to lots of security people who probably, out of all the security  researchers that I talk to, and I do talk to a lot, half of them have left a job because they  were frustrated with the way management treated their recommendations. So not everybody goes and  becomes a whistleblower, but a lot of management and a lot of companies takes what security...  They should. I mean, security folks are focused on security. Management's focused on security,  profits, roadmaps and everything else. But the security persona is like the superhero.  And when the superhero is like, I will save the day, and they're like, no, thank you.  Then they're like, oh, you are wrong and evil. I will leave. But a lot of these people do leave.  It's not that uncommon to see. I mean, it's a common...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's going to be a little dogmatic, right, Stacey? This is the right way. And when it's not,  they're offended and maybe they should be, but it's hard to compare all... I mean,  it's true in any field, right? Teachers will get mad when people don't respect our  scholarship time. Journalists get mad when somebody doesn't understand how hard the job is. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we're all in our blinders. I mean, given where he's worked, I have no reason to believe that  Zacho is anything but an honorable and talented person. But there are questions. Why did he wait  so long to file this complaint? He was fired in January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe he was spooked by Elon. I mean, think about it this way. He wasn't secretive,  according to all the reporting inside Twitter. He wasn't secretive about the issues he had with  management's response to his recommendations. So it could be that Musk was like,  let's call this guy. Let's see what happens. And maybe Mudge was like, oh crap, I don't want to be  a behind the scenes influence kind of thing. So he just brought everything into the open.  Or another theory.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Another theory is Jack brings in this guy, the guy messes everything up. Parag, who is a technology  guy, said he's not helping. He's full of crap. You're out of here now that I'm the boss. You  don't know the dynamics of the organization and you have a technology boss in Agarwal.  I think that matters in this interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he's also calling Agarwal's baby ugly. I mean, if you built the technology infrastructure  in this country.  Yeah. Good point, Stacey. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I swear. This didn't turn into another episode of Die Hard because that's where it sounds just  like one of those movies. The one with the team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When CNN, when Donnie was a great Irish accent, Donnie O'Sullivan on CNN asked him,  why did it take you so long? He said, this wasn't my first choice. This wasn't the path I wanted to  take. I exhausted all internal options. That could explain the six months. He tried to get it fixed.  He tried to do it right. He finally got frustrated and said, look, I got to go public because  Twitter's not going to fix this. My only caution, it's just my instinct is, all right,  let's not necessarily accept this on its face.  I think you're right now.  I want to see what the results of investigation are. It is, you're right, Jeff, completely  believable. It's not incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But let's also not think this is going to have necessarily a legal impact on the case that  everybody's talking about. No, but it could have a very big legal impact on Twitter because remember,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they have an FTC consent decree not to lie about this stuff. By the way, that's where  Zacho could make some money because he would get a percentage of any judgment against Twitter  as a reward for being a whistleblower. So if you're asking what's his incentive,  well, it could be because he's a true believer, but there might be money in it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think I've asked this before, but could Twitter come after Musk later for defamation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can sue anybody for anything, my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard for a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but the voting booth companies are doing that after Fox, so yes, they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this is just the first salvo in what could be a very long war.  Oh, long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's caught in the jaws here.  So I like Twitter. I just like Twitter. It's just a fun little place where we can talk and say silly  things. Well, there's another question. Does any of this matter and why does it matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's a publicly traded company. I mean, given that Twitter,  tweets can move markets. Tweets can move markets. So there's a financial incentive to be like, hey,  we need to lock this down. It also, I mean, if we look at January 6, you could say that tweets also  can incite political action, violence. How do we want to call that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So your argument is that Twitter is central to conversation in the public square and so it needs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to be secure, reliable, authentic. We count on it to be that.  I would argue that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's also remember back to the days of the fail whale.  Yeah, I mean, it's a lot better than it used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not convinced that, I mean, I guess, I mean, I can't deny it,  Stacey, that Twitter does have that impact. You're absolutely right. To me, though,  I still see it's kind of as a more frivolous place where people just throw crap out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It didn't. No, but there were like the Saudi spies who got a job at Twitter and had access,  back end access to accounts from activists and then I don't know if they murdered people  or what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, well, they revealed things back and they just got found guilty. One thing that Mudge  points out too is that the company kind of was forced by the Indian government and what some  say is the dusk of their democracy to hire certain people at Twitter and India has been  going after Twitter as well, trying to cut political dissension. They're stuck in a lot of  vices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I'm conditioned because I've been on Twitter since, you know, I remember the horse.  You were the most popular person.  Horse ebooks. Yeah, I remember when I was the, you know, so Twitter has always been kind of  more of a playground for me than the place where the national dialogue happens. In fact,  I often think that giving too much importance to tweets, even from former presidents, is a mistake  because they're just tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you sound like somebody who is ignoring the reality of like, well, just because I think  television was a silly place for Westerns and soap sponsored daytime television, it doesn't have an  influence on the discourse. But that's not true. I mean, Twitter today is not what it was when we  joined in like 08 or 07.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey playing Newton Minow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Former FCC chairman and the guy who said TV was a wasteland, a vast wasteland.  He was born in 1926.  So he's only 10 years older than me and Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You say my father had me when he was 10?  No, I'm kidding. Just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was chairman of the FCC in 1961.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, this was the, this was the, this was the dawn of, this was the same, Stacey, this was when TV  was in its infant age, just like the internet is now. So he came along and said, it's all screwing  up and screwing up the world. And everybody listened. He is still alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Said TV was awful.  He's 96. He was JFK's chairman of the FCC.  Still alive?  He's still alive. Barack Obama gave him the, say it like that.  Well, he's 96.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  His kid came after me because I dared criticize that speech on Twitter and the kid went after me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was a little late to criticize that speech. That was a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm a busy guy, Leo. It takes me a while to get to things.  He gave the speech in 1961.  I'm about to start tweeting 1968.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  50 years later, Jeff Jarvis noticed and tweeted about it.  Anyway, he won the presidential medal of freedom was given to him by Barack Obama in 2016.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So he is actually might be interested in reading the speech, Stacey. It's a very famous speech.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm familiar with the quote, so I will go check out the speech.  Yeah.  Just like, Oh man.  All right. You're like Newt Minow.  Yeah, you're very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Newton Minow invitation. I might add Stacey, you could make a road show out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excellent. Me and a 96 year old man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Stacey Hickenbotham as Newt Minow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am serious though in the question of how much import we give Twitter.  It's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it doesn't have to be important. Is it okay if people use it differently than it's intended?  No, no.  Does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's only important. Well, because if the FTC and the SEC are getting involved in investigation  over whether there are spam bots on this platform or an investigation over whether it's truly secure,  it's kind of acting like, well, it's really important that it, I mean, people are using  pseudonyms. You don't know whose people's real identities are.  Which is okay.  It's fine.  Part of the rules set.  But you wouldn't say that on the nation's paper of record, the New York Times.  That's the point. It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why it's dangerous to call the internet a medium. Exactly that.  Because the presumptions that come with that.  But that's my question.  Become too limiting to freedom of speech.  I understand. No, no, no.  Yes, I agree.  That's my question. Is Twitter...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  I don't think it rises to that level of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if it doesn't have to be as credible as the New York Times?  No, but then it doesn't have to be as perfect with its spam bots and its security either.  Okay. But then the argument there is, should Mudge have blown the whistle on this private company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he should have. It's a public company and he should have.  If what he says is true.  And I think what we have to do is wait and see what the investigations prove from the SEC and the FTC.  Yeah, but you still have to report that somebody has done this.  Yeah, yeah. Guess what?  We're doing that.  That's what we're doing.  Absolutely. But I do think that the response does matter depending on how important you think  Twitter is to the national conversation and its role in the national conversation.  It sounds like, Stacey, you think it is as important as a major journal of facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's...  It's opinion.  I think it's important less because of the newspaper thing and more because people treat  it like a secure infrastructure, kind of like you might...  Well, you shouldn't, I think.  A self...  That's an outdated...  You shouldn't. But people are holding private conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll give it as much credence as the Wall Street Journal opinion page. How about that?  Oh my God.  Oh, you're being harsh.  Wait, no, it's kind of like that. It's just an opinion page for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think as long as there's still timestamps, it's important enough. Because it has timestamps,  it's important enough. There's a record of it and it's not necessarily...  But people don't treat it that way. That's part of the problem with Twitter.  We have a record of you typing this out and hitting enter and it went to these servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. But that's part of the problem, Ant, is that people act as if it's the water cooler,  but structure acts as if this is government documents, stamped and signed to the...  Which we don't care about either, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, those are the library tweets, they're in the Library of Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But so is All in the Family, right? It's there as a cultural phenomenon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey, do you know what All in the Family is? I'm just checking that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the racist TV show, right?  Archie Bunker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the racist character on a show that taught America how racist we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Archie Bunker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Olivia Wilde and Harry Styles share a deep love?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, this is why Twitter is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why Twitter is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trending story, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, I got a dumb question for you, a really dumb question for you.  On my Twitter homepage, I don't see trending.  Where do I get trending?  It's on the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the right-hand corner.  Do you don't have a what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't have that?  I don't have trending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's what's happening.  They added in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have what's happening on yours, Mr. Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This used to be called trending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It used to be trending.  Well, it used to be simpler.  It used to be just be the topics.  Oh, I see.  Look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, look underneath what's happening, some are slugged news and some are slug trending.  But Olivia Wilde breaking your silence on Harry Styles is neither.  So it's neither news nor trending.  This is true.  And some are sponsored.  That's my biggest complaint about Twitter now is...  And it seems to be only on the mobile.  They got to make their cash.  Otherwise, is it time for your commercial?  Yeah, we got to do that.  It's only...  I've decided I can't read Twitter on mobile anymore or I'll have to use a third party app  because...  And the way they do it, promoted is the last thing in the tweet.  So you start reading a tweet thinking it's a real tweet.  And it's by the way, like on mobile, it's like every fourth tweet.  And then you get, oh, they bit...  But you can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Once a month I get fooled.  But most times I can tell right off the bat that it's fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really bad on mobile.  I tend to just use list and notifications on mobile.  I don't even bother just going to my feed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That bogs me because you don't know it's promoted.  I get fooled a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like mine are so ridiculous that I'm like...  So let me just...  Here's my mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Mike Masnick, the first tweet, then Louisa, real tweet.  President Biden, I think he's real.  Wett Moser, Laurie Garrett, all real people.  And then underdog fantasy, which by the way, blue check.  What would you do if you won $2 million from a fantasy football draft entered today?  Promoted.  Promoted.  It's just like tabula and outbreak on every news site in America.  Promoted.  Yeah.  I guess I should have known that one was promoted.  Let's go.  Sherlyn Ifill, weather channel.  Oh, promoted.  Promoted.  Promoted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wall Street Journal wastes their money promoting to me, man.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They spend so much money sending me stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you don't see this on the...  This is what puzzles me.  You don't see it on the website.  Nope.  I see it on the website.  At least not as often.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Here we go.  Wall Street Journal is promoting...  Oh, UPS Business is promoting a Wall Street Journal story.  Oh, maybe because I'm blue.  No, you're blue.  Data stacks.  Boing, boing.  Kevin Beaumont, real person.  Apple promoted tweet.  So every four or five tweets on the website, I'm getting promoted stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't have the same frequency.  Leo's right.  I got a higher frequency in that.  I don't see any promoted ones.  Am I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, that was five and then promoted.  Then I've got six promoted.  And this is a Doritos channel.  Are you on your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is on your computer?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is about every five for me on the web.  Why are you 12 for me?  Oh, I'm looking at latest tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you not looking at...  That's why.  If I look go back home, maybe it's go back home.  Federman, Aaron Rupar, Massaman.  No, I don't have any promoted tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I just switched to latest Leo and I get promoted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Am I just lucky?  Because it's terrible on mobile.  This is way better than what I see on my phone.  I have not yet...  None of these is promoted yet.  These are all real and good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They know you're worthless to the advertiser.  I am a bot.  I am a bot.  Must be the bot.  You are not an emdow.  You're not monetizable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not counting...  Seriously, I've yet to see a promoted tweet.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've seen like eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah, it's about every five or six for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait.  What browser are you using?  Does that have an impact?  Oh.  Is it cutting them out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm in Braves.  That's what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have Firefox with the UBlock Origin.  It's blocking them.  That's pretty sophisticated.  I'm surprised UBlock Origin is smart enough to know...  Well, it says promoted.  Well, that's hard to do.  Usually they do it by a web IP address or something.  Oh, that's good.  Okay, that's what it is.  Oh, good.  Thank you.  So you're robbing Twitter.  Or Twitter can't make money because of you.  I give them three bucks a month.  I give them my blue.  Are you still in $3?  Yeah, I'm still at $3.  They raised me.  I haven't gone back since this went up.  You got it because you quit and then you came back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't quit.  My cards expired.  Or whatever.  At the time of a year.  It's the same thing.  I'm still battling that.  I keep getting notifications.  So, oh yeah, we need to update your card.  I'm like, that's another one because I use so many burner cards.  All right.  I'm sorry.  This is really boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of my favorite new Twitter accounts is Random Restaurant.  Underscore Restaurant, underscore bot.  And it really is random.  Sometimes they're Pizza Hut's.  Sometimes they're fancy restaurants.  All around the world.  Four pictures per random restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think that would be good for Twitter to force everybody  that's a bot to have bot at the end of the name?  No, good bots are more useful.  Yeah, but that's okay.  Then I would still know it's a bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got the murder bot.  Maybe a different word than bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never see, but all I ever see is the actual name name.  Random Restaurant.  You really have to look to see.  Why do I want to follow this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do I want to see random tweets from restaurants that I don't know?  I think sometimes you get a good looking restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He loves the quirkiness of the internet.  Just don't look at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clearly.  And he loves to take talk.  Unfollowing.  It's going to irritate you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you're going to talk to Jeff about how it's your journey.  I do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm unfollowing right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then we're going to have to hear Jeff talk about the virtues of quirkiness.  Although I do follow cats with jobs.  So I'm kind of with Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  What's that?  Cats with jobs?  Yeah.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cats with jobs.  Is that related to Bodega cats?  No, it's at cat workers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lisa got a new Twitter account for you to follow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel so boring.  You need to.  I don't follow anything like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's good.  Oh, keep going.  The next one's good.  Keep going.  There.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cat with jobs is adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cat and the money.  Let's make it rain kitty cat.  Oh my God.  Okay.  You're right.  I'm following this one.  See, this is much better than random restaurant tweets.  Hey.  Yes.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a podcast one.  Did you get the one with the cat with the mic?  Cat with the mic?  Yeah, keep going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, keep going down.  Chloe and Ian.  You tried it.  I just want to thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went too far.  I went to the end of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've come to the end of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Podcasting cat.  There's a podcasting cat there.  Podcasting cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, podcast cat.  Hello, podcast cat.  Podcast.  He's wearing a bow tie.  I used to wear bow ties.  That's a little very dorky of them.  Actually, clearly Annie Leibowitz did not take this picture.  Let's talk about this because I don't even know about this story and y'all are getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  me all excited about this.  Let me take a break and then we'll come back and tell you why Annie Leibowitz, who is widely

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  considered to be the greatest portrait photographer of all time, sucks.  But first...  Wow.  Am I right?  Am I right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ant Brood's going to explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ant Brood's going to use bad words.  He used bad words before the show.  He's so incensed by this.  I love these guys.

And I never even imagined there was a problem until I read an article about the latest Annie  Leibowitz photo essay in Vogue.  She did pictures of the new Supreme Court Justice and Katanji Brown and apparently  didn't do a good job.  What's the story?  Sorry, I was on mute.  It's okay.  You can swear publicly.  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she was nabbed for the job to capture beautiful images of our latest Supreme Court  Justice who just made that history because she's a great portrait photographer.  However, apparently she's not that good at shooting portraits of people of color.  Folks in general.  We've talked about this on the show in the past about Google's technology, especially  with the pixels.  These are awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are the receipts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's two problems here.  One is pointed out in this article in The Guardian, which I thought was really good.  Let me give her credit by Tayo Barrow, which is the content.  She chose to take pictures of Justice Brown Jackson at the Lincoln Memorial.  I understand when she says, oh, yeah, you see what the problem is here?  It's the white savior complex all over again.  She's at the foot of Abe Lincoln.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Abe is lit brilliantly and she is seen only in the shadows.  In the shadows.  Right.  Maybe it's his clothes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His style is very high contrast.  A lot of them are black and white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fine.  That's great.  It's moody.  I get that.  But go back to that first image there.  It's pretty dark.  We're looking at this frame.  We have the Lincoln Memorial back there in the background, which has its own set of lighting  already hitting it.  So it's going to show up.  I know Miss Annie has her own light kit.  She could have put one little dag gum light even at the foot of our new Supreme Court  Justice there just to light her up because she's in a dark overcoat, a dark shirt.  She's in the dag gum shadows.  Show her as the subject here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and the expression is not exactly regal.  If you look at this picture, you don't get an image of a proud Supreme Court Justice  representing the first black woman on the Supreme Court, somebody with power and dignity.  You get a completely different impression.  Yeah.  So I agree.  Maybe is it possible this is unprocessed?  This isn't what's going to show up in the magazine.  This is a leaked...  Well, no.  It was leaked by her.  It was Annie Leibovitz.  Oh, it's from Annie.  This is from Annie Leibovitz's Twitter account.  Oh, never mind.  Okay.  So she's just the framing of that portrait.  She's proud of this work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you mentioned the processing on that.  She has a team of post-processors.  Somebody looked at this beyond her.  There was several eyes that looked at this.  And then it went to the approval staff at Vanity or whoever it is.  Vogue.  I mean Vogue.  At Vogue.  And they approved it too.  So I'm like, who the hell...  Who thought this was okay to put this historic person in the shadows of this photograph and say,  hey, this is just beautiful.  This is what we want to promote.  This is how we want to promote this historic event in our country.  By putting this black woman in the shadows at the foot of a white statue.  I didn't like that one bit, especially when I know her work is beautiful.  She shoots a lot of other athletes and a lot of other actors, actresses, celebrities,  or what have you.  And their images come out just outstanding.  I love her work.  I freaking pay for the master class subscription specifically to watch her photography class.  Here's another image.  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of hers from Vogue of another African American, sorry, black actress, which is fine, I think.  Do you not?  So it feels like she didn't do justice to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, yeah, that one's better than some of the other things, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's also, if you go down, there's also photos of the cover she shot of Simone Biles and Viola Davis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another mistake, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  Yes.  You know, it...  Is she...  That tweet was the...  Do you think she's racist?  I'm not going to say she's racist.  I'm saying that she can do better.  She's a brilliant photographer.  She can do better than what she did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, Google was spending a lot more effort to show people of color well.  Right.  She was part of their campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a picture of John Favreau and Yoda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yoda's much better lit than the white guy.  Maybe...  Okay, that saves her.  Maybe she's got a thing for green guys.  Sure.  I don't know.  Right?  Sure.  But dude...  It's not...  So you're not accusing her of racism as much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not going to accuse her of racism.  I'm saying I know she's a much better photographer than that.  It's a beautiful cover.  That's great.  But Viola Davis and Simone Biles, those are really, really bad images.  Yeah.  Could be so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're hearing from a photographer who knows how it should be done.  That's the important part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to that tweet of hers where she's showing off the pictures of the Supreme Court  Justice, the portrait shot where it's up close, even that one, it's as easy as just doing a  simple filter on her just to bring the light up on her.  Because you can tell she does have a light in this image because there's a soft shadow  going right down the bridge of her nose.  So she does have a light over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She chose to make it moody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's going moody.  We know that a lot of film is...  The chemistry is designed to look good for white people and does not look good for black people.  This is a historical problem.  This is what Google was talking about in their recent campaign for the Pixel 6 images,  getting skin tone right.  Maybe Annie's just using the wrong film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't get it.  My problem is she's not the only person to saw that image.  It went through a bunch of levels of approvals.  If you do a search, there's so many articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Annie Leibowitz photos blasted.  Yet again, she can't photograph black women.  That's from Digital Camera World.  Boing, boing.  Yahoo!  And you said a PetaPixel had a...  PetaPixel is where I first saw the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Vox had a big piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Vox's headline representation is deeper than putting black icons on magazine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know who I fault more is Vogue and the editorial team at Vogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, they had the last word to say, okay, print it and publish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, in this case, I don't know.  In terms of what she's sending out, she is such...  I mean, yes, in every case of every photographer,  it's the photo editors who do the final selects.  I've been there.  But in the case of Annie Leibowitz, she might have more power than that.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She might have some pull.  She may have some clout, but damn it.  But you're right.  This picture doesn't look good, Miss Annie.  I mean, you have her at the foot of this dude in the dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's Google's opportunity.  Send her a Pixel 6 and say...  She'll start using a Pixel.  Annie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I put a link in the chat where she was part of the Pixel campaign.  And I remember us bringing this up like, wow, she's promoting a camera.  I said specifically, look, this camera is going to be quite nice,  but understand that she's a professional  and she's going to understand how to use the tool.  She even has a dad gum case on the phone  where she's not really holding the phone.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  She knows what she's doing.  Well, the fact that she tweeted that pretty bad image is a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unaware.  That's the issue, I think, in the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People can say style and the style...  I get the high contrast moody style.  I'm totally fine with that.  But at the same time, if someone's going to take a portrait of me  for the cover of some monumental event,  I'd like for my face to be visible and not necessarily have my face in the shadows.  She can do it.  I mean, I'm looking at her Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a picture of Olivier Roustang.  Looks great.  That looks good.  Beautiful.  So she knows how to do it.  And she takes pictures of a lot of black folk.  It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's outside in natural light.  It's really hard to screw that one up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think she did Darth Vader a real disservice in this shot here.  It really is awfully dark.  Look how bright his laser is compared to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just being silly here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think she's overrated.  I like her a lot.  Obviously you do too.  You took her master class.  I do.  That's why he's all the more disappointed.  Here's Amanda Gorman.  Here's on the covers for Amanda Gorman, which I think is beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, Vogue.  So who approved that one?  Because that one looks great.  She's lit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's lit.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think it was more an odd choice to do it at the Lincoln Memorial  and to do it at the foot of Abe with that expression  of uncertainty.  It was an interesting choice.  I haven't heard anything...  It's a beautiful picture.  It's not a great portrait.  I think it's a good picture.  It's not a great portrait.  I don't even think it's a good picture.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, when I look at this picture, I don't know who I'm looking at.  There's nothing guiding Mike.  My eye is directed at Lincoln.  Thank you.  And he's not in the right spot.  So it's confusing because he's not in the right...  Between her gaze and Lincoln is where the focal point of the photo should be.  And nothing's there.  And so they're fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's not a great picture.  I love how she just broke that down.  Yeah.  Really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, would you like to be on Hands-On Photography this week?  No, thank you.  This is going to be the topic discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am the what not to do on Hands-On Photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You already got a job because tomorrow morning you and I are going to be doing Clara and the Son.  That is true.  I'm embarrassed to say I have three or four hours still to go in the book.  What?  You're bearing through this.  And they're the best three or four hours.  It's such a good book.  2.0 speed.  You're going to feel feelings, Leo.  It's very interesting because it's about...  First of all, the author, Nobel Prize winner Ishiguro, wrote Remains of the Day, which is an  amazing book.  This is a science fiction novel, which he doesn't, I think, normally write about  artificial intelligence.  These are artificial friends, little robot playmates for children.  And Clara is one.  And it's told from her point of view, which makes it very interesting.  It's also just a good story, I think.  I'm really enjoying it.  I really like it.  So tomorrow, 9 a.m. for you Club Twit members, we're going to get up early.  Stacey and Ant and I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not early.  So early.  Both Ant and I will have been up for a couple hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's Leo's day off.  I'm going to brush my hair this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Still not early, even if it's your day off.  Good grief.  Do you remember how I looked last time?  The chickens had been up for four hours, man.  What are you waiting on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, if you're like me, you can also listen to it on demand on the Twit Plus feed.  If you're not a Club Twit member, this is a good reason to join because we don't make  this one public.  Like Hands on Mac, Hands on Windows, The Ultimate Linux Show.  It's one of the shows we do because the club supports it.  Untitled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Untitled Linux Show.  What did I call it?  You call it The Ultimate.  It's The Untitled.  It is The Ultimate Untitled Linux Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're not a member, seven bucks a month, ad free versions of all the shows, these extra  shows plus I think the best darn Discord ever.  Clearly.  Twit.tv slash Club Twit.  And that's the community manager, so he's a little biased, but I am too.  It's really good.  Twit.tv slash Club Twit.  You know what Discord I am now in?  Mid Journey.  Do you know about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was on that for a little while and then I popped out.  I got sick of all of the notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all know about Dolly too.  There's a good article comparing these AI generated images from, and this is PetaPixel,  from Dolly to stable diffusion and the one we were just talking about, which is actually  in a Discord server, Mid Journey.  All three work the same way.  You give them a text description of an image.  They generate an image.  Matt Grokut, who wrote this for PetaPixel, did a great job.  Actually, he's writing up Fabian Stelzer's research where Stelzer put together images.  It's actually, we should go to Stelzer's Twitter thread, where he put together images  with the same prompt from all three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So smart.  It's pretty awesome.  Pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is really interesting.  Film still, portrait of an old man, wrinkles, dignified look, gray silver hair,  peculiar nose.  I'm surprised they didn't get me.  Wise, eternal wisdom and beauty.  Oh, I see why.  Incredible lighting and camera work, depth of field, bokeh, screenshot from Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See how Dolly could do with our Supreme Court justice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't this the differences here?  Who do you think did the better job?  Or it's not even a question of better.  It's all about taste.  That's the point.  I think Dolly's is the most, like it could be real.  Well, so could stable diffusion.  Mid Journey looks like some cartoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mid Journey looks like a hobbit.  Creativity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So here's a Beatles Lego set, catalog photograph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I tried to get Dolly, I finally got in to the beta.  Yeah.  And for my book, I thought maybe I can get a book cover out of this.  Gutenberg parenthesis, you think you can figure it out?  It just completely befuddled it.  Pretty impressive.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about this one?  A human anatomical heart made of flowers, pastel, matte masterpiece.  Now this one, I love Mid Journeys.  Oh, I love it.  That's the creepy line.  Oh, you think that's creepy?  Oh, I love it.  Which do you like, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well,  Dolly 2.  No, I'm like, stable diffusion is the silliest.  I like Dolly 2 because Mid Journey is prettier and it's more high contrast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like real art to me.  That looks like you would see that in a museum.  What is art, Leo?  I don't know.  What is art?  Behind the scenes shooting of the moon landing Hollywood Studio 1969.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stable diffusion looks closer to all the existing moon photos.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mid Journey looks like a video game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have this.  Should we just do one?  Yeah, go ahead.  Let's just do it.  I'll go into the newbies room.  Mid Journey, use free to try for a certain number of images and then you can pay for it.  Here's somebody's Spider-Man with wings and a suit of armor standing above his city  skyline.  Is there, think of, Guy, you think of some phrase that I could type in here.  It takes about a minute.  So we'll have to do something else while we're...  Who?  You can be the podcast legend.  The Twitter account I was just on is Fabians.Eath.  I'm sorry, at Fabian Stelzer.  S-T-E-L-Z-E-R.  And he's the one who did all of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Podcast legend having lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good.  I like it.  Podcast legend having lunch.  Do you think it does better if you have a name or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.  All right.  No, I didn't have any names in the other ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do it in Dali if you would, Jeff, and then we can...  Oh, I got to get into it.  Oh, I'm done.  Now I'm waiting so it's going to be a while because I think it has to chew on it for a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, what I notice is that Mid Journey tends to have a bit of a cinematic feel to it.  You get a lot of the blue and teal look and then it has a bit of...  It's more moody.  Most of them seem to have like this soft Gaussian blur on them too.  But again, it just sort of looks like paintings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a photorealistic potato river.  Here's a...  Oh, for you, Kevin King, a megalodon breaking the surface of a huge wave chasing an orca.  Okay, what do you want me to say again?  What do we say?  Podcast...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll never forget...  I don't want to say this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was talking to Lisa Kearney here recently.  She's been on my show a time or two.  She's a photo finisher where basically she takes a lot of the images  that you see on ABC, Netflix, all the popular TV shows and movies,  and she puts their art together.  Really, really, really talented.  It's pretty funny.  She talked about this mid-journey and she feared for some of the creators like you did,  Mr. LaPorte saying that, you know what, people are going to lose jobs because now  a marketing department can just put in these prompts and get what they want out of it.  Conversely, she said, you know what, but I'm going to be fine because I'm a finisher.  I'm like, yeah, you're definitely going to be fine because you can go in and totally  redefine the stuff that came out of the prompts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just put it in the Discord.  You did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's so good to see.  Oh, I'm not in that server anymore.  I left the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, if I do this, I will...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty good.  It was at a style or just in general?  I do style.  His lunch is hot dogs and potatoes.  How come we're all bald?  Did you say bald?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we said legend.  Legend.  I guess that implies old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what I got when I said Gutenberg parenthesis.  Okay, not good.  Not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  So it looks like...  I don't know what it looks like.  Oh, here it is.  It popped up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, podcast legend having lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's still working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's updating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, there's your thumbnail.  That's awesome.  I think that's art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Podcast legend having lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There it is.  Have hair, headphones on.  I'm definitely a podcast legend having lunch.  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where'd it go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I lost it.  I lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, podcast.  So people, it looks like you can also refine it.  Like you go that and then do more with that kind of.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where'd it go?  Shoot.  Shooty, shoot, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stan Lee in heaven.  There's the too easy.  There's a lot of the...  Oh, here it is.  Okay.  So now what happens?  What do these do?  You won you to you three you four.  So I'm thinking maybe that's you too.  Redo you for I don't know what these do.  Maybe if I read the instructions.  Okay, the Bible send you four images.  Click the number buttons underneath to get upscales or variations.  Oh, okay.  So, oh, and then it probably doesn't do them in place.  There's Stan Lee in heaven.  Oh, your job will start.  Oh, so I gave it a bunch of jobs at once.  Oh crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, whoops.  Clicking all those things.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are angry with you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I might have used up my free trial.  Okay, here's another podcast legend having lunch.  That's all about the lunch.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Job finished.  See the results.  It just improved the lunch.  I asked it.  So I told it to improve specifically one of those images which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did that just say Chad Wood Boseman is a white dude?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, just Chad Wood Boseman, which is weird, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very weird.  Doesn't look like him at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  See, I think you're better off not...  Oh, here it is.  Oh, even better.  Yeah.  My God, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at this one.  It looks like me and Joe Rogan having lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's hysterical.  Podcast legend having a lunch.  I'm going to frame this.  That's a good one.  That's freaking awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, print that out.  That's...  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Save that to my camera roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Print that out.  That's a good one.  Wow.  I have to go in and play with it at some time.  I haven't had any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to play with it some more.  Yeah.  Here's...  Oh, that's good too.  Oh, we're still bringing them.  Well, I clicked it 20 times.  Oh, right, right.  Podcast legend having lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like those as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Wowie, wowie.  Oh, we really did a lot of lunches.  See, no headphones on those.  More Chadwicks.  Here's a long spear killer hunter whale.  Japanese demons in the forest.  That's cool.  Here's another podcast legend having lunch.  I think this is what I'm going to look like.  The sunset.  Yeah.  Dude.  Dude, these are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the play.  I'm impressed with this.  It's free, although I'm going to pay for it because I want to do more.  More, more, more.  I'm going to use these podcast legends having lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at this one.  You have new avatars now for your socials.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is just awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Yes.  Right.  So go back and say that's what the upscale is.  And which one should I upscale?  The two?  One, two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I count like three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one before that one.  Was it just food?  Oh, the other one.  It was the images before.  The one that looked like you speaking with somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I loved that.  That Joe Rogan one.  That one looked really good.  Yeah.  That was really good.  Yeah.  Let's do that.  That's three.  You three upscale.  Your job will surely.  So you can do 8K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an AI for you.  That's an AI in a nutshell, right?  He's like he's the lunch is his necktie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just a beautiful work of art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's almost done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's badass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is called Mid Journey and it's really you can actually sign up instantly  and it's just a Discord channel.  Oh, my God.  This is still working.  Fifty five percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See that almost look like Doc Searls, too.  It does.  I should send it to Doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Podfather Hector Salamanca.  It's Lala.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's not taking very long either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, these are working really fast considering there's also lots of other people using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ninety four percent.  Almost done.  Wow.  Wow.  I think these are beautiful, don't you?  I mean, they feel like they're good.  They're art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are very nice.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at these.  It's there's something going on.  It's little it's little brain.  Oh, here you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  We wow.  We I've got a poppy on for some reason.  Oh, it's getting getting sexy there.  And this is the this is the other fully upscaled one.  Which I think this is a painting.  Yeah, that's a freaking print right there.  Oh, unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  All right.  I feel bad for people who are only listening because here's Casey Newton's piece.  Oh, it's a great piece.  His his first week.  Yeah, it's quite good.  What do you think, Stacey?  You you cover AI.  We're going to talk about Claire and the sun.  What's the meaning of all this?  Is it just a toy or is there going to be some longer term impact?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so I don't know if AI has its own meaning.  We're going to give it meaning and we use it as a tool.  But if you look at the way Silicon Valley is pushing AI,  they're pushing AI to do things that people used to do better.  Right.  Or people used to what is this cinnamon rolls with boobs?  It's no no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Googly eyes.  Geez.  Your mind stays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only prompt is manager cinnamon rolls.  And for some reason, Dolly likes to add googly eyes to things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I like to add googly eyes to things.  Anyway, I think I mean, again, it's a tool.  And right now, all the all the use cases we're seeing getting funding and getting a lot of  attention has been around taking people out of the equation.  So you look at Amazon Go.  I just read a hotel about a hotel in New Orleans that was fully automated.  And part of me is like, I don't think this is I don't think this is smart,  because once you automate things, we've already seen how terribly things can go wrong.  Actually, there's a story this week that we're going to talk about Google,  not having people in the mix and the ability to call and communicate with people that causes  problems.  Yeah, we're going to see that whole thing when you start giving AI the ability,  replacing humans with AI and giving them the ability to like,  check you into a hotel or check you out or fire people or hire people.  What you're seeing is people A will adapt to game the system and B people who get caught  in the system or the system doesn't serve them.  They're not going to have a recourse and that's going to be a problem.  So I think that's where we're heading.  But I think it's a dumb way to go.  And we're going to hit a wall at some point very soon.  But why do some managers argue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What some managers argue that having this AI in place can create other higher level,  higher, they do, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  But we don't actually, I don't think that's what they argue.  I don't think that's actually what happens because it doesn't create higher level jobs.  It creates really bad, boring jobs for people.  So like, you'll have people who are doing high level thinking and those were not the people  like who were doing those other jobs necessarily.  But then you'll have people like you or me becoming photo editors for like Dali instead  of working with people.  So all the fun parts of our job, like working with other creatives,  gets sucked away and we're just entering stuff into a computer and generating images.  And then we're the human in that equation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're also seeing creativity that we haven't seen.  Kevin Roos, I just put it in line 85, Leo, did a good piece.  I think a very reasoned piece.  We need to talk about how good AI is getting.  With my Martian antennae app, I was thinking, uh-oh, more panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of the question I was asking too because it's getting good.  It's getting good.  GPT-3 is good enough to write sports stories.  He wrote a book review with it.  Yeah, he wrote a book review.  On GPT-3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But he also says at the end, and this is what makes me happy, Roos said at the end,  I don't know where to go.  Sorry.  News media need to do a better job of explaining AI progress to non-experts.  Too often journalists that he admits himself here rely on outdated sci-fi shorthand to  translate what's happening in AI to a general audience.  We sometimes compare large language models to Skynet and HAL 9000 and flatten promising  machine learning breakthroughs to Paniky.  The robots are coming to headlines.  So I'm really glad he had that perspective here.  Is that exactly what you're saying?  Is that the opportunities are great.  Yes, there's issues that Stacey will remind us we need to talk about.  But wow, it's getting pretty good, pretty fast.  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is, though, a critical point, the singularity, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but I'm just going to I'm like, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right now, you look at yourself your whole right now you look at this stuff and in almost  every case you can say, yeah, that's an AI.  Certainly, occasionally something will come up and that's really good like that heart.  That could have could have been a human that did it.  But we know the difference right now.  There's going to be a point.  The real thing there's two singularities.  There's the one that Ray Kurzweil talks about where it's indistinguishable from human.  You just look at a picture or read an article and it's hard.  You can't tell the difference.  A human could have written it or a machine could have written it.  That's one singularity.  Then there's the real singularity, which is when the machines become can design themselves  because that's when the acceleration happens because they can do it iterated a much faster  pace than humans.  I feel like we're not where it's Zeno's paradox.  We're getting closer and closer without actually getting there.  You know, we're dividing the distance, dividing the distance, dividing the distance.  But I feel like we're not going to quite get there.  Good, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And who says that's the goal?  Who says it's the goal to be the human brain?  Who says it's the goal to replicate what we do?  Well, no, but that's the thing people fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the thing people fear is the singularity.  Only because people like you make them fear it.  I'm not making anybody fear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff welcomes our AI overlords.  I think what we've neglected to think about is people when we start thinking about this  is we think of AI as this non- I'm trying to think.  They don't recognize that there are still people behind the scenes pulling the strings  and dictating how it's A, developed and deployed.  And we don't question those people's motives.  Instead, we look at the AI and declare them Skynet.  When in fact, there's a large portion of people who would make a lot of money and gain a lot  of power.  It would be like a new scary feudalism if we had Skynet.  You know, look at what China's doing to the Uyghurs.  That is very much- so we attribute a lot of that to AI when it's really the people building  the AI.  And I think it's a distinction that we really should make because if you don't look at  the puppet masters and you're only looking at the puppets, you're really not seeing  what's going on.  And I know that sounds like super cheesy anarchist or whatever, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a long history of scientists and technologists designing things that they lose  control of.  The atom bomb is a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They knew that was going to be a bad idea.  Yeah, a lot of people did.  When they were developing it.  The base technology that went into it-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they did it because they wanted to fight Nazism.  And they thought that was the only way we could do that successfully.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's this great book.  I'm going to tell you what it is as soon as I get there.  Hold on.  No, everyone should read it because it's actually- it talks about chemical warfare.  Oh.  It's all about chemistry and scientific research and how these scientists-  Oh my God.  Where's the name of the book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's not unusual that scientists are just treated as pure research and do it  because they can.  And then it happens that it has an impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's called When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamin Labatt, L-A-B-A-B-A-B.  It's not a great read in terms of riveting, but it is a really good portrait of a bunch  of different scientists.  And it's fictionalized too.  But it's all based on their actual lives and facts.  And then the kind of conversations behind the scenes and their doubts are what fictionalize.  But it talks about the guy who invented chlorine gas for World War I chemical bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fritz Haber, Alexander Grotendijk, Werner Heisenberg, and Edwin Schrödinger.  Yeah, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  May I see your book and add a book?  Our dear friend David Weinberger's Everyday Chaos is very much about this.  It's a wonderful book in which he argues that we're hitting a point, and this might be very  important, Leo, where the computers can explain things or predict- I'm sorry, they can predict  things better than we can, but can't explain it.  There is no explanation.  It's just through no end of A-B testing, it arrives at what is in fact a good prediction,  and it could be a prediction of what we would say next as in lambda.  And there's no explanation of how it got there.  There will be an explanation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we can't even look inside it to see the rules.  No.  We can't reverse engineer it.  It just does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It just does it, and it does a good job of it.  But the myth is that we could never explain anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I was going to say we don't know how the brain works.  So, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  Exactly, Stacey.  God knows what comes out of Leo's head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The concern is quite reasonably, though, well, here you are doing it as kind of blue sky research,  and we're getting closer and closer to machines that can produce an output that's  indistinguishable from human output.  I think you're giving more credit to people who are doing this saying like they have the choice not  to.  Nobody has a choice not to.  We're just going to do it just as we do everything else because we pursue these things.  And then the fear is, well, what's the consequence of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's also, I think, Leo, I think what was wrong in the early days of the internet,  what was wrong about Facebook was that they maybe they couldn't have guessed it,  but they never, I think, built in the system to say, how could this be misused?  Let us build a guardrail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Amy Webb says.  You have to think.  You have to strategize.  You have to think about the consequence of your actions.  We're not real good at that.  Although, although Oppenheimer, Robert Oppenheimer, as soon as he saw Trinity,  said, you know, now what is it now we have are as gods, we have become gods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Gutenberg invented movable type or after the Chinese and Koreans did,  and couldn't have predicted 150 years later.  What now?  I have become death, the destroyer of worlds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's from the Bhagavad Gita.  Sorry.  That deserves that deserves to be remembered because he immediately looked at Trinity and said, yeah.  I think all the scientists at the time.  Yeah, all the scientists at the time.  I remember I just read the wonderful book about  von Neumann, John von Neumann, and everybody understood that they were creating something  that could end up destroying the world, but they were so anxious to stop the Nazis and end the war.  And they really thought, as did Oppenheimer, the Nazis were going to beat us to it if we  didn't get onto it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so we almost had to do it because it was us or them.  You know, it was a self-defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  I want to take a little break.  Come back.  We will talk about customer support via Python script.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When we were trying.  That has you written all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by in real life.  IRL.  It's an original podcast from Mozilla, a show for, guess what?  People who build AI and the people who develop tech policies to regulate it.  Bridget Todd hosts this and there's a new season just came out.  That's why I want to mention it to you.  It's looks at AI in real life.  Boy, this couldn't be more timely, could it?  Who can AI help?  Who could it harm?  This is season six of IRL.  The show features fascinating conversations with people who are working to build more  trustworthy AI.  So I'll give you some examples, episodes, really good ones that I enjoyed.  There's an episode about how the world is mapped with AI and what data is missing as much  is as important, right?  As what data is there.  You'll hear about the people who are working to fill in those gaps and to take control  of the data.  There's an episode about gig workers who depend on apps for their livelihood.  You know, those algorithms in Uber and Lyft and how they're pushing back against the  algorithms that not only control how much they get paid, but who they pick up, where  they go, what they do, whether they work or not.  And about the workers who are looking to find new ways to gain power over the data so they  can have better working conditions.  The truth is out there.  AI from above.  When an algorithm is your boss, there are episodes for political junkies about the role  that AI plays when it comes to the spread of misinformation and hate speech around elections.  This is a very good show about a very important topic.  We've been kind of, you know, meandering all around it.  This show is all about it.  IRL.  Who has the power over AI?  I invite you to search for IRL in your podcast player.  We'll put a link in the show notes at twit.tv slash twig.  And many thanks to IRL and the folks at Mozilla who put this together.  And tip of the hat, by the way, to Bridget Todd, who does such a good job with this IRL.  You can also go to IRLpodcast.org slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  So this is actually the story you were talking about with lack of support from Google.  A dad innocently took a picture of his naked toddler to send it to the doctor.  This is from Sunday's New York Times.  The doctor asked him to.  He said, oh, there's a problem here.  Take a picture.  Send it to me.  Cashmere Hills.  Excellent article.  This happened in February of 2021.  With help from the photos the doctor diagnosed the issue, prescribed antibiotics.  The kid was great.  But two days later, Google killed his account accusing him of child sexual abuse material.  And referred him to the San Francisco Police Department.  Now the problem is this guy, by the way, ironically, the father, I will leave the name out,  actually works in this field.  He designs programs for detecting problematic material.  He's a software engineer that does an automated tool for taking down video content flagged by users  as problematic.  He filed a form requesting review of Google's decision explaining, well, there were pictures  for the doctor.  The problem is he took them on his Android phone and the Android device uploaded it to  Google Photos where it was automatically scanned.  But he lost not only his Gmail account, but he was a Google Fi user.  So he lost his Google Fi account.  He lost all the documents in Google Drive, including pictures and documentation.  He lost his Google account.  He lost all the documents in Google Drive, including pictures and documentation of his  son's first years of life.  He had to get a new phone number, a new email.  And he couldn't, as a result, get the security codes he needed to sign into other internet  accounts.  So then, as a chain reaction, he's locked out of his digital life.  San Francisco Police Department takes the case.  And after an investigation says, no problem, you didn't do anything wrong.  There was no crime here.  No crime occurred.  This was December, by the way, now we're 10 months later.  He received a manila envelope in the mail from the SFPD saying, you've been investigated.  We served search warrants on Google and your internet service provider.  We got your internet searches, your location history, your messages, any documents and  photos he'd stored with Google.  So they saw everything.  They got everything.  And they said, case closed.  No crime occurred here.  Uh, the father called the police officer, the police investigator, uh, and said, can,  can you help me get Google to give me back my account?  Um, you have to talk to Google, the officer said.  There's nothing I can do.  So Mark appealed to Google again, uh, gave the police report to Google saying no crime  occurred after getting a notice two months ago that his account was permanently deleted.  Google said no.  Uh, he investigated suing them.  He said, well, that's going to be too expensive.  The irony is this is the sad coda on the whole thing.  The SFPD has all of his Google account information on a thumb drive because it was part of their  search.  He's trying to get a copy because Google won't give it to him.  Um, it's funny.  We talked about this on Sunday on Twitter and I got the distinct impression that the  panelists blamed the father.  Like you should have known better.  Did it take this picture of your son naked?  Your thoughts did definitely stick on his digital eggs in one basket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He, well, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, I think the fault here is when government can't deal with questions at scale and deputizes  private entities to do their work for them.  Google's in a position here where you, hey, you tell us to take down all child porn.  We're not going to, there's no line there.  We're taking down anything.  A naked child, you know, name, pop, picture with Facebook.  Here we're taking it down because liability, because the government made us do this.  And we're doing that.  I just had a meeting of 25 internet researchers at the school, which was a great meeting.  And they were talking about how what's going to happen now is that regulation is going  to say to the platforms, you've got to give your data to researchers.  And the researchers are saying, whoa, there's not enough of us to protect the world.  Once again, you've deputized somebody to do your work for you.  And we've got to grapple with that, I think.  And, and I think he has a right to get his account back.  I think Google's doing the wrong thing here.  But this is what happens when you have private entities become your cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm curious to know the timeline.  When he snapped the photographs, how long was it before Google sent all this information to  law enforcement and law enforcement got in contact with him?  Just, okay.  So it was pretty quick.  And then next, isn't this what was supposed to happen?  I mean, this is a false positive, of course, but isn't this what's supposed to happen?  Well, that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is your family photos?  This is what Apple got in so much trouble for.  Remember, they were going to do this scanning.  And everybody got all upset.  Apple, I should point out, still does it the way that Google does in the cloud.  Apple was going to do it on your phone.  But in any event, what is it any of their business?  What pictures I have on my phone or on my cloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it is their business because there is a documented harm and use of  digital lockers to store images of child.  It's their servers, right?  Yeah.  So that makes sense.  To me, the issue here isn't that Google scanned it and flagged it.  It's that this father had...  The police exonerated him and he doesn't have a recourse to get his information back or to get  back on Google.  And I think that is...  To me, that's the big issue.  Taking pictures of kids' penises is a big deal and you shouldn't do it.  Even if you're doing it for the doctor?  Hold on.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hold on.  And it's reasonable for a company to flag that.  And when you say, yeah, I took that because of...  I was taking a picture for the doctor, you explained the situation, but there's no way  for him to explain it and get it.  And Google simply doesn't care.  It's not worth their time to hire someone to do that.  Yeah, but who's committing a crime here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the father took a picture of his son, but Google disseminated that picture all over  the place.  Google sent it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  Google themselves looked at it.  Which we tell them to do.  Nick McLook looked at it.  The police department looked at it.  They looked at everything he had.  They went through his entire account.  Right.  Who disseminated that picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not the father.  Google did, but it did it based on the rules and mores that are in place right now for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They gave Google.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, I mean, I think it's an eye-opening case in the sense that people are like, oh crap,  Google does that?  Holy moly.  But I don't think in this situation that it was wrong.  So did photo-map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a day.  Photo-map to the exact same day.  So does Best Buy.  Kodak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many pedophiles had to get caught before they stopped taking their stuff up to the  Geek Squad?  Good Lord.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google sent a response to Kashmir Hill when she asked about this.  It was kind of one of those no response responses.  Yeah.  No response.  Let me see if I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are the odds that Google is going to back down given Kashmir Hill's story?  There is an answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wouldn't be surprised if Google at some point then gives him back his account.  But I think this is why you want end-to-end encryption on the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is exactly why governments don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's statement is in its entirety child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and we're  committed to preventing the spread of it on our platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Priti Patel, who is the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom, just came out saying,  ah Facebook, let's not go so quick into that end-to-end encryption you're doing after the  abortion case because that's going to affect us here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe the problem is not Google.  The problem is government, which wants Google to be doing this.  Always.  All of this stuff to be scanned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or just recognize that this is the impact when you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think a lot of people want us to prevent sexual abuse of minors.  And when you say to them, okay, if we do this, that also means we have the ability to see if  you're going to have an abortion.  And if we shared this with the police, then why wouldn't we share that with them?  Well said.  Unintended consequences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is why I'm constantly like when Jeff says moral panic, I roll my eyes because  you could have both sides and we have to figure out like we have to create rules like,  okay, if we say no encryption, then we have to say you can only get access to this data  and see it in this case.  Not whenever we feel like it's a good enough use case.  We have to specify, okay, to prevent child sexual abuse by this method.  I also think.  And then everything else you can't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you are an active child molester and you actively do this stuff,  you probably are smart enough to encrypt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  A lot of tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well.  Like a lot of tools.  I think this catches the innocent more than it catches the guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're making an assumption.  I mean, again, I will go back to people who brought their  photos of praying on children to photo stores.  And those who left it on their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  And they had to learn, but I think they've learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think there are those that do encrypt it, but there's plenty that don't.  And there's plenty of like first time or casual user.  I don't know.  I'm not in the mind, but I think we don't have the data to say that that's true.  So I would be very cautious about saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will give you some data about this that maybe, I don't know, maybe this  says something in 2021, one whole year, Google filed 600,000 reports  of child abuse material and disabled the accounts of over 270,000 users.  Were they child abusers?  Are there that many?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That most were.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a lot of creepy old men out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you think that you think that of those 270,000 users, the majority,  90 percent, 80 percent, whatever, even if it's 50 percent, were actually criminally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We would hear more cashmere.  Hill would have gotten more stories like this one of the edge case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's look at the number of sexual predators in the US.  I mean, I guess that's a proxy that it's a rough proxy.  But what are those people called when you have to write offenders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sex offenders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course, you're going to Google.  750,000 registered sex offenders in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are approximately 250,000 convicted sex offenders under a criminal justice  supervision in the. Oh, that's in this particular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, but that's total.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So 750,000 registered sex offenders in the United States.  OK, that includes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if Google's catching 270,000 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then studies of victims have shown that less than 30 percent of sex crimes  are reported to law enforcement.  So to get registered, you have to be all the way to conviction.  And we think about how many people are accused, at least.  OK.  These are gross stats.  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's a lot of I mean, I was just thinking about, you know, one in four,  one in five women are sexually assaulted again, not child, you know, not child predators.  But. That's I mean, there's a lot of people out there doing really icky stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are the what are the panelists on they think that he should have done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not uploaded, not taking the picture and not had his uploads on turned on to Google.  He should have been aware of your kids sick.  Yeah, but at the same time, they thought he should have taken the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the day and age, though, where a tele doctor is normal now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It feels like an overreaction.  It feels like the stranger danger overreaction we had  20 years ago that has kept our kids off the streets for the last 20 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not mine. Get outside, dad.  Gun it. Not going to sit in this house all day.  Good for you. Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, well, I know they're not going to go to the bathroom because there is now a tool  to monitor kids going to the bathroom in a thousand American schools.  It's called E Hall Pass.  And if your kid takes too long to poop, they're going to be in trouble.  Let me tell you something.  It's a according to a vice, the system has some resemblance  to the sort of worker monitoring carried out by Amazon.  The product is the co-founder and national director of the K-12 Security Information  Exchange, a nonprofit focused on cybersecurity for schools told Motherboard.  The product is just the latest in a growing number of student surveillance tools  designed to allow school administrators to monitor and control student behavior at scale  on and off campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here again. You lost my kid.  Didn't you do anything to make sure you knew where my kid was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. The program E Hall Pass tracks how long at what time and how often each child goes to  the restroom and store that information on third party servers run by a profit,  for-profit company, a private for-profit company.  Oh man. Just imagine the stats they're generating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting because I saw someone talk about this and kind of other monitoring  software for kids in schools as a way to de-professionalize teaching and to make it  very easy to scale monitoring children in school to a untrained person who basically just like  walks the halls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you might make the argument now the teacher doesn't have to be a police officer.  The teacher can teach, can focus on teaching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All teachers have to be an authority figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Students request a pass through the software and the teacher then approves it.  The tool promises, quote, hall omniscience with the ability to always know who has a pass  and who doesn't without asking the student.  The E Hall Pass website explicitly talks about stopping meetups of students mentioning vandalism  and TikTok challenges, which is the real problem in today's schools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. But then there's also a flip side, a potential good flip side on this.  And I hate bringing this up, but with all of this active shooting stuff, that's another  data point that we can have.  We know where all the kids are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.  That'd just be the world we live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd feel better about it if they use that information to help the children, but  that's not necessarily.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you, did you get any celebrity spam in your Facebook this morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's Facebook?  I wouldn't have noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, your dog did.  Facebook users are reporting celebrity spam is flooding their feeds.  Facebook says earlier today, a configuration change caused some people to have trouble  with their Facebook feed.  We resolve the issue as quickly as possible.  Hundreds of Facebook users reporting a strange glitch in which hundreds,  really hundreds, oh my God,  feeds show posts of people commenting on celebrity pages, even if they don't follow  the person leaving the comment or the celebrity.  All right.  Yeah, I don't know how widespread it was.  As of Wednesday morning story about this.  Well, wait a minute.  Down detector, which tracks all this stuff, reported thousands of issues related to  Facebook.  81% of complaints related to the website's feed.  45% of users reported issues with the Facebook feed.  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  We don't know.  How could you ever know how many it is?  It might be millions, might be billions.  We don't know.  Millions.  That's what I'm asking.  Celebrities, too many celebrities.  Did you get celebrities in your feed?  Facebook is offering a, and apparently will be accepted a $37.5 million settlement over  tracking like Google.  This is a similar settlement with Google.  Facebook continue to track user locations even after they switched off location services.  When location data not available, the app used IP addresses to get a general location  for the purpose of serving ads for local businesses.  This violates California law as well as breaching the company's own privacy policy.  Preliminary settlement filed Monday in San Francisco federal court.  Judge has still to approve it.  $37.5 million take about a third off for the log firm divided by three and a half billion users.  You're going to get, I don't know what you're going to get.  You're going to get a postage stamp in the mail.  I don't know.  I think even though you'll probably get very little, if anything,  in the suit, it does probably have some effect on the behavior of these companies, I would hope.  Just like complaining about the metaverse avatar of Mark Zuckerberg got him to redesign it.  Did you see Mark so excited about Horizon World's major updates to  Horizon and Avatar graphics coming soon?  Oh, this is the, wait a minute, I'm sorry.  This is the good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like that's the new one, isn't it?  That's the good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, whoops.  I'm sorry.  That's the fixed one.  Still looks pretty bad.  The early one was even.  Does he have legs yet?  Is he grown legs?  No, I don't know.  I don't think they have legs.  It did look a little bit.  I can't find the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, if you look up, just to suck ridiculous video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  There's a lot.  But I do have this statuary from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, LACMA,  a piece in the Archive of the World Art and Imagination in Spanish America,  1500 to 1800 exhibit.  A sculpture of the baby Jesus looks surprisingly like the baby Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, Zuckerberg is Jesus.  Zuckerberg is Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'll bring this up for Jeff since he's a TikTok fan.  Have you ever seen the TikTok account Has This Artist Ever Seen a Baby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  It's wonderful.  All right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that feels like something has this artist ever seen a baby because that is a clear example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Let me turn off the audio.  No, no, no.  Turn off the audio, please.  Has this artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What the heck?  How did you get that, Leo?  It's the first thing that popped up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's the first ever seen.  Oh, there's also Has This Artist Ever Seen a Cat?  So after you've plumbed the depths of Has This Artist Ever Seen a Baby,  come on.  I guess there's more than one.  I don't know.  He does a series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an account.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't have to watch it.  I just was trying to relate to Jeff through throwing the TikTok reference.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's funny.  Here's a good one.

Transcript:  What the heck?  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  What account are you on?  I don't know.  You just don't know how to use TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you use this Tok Tok thing?  Hello, Tok Tok.  Play me a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a YouTube version too.  So there you go.  If you just Google Has This Artist Ever Seen a Baby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the before and after.  There on the left, the original Mark.  On the right, the moon approved Mark Zuckerberg.  There's a little better, but a little better.  He's got more shading.  He should just get a better haircut.  And let's be honest about it.  The Caesar cut is over, man.  YouTube, rightly.  Does he have a Caesar cut?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if it's a Caesar or not.  It's cut pretty close to his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does he have bangs?  I don't even know what a Caesar cut is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the short bangs across the front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, maybe.  I can't.  Oh, it's not flattering to any head shape.  Well, it's better.  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not talking about Andrew.  I haven't seen a picture of him.  I don't know what he looks like.  I think your haircut's spectacular.  How bad could his be?  YouTube removes videos of Tesla fans.  Wait, there's Andrew.  No, that's not a Caesar.  That's a nice haircut.  What a good looking fella.  I like him.  Doesn't look anything like Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not one bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I just thought it was that close to the head.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's just a short haircut.  Now you're going to make her.  She's going to go to all her friends and say,  can you think Andrew looks like Mark Zuckerberg?  It's more like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube removes video of Tesla fans using actual children to test whether the full  self-driving software stops for children.  Following the commercial that we talked about last week.  Yeah, where they went and sprinted a mannequin.  But don't use actual children.  Okay, so some people are just, I'm sorry.  Anything for reviews, I guess.  They were dumb before the internet.  That's right.  The internet did not make them dumb.  Here's a happy story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute, let me find one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's National Waffle Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's National Waffle Day.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a new movie about the history of Blackberry.  I think this will be good.  The story of Doom Smartphone Company.  Jay Baruchel and Glenn Howerton starring as Mike.  Movie?  Yeah, movie.  Really?  Yeah, it's done.  They're finishing a production.  I think it's going to show at the Toronto Film Festival.  Soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did Canada fund this movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they should have.  Exactly.  It could be about the Osborne 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good cast.  It's wrapped production.  What is the drama in the Blackberry story, though?  It failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It had so much potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It still exists serving up embedded software through QNX.  It's in cars.  It is, although...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Although it's not really about Blackberry, the, you know,  pivoted Blackberry.  It's about Blackberry, the phone company.  And in fact, just this month, Blackberry turned off the servers  that would let any Blackberry phone work.  They no longer...  No matter which Blackberry you have, it no matter...  It no longer works.  Oh, BBS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blackberry Pearl?  What was it?  BBM?  Blackberry Messenger?  Is that the thing?  Yeah, BBM.  Not just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your phone even won't work.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I bought the life story of Adam Osborne.  I'm going to do that.  That would be boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The movie is based on a 2015 bestseller called...  I think you might remember this.  Losing the Signal, the untold story behind the extraordinary rise  and spectacular fall of Blackberry.  By two reporters at the Toronto Globe and Mail.  It is a very Canadian story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Canada content, man.  You got to fill the airwaves with Canada content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do have a story.  Normally, this would be in the changelog,  but I'm not going to put it in the changelog  because I want Stacey to comment on it.  Google has turned off, has shut down its IoT core services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We talked about this last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about this last week.  Okay, never mind.  Let's forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I put it in the changelog last week, which is where it belonged.  I guess we can talk about it.  Sorry, Liv.  We talked about it in Windows Weekly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I thought, oh, I'll definitely ask Stacey about this,  but forgetting that I had already definitely asked Stacey about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have stuff below the line you could talk about.  You could talk about the company that's going to make call center people  sound more white American using AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  There's more bad AI stuff in here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello, my name is Chad.  I am in Bloomington, Indiana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I help you?  Thank you.  Let's see if they can make me sound more American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Please.  Everybody's having a proper fit about this.  They're trying to argue that, no, this is going to create more job  opportunities because the bigoted Americans will play.  Well, it's really true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody wants to say it out loud, but I hear from people all the time saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, I got a customer service rep where.  And they weren't American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They weren't.  They weren't American.  That's normally what I've heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, customer service reps are bad no matter where they're coming from.  Well, it's not the reps.  It's the ability that they're not trained.  They're given a no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they don't have the power either to solve a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  We don't want to say accents are a problem because you have one,  says President Marty Serum.  They're only a problem because they cause bias and they cause.  I don't think they cause bias, but they are definitely  affected by bias.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  That's a standard.  Do you cringe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do any of you cringe when you have to call a customer service and it's someone that's  not American?  I presume no, because y'all are.  I always ask them, where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the weather like?  I talk to them.  I'm afraid they can't tell us though.  Well, I've never had anybody say, I can't tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  If they make something up, that's fine too.  People who are located here in the U S also have accents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a dumb prejudice.  We all agree.  Yeah.  Oh, do you know what a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  NIMCEL is?  A NIMCEL.  Hey, watch it Leo.  Watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a NIMCEL and you're a NIMCEL and you're a NIMCEL.  You're a niche internet micro celebrity.  Taylor Lawrence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think I was more of a demi celebrity myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not a micro.  Taylor Lawrence's new  neologism for niche celebrities.  As online fame fragments, NIMCELs  represent a growing fraction of the attention economy,  she writes in the Washington Post.  When did she go to the Washington Post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, she went there some time ago.  She gets nasty about the times.  There's a cluster about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a picture of a NIMCEL in case you  wondered what they look like.  That's Bryce Wolman.  I guess he's got a  6'6", 25-year-old operating nurse.  It's his cult following online that's made him a breakout star.  He tweets jokes and missives about life to his 5,000 followers  from the handle TheBigAndSexy70.  TheBigAndSexy70 talks about driving his Chevy Tahoe with a DVD player,  often dresses in bright clothing.  So 5,000 followers is a small follower count.  But that's still in the real world.  5,000 people following you around every day.  That'd be noticeable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what the average circulation of a daily newspaper  in America was before the steam-powered press?  What?  So there you go.  It was a substack newsletter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are YouTubers considered  termed NIMCEL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if NIMCEL is in widespread use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TikTok and YouTube stars count.  Henry has 2.1 million followers, but I would say he's a NIMCEL.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can tell you right now, I know Hank and Hank is killing it,  but I'm pretty sure my mom has no idea who he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  But to his fan base, they...  He's a celebrity.  Yes, absolutely.  Absolutely.  In fact, he recently...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quit NIMCEL.  He recently performed at Outside Lands, the big music festival.  What?  He cooked at a music festival?  Look, here's a picture of him performing at Outside Lands  with his huge audience watching him make sandwiches.  Oh my, oh that's amazing.  So I guess that's more than a NIMCEL.  I don't know what that is.  That's, by the way, that's Phil Rosenthal from Somebody Feed Phil,  who is like his MC and his daughter Lily Rosenthal.  He's making chopped cheese and chicken parm at Outside Lands.  It's a pretty unusual DJ set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like it does look like a DJ, except he's got a induction burner instead of a turntable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No turntables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually kind of cool how the...  Having induction burners in, because that makes cooking much more accessible.  Yeah.  You could plug it into your Tesla and bring it camping.  I hadn't really thought about that, but I'm like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He uses them all the time.  Yeah.  I think there might be video too of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to see the food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to eat the food for him to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I found out that he's been cooking nearby, but not bringing me the leftovers.  He brings it to a young...  I told you this, a young lady.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we eat self-sufficiency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The way to a woman's heart is through her stomach.  All the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here we go.  Here's a...  Mine too.  Here's a short of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen to that crowd cheering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hank the Tank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hank the Tank.  He's cooking for him in the gastro magic stage.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Excuse me, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is somebody else's stuff.  I hate this.  This is the new YouTube shorts.  It's just like TikTok.  Yeah.  Everything's just like TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been uploading this.  Except YouTube podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is YouTube really trying to promote podcasting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a podcast channel.  They're not promoting us.  Well, they aren't.  Well, I don't know what that even means.  Nobody goes to YouTube for podcasts, although NPR just put a ton of podcasts on YouTube,  so I may be wrong on that.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a Google photo question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ant or anyone.  Sorry.  I felt like we were devolving there, but I have a real question for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  20 shows, including Up First and Through Line are now available  on the YouTube podcast channel from NPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  So that must be real.  You know how in the camera, Google will be like,  okay, use portrait mode.  And you're like, all right, fine.  I'll use it.  And you use it and then it does this post-processing of whatever image you took.  How can you make it not post-process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There should be another image next to that one that's not processed.  It allows you to use either one in Google Photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  So if I see the photo and I go into this, is it this?  No, because of the setting hamburger menu or the little menu dots.  I got nothing.  And it's driving me nuts because like, let me test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do a portrait.  Boy, yeah, this is fun podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Portrait of yourself.  Sorry.  You guys wanted to take over the show.  I'm washing my hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was like, this is a real question.  Nothing to do with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  It didn't.  Yeah.  Normally it's right next to it or maybe it's under Google Photos under that directory.  Because I've seen it before.  It gives you two options where one is the process version and one is  the standard snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's taken away my standard because I have all this hyperpigmentation and Google  just loves to emphasize it when it comes into like, it's like freckles sort of normal.  And then it's like freckles.  What's hyperpigmentation?  Did you just call freckles hyperpigmentation?  No, I have hyperpigmentation from I have melasma on my face.  Oh, I never see it.  Do you cover it up?  But I cover it some, but not I don't want to wear a lot of makeup.  No, you look great.  Either way, when I take a photo, it's not like Vitiglio or something like that.  Fideligo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do not see that in there like I used to.  I just looked in all of these folders and it's not there.  I wonder why they took that out.  Well, then.  Because sometimes they will overdo it and have the depth of field off and it'll blur  out part of your eye for some reason, stuff like that.  Yeah, and it'll just get weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Stacey, I should tell you, you can probably trade in that Google Flip 3  for almost 100% credit for Google Flip 4.  Samsung Flip 4.  Google?  Samsung.  Samsung is being very generous with their trade-ins.  So go look and see what you can get for the trade-in.  And that way you could get the new Flip 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The gift that keeps on giving.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.  Thanks, Uncle Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's worth checking.  I've seen people say, wow, I'm getting a huge amount for a trade-in.  They do that when they announce new phones.  Apparently, selling very well almost a million Galaxy Fold and Flip phones sold in the first day.  Nice.  I like the phone.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It works in my little delicate paws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm not crazy about the Fold.  I think it's too big.  But I thought the Flip was just right.  And good reports on the Flip 4.  You might want to do that upgrade because I guess the little screen on the front can run apps now.  And so it's going to do a lot more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the Google changelog.  It's not the changelog.  Oh, crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Your AI is not working very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube is getting split-screen mode and shorts are coming to televisions.  Page two.  Apple Music 4 for Android.  Now in beta with iOS 16 features and Apple Classical mention.  Page three.  YouTube.com podcast goes live as simple explore page.  We already talked about that.  And page four.  Google Docs.  Google box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go, G, jump, bump.  Google Docs update helps everyone stay on task.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I say it was good stuff in the changelog.  I said there was some things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Docs has a new tasks feature.  So you can rolling out August 17th.  Those under schedule release will see it on August 31st.  So you can add to do's.  That's kind of cool.  That would be for a shared document when you want to delegate.  You could add some things.  Or if you're writing a report, you can put your deadlines in there.  That's cool.  Right there in the doc.  And that's, believe it or not, the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shortest changelog ever.  Wow.  Man, was that good.  Wow.  I'm a part of history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see Instagram is now copying Be Real as well?  Allegedly.  Working on it.  It's an internal prototype.  But the same idea where you'll get a pop-up saying,  okay, now take a picture of you and your surroundings.  And it'll go on your Insta.  It's so close to Be Real.  It's like they're not even pretending that coming up with new features.  They're just copying them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Once you got the audience, all you have to do is just copy the features you think they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I just disappointed that Instagram, and I keep saying this is no longer Instagram,  but I guess it's doing well.  It is very much like TikTok now when you go to Instagram.  You're looking, looking, looking.  More videos, more videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  I've complained about it in the past, but again, I'm someone that  I don't just always shoot photographs.  So I'll stick videos out there and they definitely get more attention.  I wish my photographs got more attention, but it is what it is.  I just feel for the photographers that are out there that their focus is photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Boyfriends, daughters, room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, there's I know that voice.  That's the TikTok voice.  I was going to pull up this character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I got to do the puzzle piece.  Hold on.  Make sure I'm not a bot.  Thank you.  Sure.  Yep.  This guy is FN Mika.  You want to see him?  Oh, that's FN Mika, right?  He is a virtual character on TikTok.  TikTok just signed a big record deal with Capital Records.  He has over 10 million followers on TikTok.  Talk about it.  Incel.  I'm sorry, not Incel.  What is it?  He just canceled his contract.  What?  They just canceled it?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then the next thing.  He's a racist character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this story from August 12th is already out of date.  Way out of date.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  And now right after that, I put that in there because right after that,  Capital came back and said, yeah, we're going to sever ties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  I see.  I saw the first one.  I didn't see your follow-up from Dadgum.  Capital Records sever ties with AR rapper FN.  Sever his ties with AR rapper FN Mika.  Apologizes to the black community.  Great.  You should have maybe looked a little closer, Capital, to what he was doing.  You know, well, but that's the thing.  Was he racist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  The FN stands for Factory New, which is a company and it's basically a couple white dudes  working AI to create music.  And they created some music that people apparently like.  You got 10 million followers and they did something right on that standpoint.  But unfortunately, it used a lot of racial slurs and put some interesting graphics up.  Well, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was stopped before playing his videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's pretty craptastic.  But again, Capital was just trying to jump on whatever the hot ticket was  and try to capitalize on it.  No pun intended because that's what they all do.  My beef with this, and this was brought to my attention on Twitter,  lady named Ms. Andrina, I believe that's how you say her name.  She brought it to my attention and I dug into it a little bit.  But my problem is that AI had some data to scrape to figure out what it is that people are liking  and willing to pay for.  I don't like the fact that it's a couple white guys throwing out a bunch of racial slurs,  but I also don't like the fact that we have created the data that's got all of those racial  slurs in it that made it acceptable to be played as records.  I know y'all have some white privilege, but I apparently have black privilege where I'm  supposed to be able to throw around that N-word.  But not white guys pretending to be black.  Have you ever heard me say that?  No.  You never hear me say it.  No.  I refuse to say that word.  You're classy.  I don't give a crap about it being a term of endearment and things like that.  I'm not going to say it.  I have a problem with that being a part of the data that we put in there to allow it  to be scraped, to be put out there in music and say, oh, okay, let's go ahead and capitalize off  of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that FNMECA has 31 or whatever it is, 10 million followers, because of the music as  much as like I'm looking at these, they're typical TikTok videos, funny videos like a  PS5 that turns out to be a coffee machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's all brand.  It's all brand, man.  Get you an album and build your TikTok army and have that TikTok army come after your  music and your other art and just continue to grow.  And that's what they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would it have been different if it weren't white guys doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For me, no, because it's just not my thing.  It's kind of appropriation to say, well, I'm white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm an appropriate black culture to make a lot of money on TikTok.  Yep.  I'm not thrilled about that idea.  I don't like either side of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And someone, I believe it was the same person they mentioned on Twitter, is like, well,  we know that you are a little bit more conservative than other black folks that we know.  Yeah, because I'm not a conservative.  No, I'm not a liberal.  I'm right there in the middle of it.  There's a couple of stuff that both sides say that I totally disagree with and there's  things that they say that I do agree with.  And on this one, I'm right in the middle of the road.  I'm fine with AI being used to help make art better, but I'm not fine with this AI that  is totally racist and just putting this crap out.  I'm not cool with that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of humorous.  The capital records paid so little attention that you said, well, 10 million followers,  sign them to a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the thing.  That's the music industry, right?  It's always been that way.  Okay, so-and-so is hot.  We don't know who they are, but people are listening.  Let's get them before somebody else do so we can capitalize on it and make more money  for ourselves.  We don't give a damn what they're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has a billion views on TikTok or it has a billion views on TikTok.  It's the number one quote virtual being on the platform and his debut major label single  Florida Water came out August 12th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which features another rapper that is currently under, I believe under investigation or even  incarcerated because of racketeering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, great.  Well, well, well.  But the record companies don't care if it sells records.  They don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  All right, let's take a little tiny break because it is National Waffle Day.  And when we come back-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not month.  It's not a waffle month.  Well, let's chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every day is National Waffle Day in the Higginbotham household.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'd be good if it were National Stroopwaffle Day.  Actually, whoever told us that-  Oh, I see.  In Denmark, they celebrate March 25th.  But in the US, August 24th is National Waffle Day.  Woohoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Woohoo.  I do like waffles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Belgium, Hong Kong, Stroopwaffles, Galettes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I sense an international house of pancakes conspiracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, let's see the history of National Waffle Day.  Do they have waffles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a waffle house, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  But I'm saying it's the IA-  The waffle house.  It's the pancake people who are-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Waffle Day is celebrated in several European countries on March 25th  because it's the first day of spring or roughly so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think of waffles as a spring food.  Do you, Stacey?  I know every day, but-  This is also international-  Pick a season for waffles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is international strange-  Wait, a season?  This is international-  It's like a weekend breakfast.  It's training, what?  International-  I'm sorry, are you trying to tell us something, Leo?  Nothing important.  This is International Strange Music Day.  Yep.  And National Danny Day.  Oh, we did just play FN Mica.  If your name is Danny, it's your day today.  National Danny Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only Danny.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We could do a John Cage rendition of Oh Danny Boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes.  Now, after that fine break, we should get your thing of the week, Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Once again, actually, we did a post on the site on why there are no things of the week.  There's just nothing interesting in the Smart Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You actually felt so guilty that you wrote a blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin wrote the blog post.  We were like, hey, do you want to review this?  And I'm like, no.  And basically, so there it is.  And gratuitous norm.  There's norm.  Norm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Norm.  Why the once exciting Smart Home is now boring.  Can I tell you a secret?  I've been bored by it for years.  Hush.  Anyway.  Here's a picture of his first Smart Home Hub from 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's actually, oh, that is his first Smart Home.  Boring Even Then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what the caption says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boring Even Then.  There's an Amazon Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boring.  And I even tried to bring up.  This is where it starts getting exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's it?  So basically, our thesis here is a device-centric Smart Home is boring.  The Smart Home is not device-centric.  It's experience-centric.  Anyway, that's not what I want to tell you about though.  I have a thing for y'all.  All right.  Y'all want an audio book or do y'all want books?  Any book.  Any book would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Either is fine.  Doesn't have to be audio.  Could be any book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I'm listening to the audio book.  So I'm going to, and I think it's a great audio book.  So I'm going to tell you it's Razor Blade Tears by Simon Crosby.  No, Simon Crosby is one of my sources.  Hold on.  Let me tell you who made it.  SA Cosby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This could be the next Stacey's Book Club.  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not science fiction.  Okay.  This guy actually wrote one of my favorite books of last year.  It was a heist set in the South.  Blacktop Wasteland.  Listening to this book, I am just like, my God, when are we going to get this as a movie?  It is so good and so vivid.  And I love it.  It is the story.  Well, it, it, how would I describe it?  It's two old men go searching for justice after their sons are murdered.  Are they named Leo and Jeff?  No, no.  Isaiah and Derek.  So it's a, it's a black man and a white man, both from, are they named Leo and Anne?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause I'd be interested in reading that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it, it deals with,  I know.  Anyway, it's great.  It's got action.  It's got like reckoning over race, reckoning over like rights for gay people.  It's got people coming to terms with who they are.  It's got class.  It's got how we treat ex-cons.  It's just a, it's just a great story.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And my wish list, adding it to my wish list.  Cause I used it like yesterday, but unfortunately, but nice.  You got Steve Gibson's book.  I did.  Recommendation.  That's how, you know, you're right.  I got Steve, see the problem is Steve gets a day, a jump on Twig and I downloaded,  I downloaded his book instead.  I'm sorry, but I will put next month, razor blade, the singularity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I buy the extra credit, hardly anything.  It's, it's, it's way less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, but I already have two books a month.  That's, I can't read as many as I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, oh, should I show, should I reshow?  Will it waffles since it is national waffle day?  Like four or five years ago, that was, that was my thing for the last time we had waffle day  on this show, which is my waffle cookbook.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a waffle cookbook.  But is it, is it like, does it try to waffle things that are not normally waffled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  And the best recipe is hash browns with pepper and rosemary.  And you pop that in the waffle iron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have a, a, a underused waffle iron.  I, I think I might do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The waffle is the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Calamari salad and a waffle iron.  What, what, what, what?  Well, the iron is just, it's just a heater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just cooking.  It's just like, yeah, it's just a grill.  Yeah.  You know, I, that kind of thing about, I should probably make my grilled cheese  in the waffle iron, shouldn't I?  Oh my God, you a hundred percent should.  Yeah.  Yes.  Darn.  Okay, good.  Will it waffle?  Yes, it will.  53 irresistible and unexpected recipes to make in a waffle iron.  Now, Stacey, a point of order.  I don't have one of them square waffle irons.  I have a round Belgian waffle iron.  Is that okay?  Yeah, that's what I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're still going to be fine.  It won't come out square.  That's the information you need to know.  And you know what?  I'll throw out another thing.  The little dash mini waffle irons.  Also in honor of national waffle day.  They're like 10 bucks.  Get one.  They're delightful.  And if you, then you can keep a little waffle batter in your fridge and just pour it out.  Get yourself a little waffle and you can make a waffle sandwich with an egg in the morning.  You should put that in your office there.  Oh, and it comes in many colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aqua.  Oh, not just colors, shapes.  There's a bunny shape.  Oh, you could have a skull shaped waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see hearts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I had a kid going away to college, I might get him this.  A pumpkin shape?  I don't think you're allowed to, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you can have a waffle iron, surely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd actually get my kid an induction burner personally.  Yeah, that's safe.  All right.  It is.  When you don't have something on it, it turns out it's much safer than a hot plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are four inches.  They're teensy.  Yeah, they're this big.  Teeny weeny.  Teeny weeny.  You could make stroopwaffles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not this size.  They're smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Lego that Eggo.  And there's a thumbnail.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Razor Blade Tears, a novel on Amazon or Audible.  Will it waffle?  A waffle cookbook.  And the little mini waffle irons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There you go.  Sorry, y'all.  I just got so enthusiastic about Waffle Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Waffle Day.  I respect that.  I respect that.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I want to mention just quickly that Crikey, which is a wonderful news site in  Australia, said that the Murdochs were unindated conspirators to Trump on January 6th.  And Lachlan Murdoch threatened to sue them.  It went back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.  And finally, Crikey did a full page or a quarter page ad in the New York Times saying,  come after us.  And indeed, he did.  He's suing Lachlan Murdoch, suing Crikey because Crikey said that the Murdochs were  not unindicated conspirators.  I'm not going to go to Australia because now I'll get sued for repeating this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in the US, of course, they'd be in the clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The problem is the Australian libel laws are off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Australian.  And so they may in fact be liable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they're going to fight it.  And well, they should.  Peter Frey, who is the editor, is very good.  So I want to mention that.  Also a great name for a newspaper.  Crikey.  It's perfect.  Crikey.  Ben Evans had some fun with the fact that the New York Times put up to a blog post on  explaining how they use AI to get you to subscribe.  This is the same newspaper that, of course, decries using dark methods.  Dark methods.  To get you to do things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at the subscription funnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hate seeing slides of the funnels.  Oh, God.  I've seen so many.  And then finally, according to Nielsen, for the first time, streaming has now,  and usage has surpassed both broadcast and cable.  Isn't that interesting?  It's a streaming world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  The largest and Netflix number one by far, which is interesting.  Then YouTube, Hulu, Prime, Disney, and HBO Max.  Netflix has 8% of the market, HBO Max 1%.  And then there are a lot of little other guys to make up 10%.  So that I thought was very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Mr. Jarvis, I know this is the picks of the week and stuff, but  we sort of saw this coming.  But was there anything the cable companies could have done to prevent this?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  They have their own streaming channels.  So you got HBO Max versus that.  But it's really cord cutting and all that.  I don't know.  Oh, this is just the way things are going.  The progression.  But streaming is a pain in the butt.  Do your boys?  How so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How is it a pain?  You literally pick up a phone.  I'm an old guy and I get out my clicker here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I'm so amazed.  It doesn't have a wire anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's on channel four?  You're watching your TV on a TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't watch it on a TV.  Watch it on an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little market research.  And do your boys, what do they, do they watch primarily YouTube?  I'm going to guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  YouTube.  YouTube and the popular service of Disney Plus.  Oh, that's interesting.  Those are the things.  Because they dig Marvel and stuff.  They dig all of those little different series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they don't watch broadcast television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not often.  Only if they catch the parents watching reruns of something or other.  But most of the time they're just, they're watching a streaming service like Disney Plus.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You know what my kid said about broadcast television?  What?  I feel so sorry for my friends who have TV.  They have to watch what's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And even with that said, Miss Stacy, even I don't watch broadcast unless it's,  I go to Hulu to watch reruns of old shows.  I'm not even watching it live.  The only time I'm watching it live is this weekend with football season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I never watch it.  And I'm going to, don't forget, I am a former TV critic.  And yeah.  Oh yeah.  I heard.  Yeah.  And that's how I just, some of it's just so off.  That's how I ended up seeing TMZ on Richard Simmons.  An hour.  An hour of that.  Broadcast TV has just gone to the dregs.  It's nothing on it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is an assumption though that you have high speed internet.  Okay.  You're not going to watch streaming if you don't have high speed internet.  What is the penetration of high speed internet in the US?  I wonder.  Oh, I got a question.  What is, here we go.  This is from, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you can also watch it on your phone.  Don't forget, you got the phone companies are saying certain services are included.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watching on the phone isn't very satisfying though, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but everything is pushing us to create content for people to watch on the phones.  Remember Quibb?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I like watching stuff on my phone.  I like watching stuff on the iPad.  We only watch, we only have one TV and we only watch it very, we watch the Sandman  and that's only because my daughter and I were watching it together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's an interesting picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from last year.  Apple Insider.  Those blue counties are areas where less, fewer than 15% of the people  are using the internet at 25 megabits or better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Some of those places though only have like six people.  Yeah. They're mostly rural counties. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although much of Alaska.  So the percentage of people using the internet, 25 megabits or above per county,  less than 15% have broadband in the blue counties and the gray counties is more than 15%.  I'd like to see some other stats, but the blue counties here aren't watching streaming.  I could tell you that.  85% of the people in these counties don't have enough internet bandwidth to watch streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're just waiting on football season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have enough to watch it on their phone, just not on their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah, if you're that rural, you may not have,  you may not even have high speed telephone.  Anyway, Ant Pruitt has a need. He has a need for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need her laughs these last couple of days.  And I got some. I got some. The first one comes from,  actually we just mentioned her regarding that FN Mecca Twitter thing, but I wanted to put this  out here for you because she had that same drone that you bought that I tried to tell you not to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You did. You did try. You tried hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I follow Adriana. I really like her. In fact, she was the person who kind of introduced me  to black Twitter. I asked her who should I follow? She told me who to follow. She's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man, that thread though, she shares a thread of using that pixie drone.  And it was such a great experience. And they pretty much should have made her an affiliate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She said, I disobeyed your product warnings. And let me tell you is exactly  the disaster your product managers figured it would be. Is this going to be a pixie drone example  here? Let's see. And that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's fine. That's what it's supposed to do.  But further down in that thread, there's an interesting incident, which there are no pictures,  but the pixie drone gets stuck in someone's hair.  That's not good. Look at this. This is the orbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the orbit. It goes around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't just anyone's hair. It was a very fancy person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't Adriana's hair. I could tell you that. Let's go down and see. There's no  pictures of that. So she's using it a lot. I'm going to bring mine in next time. It's just  sitting on my desk. This is the discontinued selfie drone that I bought for fairly significant  expense. It looks like she's getting the value out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She did pretty well with it. But again, at the very end, she talks about, whoops,  this thing ended up in someone's hair, like literally tangled. Like, holy crap, I can't get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this out of her hair. Well, I wouldn't do it in a large group of people. You'd do it with somewhere  where, because the drone is going to run into people and propellers got wrapped up in her hair  in knots. It's going to hit this guy. Watch out. Watch out. No. Oh, that's it. That's it.  She wasn't paying attention. She walked right into the thing. But this is, you know what, Adriana,  you probably shouldn't be using it at an event with people wandering around, right?  Especially old people.  Look, here comes the guy. She's looking at the guy. Here comes the drone named right for her.  Oh, her name was Kelly. She was incredibly patient as I attempted to disentangle the  pixie propellers from her hair with the least amount of hair breakage. The friend was a lot  less patient and said, you just have to break it and snapped one of the propeller guards right off  the pixie. Yeah, just wrong. If you ask me, I think she wanted to break it because she said,  this is a really dangerous thing to be using in a place with this many people. But I guess I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have to tell you that now. Ha ha ha. Yeah, that woman sounds like a piece of work.  Little belligerent. Little belligerent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that thread. That thread made my day.  Wow. 37, 31 tweet thread by Adriana Langston. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a good thread. Don't let the 31 tweets fool you. It's worth it.  It's an absolute classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a gem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And she's great. I follow her on Twitter too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I love her. And she's always tweeting at us saying stuff.  You said you had something else that would make you smile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Number two is one of my favorite comedians, Mr. Alonzo Bowden. If you skip to 37,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Alonzo Bowden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This bit is just, this wasn't televised. This was just done strictly for YouTube.

Transcript:  Turn up my sound if you would. Or no, I turned it off. Never mind.  I'm sorry. Here we go. Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ... talk show. On average, women use three times as many words a day as men.  Because women speak in detail and it's three times as many words a day.  So what about a week? A month? A year? Or years?  There are men who've been married in excess of 20 years.  How many words have they had to listen to?  It's mind boggling.  And you could tell. You could tell the old veterans because they have a filter built in.  And they don't listen to all the words. They only hear their assignment.  She'll just be talking. Grocery store. Milk. Cereal.  Gas. And he's like, I'm going to go to the grocery store and get some cereal and milk.  On the way back, I'm going to get gas in the car. And she's like, I'm glad you were listening.  He's like, oh yeah, I was listening. I was listening.  That's so true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I totally do that.  I live that every day. Every day.  Every day. So does Andrew, I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Andrew speaks more than I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's interesting. If we asked Andrew, would he say  that's true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He probably would. I mean, there are like Wednesdays after I've talked to y'all all day.  You have nothing to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I go and read a book.  That's my excuse too is that, well, honey, I've been talking all day.  I don't want to talk anymore.  I know. I know. I think he's pretty accurate. I'll just say that. I don't mind it. It's a fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One more thing. I just thought about this. Mr. Jarvis, I've been watching musicals here recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Oh no.

Transcript:  One in particular, I just stuck it in IRC and in our Discord.  I've been watching that one in particular because somebody has now been nabbed as Sandy Cheeks.  He's going to be in Suns. He or she.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is justice.  This is justice.  I don't share a lot of personal private stuff because the whole world ain't got to know,  but this was pretty big. I'm quite proud of her. She's always wanted to get into acting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's going to do so well.
