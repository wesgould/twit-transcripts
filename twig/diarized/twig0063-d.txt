She was our reporter at the Logitech event.  We'll report in live, because you are live right now.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Right.  It's all so confusing.  Am I DVR'd?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can someone pause me?  You're recorded.  Unpause Becky.  So here as usual, Gina Turpani from San Diego.  Hello Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hi, good to be here.  Excited to talk about Google TV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Smarterware.org is her website.  And of course she writes for Fast Company.  It has a great Work Smart feature.  It's at fastcompany.com slash work smart.  Jeff Jarvis back from Frankfurt.  You were there last night.  20 hours.  Ay, ay, ay, caramba.  And the ambient didn't work according to your Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I was really pissed.  I was awake.  It's a terrible thing to be awake.  Are you jet lagged still?  No, I'm just stupid.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not going to say anything.  I was going to say something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm eager to talk about Google.  We've got lots of Facebook news.  We've got news.  We've got a ton of news.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you know who's been covering it?  From his command center in San Francisco, MG Sinkler of TechCrunch.com.  Love MG.  We're all big fans of yours, MG.  Thank you.  Thank you guys.  So you actually didn't go to any of the events because they were all going on at once.  There was a Cisco event.  There was a Facebook event.  And there was a Logitech event all in the same morning, all in the Bay Area.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Yeah.  I couldn't pick one to go to, so I kind of watched the stream and the live blogs.  We had people at them all, so I was watching the live blogs.  And I watched the live stream of the Facebook event itself.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I guess we should...  You know what?  What we should do is quickly cover the Cisco and Facebook announcements.  Since they're quick, there's not a lot to say about them.  We're going to spend a lot more time, I think, with the Google TV Logitech announcement.  Start with Facebook, MG.  What did Facebook tell us today?

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  So Facebook basically, they rolled out a few new features.  So one of them, the big one, one of the big ones is data portability type deal where they're  going to allow you to kind of export all your data finally from Facebook itself.  And they're not really disclosing where you can move it to yet, but you'll basically be  able to get a big file dump with all this data and including your pictures and all that  kind of stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's something we talked about with Backupify that I'm already doing with a third party  service.  But Facebook actually, I think, wasn't too happy about Backupify.  It's nice that they're off on that.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there's been a lot of talk that people want to get this data out of Facebook since  everyone is putting so much data into it.  And it looks like they're finally doing it.  You know, Dave Recorden, it sounds like it's leading this charge.  He was the one who talked about it today.  And yeah, I mean, they're saying all the right things now.  We'll see how it's actually implemented.  It kind of makes sense, Dave.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Would you stay there for a second?  So and Gina, too, I want to hear.  So if I can get my Facebook data, then I presume that this now means that independent app developers  can develop independent apps for me to publish and display my data to the web alone or with  others in all kinds of new and wacky ways.  That's interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It doesn't.  From what I understand, it gets up.  You download it as HTML.  So it's this big kind of giant HTML package.  So that's I mean, that's not JSON or XML, which is much more machine readable, but it  certainly is programmatically readable.  So yes, you could do that.  It would be nice for it to export to an XML or JSON file.  So that would be a little easier to import.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think that's why they used HTML is to kind of discourage you from doing stuff  with it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think they use HTML because it makes sense to a regular user who double clicks on the  zip file and clicks on the index.  Oh, and then you get like a browser.  You get like a simplified version that you can look at.  So I think that makes sense.  A normal user would look at a bunch of XML files and say, what is this?  I would love to see, you know, I mean, honestly, the graph API is fantastic.  It exposes all the data via JSON anyway.  So developers are getting that right.  So this is really for regular users.  And what's cool about this, too, is that you get all the photos that you have been tagged  in.  It's not just photos that you've uploaded.  So that's really useful.  From what I understand that that's true.  So I think this is just for regular users who say I want to back up my Facebook.  And this is an easy way to do it.  And I think it makes a lot of sense.  And I was really, really happy to hear this because this is.  But it feels a little bit like a face.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, imagine making apps out of this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, definitely.  And because it's HTML, you can read it in and you can make apps out of this.  I feel like it signals this sort of cultural shift at Facebook.  I mean, this is kind of feels like an about face.  I mean, they've always been accused of being kind of this walled garden and your stuff  is there and it can't go anywhere else.  So I feel like this is a response to diaspora on some level.  And when we talk about groups, I think that's a response to the rumors about Google me.  But I also think it's like, oh, this guy, David, you know, was instrumental in building  all of an open ID. He's a head of open source at Facebook.  Like we have a lot of Googlers going over to Facebook.  I think we're starting to see Facebook start to, you know, show some of the values that  we're really used to hearing from Google.  So I'm really happy about this.  You really have to thank Dave for this.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Yeah, I totally agree with that, obviously.  But there's also, you know, there's still a little bit of a lot of gray area and what  they're going to do with all this stuff.  You know, it's like they still have the kind of weird relationship with Twitter and the  weird relationship with Google when it comes to actually importing this data.  You know, I've heard that they basically want to have deals in place with any any company  over a certain size in terms of, you know, bringing in just even the friend graph and  that. So, well, I'm sure they'd be OK with people exporting their data and maybe using  it, you know, in like some little small startup or doing something like that.  If someone tried to, you know, pull this into Google me or pull this into Twitter, I think  that Facebook would still hold on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If I download it and it's now mine and you come along and you say, hey, sailor, put it  here and look at the neat things we'll do to it.  That's up to me. Otherwise, you know, Facebook can't stop me from doing something with my  data once I've downloaded it, which they've enabled.  Yes, that's true.  They're not scraping it out of Facebook.  They're getting it from me.  What's cool about that is it goes to the idea of me being the server of my identity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, think about somebody like Tumblr.  Tumblr could then say, OK, great.  Download your Facebook file, put it on Tumblr and now you've got your own website with your  Facebook content on it, which is actually good for Facebook, I think, because you use

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  it as an authoring tool for your identity, which goes to what you've been talking about,  Leo, in terms of what Google profiles could be, which I think may be part of the reason  that is because it's also a shot across.  They had to.  Definitely.  Before profiles comes out.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Definitely. You know, at the most basic level, I think that the most basic function of any  software program should be I can get out the data that I put in.  And so as far as I'm concerned, this export my data is like whatever, six years.  You know, Google's data liberation front.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Definitely. And what's so interesting is that if if the social network, the movie, which I did  see, you know, if it's true, I mean, this is how Facebook started.  Right. Zuck went and sucked down all the photos from all the different Facebooks around  Harvard and then created Facemash.  He used WGet.  Right. He used WGet.  Right. But now he's giving everybody the ability to pull down their own pictures.  Their own data. I think it's a long time coming and really good idea.  And Jeff's point is right.  If you hand over your Facebook zip file to another program, just the way you export your  bookmarks from one browser and import them into another, I can't see how Facebook could  argue with that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's great news.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They also I think this is huge news.  Yeah, I think this is really maybe the most important story of the day because it does  change the whole architecture of how we can handle identity.  I had lunch by chance this last week with Brett Taylor, who's the CTO at Facebook now,  or his former friend feed.  We were great, nice guy.  And what I hear from from them is that they struggle about the way that privacy that  comes out. I was going to write a post about this, but I'll say here first, I think the  positioning for Facebook is that it is a sharing service.  You go to Facebook to share, you don't go to Facebook to hide, you go to Facebook to  share. And now with groups of M.G.  I'm sure will fall on the second.  You can share with a small group.  You can share with the whole world.  You could this all it's all about control.  And this gives us another level of control.  I think what's brilliant about it is that if I do choose to download it all and I do  choose to publish it all, I've done that independent of Facebook.  And it's no longer Facebook's fault if I broadcast to the world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So tell us about Google Groups, Becky.  What is it?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  I was just going to ask M.G.  because I was I looked at it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google Groups. I'm sorry.  Facebook Groups.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  You can't help yourself. They're all becoming one.  And I just cursorily looked at it.  And I don't understand the difference between this groups and the previous groups.  M.G., can you explain that?

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Yeah. OK, so groups is the big consumer facing feature that they launched today.  So it's kind of like creating a new environment within Facebook itself where you can  easily add any person that's already in your social graph and just put them in put them  in this new group area and share anything with them.  You can even they have a new feature where you can share a doc and kind of edit it.  You know, it's very it's very basic, but very privately to that group.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that based on the docs dot com Microsoft solution that they offered a while ago?

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  No, I don't think so. I think this is just totally an internal thing.  It's a very simple document that you can just kind of group edit together if you want.  I mean, the thing that this actually most reminds me of is actually Google Wave.  I know. Oh, wouldn't that be awesome if they brought Wave back?  It's kind of like it. It's not, you know, it's not as technologically advanced.  There's not all the real time typing and all that stuff.  But, you know, in some ways that this might be, you know, Facebook saying, hey, Google,  this is what you should have done with Wave if you really want to make this a  collaborative environment type deal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not seeing it yet. So when and how is this rolling out?

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  They're rolling out over the next few weeks.  I think they enabled it for some people today.  I got access to it right when the thing went live.  Where would it be?  Where would it be?  It would be under your main it would be in your main tabs on the left hand side,  pretty much right under friends.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, yeah, so I don't have it yet, I guess.  Oh, I think I can add you.  Can you add me? Can you make me a grouper?  I think I can. I'll try that.  I'm on Facebook, my private.  I don't know if I'm your buddy yet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  How is this different from lists?  I mean, they said during the event that no one wants to make lists.  And I agree. I agree. No one wants to make lists of friends.  This is my softball team. This is my, you know, coworkers.  But how is groups different?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My sense is that, right, and Zuckerberg said to me, too, that no one makes like lists.  They like to do it only in the process of doing something else.  So I think in this case, rather than going in and trying to create a taxonomy  of all the friends you already have, you say, oh, gee, I'd like to talk to these five people  together as a group. I'll just make them a group.  OK, and that will come this.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really groups.  You can do all kinds of things.  You can do chat and you can chat all at once.  You can, you know, just you have a wall there where you can still do all the,  you know, things you would on a regular profile wall.  But now it's just inclusive to your group.  It's also interesting that there's three privacy settings for this.  So there's there's a hidden, which is completely hidden and completely private.  There's private, which is invite only.  But people can still search for that group and see who's in it.  And then there's completely public, which anyone can join and interact with.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Why name it groups when you already have something called groups  that does something different?  That doesn't make sense to me.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  It's really it's. Yeah, they talked about that a little bit.  I think Zuckerberg said that they wanted to keep it, you know, as simple as possible.  It is a grouping feature, so therefore they called it groups.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  OK, all right.  If you. There is an explanation to Zuckerberg.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the movie, we don't know what it is yet.  It's always changing.  How do you like the movie, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I enjoy the movie.  It infuriated me at times, but I very much enjoyed it.  I also enjoyed reading reviews because I think that people's impression of the movie  really reflected what they, you know, like their own issues like Nick Denton  was quoted as saying that he felt that the, you know, the lesson of the movie  was that you have to be a bit of a brute in business, which which which I think  which made me laugh.  And I think it could be a good quote for you, Jeff, and your is, you know, should  you does business need to be evil panel at South by Southwest.  But I enjoyed the movie very much.  I really related to him.  I love that his kind of obsession, you know, obsessiveness with the product  and his ambition and the focus.  I thought something I identified with.  They did make him out to seem like a robot, which he isn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did he seem like evil, an evil person, a sociopath?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, he didn't. He didn't seem like an evil person.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The interesting thing in the movie is that and we talked to Dana  Bernetti on that night last night.  She he was the producer for Tigger Territory.  And he said the Fincher decided this and Mezrich and Aaron Sarkis  decided on this almost Rashomon like you're looking at the same events  from three different perspectives, Marks, Eduardo's and the Winklevoss's, I guess.  I don't know.  And I think that that actually comes out in the way people see the movie.  Everybody I talked to has kind of a different view of whether Mark is bad.  Yes. You know, and it's generational.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's where where you sit.  Of course, I was very sensitive to how women were portrayed and sort of  and like summarily dismissed basically that one scene in the dorm room  where it's like is kind of handing out responsibilities to the guys.  And they say, who are the who are the girls?  And, you know, it's like, no one.  It's like, you know, what?  And then one of them says, what can we do?  And he says nothing. You know, I mean,  and I felt like that was kind of indicative of how.  So, of course, that was that was annoying.  But, you know, people in my theater chuckled at that line  because it was so ridiculous because they were building this sort of caricature  of this like robotic nerd guy.  And, you know, I mean, so I enjoyed the movie.  I was impressed that the filmmakers made it something entertaining.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's very accurate, technically, which I kind of liked.  We talked about W.  Get Pearl, HTML that's seen in the computer science  classroom where the professor poses what is seems to be an impossible  problem in question.  And and then Zuck leaves and the professor says,  well, I guess you didn't know the answer.  He says, I know. And he gives it and rattles off the answer.  Dana told us that actually the original answer that he rattled off  in the script was wrong.  They had a consultant on set and they actually brought everybody back,  relit and shot it so that would be correct.  Wow. So the Fincher, apparently, that's his thing.  He wants to be actually very correct.  And so it's the most certain things.  Yeah. Well, that's the interesting thing.  It's the most technically correct movie I've ever seen,  but it has nothing to do with the factual reality of Facebook.  But that's OK. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love less review and less.  I did too. That was the one I think was most important.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Absolutely. Me too. Me too.  And yours, Jeff. But you're very similar.  Well, you say similar.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We hit more of a point.  He used it as an opportunity to to give a lecture on neutrality.  Yeah. Or sermon.  Well, that's Larry. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's his thing.  And his for those who didn't read it, it's in the New Republic TNR.com.  You can read it for free.  And it's really he says it's not a movie review.  It's a great movie.  But it misses the most important fact of Facebook,  which is that no one had to ask permission that Mark Zuckerberg could create  a multibillion dollar company with half a billion users in six years.  He didn't ask for ask permission from Harvard, from the Internet, from telcos.  He only needed a thousand dollars to start it.  And that's the kind of the message of the Internet generation is that you can  you don't have to ask permission anymore.  You can just do it.  And boy, what a great message that is. Yes. Yeah.  All right. So that's Facebook.  Not only not only the actual Facebook, but the the the picture thing,  though, there was a third thing. So it's groups.  Well, what was the other thing? Was it?  Did you get the invites to groups?  I just I just asked you to be my buddy.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Yeah, I accepted.  And I invited you to this one group that everyone created.  All right. So I see here.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  I think, Jeff, the third thing was dashboard.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's right. New dashboard, which we haven't seen yet.  So just yet more privacy control.  What is the dashboard?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a new way of privacy control, Becky.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  That's my understanding.  And M.G. was more on this, but that it's more visual.  Yeah. To use privacy setting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so the theme of this all today is control, control, control.  Yay, Facebook.  Right. But the problem always is what when they in the past,  when they gave more controls, it was more confusing.  It seemed like less control.  So they've gotten that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What Facebook giveth, Facebook taketh away.  The Zuckerberg taketh away. Oh, good.  So now I can see the group.  So M.G. invited me to a group of tech writers or bloggers,  tech news bloggers and reporters.  And so it's an open group.  So anybody who has groups can see it.  And there's Dan Patterson, there's M.G.  There's Dwight Silverman at Bot.  Well, this is going to be a fun group to be in, actually.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Hey, hook a sister up, man.  Yeah, no kidding. Invite us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you invite me?  I like the people in it.  No, sorry. What?  Yes, very, very exclusive.  Anybody can join it, right?  M.G. or it's an open group.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  This one, I think, is a this is the middle tier privacy setting.  So I think you have to be invited to join it.  But anyone can see who's in it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, I'm glad I got back on Facebook.  Somebody said and quite rightly, I understand people are saying it to me on Twitter.  What I've confused, Leo, you hate Facebook now, you love Facebook.  You're defending Mark Zuckerberg against the evils of the social network.  And it's a layered thing as geeks.  I feel like we can criticize Facebook and we could be adamant about it.  We could say this is a bad thing.  But when it comes to the outside world, I'm going to defend my geek brother.  You know, it's true.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I'm actually feeling a lot more the most positive.  I felt about Facebook in a long time because of the movie and partially  because of these announcements.  So, you know, I feel bad for Zuck, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am me, too.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Wow. The new twig. No geek on geek violence.  Yes, that's right.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Enough geek on geek violence.  We can't have it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They listen. I think I think the point of this is, is that Facebook does listen.  And, you know, in a way, the most important line in the movie,  which I'm sure Zuckerberg does in fact, because we don't know what it is yet.  It's always changing.  And that goes away from the whole industrial age view  that you have a product and you stand by it.  So he's always been, you know, whether it was the newsfeed or or the ad program  or anything, he'll throw it out there.  People don't like it.  He says, OK, I was wrong here.  I was right there. You're wrong there.  And he fixes it and changes it.  And he rolls with those punches.  And that's a whole new way to do this, you know.  And again, Google knew that too, with betas and forgot that when it came to  buzz. But that's just the way that Facebook operates.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I think the movie did a really good job of showing how he fed off  of the response, like the more that Facebook grew, the more kind of focused  and obsessed he got about it.  And I love the way he kind of looked at MySpace and said, that's ugly.  And looked at Friendster and said, it's always down and said, Facebook's going to  be clean. It's always going to be up.  He controlled his ability to scale by by making it exclusive to Harvard.  Like, I think he made some really smart decisions.  And the more people he was constantly looking at, how many users did he have  and iterating and adding more?  And I think that that is the that is the true web experience.  Right. It's that constant feedback and that iterating and that growing as you go  versus creating a finished product and then issuing it.  So if the movie did anything right, I certainly think that it did a good job  of portraying, you know, a smart programmer who's obsessed and who is ready  to iterate and ready to listen to his users and go with what they want it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And of course, as long as we as long as Facebook  responds to their criticisms that we pass along about privacy, about  settings and improves and iterates.  I have no problem with saying, hey, you're doing the you're doing the right thing.  You're going in the right direction. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, the problem is they had so many privacy setting changes that confuse  people over and over again.  After a while, it felt like are they not learning from their mistakes?  And today's announcements feel like they're learning from their mistakes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I really sense that they struggle with that.  I mean, I really, really do.  And I don't think it's as simple as just PR.  But, you know, a few conversations lately, they really do try to learn from that.  And part of it is that they are confused because they have a view of the world  that's just not meshing in how they communicate it.  And that's what Mark said to me when I sat down with him.  I hope you can do a better job of communicating this than we have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, Jeff Chavis, you are added to the Facebook group by  Robert Walter Scoble.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, Scoble is always ahead of everyone.  He was there first.  I think he created the group.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did he create it? I'm liking who's in this course.  Let's let's pull up the ladder now, though.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, you gang like bastards.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No girls allowed.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  We're going to make our own treehouse.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Get back here, make your own group.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, I changed my mind.  All girls allowed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I have great groups already.  Really?  Yeah, I just got it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm refreshing my Facebook page like a loser.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wait a minute. No, no.  How do I add somebody to the page?  First of all, I guess you have to be my friend.  Anyway, that's we'll take a break and come back while I add  Gina to the tech news bloggers group.  Oh, you already are my friend.  We are friends. We are friends.  So I'm going to add you to my somehow add you to this group.  Can I do that, M.G.?  Or it is do you have to be some sort of?

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Yeah, go and the right hand column, click on add friends to group.  It should be right under all the pictures.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Add friends to group.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's also interesting that I don't accept or anything.  I'm just there.  Well, that's kind of interesting.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Some people might have, you know, take issue to that,  like they do with all Facebook changes.  But it's like you is completely opt out.  You know, you anyone can add you to any group.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I saw the things that I do at the group that are part of the group.  So if I don't ever do anything with it, it doesn't matter.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't see you. Maybe you aren't my friend, Gina.  I'm going to have to add you as a friend.  Well, I have I'm a fan.  You see, I'm on your fan page, but I don't know your personal.  So I can't add you, but Becky, I added you.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Oh, thanks, boss.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because she's my friend.  We're going to take a break.  We have a Cisco announcement and then Google TV and lots more to talk about.  Becky Warley was at had an early morning demonstration of Google TV.  We've got some video from there and Becky's insights.  M.G. Siegler is here from TechCrunch.  Great to have you, M.G.  Once again, just love your stuff.  Gina Tripani from SmarterWear.org is also here.  And of course, Jeff Jarvis, Buzz Machine.com and the author of What Would Google Do  If It Were On An Overnight Flight from Frankfurt?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  It wishes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's time, though, for me to mention our friends at Citrix,  the makers of the great GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting is a great solution for anybody who doesn't want to travel.  Jeff, one of these days, the Germans will get to go to meetings.  Sell it to the Germans.  And you will not have to go there.  You go there like every month, it seems like.  I just passed 100,000 miles.  And let me tell you something, you know, American Express did a survey.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Rather be on GoToMeeting.  I can tell you that for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  They they looked at the cost of business travel, and it's about a thousand dollars  for each trip that includes airfare, hotel, taxis and all that.  You really this is a great way to cut costs, be more efficient,  work more efficiently, be improved processes, save money by reducing travel,  improve communications with the people you work with, help you work smarter  and be more efficient. GoToMeeting.  There are other online meeting solutions. I know.  You can try them all. Please do.  And here's a 30 day code to try GoToMeeting.  And I guarantee you, you will come back to GoToMeeting.  It's the best for product reviews, sales, presentations,  training sessions, collaboration sessions,  turning conference calls into boring from boring, you know,  audio presentations to to something exciting, engaging and functional.  30 days free. GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  GoToMeeting.com.  Now, now they're saying offer code twig.  So if they ask you for an offer code, just use two T.W.Y.G. in there.  I'm confused. GoToMeeting.com slash twig or offer code twig.  Either way, 30 days free of the simply the best,  most secure, fastest online meeting solution.  We thank Citrix for their support of this.  We can Google and invite you to try. Please go to meeting.  Very briefly, Citrix announced the new Uma Thurman phone.  What is it? Umi?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Maybe Cisco. The Cisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cisco. Umo. Cisco.  Cisco. Uomo. They said it.  Cisco for men.  Uma, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah,  Uma, Umi. Oh, I get it.  U and me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is there an umlaut involved at all?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  No double, no double dots.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Huh? How's it spelled? Umi.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Umi. Kara Swisher said it sounded like bad sushi she wouldn't eat.  Umi.  Umi.  But the other thing that's weird about it, and this was Jim  Louterback pointing this out in a tweet saying they're calling it  actually the Umi telepresence.  So really geeky name for a super  consumer product.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but not a consumer price.  Right. Six hundred dollars.  Six hundred bucks.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  And this is video for your HDTV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's OK.  So now we saw Skype offer this at CES, the Skype camera, Skype TV,  much less expensive.  Cisco's Umi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Umi.  Umi.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, is a camera.  It looks like well, I see it's got a it's got a bar over the U so it's a long Umi.  They told me they told me it was Umi.  No, it is Umi because it's a long, long U.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  I understand. It's a camera and a console.  OK, and they say it dynamically adjusts to lighting conditions in your room.  It's full HD.  It adjusts to the size of the room for sound purposes.  It prioritizes the video conferencing.  And this is the part that's unbelievable.  Six hundred dollars plus twenty four dollars a month.  What?  A monthly fee.  Twenty five bucks.  Now, that could be subsidized if you perhaps ran it through Verizon Fios  or through Comcast.  And then they're going to, as I said, prioritize some channels.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it just that sounds like they think this is going to replace your phone service.  Like you won't pay for your telco.  You'll just use Umi.  Nuts. Nuts.  It does have a video voicemail.  That's kind of cool.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  It also has interoperability because you can use it with somebody else  who has Google to Google chat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ah, so I can use because I think, you know, most of the people,  everybody listening to the show either uses Skype or and or Google Voice,  which and Google Chat, which allows you to have.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The big question for this show is whether or not it could improve the quality  of this horrible, grainy, pinkish version of BUC.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, we are going to we are going to buy a unit and and just see.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  My theory on that, Jeff, is it fundamentally comes down to the glass and the cameras.  They've put out all these HD cameras that change the connections.  But if they're these tiny little eyeballs that have crappy glass,  you're going to have a crappy signal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It does tie into the the the Logitech announcement  because they also announced a camera using Carl Zeiss lenses.  Logitech actually does excellent cameras for Skype.  Their C150, which is 60 bucks, is a very nice camera.  So this somebody has decided it's funny how the industry all moves  like a school of fish.  Somebody has decided short of absent any evidence  in favor that everybody now wants to sit in front of their TV  and talk to mom and dad.  This is what everybody wants to do.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  And not only the Cisco announcement, but I don't know if this one  is kind of sneaked by the other day, but the T-Mobile MyTouch  that they announced has a front facing camera and it has phone  to laptop video conferencing.  And that's one of the first ones that's doing that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's like FaceTime, but with standards.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's and it's again, interoperable.  And I think that's been the barrier up until now is that FaceTime.  Where are these APIs Steve Jobs promised that are going to supposedly open this up?  So now if video conferencing is, as you said, really moving forward  for the whole industry, then that's the in my opinion,  the thing that's going to open it up.  So the fact that it works with Google, with the Google Voice  and Google Chat is actually a good thing for the Cisco UMI.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is the price a nonstarter? I think it is complete.  Yeah, totally.  Nobody's going to do this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's expensive in that box?  I mean, the lens, yeah, the glass.  But but how expensive can it be?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Unless there's some super secret sauce.  But see, even consumer consumers don't say, oh, this looks so much better  than the twenty five dollar solution.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's oh, grandma, I can see all of your wrinkles.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. So now one thing that didn't sound so hot in the demo  of the Google TV was the audio.  And maybe they're using expensive array mics to get a better audio.  Because, you know, I'll tell you what, if you're sitting ten feet away  from the microphone in a big room, you're just going to sound awful.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Which demo is this?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Logitech Google TV demo.  They did demo it.  And at least in gadgets at all, it sounds terrible.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  I think that's ultimately going to be the impediment for this living room.  Lean back Skype.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Everyone's going to have lapel mics.  I mean, what do you have a shot under a mic, a directional?  Well, you could get there are mics that  in theory could give you a good results from ten feet away.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  I don't know what again, it's going to have to be directional, right?  I mean, that's what's so expensive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would say, grandma, move a little to the left.  I can hardly hear you. What is it?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, Sonny, you're as a TV producer.  I can tell you that people will always forgive you bad video.  They will never forgive you bad audio.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that funny? Yeah.  And certainly we spend a lot of money.  And one of the reasons our attractive video has these enormous microphones  in here is because we want good sound.  And we sent Gina and Jeff six hundred dollar  microphones so that they they look and sound good.  Those are very expensive countrymen microphones.  Yes. And they do sound good.  But, you know, I don't know, I could say I would, you know, well, we will.  Look, we're going to have to buy one just because if it's better, we'll we'll use it.  But we'll so we'll let you know, we'll do a demo of that.  Now let's talk to about the meat of the matter, which is  Logitech also had an event in San Francisco today  to show their new Logitech review, which is their Google TV device.  Becky Worley couldn't be there for the event, so she snuck in early  and got a little demo from was it from Google or from Logitech?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  It was from Logitech.  And it was it was great to see it in action.  And the idea here is this is the set top box or the box that's going to sit between  your devices and your TV and put the Google UI on your TV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they have a big keyboard, which looks like a standard sized keyboard.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Wireless via RF, so it's not line of sight.  And that connects up the HDMI to your TV  and the cable box or whatever your main video.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The keyboard is RF, but there is a there's a set top box that has in and out HDMI.  The in comes from your cable box and the out goes to your TV.  So it's kind of interposing itself between your TV and your source. Right.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  And obviously, what it does is it consolidates all of your content,  as we've seen with the Google TV UI, and it brings information from the web.  You can see you can search for something and it'll give you results from the web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here he searched for Top Gear.  He's got YouTube. He's got stored stuff on the DVR that requires a dish DVR.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Right. It doesn't search your DVR if you don't have a dish.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It also searches programming listings.  So you can see BBC America will have it today at three.  So all of those showed up.  And I presume you could set a DVR if you had the dish DVR set a DVR recording,  playback DVR recording.  Or now, can you watch YouTube on this?  Yes, you can. Oh, what a surprise.  Is that a Google product? I think it is.  It also has picture in picture.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  And so you can watch in the small window while you watch YouTube videos or you can tweet apps  like Twitter or any of the built in apps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm scanning through this here.  So it's got Pandora.  It's got Netflix, although the Netflix interface is not  the most recent Netflix interface.  It's the old Roku version one interface.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Got the Amazon video on demand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like that. Got to have that.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  And you know, my postulation after seeing this is the problem.  And I go back to what Steve Jobs said when he was asked at D8 about Apple TV.  He said the problem with set top boxes and getting involved in TV is a go to market problem.  People are not conditioned to buy set top boxes.  They presume that they'll be subsidized by the cable company or by your provider.  And so people won't shell out money for that.  But when I asked Logitech about that, they said, you know what?  Our most popular universal remote, the Harmony One, costs $150.  That's really the starting point for them.  They go up to $500 and they think that the sweet spot is about 250 bucks.  And guess what? That's what this box and this keyboard cost.  And then you can get it subsidized if you get it with Dish.  But the point is, they're selling this as a remote with some Google stuff on it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Although there's a free iPhone and Android app that is pretty sophisticated.  In fact, if I skip ahead a little bit in your video.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do I get to get past all this keyboard stuff and just use my phone?  Yes, but then you still need to buy the...

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if you're not into the keyboard and I mean, did we not see this?  Well, it reminds me of Web TV. Web TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks a lot like Web TV. But wait a minute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here, Jeff, watch this. This is the Android interface, which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We asked you... Let me actually...  Before I talk about the application on this, let me actually show you some pretty cool things.  So let's say, you know, somebody else is watching TV and I am browsing YouTube.  And I find a video that I want to share.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  On your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So all I'm going to do is press this video and I want to share it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is the standard Android interface. You see all the sharing stuff.  Oh, I want to share my Harmony.  There's Harmony as one of the sharing items.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  This is cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's now going to the TV.  Is this a full browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Looks like a full browser.  Yeah.  It looks like a regular YouTube. That's awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is.  So he sent basically a YouTube page to his TV, kind of like a Chrome to a phone.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  It's basically like flicking it to your TV.  And if your TV is off and your components, like your receiver, are off,  if you do that, it'll turn all of your devices on.  So I thought that was kind of...  That's interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it knows about your devices because it's a Harmony remote, basically.  Now that's a free app.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  The app has to be in conjunction with the Logitech review box.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you spend the $299 on the box.  Now you can control it.  Now this is Android. And they said iPhone too, right?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  You saw that on the web. I didn't ask him about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, they may not.  You know, they have to get through Apple's approval process.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me ask two questions.  First, is there one winner for me?  So in the end of the day, I have Roku box now.  I have not yet opened up my Apple TV box.  And now there's this.  Is there any reason to use more than one because of the deals they've done with programmers?  Because of what?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Why wouldn't I use this if it has Netflix, Amazon?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't have ABC, NBC, CBS.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  No, no, but I keep my...  But the way it is right now, oh, I see what you're saying.  So one content provider.  So they've just got the internet.  Is there any reason that...  It's not a la carte yet. You can't do a la carte yet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Yeah, but I'm still...

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  The way Google positioning this is pretty smart because they're unlike Apple TV and  unlike the Roku box and unlike the upcoming Boxee box.  They're making it as an add-on to what you already have.  So like if you have...  Especially with Dish Network, which they have a nice deal with.  But even if you just have a regular cable provider because of the HD in and out, you  basically make this as an intermediary device.  Kind of like you used to do with TiVo back in the day or whatnot.  So this is their kind of stepping stone because I think they realize that people aren't quite  ready yet to move to just having...  Killing cable and just having whatever content is from the internet on YouTube and Netflix  and whatnot.  So this is kind of a smart position for them, I think.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Okay.  So here's my next question.  So I have...  I'm wacky.  I may have all three of those boxes or four of those boxes because I'm doing this, but  I may have more than one plus a cable box plus a DVR plus something else.  And this thing has one HDMI.  Do I now need to get an HDMI switcher?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you're going to have all those anyway, you want an AV receiver.  They actually showed you an AV receiver, Becky.  I saw that in the bottom there.  Absolutely.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  And I think the ideal way that this would work is with this Dish Network built into  it because that's the way it's...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's currently set up.  Let me show you one other thing.  Now you have to tell me if this is what I think...  If I'm looking at what I think I'm looking at.  So this is the Android application.  He's pointing at the TV.  I just pressed this one button.  It says watch Google TV.  And right up here on the TV set, which is turning on now because...  It's going to come on.  Yeah.  It's 1080p.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Yeah, I asked him about that specifically.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's 1080p.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  It's 1080p.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's big.  Apple 720p.  Roku Box promises 1080p but is not yet 1080p.  That's big.  I think that's more important than maybe people would recognize.  You're now going to have high-def quality video on here.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I specifically asked him.  He said absolutely 1080p.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's something Apple can't do right now.  Roku can't do right now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So do I return my Apple TV before I open it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Now, let's talk about what it can do.  So the Apple TV, this is what you're going to...  I think we are still in this crazy Tower of Babel world because you're going to need a  big form with check boxes in it.  Apple TV does two things, iTunes and Netflix.  That's it.  Roku Box doesn't do iTunes but does do Netflix, Amazon, a bunch of channels including Twitter.  You can watch news shows on it.  In fact, anything that's a podcast you can watch.  Actually, though, with the iTunes, I guess if it's a podcast, you could go through the  podcast interface.  Then Google TV, which has pretty much the same partners as the Roku, they said Hulu  is being blocked but they're negotiating with Hulu.  It sounds like Google TV is likely to have the largest set of additional partners, including  HBO as a partner on there.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  This is an issue of really making deals and who has the power of collusion is maybe a  strong word, but the power to get everybody together on this.  It may take a Google to do it.  It certainly doesn't seem like Roku or one of the other hardware makers has been able  to push the tides in one direction.  I would have said until now Roku was the leader on this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm starting to think now that this Google is going to move ahead.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  They also have an app, a deal with CBS.  An app is what Molly Wood said.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Interesting.  The marketplace is not yet on it.  They say soon in 2011 of the Google marketplace, which means you can add apps.  Two negatives, two big glaring negatives.  One, $299.  Apple TV is $99.  Roku is $99 or less.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Expect a subsidy.  I bet it will come down to $149.  I think the price point has to be under $150.  I agree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  $150 is a sweet spot.  Two, it's complex as hell.  This is what Apple is selling is new.  Well, Steve says you don't want a computer.  You want a TV.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  If I can go back to that remote issue, that's the only way that they can get people to program  it.  But see, people already have to do that.  That's the problem facing the living room right now for the consumer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My wife hates me because she says I can't watch TV.  I just want to watch TV.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  That's where I think it's not one UI to rule them all.  It's just give me one freaking remote to rule them all.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't want the remote to be six feet wide.  True.  Well, you can use your phone.  It's a damn surfboard.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  You can use your phone.  I think it has to be the phone.  I mean, the Apple TV also interacts with the phone.  It's so much better than the Apple TV remote, which is that little undersized thing, which  looks great, but it's really hard to type anything on, obviously.  So this thing would be great for typing on, but who wants to have a keyboard sitting on  their coffee table?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you assume that everybody will have a smartphone, Android or Apple phone, that will  work with these things?  Can they just say, well, look, that's the universe?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, except that I'm the dad and I have the phone and I'm in the room and somebody else  You have to leave your phone on the coffee table.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  I'm guessing, and I don't have confirmation on this, but based on the way that Logitech's  projects work, I'm guessing that all of their Harmony remotes will control the review box.  At least you may not have query input, but it'll at least allow you to change channel,  go to the guide and do some of the basic directional functions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what, I like the idea of maybe an iPad that I leave on the desk.  Right, the iPad now controls the Apple TV.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  They just released that app like last week or whatever, and soon the Android tablets  will be able to, or Google OS or Chrome OS.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Of course, that's a minimum $500 remote control.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google's other specialty these days is voice.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  They showed that off, Jeff.  I'm glad you mentioned it.  They did.  Unfortunately, I didn't get it on tape.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Instead of you, me, it's Gumi?  Gumi?  No, Gumi?  Gumi interface?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  No, he basically said, price is right, into his Android phone by hitting the Google Voice  actions button, and it pulled it right up on the Google TV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got Dictate, but it all, okay, so you can dictate, and it looked like it did a pretty  good job with the demos I saw.  Like you would literally would say, and we've seen the Google phones now do a very good  job I think.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Yeah, especially when they're cross-referencing a database, it's a known universe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Price is right.  Right.  It's going to be, there's a much more constrained possibilities.  It's Star Trek time.  And it has an available camera.  It has all those additional features which work with Google Chat.  So you don't need, I think Gumi is kind of the loser in this one, the Cisco Gumi.  For $299, I guess you have to buy the camera, which is another $150, I think, something  like that, from Google.  They had the whole price.  You know, you can go to the website.  Logitech put this all up ahead of time.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  But because it's an ecosystem, there's nothing to say that there couldn't be some future  consolidation.  What about the front-facing camera in your Android phone being the camera you used to  talk to grandma and you see her on the set?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now I'm holding a microphone and camera right next to me.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  I think the real weakness of this Logitech box is actually the fact that Google TV is  a platform.  You know, it's not one box in particular.  So soon, in the next couple months or whatever, it's going to be built into Sony TVs.  It's going to be built into Sony Blu-ray players.  So why do you buy this $299, even if it's subsidized, why do you buy this $150 box when  you can either get it in a new TV or get it in a Blu-ray player?  I think-

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Or get it in your Android phone.  In a sense.  That's exactly right, Jeff.  They're going to market apps that are much more expensive that will control your Sony  TV.  That will be Logitech branded that are running, that are Android apps that will run all of  your other devices.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What other manufacturers, Becky, are announced to be making Google TV boxes?  Sony has an announcement next week.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  That's the only one I know for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  At the Google I.O. conference, they announced Sony, Dish, and Logitech.  Those are the three players.  And then President of Best Buy was there to accept bribes from all three.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Well, I think Samsung's going to be in a hell of a place because they have their own  app store and they are going to end up having to make a tough call.  They put a ton of R&D money into that already.  And if they're not going to accept the Google TV UI, they're going to be out on a limb.  And I wouldn't want to be making that decision.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the Amazon app marketplace also makes sense now.  Because it's so ubiquitous?  Well, Amazon's a brand we know.  And Amazon can get you to get to all their entertainment through their app marketplace.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's interesting.  But what you don't want is more fragmentation.  And that's really one of the things we're really headed towards is more fragmentation.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Geek Squad wins out big on this one.  Oh, man.  Just the installers are going to go crazy.  Their little black ties are just twirled right now.  Oh, I'm so excited.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's job security.  So $299.99.  You can order it now.  When are they going to have it available?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  End of October.  It's pre-orders now at Logitech and I believe at Best Buy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK, Leo.  I ordered it already.  Rice lets you buy one thing.  Just one thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  My wife doesn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the problem.  OK, go ahead, Jeff.  I understand this is a hypothetical.  What are you buying?  What do you want?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  People are going to come to you and say, Leo, what do I do?  Apple TV, Roku, Boxee, this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I really like the simplicity of Roku.  I think Roku beats Apple TV, at least for me right now.  But I have to say, I think the potential is here for Google TV.  The thing that Apple TV didn't do that I was disappointed was have apps.  Now I suspect we haven't heard the end of that one.  I think there's 8 gigs of storage on that Apple TV.  We already know you can install apps, there's just no app launcher.  It's a simple firmware button to push for Apple to make apps on this thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And at first your apps are probably resident on your iPad, then go through Apple TV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, apparently there is some facility to do that.  That's another way to go.  I'm glad I don't have to choose, Jeff, to be honest.  I don't think there's a clear winner here yet.  But I think that the...

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Becky?  Well, it's a good question, Jeff, because I feel like I'm going to have to make this  decision advising on Good Morning America.  Like, okay, America, if you've got to buy one thing for holiday.  And what I will say is I feel like we're back to the format wars.  And so in the transition space, while they're fought, I actually think this Google TV Logitech  device is the best consumer choice because it solves two problems.  One, it's an all-in-one streaming solution that may very well be future-proofed enough  to take us into the next three, four years.  Secondarily, it solves the universal remote problem.  And I think that if it can consolidate those two issues, it's worth the investment, especially  if it's subsidized by your satellite or cable provider.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And there are two USB ports in the back, which unlike Apple USB port actually does something.  You can hook a camera up to it, among other things.  IR blaster support, HDMI.  Yeah, this is...  What's interesting is it's also a big win for Logitech's Harmony line, which we've said  for a long time is absolutely the best remote control system out there.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  There is no doubt it's the best.  It's still too hard for the average consumer.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  This is the power nerd's choice.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Becky, you're right.  It's the decade of the blinking 12.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We're back to that?  No!  The fact that ECRs didn't figure out early on how to listen to a signal to get the time  and just put the damn time in.  Right.  And how many years did it take for the consumer electronics industry to get there?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  And in every household, there's only one person who knows how to program the damn thing, and  it's like a ball and chain.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because you're the one person I take it?

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  That would be...

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Have you guys seen the Sony Google TV remote that I think NGadget had pictures of yesterday?  The ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life.  This looks a thousand times better.  This Logitech remote looks much much better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sony, it's baloney.  This looks like something...  Well, it looks like a remote control vehicle controller.  I mean, it's crazy.  You've got that AR remote flying around you.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  You've got some sort of plane that it's controlling while you're watching TV.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What, Gina?  They felt like functional designers rather than consumers.  Put that in there.  Put that in there.  Put that in there.  It's all in there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The keyboard looks a little Kindle One-ish to me.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  That's exactly it.  They took some sort of a gaming console controller and they glued it to the Kindle One bottom

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  half.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  Ew!  Ew!  That's exactly what it is.  Ew!

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Poor Sony.  Yeah, I think Sony's kind of out in the cold on this one, to be honest with you.  Every TV manufacturer is going to put something like this into their TV, and that's the other  problem is that I don't think consumers, if they have a TV that does something, are going  to buy something else.  So now you've really got a fragmentation of the market.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What you have to have...  I think Becky's on to the point here.  You have to have some hub controller for all your stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you don't though if you get a TV with Yahoo widgets or you get a TV with the Samsung  tools.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the same...  But you're also going to still have a DVD player for a year or two.  You're going to have...  Right.  But those are...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do believe those will fade away.  Maybe even...  I mean, one can hope the cable box.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right, but that's what I'm saying.  That's where I think the hope is now.  The exhaustion of hooking up one more thing is too much to bear.  I agree.  So you buy the TV with it installed.  That's what I'm saying is...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  We agree.  If you've got this stuff, you're not going to...  I don't care if something has better features.  You're done.  Yeah.  So we're going to have this very fragmented market.  Now, who this benefits, I think, is people like Netflix and Hulu because they're going  to be in the driver's seat.  Everybody is now calling on Hulu, right, MG?

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  And saying, okay, please, please, please let us have Hulu.  Yeah.  Hulu is the one.  They're kind of...  Everyone is after them right now because that's a big differentiating factor.  Everyone it seems like has Netflix.  Right.  Netflix turned out to be too easy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hulu did the right thing.  They held out.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  I think one big differentiating factor that's going to come into play, and you hit on it  a little bit, Leo, but if Apple launches apps for this, and we already know that Google  is going to launch apps for the Logitech box and all the different Google TV platforms,  a lot of people might end up buying these set-top boxes just to get apps.  The wild card there is how you actually control these apps.  Do you use an iPad to do it?  Can you imagine using that keyboard thing to try and play a game on your TV?  Do you have to have another remote then to do that?  But I think that will be really interesting in the next six months to a year to see how  that kind of comes into play.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Stories today are that Apple TV is selling so well they can't keep it in stock in some  Apple stores.  It is a hit out of the box already with as many as a million units sold already.  So they may just have the momentum.  If they can pull in apps, maybe they can win that way.  I love this battle, by the way.  First of all, it's great for us because we've got something to talk about.  Press loves horse races, right?  We've got an 18-player horse race here.  But it also is good, I think, for consumers in the long run because the competition, I  know it's confusing initially, but the competition will, I think, wring itself out, and we will  get a low-price good solution eventually out of all this.  I hope we do.  This is where we're headed.  We're heading toward streaming content, period.  There's no doubt about that.  It's also very good for people like me and TechCrunch TV and anybody in Fast Company  because as internet content providers, we're suddenly at parity with NBC, CBS, and ABC.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By the way, have you done deals with Google TV and Moxie and all these kinds?  Just Roku?  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What does it take for you?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You should just be there.  Why is a deal even necessary?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll tell you, on the Apple TV, you plug it in, you go to the podcast section, we're featured.  All of our shows are there.  It's very easy to play them.  We are on the Roku box because our partner Mediafly's deals with Popcorn Hour, Roku box,  and Yahoo.  There is a Boxee content plug-in, I believe, so we will be on the Boxee box at Ship.  That's a third-party content plug-in.  I don't know if Google, we even need to do anything for Google TV.  You speak into your phone, you say, this week in Google, and presumably it would pop  up and you'd play it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It either Listen or your Twitter app, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is a Twitter app for Android.  We have apps on all the platforms.  I think that anybody wants to play in this space, it's really a very low barrier to entry.  I don't think you need to do much.  That's where the search, see, Google is smart because you don't need to curate, you just  allow people to search.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Ah, so then there's the question, where does Facebook play in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It always comes down to Zuckerberg.  Everything comes down to Zuckerberg.

Speaker: Becky Worely
Transcript:  I asked about that in the Google TV and they said you just go to it in the browser, that  they didn't talk about it in the apps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They have a full browser.  Yeah, but I think it's reversed, Becky.  I think that the powerful thing here is the social search.  I've been arguing in one of my really boring PowerPoint slides that there's new spheres  of discovery of content, right?  So brand used to be it.  That's the way media still thinks.  As we go to the programmer's schedule, we buy the magazine, we buy the newspaper.  That's a search, reverse that.  We ask the question, if you got an answer, you're there.  If you're not, you don't exist.  The more powerful force that comes along is, of course, the human links.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, imagine instead of living in Google TV, you live in Facebook TV.  That group that you just started, MG, if it's a group of my friends and I can see who's  watching what, we could be discussing True Blood while we're watching True Blood.  I think that's very powerful.  That's where it all goes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's where it takes off.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting.  The guy who's leading Facebook groups is the same guy who created Hot Potato.  Facebook acquired them.  And that was kind of one of their thing that they were doing.  You could check into watching a television show and have conversations about it.  So that's kind of interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that's so key for both discovery and socialization of the event and for creating  things that are social.  It all starts to come together.  The stat that I throw out regularly is that Schmidt says that Google causes four billion  clicks a month to publishers.  Bitly passed that mark a few months ago.  That's interesting.  Apple's to come quads, I admit.  It's not all the publishers.  But you consider Bitly is only a fraction of Twitter and Twitter is a fraction the size  of Facebook.  So the human links become the primary means of media discovery in the future.  It's not brands.  It's not curators.  It's not search.  Each of those will still live and have a major important point.  But the market share is going to go more and more and more to human links, peer links,  interaction or analyzing what we're talking about and seeing heat there.  It's a John Henry moment where the humans win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Becky Worley is going to leave us.  She has to get ready for TNT.  Tech News Today is coming up in about 20 minutes.  So Becky, thank you for your coverage of this event.  We're glad we could get your video.  Thank you.  Thanks for having me.  Thank you.  Becky Worley reports for Good Morning America for ABC News and is of course a regular on  the Twitter network as part of our tech news today.  Bye, Becky.  I see you.  And is the executive producer of Twitter.  While Becky repositions, we is that what it's called repositioning?  I don't know what that's called.  We're repositioning Becky for her next gig.  I'm going to quickly take a look at our sponsor Gazelle.  They do a great job.  If you've ever seen Gazelle and helping you get rid of the gadgets you're done with.  Gosh knows there's plenty of gadgets in our lives today and plenty more that we don't  need.  You could recycle them.  You could give them to friends.  You could sell them.  You could try to sell them on eBay or you could get zeal.  Don't sell them.  Gazelle them.  It's the easy way to get cash for your gadgets.  Got an iPhone 3 you ready to get rid of so you can buy the iPhone 4.  Let's just put in the iPhone 3 GS.  You just put it in the search, the search bar here.  You say let's say I have a 32 gig 3 GS.  Does it make a call?  Yes.  Free of water damage?  Yes.  Perfect condition.  I have all the cables because I am that kind of guy and it is worth $222.  Here's what happens.  Gazelle sends you a box with a return mail label.  You throw that in and anything else you want.  The Gazelle experts go over it, make sure it matches your specs, remove all your personal  data, and then they send you a check.  It's that easy and you're already there to buy in that next iPhone, the iPhone 4.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot com.  Lots of other reasons to love Gazelle.  For instance, some of your gadgets, let's face it, have no value at all.  Gazelle does recycling.  Their Gazelle recycle network is made up of responsible recyclers.  Folks who don't do landfill.  They don't use child labor or prisoner labor.  They take care of your stuff.  They're approved by the EPA.  Gazelle recycles for you as well.  One more reason to love Gazelle.  If you've got a charitable cause, a school group that you need to fund, you don't have  to have a bake sale.  Have a Gazelle gadget drive.  They will create a personalized gadget drive webpage for you.  You send your donors to the page.  They send their gadgets to Gazelle.  You get the money.  Easier than a bake sale and more rewarding, less expensive than having an event.  I love Gazelle.  Lots of people have used it.  We've used it many times now to get money for a lot of stuff lying around the cottage.  Go to gazelle.com.  Don't sell it.  Gazelle it.  If you use the special code TWIG after you've got all your items put together, you get a  5% bonus payment on your used gadgets.  You can also get cash or get an Amazon card.  They have other ways that you can get more money back for your gadgets.  I really love Gazelle.  I got to do this.  It's so great.  I have so much stuff sitting around.  I got to do this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We all do, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My wife's going to go through every closet I have and just send it all without my permission.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, she should.  You get this one box and you throw it all in the box and you send it to them and they  just send you a check.  It couldn't be easier.  Gazelle.com.  We thank them for their support of this week.  I'll have to stop her from sending my Newton in.  No, you're not getting my Newton.  I don't think it's worth anything anyway.  Let me just say I've got a curiosity.  It's kind of fun.  Just go to the webpage and play with it.  Newton Message Pad 2100.  Let's see what that's worth.  That's just the one I got.  Power's on, free of water damage.  It is in perfect condition because I never used it.  AC adapter, rechargeable battery.  I don't even know what this stuff is.  Let's say I have everything.  It is worth $81.  I'm kind of surprised.  Hey, that's pretty good.  There's this graph at the bottom that shows you how the value.  For some reason, in August, the value of the Newton went up.  Wow, $87 for some reason, the projected price, and then it dropped again.  But get it before it, because it's projected to drop to $3 next month.  So if you do have a Newton and you don't want it, sell it now.  I love this.  I'm not sure how that works, but that's so cool.  They have price history, today's price, and projected price.  Anyway, enough of that.  You're watching Twig.  MG Siegler is the heavy breather in the background there from TechCrunch.  Is that me?  Yeah, I think it's you.  Just move your headset down or up or something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or calm down, MG.  Just calm down.  I'm so excited.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  I'm about it.  I need Google TV products.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's from TechCrunch, and we love him.  TechCrunch.com also here.  The great Jeff Jarvis back from traveling around the world.  He's got his eyes propped open with toothpicks right now.  His website, buzzmachine.com.  He's also the author of What Would Google Do?  A great book if you're interested in what Google's up to, and a professor of journalism  at the City University of New York.  Gina Turpani is also here from her home.  Maybe that's you breathing heavily.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is it?  Uh-oh.  Usually I'm the heavy breather.  So, you know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Turpani is smarterware.org and fastcompany.com.  Let's see.  I guess we could talk about other stuff.  Are we done?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Any last thoughts?  We've got seven new Android phones from...  Unbelievable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, tonight we're going to be doing a live broadcast from CTIA in San Francisco.  Start at 730, and we will be showing you all the new phones at CTIA.  Oh, good.  Unbelievable array, including the Droid Pro, which somehow Motorola kept secret for the  longest time.  It's obviously for the BlackBerry fan.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Weren't there some numbers published about Android this week?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's my number of the week, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, sorry, sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We don't mention numbers around here.  You like the Droid Pro?  That looks just like a torch to me.  That's a Motorola device.  BlackBerry focused.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's going to be Verizon, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep.  AT&T had three new Droid devices.  I mean, if I'm Apple, I'm going, okay.  You know, it reminds me so much.  I've said this before.  I have no great insights.  I know so much of the PC versus Mac wars, where you could buy a PC from 8,000 manufacturers,  configure any way you want, and you can get an Apple from Apple, exactly the way Apple  configures it.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Did you guys see the...  Broke a couple hours ago, I think.  Wall Street Journal has a story that looks suspiciously like it was leaked by Apple,  that the Verizon iPhone is definitely coming at the beginning of next year.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Journal seems to be Apple's place of choice for leaking information.  Well, it helps when Steve Jobs takes his helicopter to Rupert's retreats.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And his hat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did he wear his funny hat?  I don't know.  Strange top hat that he was wearing.  Yeah, so Verizon will get the iPhone.  I mean, if it's Apple, at this point, I think we can say that Android is putting so much  pressure on Apple.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Right.  I think, I mean, if anything, I think the timing of this potential leak, whether it  is or not, is directly correlated to some of the news that came out today, which I think  Jeff is going to talk to.  Yeah.  That's what it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  I like the array of names for the new Motorola phones.  You've got the Bravo, the Citrus, the DeFi, the Droid Pro, the Flipout, the Flipside,  and the Spice.  I'm surprised they don't have a Poshie.  It sounds like the village people.  Sporty.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sounds like the Spice Girls.  Or the Posh.  Yeah, the Poshie, right.  Better than Posh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bravo, Spice, Citrus, Spice, DeFi, Spice, Droid Pro, Spice, Flipout, Spice, Flipside,  Spice, and Spice Spice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Another one who can sing.  They don't need to.  Seven Android phones, three Bluetooth accessories, and that's just Motorola.  Boy, you know, didn't, and I'm wrong, but didn't Motorola a few years ago say we're  getting out of the cell phone business entirely?  I'm pretty sure they said that.  And well, they're back, baby.  Did HTC also announce a bunch of phones?  I'm sure they did.  It's kind of stunning.  It's an onslaught.  Skype for Android is out.  I installed it immediately.  Now those of you with the Android phones on Verizon already had Skype mobile.  But for those of you who are Android users not on Verizon, now you can make phone calls  via Skype on Wi-Fi or 3G.  Absolutely free if you're calling another Skype client and very inexpensive as usual  for the Skype out to phones.  Long time coming.  Yeah.  Is there any reason why I would use that instead of Google Voice, which does kind of the same  thing?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You got the transcribed voicemail and all that stuff, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Google Voice has more functionality.  On the other hand, if I'm calling a Skype caller, I mean, it's good to have that.  Right, right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Google Voice does use the proper phone line, right?  And it's kind of just data?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right, your minutes.  It counts towards your minutes.  Oh, it does.  That's right.  Okay, there you go.  That's a compelling reason.  So this does not count towards your minutes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it works well.  It's good.  You need a strong 3G connection and there's no skippy-ness or echoing.  It's been good for you, Leo.  I haven't had a chance to try it yet over 3G.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I haven't called anybody with it myself.  Who calls anybody anymore?  I know.  I haven't made a phone call in years.  Yeah, no.  What are you talking about?  It doesn't work.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And also with Google Voice, you get text messaging, obviously, free text messaging.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this is nice because it does see your...it goes through your contact list and shows  up in the Skype.  Let me see if I can get an image of this here if I can.  It goes...where is that?  Where is that?  I know it's here somewhere.  There it is.  I've got to find the camera.  So this is Skype.  It's got...you see these are my Skype contacts, but this is all my phone contacts from my  phone book.  You can do events.  And it runs, by the way, all the time in the background.  So it's always on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There you have it.  Fring is still around.  This was the wonky choice for people who didn't have Skype.  And as Fring is now doing one penny calls.  So they're trying to stay relevant in the Android space.  I presume that's a penny a minute.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, except that you don't want to set up your payment information.  Like, it's cheap enough, but it's like, oh, I have to just set up my whole credit card  to pay Fring.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Most of us have either credits with Skype or with Google.  I have credits with both.  Let's talk about market share.  Chrome's market share triples.  Number of the week.  Okay, I won't say anything.  I thought you...how many numbers do you have?  That's it.  That's the only one.  Well, no, he was...okay, MG was talking about phone penetration, not browser penetration.  Oh, I was talking about sales.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  The assaults of the numbers, you know, like that.  But are they one of those salesmen?  We can just do it now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's do phone penetration then.  What are the numbers on the phone penetration, MG?

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Let's see if I can call up the newest ones.  They're huge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  We've seen stuff sold in the last quarter.  If you take total sales, Apple will still be able to say, oh, no, we have pride of price  in total.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here it is.  32% of sales were for Google, 25% for Apple, 25% for RIM.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's 82%.  I wonder who those other 18% are.  Windows?  Nokia.  Nokia?  That's in the US, right?  That's not worldwide because it's very different worldwide.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So is that the first time that Android sales have topped RIM and Apple in a quarter?

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  I think the key here is RIM.  RIM was the one that was still ahead.  You know, I think it was last quarter that they officially passed Apple, you know, by  various estimates or whatever.  But yeah, RIM is the big one now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's huge.  It's a big milestone for Android.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In January, they had only 14% and now there, and Blackberry had 34, iPhone 32.  And so now you've got Android up to, what did I say, 35%?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There's a great story in Newsweek about Android.  What's his, I don't know, Dan Lyon at Newsweek, but Andy Rubin has some really good quotes  just about the messiness of Android and the fragmentation and the multiple handsets versus  the iPhone kind of controlled experience.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Andy Rubin, who was the guy behind Android.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  And the guy behind, Danger, right?  Danger.  He started Danger and then Android.  So yeah, that's a big milestone for Android.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So he's saying he doesn't like the fragmentation, that that's a problem?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, he's saying that it's, that Android's evolution is messy.  Right?  The fragmentation is part of it.  It's called open source.  Right.  It's open source.  And so there's lots of different developers and lots of different manufacturers all contributing  to it.  And that's just sort of the evolution is a little messier, but that's what it is right  now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Would you say the evolution of Windows was equally messy?  No.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, well, Windows wasn't open source.  True, but it was many manufacturers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the new iterative model.  And that's what's changed entirely in the entire software industry.  That's that thing you were talking about with Facebook.  We don't know what it is.  We'll see.  We'll know when we get there.  And Android's kind of the same thing.  It's iterating.  Whereas Windows, Windows was never, that was the pre iterative stage of software development  where you created something that was, you released full blown, this is done.  And if you iterate, it's inversions.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google defines a list of capabilities that a phone has to have in order to carry the  Google brand.  I'm not sure about the Android brand.  So that's their way of sort of communicating to manufacturers like the phone needs to do  these things, have these compatibilities in order for you to have our name on them.  I think they could maybe, I don't know, maybe they could do a little bit better in that  respect.  They could maybe use their way in terms of like here, using our label to make some phones  be maybe a little more consistent if the fragmentation gets worse.  But that was interesting to me.  I didn't realize that that was the case.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's certainly a challenge, right?  I mean, if you're trying to appeal to consumers, it's the same challenge Google TV will face.  Complexity is always bad for sales.  On the other hand, we like choice.  So it's kind of, choice kind of means complexity.  Apple's got it simple.  It's very straightforward.  One skew, but you don't have much choice.  Google's responding to Oracle's lawsuit, Oracle suing Google over the use of Java for  the Android phones.  I think in Gadgets Summary says it all, quote, Google says Android didn't infringe on any  of Oracle's patents.  And even if it does, those patents are invalid and or unenforceable for a variety of reasons  anyway.  So, you know, shove it.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  Yeah, that whole thing, this whole thing is getting really messy.  Someone is basically suing everyone.  Someone had a good chart yesterday.  I forget where it was exactly, but it's like connecting all the arrows from, you know,  Motorola to Google to Apple out and everyone's suing one another.  I think Motorola today is suing Apple on like 50 different counts for patent infringement.  Microsoft is suing Motorola.  It's just a nightmare.  I mean, this is what they're all trying to get into now.  There was talk that Microsoft might be, you know, kind of not directly going after Android,  but going after partners who aren't building Windows Phone 7 phones and suing them if they're  using Android because they're saying, well, yeah, Android may be free, but you have to  pay us basically a patent fee to use any of these features.  So, you know, maybe you should come with us and not think about Android.  The whole thing is a nightmare right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's something your Germans will like.  This is from Gizmodo.  A murder captured by the Google.  Can this be possible by the Google Street View car?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The dead bodies were.  The dead bodies were just there.  Yeah.

Speaker: MG Siegler
Transcript:  They got rid of them pretty quick, I think, but they were out there.  This is in Rio.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that horrible?  It's horrible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe it's not a murder.  They say maybe this one in Rio is probably a hit and run.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't understand how the Google car got so close to a body laying out in the street  like that.  I mean, you would think that it would be surrounded by police cars.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Must have just happened.  Yeah, but it's covered.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The body's covered.  Oh, no, it's covered in plastic.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they have a different standard in some of these countries.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There was another great story that is up on the, I don't know if it's up on the Facebook  or the friend feed, but it's up on the rundown, which is a view of the value of Street View  and other ways that you imagine that Street View content were used for games.  So now you go from Grand Theft Auto in a made up world to the real world.  You go through the real time square.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like that video that was on YouTube, the HTML5 demo video where they took a song,  you would enter where you lived and then would show Street Views of where you lived.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you go through this real world view and it also speculated that there'll be software  to cut out people, which Street View is looking to do anyway because of the Germans.  And so it becomes more of a sanitized but real world.  My joke is the Germans, when they have the pixelated buildings, if you go through that,  you'll go to Narnia.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Speaking of creepy, Eric Schmidt says, quote, Google's policy is to get right up to the  creepy line and not cross it.  Eric, Eric, Eric.  Will somebody please pull the plug on Eric Schmidt?  He's being interviewed and asked about a Google implant.  That's when Eric says, well, I think implants would cross the creepy line.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Why does he keep saying this stuff?  I mean, it's just like, stop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It just makes me want to interview him.  That's all.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm supposed to see him.  This could probably get messed up.  I'm supposed to see him Friday for my book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hope you get to talk to him.  This is an interview with Atlantic editor James Bennett at the Washington Ideas Forum.  Schmidt actually says some, I think, very right on things about Washington, D.C.  He says, technology can completely change the way government works.  Washington is an incumbent protection machine.  And he says, technology is fundamentally disruptive.  Mobile phones and personal technology could be used to record the bills that members of  Congress actually read.  Yeah, that'll happen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just, you know, put that thing on me and then determine what stimulus funds were successfully  spent.  It's true.  Information is a chance to reinvent government.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But that's a gov 2.0 pitch.  Gov 2.0, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But he's also saying, when I asked him about this at Aspen Institute, a year, summer ago,  and about this kind of disruption, and he said, you know, look at the bailouts.  It all went to the old industries.  And then went to developing the future.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  America's research universities, says Eric Schmidt, are the envy of the world.  We have 90 percent of the top researchers in the world.  We also have a bizarre policy of training people and kicking them out by not giving them  visas, something Silicon Valley has always been, you know, ringing the bell on those  H1V visas.  China, he says, China governs like a large industrial company.  It wants to maximize its cash flow, wants to maximize its internal and external demand.  All of the interesting new ideas, like doubling down on solar tech, can be understood as a  business expansion.  It sounds like a good interview.  I hope you do get to talk to him.  Yeah.  He's in rare form.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's an amazing, amazing, smart guy.  He's always challenging.  And he's willing to talk.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which a lot of people are not willing to do.  All right.  We're going to wrap this puppy up.  First let me get our tool tip in a number of the week in just a bit.  MG Siegler, let me let you go because you probably have other things to do.  I want to thank you for being here.  Great to have you on.  Thanks.  Just love it.  Thanks, MG.  Right for TechCrunch, techcrunch.com.  He's Paris Lemon on all the social networks.  And we really got to come back soon.  Okay?  Yeah.  Anytime.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Really appreciate it.  This is Regina's tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is a really simple Google Instant tip.  Last week, I think right after the show, Google announced that they added a few more keyboard  shortcuts to Google Instant.  You can navigate up and down, not only up and down the dropdown of suggestions, but  up and down the results when you get them.  And then you can hit enter to go to them.  So you can basically search Google now and then go to the result that you want without  ever touching the mouse, which is pretty cool.  So it's just after you do a search, I'm going to do it on google.com.  As you do a search, you select the Google Instant suggestion that you want, hit enter  to get your results.  And then you'll see a little blue arrow on the left-hand side of the search results.  And you can use your up and down arrow keys to move it.  And then when it's on the link that you want, you hit enter and it zips you right there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, that's what it is.  I couldn't figure out what the blue arrow was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is that?  What's that doing?  What's that all about?  Cool.  Any other keys?  Where do they document this stuff?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, it's buried in some help.py file somewhere.  You know, Google is.  Help.py, I love it.  Yeah, it's always like some, you know, Python.  Support.py.  Yeah.  But they did an announcement about it.  It's a pretty small edition, but it's really nice.  It's nice for people like.  If you follow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And they're also showing previews of the pages too soon, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, some people, they are showing previews.  And I think instant within the Chrome bar is also there's some rumblings about it.  The early dev versions are showing up.  So I mean, it's annoying.  You still have to navigate to Google.com to do your search, which we, none of us.  None of us do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  One of the little tidbit that I just put on the list right before the show was that one  analyst is saying that Google instant is already improving Google advertising results.  And I haven't figured out exactly how.  How would they know that?  I wonder.  That's what I wanted to.  They up their revenue projections because of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if you type slowly enough, I guess you see a lot more advertisements, you know?  So you know, I type Leo and now I'm seeing the horoscope ads for AOL.  And then I'm a type.  I don't.  Yeah, I guess you'd see more ads.  Your number of the week, Mr. Jim.  Oh, I'm getting another one out since you stole the first one.  No, we didn't say it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go ahead.  We just started.  That was it.  That's all right.  I got another one.  So there was a there was one.  Some people see as a real puff piece on Mark Zuckerberg's CEO or I mean, COO Sheryl Sandberg  in the New York Times this weekend.  I thought it was actually a very interesting story.  But it said in there that there are 200 ex-Googlers working at Facebook.  Wow.  Which is pretty amazing.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But there's value transfer.  Don't be evil.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah.  But that's I think a lot of the great people like Paul Mouhaite and Brett Taylor and you  know, I was David Corden, a Googler.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think he was he was at Six Apart.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Six Apart.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah, yeah.  But if hey, if this means that they're going to help Facebook sort of embrace the open  web more, great.  Keep going.  Keep going.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It spreads the culture.  Oh, you know, it's not a Google creates a culture for the Internet in the culture expands.  It's not a bad thing.  So that's my number.  Good number.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My tool of the week is something actually Matt Cutts announced.  It's been around for a little while as the Google URL shortener is now open to the public.  You can use this for yourself.  It's G double O dot G L.  Yeah, it's shorter.  It will have stats.  It's very bitly like really in some of its features, but it's not as complete in the  feature set.  But it will have stats.  You can see I haven't used it, but we'll show you when it was created, how many clicks it  received and you can see clicks for two hours, the day, the week, the month and all time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you're not beholden to Libya.  Do you see what just happened?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  BIT.ly is registered through the Libyan.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so two sex related URL shorteners just got shut off under Sharia law.  Oh, really?  Yeah, VB.ly, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Violet blue service.  And then and was there another one?  The Google shortener too will give you a QR code.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, geeks.  Automatically, which I really, really like.  Yeah, that's actually a nice feature of it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So what's the G the dot GL?  I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a good question.  It's the land known as Google.  I come from the land of Google.  If anyone deserves their own domain, it ain't it them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's the twit dot TV QR code.  I like that.  Yeah, you know, I was I was thinking for a while many years ago, I wanted to start a  service called your daily action item.  D.A.I. dot L.Y. and just I mean, I like the domain name.  And then I realized I'm going to have to go to Moammar Qaddafi to get it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  GL is Greenland.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Greenland.  See, that's safe.  That's safe.  They're never going to say unless it melts.  But that's it.  Yeah, I was getting confused.  Greenland is the one that's icy and Iceland is the one that's green.  It's very it's not right.  There we go.  There you have it.  There you go.  It is this week in Google, this portion of this week in Google brought to you by my good  friend and I just want to give him a little plug here.  Tom Johnson, who does mail route, mail route dot info.  It's the best anti spam engine for people who have their own domains.  If if you use Gmail, you don't need it.  I'm telling you right now, I'll just save you some time.  But if you have your own domain, as I do, Leoville dot com, mail route is fantastic.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What was the number again, Leo?  One more time.  How much spam you got last year?  I don't have it here somewhere.  It's something with a million pieces.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was a million pieces of spam that it blocked that never even went on my server.  And we got Tom Merritt using it for his sub brilliant.  He started he has sub brilliant done and he's had it for years.  He never he created a mail mail server and everything could never use it because because  there was so much spam on it.  So we've got it going through mail route.  And already, I think I just saw the first stats have come out from a sub brilliant night  was like 98 percent spam.  So you get spam protection, you get virus protection, too, because, of course, you know,  that's often attached to the email disaster recovery with their mail bagging service.  It is a really neat service.  If you have your own domain, if you the simple test is if you can change your MX record or  you know someone who can, you can use mail route.  And I think you will like it.  Two dollars per seat with a minimum of twenty a month.  But if you go to mail route dot info and sign up as a Twitter listener, you'll get 10 percent  off for life.  I've been using it for six years now and I love it mail route dot info.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  I thank Jeff Jarvis for being here, the author of What Would Google Do?
