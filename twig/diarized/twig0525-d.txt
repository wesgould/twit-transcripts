Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the other side you mentioned in my palms sweat because if you're a fear that you're looking over the edge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was great. It was just beautiful my first time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you were at the Grand Canyon, did you do they have rules against drones?  Sending drones out and getting footage allegedly to have rules, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, but no, I didn't I didn't fly the drone this time  Okay, I did take the dogs and let the dogs run around and they enjoyed. Oh, so you let the dogs out I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been wondering who let the dogs out and now I know  And it's great to have you here both sitting on set and working at twit and sitting behind me  Right over my shoulder. That's right. So everything that I enter on my computer in our office  I am you have yeah, you have the ability to  It's great to have you on today, thank you and yeah, so I mean I'm just gonna say right up front yesterday  It was this thing you may have heard of it  It was an Apple announcement and I feel like as every year it happens  Apple  Sucked like a vacuum the news out of the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Power for some reason how does a company have that much power, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know but they did it but we do have some news that we can talk about  We'll probably get a little bit later get into things that might touch a little bit on what Apple talked about  but we should probably start with  This whole antitrust thing because there's a bunch of threads happening right now as I was looking at the rundown  There's all these different pieces moving  The Justice Department of course is already probing Google and you can add to that an antitrust investigation  That was just announced 50 states and territories  Announces an investigation on Monday. They say Google dominates all aspects of advertising on the internet and searching on the internet  That's according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. They're focusing on the online  Advertising aspects to start they also have complaints on search result rankings  protecting personal information a whole smorgasbord of everything that we you know read about in the news lately as far as what Google's doing badly  They say Google poses an  Allegedly very good. That's important. Google poses a quote existential threat to our virtual marketplace  Now what's interesting here, yes, is that every state is included and except Alabama and California

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's in 50 states 50 states and territories they had to throw in two territories to make up for the states, right? Yes  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which I mean in and of itself though, that's a whole lot of involvement from all directions  But you know, obviously Alabama and California out on that  Piece of the pie piece of the Android pie  What do you think Jeff? I mean, this is just yet another pile on happening right now. Well, I'm of two minds  Yeah, so Facebook is also under this kind of alleged scrutiny

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another story there about about Amazon  We have the far right going after the tech platforms because they think they're being used by the tech industry  We have the far right going after the tech platforms because they think they're being not nice to them  We have the left going after them because they're big capitalistic companies  We have a generalized media tech lash going on with a newspaper or magazine publishers suddenly becoming lobbyists  Which makes me very uncomfortable as a journalist trying to get protectionist legislation and regulation going on  So that's the atmosphere in which the time this happens. I'll come back to that in a second, but  Having said all that and I'm I'm a I always get worried about  Regulators going after the internet and our freedoms there  I have long said and long said on the show that the one area where Google is  Vulnerable is in advertising. They do control tremendous  part of the advertising market  they  Have a kingmaker's role there. They bought double-click years ago and were perfectly allowed to do so  though some said at the time it shouldn't have happened and  So yeah, there is some weakness when it comes to advertising and the question is what evidence is there of Google using his power in Europe?  They went after Google. They're still going after Google for  Its placement of shopping ads. That's ridiculous because shopping means hardly nothing in this  You know, they're way off the mark as far as I'm concerned, but but an investigation of advertising. We'll see what it yields  So that's that's part one  Part two is another piece in here that says  From Yahoo Finance. We need more monopolies like Google, right? Hmm  And I really like this piece by by Rick Newman a senior columnist at Yahoo Finance  Who just talked about how?  Yes, they're going after him. Yes, Elizabeth Warren was to break up all the all the big tech companies  Yes, Trump has attacked them but he says if Google is an abusive monopoly then we need more abusive monopolies  Consumers clearly love being ripped off by Google ranking it constantly consistently near the top among consumer brands  Consumers don't seem to have a problem with Google's business model, but regulators sure do  Yeah, and and goes on then a little later after the story continues button and says that you know  If you're gonna go after  Companies, maybe you should go after Equifax which just today told everybody who thought they were gonna get 125 bucks from them for their for their  Illegal horrible acts. No, no, no, no, no, we're gonna make you walk through glass and steamy lava to get that money  I walked through that glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I clicked through there many many many things that they made you made you click click through to  To get the money. I don't expect that. I will get any of the money  No, but you just wasted $125 worth of your laborer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly your time. What is it worth? Well the way you're paid there. No probably up to a little more  Right, so so why are you know evil companies like that and Wells Fargo  And companies that really do abuse their employees like in this column Dollar Tree and Dollar General and flower foods and extended  Say and so on so forth and and you know, they're almost treating the companies as if they're tobacco companies  But show me the harm and that's that's my final point here is that is that I am among consumers I see no harm  I see nothing but benefit from these companies and especially Google  We can argue about Facebook. We can argue about what you think about Facebook  But Google straight out is a service company that provides tremendous services for free without harm to consumers  Benefiting consumers what's really going on is all the old institutions of society  Economic and government are threatened by the internet and now they're fighting back against them  And now I fear what's gonna happen to our freedoms and their spiel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think is more of an ignorance about the internet or a threat because every time we saw something in the in the court system  What have you?  Those leaders and like they knew nothing about the internet at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an important point and I think you're right that's kind of the beginning point, but I think basically that ignorance  Leads them to get used as tools of those who want to fight down the net and its freedoms that includes  Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say my colleagues in the newspaper business and magazine business. It includes politicians who fear that  Movements can now rise up against them and they can and campaigns can rise up against them  It includes  But but here's one thing I don't hear  the advertisers  Complaining I could be wrong. Maybe I'm listening the right places  But I don't hear them screaming bloody murderer about being abused by Google and that's really if they're going after an antitrust and advertising  That should be the victim  Consumers are not the victim  advertisers all in all aren't the victim there and they're in open marketplaces with with  Open bidding and they're getting a hell of a lot better deal  They ever did media who's complaining or media because media were too damn stupid  So in the one sense you're right aunt it's the politicians were stupid  But then that stupidity gets exploited by my stupid colleagues in media  Who didn't know how to create a new business in a new reality and are now are resorting to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think  Reading through that that Yahoo the financed Yahoo piece  I realized that is the conundrum that I have found myself in when I kind of go back and forth as far as how I  Feel about all this stuff and and I feel very hypocritical at times because on one hand like of course  I don't want a company to abuse its power  Anticompetitive behavior is you know, I would I would not say well  That's a very good thing to be any competitive like I want things to be fair  And so I would push for that at the same time and so when I look at Google, you know  It's very easy for me to see why someone might get that feeling  Lacking any solid evidence like there's a lot of feeling going on right now when it comes to technology and I just feel like they're bad  I just feel like they're doing bad things and so therefore we need to crack down it on the other side of it  I am a very loyal Google user  Yep, and I enjoy all of these services and obviously I enjoy it enough to stick with Google. Otherwise, I would have left  Left Google for something else and so it isn't it hasn't hit that tipping point to where I'm like  Well, it's serious enough or I've seen the evidence that I need in order to pull that true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Believe it or not people or some people are happy with Facebook  Yeah, with the with the results that they get for a lot of advertising  Facebook with their business and things like that or yeah, you know  there are some people that are happy with it regardless of some of the  Interesting practices that they may have in place

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you know, I think all these big companies all of them have interesting practices  Facebook for and that's where I begin to also feel more hypocritical right? Like I did step away from Facebook  I don't have a Facebook account anymore for whatever reason in the in the field of Facebook that was  Motivating enough for me to step away and and close my account  But if I really compare what these services are doing  There's there's a lot of overlap a lot of similarity. Why why would I as a user give Google a pass and not Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of hard to like put my finger on it. You condemn. Yeah, what why why yeah  I was gonna try to do the logic. I buy my lost my logic there. But yeah, what's what's so awful Facebook's rep got awful in  Media and they screwed something up royally  But I've also saw a piece recently that said that the whole Cambridge Analytica affair was way overblown  There was no real harm there Cambridge Analytica was a bunch of flim flam men who weren't really doing anything  And the there was an abuse of Facebook's rules and that's gotten blown out to the point that Facebook is now considered evil  But with a full disclosure, I raised money for my school from Facebook  I'm independent of Facebook received no money personally from any of the platforms and the disclosure. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anytime algorithms are involved it's you might as well just assume  That you're a number and don't really count and and there's gonna be some shady stuff here and there just I mean Amazon  It's just as bad. Yeah. Well, yeah, and in fact, you know, talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon is in the news for this very thing. They're being investigated by the FTC for anti-competitive behavior  As well, you know, apparently merchants are being interviewed about you know  The percentage of business revenue from Amazon versus other marketplaces the extent of Amazon's power over suppliers  Which is all early stages, but like and I feel like in all of these cases the feeling that I get is  the overarching feeling is  I'm afraid of what this may lead to  I'm not quite sure what it may lead to but I'm afraid of how big these companies are therefore we have to do something  At the same time aren't you afraid of what regulation would mean no, no, no, and I'm not I'm not saying like that I that I buy  Into that I'm entirely because I think a part of me might you know, just out of straight fear  I think it's just driven by fear  It's like we haven't seen companies of this side in this magnitude with so much direct influence and and kind of control over how people  Connect with each other and live and live their lives in an integrated way  So that uncertainty just can be scary in and of itself not knowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't think they're that much in control of our lives that presumes you don't have agency you're not making decisions on your own  To you think maybe the Facebook  Investigation could be politically motivated by a certain person who hates  Washington Post maybe who also likes to get Air Force jets to land near his resort so they can make money. I  Not proposing but maybe yeah  Something there maybe your point about being a number  I'm actually gonna gonna push back a little bit on that one because as you said that it was an interesting point  but  Google big giant Google  Knows me as an individual serves me as an individual knows my preferences serves those preferences  Throwing my own field under the bus again big old mass media still treats me as a mass  Still treats me as as in fact a number only one of millions and giving me no  Sense of individuality and personhood and instead so in a sense, it's the algorithm is the tool that enables  About the the personalization  Individualization let's call it of these services to give me greater value and relevance as opposed to  Big old mass media where you're just the same as everybody else  I buy that about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  So yeah, I don't know I know where where this where this leads to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Other than many many many months of discussing the progress of these cases

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so sick of them. We probably are going to get very sick of them  The EU, you know and everything that happened in the EU as far as antitrust. Do you think that's a template here?  Do you think we're gonna see similar outcomes?  The law is different

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What you have to prove the EU could just go after you because you're just too darn big  And the US you can't do that you've got to show that there was  proper use of a market  Monopoly there was a monopoly be there was that there was an improper use of it and see that there was harm to  Consumers in that Europeans don't require that harm test

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Europeans you can just harm competitors and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  US you have to actually harm consumers. Okay. All right, so then maybe not as much of a template

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but but Carson in this case in the Google case the consumer could be the advertiser rather than  Shopper. Yes, correct, correct. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gonna have to wait and see gonna have to wait and see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, and in the meantime, we need more monopoly monopolies like Google. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but you know I thought about that I was really you know  As far as I go trying to defend the internet from from these scourges  I thought that was a really gutsy way to put it. Yeah, it was just was to buy into it and say, okay  Fine monopoly good. Look what comes of it. Let's have more. I kind of like that. I think it was gutsy lean into the monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lean in it's a monopoly. Well, you look at China

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How can a way ball and we chat do all the miraculous things they're dudes because they're their government  Enabled monopolies and they get enough  consistency across the marketplace they offer phenomenal services

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Phenomenal yeah, it's a kind of crazy what they can do. Absolutely  Let's take a break when we come back. We'll talk about something that  Well, I bet is near and dear to my heart and I think probably all of us we can talk a little bit about  some of the pixel  Leaks that are happening  Things feel very similar now as they did  Yes a year ago when suddenly we knew literally everything there was to know and that's kind of where we're at right now  So there's a lot of fun to be had

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very upset. There's no Chromebook pixel leaks. I'm very upset. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hasn't been a one. I haven't seen what yeah, I haven't seen anything on a pixel book  Not not lately and I don't know I don't know I kind of assumed there was gonna be something  I've seen anything we will talk about that and a whole lot more first  Let's take a break. Thank the sponsor of this episode of this week in Google and that is worldwide technology  WWT began building their advanced technology center ten years ago. It has grown exponentially ever since it's like no other  Testing and research lab the lab contains more than a half billion dollars in equipment  From hundreds of OEMs and key partners ranging from heavyweights like NetApp Cisco and VMware to emerging disruptors like Tannium  Equinix and expanse WWT is a trusted partner who stays with you over the years  Many of their customers have been with them for over a decade because they know  WWT is where they can go to get the answers. They need to make their business run, right?  Their ATC is an incubator for IT innovation offers a number of things on-demand and schedule  Labs like NetApp cloud volumes on tap on tap on flash NetApp disaster recovery as a service along with hundreds of other labs  Representing newest advances in flash storage  Multi-cloud hyperconverged infrastructure cloud data management and a whole lot more you learn about products before you launch  WWT's engineers use these environments to quickly spin up proofs of concept and  Pilots using the sandbox so customers can confidently select the best solutions in many cases  This will reduce concept time from months to weeks which increases speed to market in the end  They offer lab as a service which is a dedicated lab space within the ATC  And this is where customers can perform programmatic testing using the vast technology ecosystem that WWT has already built  And it's virtual so you can take full advantage of ATC's unique benefits anywhere in the world  24-7  WWT engineers work in these labs every day. They're beta testing new equipment. They're building reference architectures  and custom integrations to help their customers make decisions and see results faster and with much less investment and  The time is now WWT has finally launched their new digital platform encompassing the ATC ecosystem  This ecosystem creates a multiplier effect of knowledge speed and agility  Anytime anywhere around the world for their customers so you can get access to articles case studies hands-on labs and other tools that make the difference  in today's fast-paced world  You can learn more about  WWT the ATC and sign up for access to their new on-demand lab platform by going to  WWT.com slash twit  WWT simplifies the complex that's  WWT.com slash twit  WWT is delivering business and technology outcomes around the world and we thank them for their support of this week in Google  All right, so we got the the big antitrust scary  Topic out of the way. Let's get to a little bit of fun stuff here. Let's get it to all the rumors and leaks  Yes rumors leaks and my goodness. There are many rumors and leaks actually last night and then this morning  I've seen two full like  4k videos. Do you remember a year ago?  Before the pixel 3 we started like a month in advance ahead of the announcement  I don't even know if the the announcement was announced yet  You know that there would be an announcement and suddenly we started seeing these these highly produced  Reviews of the pixel 3 that had not even been announced yet, right?  And I think there were Ukrainian based in many in many cases. I was thinking European, but you may be right  Yeah, somewhere. I can't remember exactly where I was thinking the Ukraine back to the Russians

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ukrainian  Estonian something Estonia. Yes, that's right. That's only a slight difference. But yeah, we have area. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was just kind of crazy  It was like everybody was like that  Well, this can't possibly be real like they must be just working off a prototype or or they've created a fabrication based on rumors  Blah blah. No, they were on Google's mailing list  Yeah, something something happened there and a number of them got it because they all had content to share on YouTube  Well now we're there again and it's happening with the pixel 4 this time it seems to be happening with Vietnamese youtubers  At least the the two videos that have appeared in the last 24 hours are so you can find one of them by the channel  NMTV it's a six minute video full 4k resolution. I mean it's pretty much just gives you everything  Everything you need to know about the the new pixel 4  Excel and you know kind of goes into some of the the features  So, you know the the full body design the software features the redesigned camera app  It shows the smooth display which is a toggle so you can turn on 90 Hertz refresh instead of 60 Hertz  Screen attention which knows when you're looking at the display to keep it on versus when you look away  Then it will actually allow it to time out that sort of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder about that that ambient control and you know  How much juice is gonna be used with that as well as with the the refresh rate?  Yeah, kind of the battery aspects of something like that because I know with this last I can't speak  I know with this last update to my old pixel  Battery life has just gone up exponentially. Okay, but I don't have all of these extra sensors and yeah features like this  That the pixel 4 allegedly will have right this so the solely radar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much is that gonna require? Are we gonna go back to bad battery life now? I hope not I don't  I don't think you can go back to bad battery life like nowadays people are very used to a certain level of battery performance  And if you don't get it, that's going to well, you're right. Andy Caprio

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that just so I saw so I normally drive my horribly long commute so I have the phone plugged in  I don't really get sense the battery. So I updated it. So today I've been home working working at home  This I can I call this work by the way  and  man, they barely took a took a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Molecule off the battery chart amazing. It's amazing. I've forgotten to charge my battery at night a few times  And you wake up and you're like, yeah, it's fine. And then I get to noon the next day  I'm like, oh, I didn't charge last night, you know, yeah, it's it's really a big difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My 3a has gotten through two days. Nice  That's fantastic. That's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's really good to hear and you and you like you said you've noticed a difference based on what it was on pie  Versus where is on Android 10 like noticeable difference totally different. That is awesome  I just I feel like battery is so important like we've all gotten somewhat more  Accustomed to good battery or you know battery that that lasts long enough for that fast charge or whatever that it's really hard to go backwards  On that it's just one of the most important key features. We know what what caused the most of the improvement in  Battery life. Well, that's a good question actually  Now night mode  I know that would be a component. I'm not running dark mode. I want it. You know that  Yeah, I don't know, you know  Nothing comes to mind as far as like and this this is the one thing that is going to improve your battery on your device  I just think they're always improving it. You know, they're always coming up with ways to  Wisely throttle down certain aspects of the phone  Not using certain things if it happens to be, you know the doze mode from a couple of years ago  Which maybe it's not even called doze. That's right  I don't even know if it's still called doze  But you know that I think has improved over the last couple of years so that when it's sitting on the table  It's just sipping right on on your battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is your fear that that now that it's the pixel 4 is gonna be always awake looking for your your gestures and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just keep using more juice now, that's my opinion. Yeah, I mean I would I would hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  especially with the solely  sensor like I  I'm hoping that they've done enough with that to kind of dial in a very nice kind of low-energy  Mode that to go along with that, but I don't know how realistic that is. It's a radar. I don't know how battery  Thirsty is a radar, you know, that's that's what that's part of your phone. I have no idea to be honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One thing I noticed just this morning with ten  Is when I pull down my notification screen it actually says one day  Three hours on my battery Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you pull down your note, I get like it says when I when I pull down the notifications

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh-huh. It says at the at the top right hand. It says one day three hours  So it's actually and it's and this morning it said one day when I when I woke up it said one day six hours  and that was  So like that was eight six hours ago, so okay, I'm gaining time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Beautiful yeah, I wonder what's going on there. That's interesting  So, yeah, so we so we see the devices leaking entirely and I imagine, you know  Google at some point here very soon has to announce their event, right?  Like it would help us out they did a really  We want to know I'm gonna schedule it for sure  but um  It just it just it's interesting to me that a couple of months ago  We started seeing some of these major leaks and immediately Google comes out and says yep, that's it  You know, it's like they embrace the leak and they were like, yes  Let's not you know, try and pretend like it didn't happen  Let's embrace it and they were applauded for that like people were like, yeah, that's doing it right were but I'm the cynic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still say that they're sending that you think that you think that this is all intentional. It's all in yeah  That's that's the that's the next level of marketing. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's level of marketing. So you're saying that  Google is sending out things to rabbit TV  Yes, Thailand. Yes  Cuz you go that's that's that's this the station that just next year will be Peru you go totally totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rabbit TV 50 subscribers by the way, I think I think this is tie  Yeah, it looks totally obscure. Yes  So yeah, I think this I think this is stuff sneaking out of their new factory in Vietnam  Yeah  They're moving stuff out of China and and so now they've got whole new security  Issues to deal with and so they got phones walking out of walking out of their I didn't think about Vietnam

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, do you think do you think Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Enjoys this sort of press? Oh, yeah any press is good press, right? Yeah. Yeah  Maybe oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm always kind of curious like obviously people are talking about it and everything but it but then again like I'm not inside the company  Orchestrating this grand like really schedule  I think I mean at this point you just kind of assume if you're in that position that something is going to leak

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or that this is going to happen. I think they would enjoy this especially when you have a huge competitor  Just up the road

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's you know what? That's a really good point when you talk about timing  All right to full money videos hitting YouTube literally a day after Apple's huge event  There's some there's some interesting timing there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hadn't even considered that and that's not the first time that's happened. They did that last year totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You might be right actually there's some really kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they're teaching at Stanford

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd learn a thing or two from the Ukrainian leakers from last year  And then other things that we know now as far as what's going to be  offered on these devices there is  There was news last week  I think it was that  Assistant would be able to step in for you when you're on a phone calling you put someone and something that someone puts you on hold  So we'll be with you in 10 minutes or whatever they put you on hold instead of you sitting there with a phone  You can assign assistant to sit in your place. I mean, this is brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Welcome to 2019 it's nice to have something futuristic finally, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I know it's kind of like it's like it's like beating them with their at their own game  It's like you put me on hold I put you on hold  Then they come on and then they get the automated response that says you're on hold, please. Hold on  Jason will be with you shortly or whatever. You don't hold. Yes. I don't hold for you. You hold for me  No one puts puts me in the corner  Also updates to night mode to include the ability to take shots of the nighttime sky

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry sky, that's a tough feat computational  Photography Google has done that like no one else and night mode has been really really good and you're telling me there's gonna be an  Improvement to something that's already really really good. Yeah, I can't wait to see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and of course Apple, you know in their iPhone they introduced yesterday their kind of night mode upgrade  And it looks looks really good  Looks like really good results  So I'll be you know, like I can already see the shootouts  Mm-hmm the shootout articles videos that are you know, like comparing the two  And you have shoot out right and I have much faith in Google's ability to impress with their night mode and just with the camera  in general, I think I said

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The last time I was on this week in tech  The fact that Google was was getting this type of performance out of a camera that has one lens  You know, oh, yeah now they're getting multiple lenses. I I can't wait. Yeah, I'm curious to see what what the secret sauce is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, yeah so much of what they were doing a a yes the quality of the one lens that they were using  And the sensor in there but but be so much of that is just the computational aspect  And so you add more lens combinations and more information and everything for Google to play with  That's gonna be a big deal. I can't wait. So I'm looking forward to that. I think the the improved night mode will be cool  I went on a hiking trip a couple of weeks ago  And while I was there in the mountains had this beautiful night sky with with stars and super clear and everything  I was laying out on a rock and I took my  pixel 3  XL and put it in night mode and propped it up, you know on the rock and had to like very carefully touch this the shutter button  Although so you know because I didn't want it. Yeah, I didn't want to shake at all  I could use the hardware button, but then it would shake so I had to like set it up just perfectly  I ended up getting a pretty decent night time shot  I think it held the shutter open for like 10 seconds trying to let in all that light and you can actually see the stars  There was no smearing and everything and it looks decent there  Let alone what an improvement might make where maybe I could pull in, you know  More details of like the Milky Way or whatever those like subtle light shifts that you see up in the sky

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's really curious a lot less noise. Yeah, it's gonna be nice. Yeah, you do know that there's a countdown on your shutter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Countdown on my shutter. What do you mean? Oh, so I could take it and like do like a timed  Tap it and yeah, I didn't think about that. I didn't I didn't think about that. I  Was I do that with my DSLR?  Just Sam is mr. Good idea Karsten is mr. Mr. Laporte listening photo show maybe  I think you have some information to share here  Also a new motion mode for the camera for  Yes, okay. Well, I mean as far as I can tell from the rumor anyways is that you know fast-action  Motion stuff like you know in this in this screenshot someone playing, you know football player or whatever  a  That the camera could actually take that shot and and capture it clearly  Clearly and be being able to it makes comment of being able to blur the background have a sharp foreground  To get that like stretched across the field DSLR  Shot where everything is Christian. Yes  So I don't know I don't know how it's going to pull that off because right now like that just that just a channel  It's computational right now. We do that in a standard portrait mode  But that requires you to be pretty close to the lens in order to pull it off  So, how do you do that when you're shooting a football player all the way over there on the field? I have no idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, having that extra set of lenses is definitely going to help from a you know, optic standpoint  But yeah, I'm still putting my chips on the computational side of processing it for sure, you know  Because it's a standard  Process a lot of photographers are doing every day and Google Google can use their you know  Machine learning to figure all of that stuff out and say hey, this is what most sports illustrated photographers are doing  So, let's see if we can mimic that no different from any other engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's gonna try it wouldn't it be cool if the phone in your pocket could eat well the camera of the sports illustrated photographer, right?  That's probably where a lot of Google's conversations around the stars. They say small they have that okay, okay  We can do that. What can we do to make that happen and the phone, you know?  Similar to the iPhone that has the kind of square the iPhone 11  You know the whole series has the square camera array on the back. Mm-hmm  Some of them have two cameras back there. Some of them have three the Google camera is square as well  Yeah, I believe it's gonna have three cameras, right? It's gonna have the names three and then a flash three and then a flash  So one of those is gonna be some sort of a zoom some sort of an optical  Telephoto so that might come in handy for something like this right in order to get a little closer  Don't be shy  With the Google pixel I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will say I was never a fan of portrait mode on  either of the platforms whether it's iOS or Google I was never really a fan because  Most people took the portrait mode too too quickly and they screwed with the details  You know, it would blur out  Ear and stuff like that and that's because everybody's just thinking alright  Let me get that cell phone real quick and they tap it not necessarily  Considering you need to be still and let the AI think for a second. Okay, this is what needs before you hit the shutter, right?  See, I never even considered that it even I want to say at one point it would tell you hey hold still or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, and then hit you because you're right cuz the AI needs a little probably needs a little bit of time  To analyze the scene and know what it's about to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, for portrait mode it'll it'll have you take the picture and then move it move your camera just a little bit up  Yeah, so that so that it can get that depth of field and for information  I don't think you're gonna have to do that with two lenses  Because you'll have the one lens you have the additional hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have the triangulation you need exactly. I don't feel like I ever have to move my phone though when I do portrait mode

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every time I've looked at it because I've I try not to use it because I struggled with getting the perfect focus on whatever  The subject is and most of them I just fix it in post myself. Yeah, but it tells you hey you need to hold still  Alright, find your focal point. Okay now shoot and if you're off just by an inch  It the process and gets messed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, everyone's I do know what you what you mean when like a portrait mode shot goes bad. Mm-hmm goes awry, you know, everything was  Like oh that does look like a DSLR and then when you really look at those edges you see that tiny little sliver of sharpness  Coming through or it just looks like a bad Photoshop around the edge or something like that. So I know what you mean  I've just never noticed in the camera UI that it's ever told me to like shift the camera or  Typically says like focus here or something like that. I remember way back when a couple of years ago  there was a there was a portrait mode that acted entirely off of  The oh, yeah, I do remember that yeah  Where it was like take it and then it it actually guided you right lift your phone and then that was how it  Figured out what I do remember that out and thankfully it doesn't do that anymore  Yeah, yeah, I don't know I don't know if there's much of that anymore person still using

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steam-powered trio

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nexus six

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Nexus 1a that doesn't even exist or the yes, right  so  Anywho, I  Know I'm excited and will continue to be excited because this is probably the next phone that I'm gonna call my own pricing pricing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're looking at another thousand dollar phone folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How could how could it not be in that high range?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Apple to the Apple just play a little game by lowering their price a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did lower it going up prices, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The same or slightly lower. Yeah, I don't think that they shifted to monumentally but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But still I mean they have you know over a thousand dollar versions of the iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're at a point of no return when it comes to phone pricing. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I yeah, I don't know that we're at a point of no return, but we're not at a point of it stopping  You know the note 10 is still like they have two versions of the note 10 now and  The lower cost one is still three digits and the higher cost one is four digits  So they're still like it's still that that point that price point that they want to get in on and I kind of see Google  Shooting for that as well because they're gonna have the solely radar on board that they can say, you know  Is  So incredibly valuable and the multiple cameras and the fact that it's our premium phone and so yeah  I don't see why not but I would love to see it a little bit less expensive. Of course, I'm so tired a thousand dollar phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what?  So how much did you spend for that laptop or does somebody spend for you for that laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a laptop. I think this one was about  2200 somewhere in that area right and you use the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  far more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Than you use a laptop. Well see, let me say this. I think I mentioned to you with the note that it it sort of  Validates its pricing because of all of the extra like AR stuff that they have built in even though it failed for you  It didn't work very well for me  But any dimensional the three-dimensional rendering that that it was trying to do that's a lot of computation  Power needed in a phone so that justifies the price because you try to do 3d work on a laptop  You need to spend you know a couple thousand dollars more than likely  Graphics processing and so forth. Okay, so  Yeah that phone I use it all the time, but it still doesn't justify a  Thousand dollars when all it's doing is is pictures and a little bit of post-processing for me  I can't render video the way I would like to or render graphics the way I would like to you know, but  Samsung give them credit. They're trying to you know, bring something to the table  This that says all right, we got all this horsepower let's use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Samsung brings a lot to the table sometimes a little too much kind of like, you know  Because I think that so many consumers would would buy one of one of their phones and yes  It offers all these things including like what you're talking about 3d modeling  But who's gonna do that?  The majority of note users are never gonna do that most people are not but I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Creators that would love to be able to have an object sitting right here on the table be able to digitize it  Yeah digitize it and put it into their next project that they're working on for a client. Yeah for sure within minutes  You know for sure big

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be nice. So yes, I do think though that we're looking at around a thousand dollars for the top  That would be that would be my guess here  And then right right before the show. I read an article by Ryan Whitwam at Android police  Who wrote about how the Apple Watch series 5?  Is just showing how how much of an embarrassment wear OS has become over the years the Apple Watch  Continues to just dominate as far as wearables are concerned. We're still is this yes where OS still exists. In fact that IFA  Was it fossil?  announced five different sub brands Michael Kors  Standing Armani, you know all these updates of fashion watches essentially  We're talking about this on all that Android last night that wear OS has really become the platform for fashion watches  Because that's all you really see happening and wear OS anymore  Samsung has moved to ties in for their right there major watches the other technology, you know  Manufacturers of phones they all tried their thing with smartwatches  They might put out one smartwatch here and there but they're not as focused on as they used to be  All right, and that might not be a bad thing because they were just creating phones on your wrist, you know  They weren't very good looking which people require in a watch. So, okay fine  So then it's fashion fashion brands that have up an OS platform to put you know on their smartwatch lineup

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need to look into that a little more because I like watches as jewelry  I actually have a watch if I don't have it on today, but I normally wear a watch as jewelry and I've always wanted something  That looked good, but also had the simplicity of telling time and and giving me a few notifications here and there  And it's companies that were able to do that  They're no longer here because they didn't look good, you know, but what was that? Right? What was that watch company?  And I think they got bought out by Google but from all of the functionality it was there just simple notifications  But when you looked at the watch it looked like the old-school Casio. Yeah  Nobody wants to wear that as a piece of jewelry are you thinking about pebble pebble pebble? That's it. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right pebble did a good job and so look at the Apple watch  Do you like the square kind of aesthetic of the Apple watch?  I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily say that I find the Apple watch 100% like the most the the perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look of a smartwatch not perfect, but I think it's better than what we've seen in the past  I still like the square. Okay, especially the larger face because it looks better on a wrist with larger hands  Yeah, what phone do you carry it? This is a pixel  Two I think or three one of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're you're an Android? Yes, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a pixel something something. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's right pixel for I will wait until the pricing goes down. Yeah, I don't want to do a thousand dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't justify that Google if if history has shown  So taught us anything Google definitely discounts the prices on their pixel if you're willing to wait a couple of months

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Four months something like that or you could just sit under Leo's desk and hope you drop something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know you work a twit now that very well could happen that could actually happen that is a scenario that has  0% chance

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how it goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so you Jeff based on what you've heard as far as the pixel I may have asked this last time because I feel  Like the pixel 4 comes up every time I'm on the show. My apologies if I talk about it too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what do you think I'm gonna talk about what I talk about too much  Which is that for my limited budget?  my  Blessed and I love it  Pixel book is gonna go and I'm sure I fear soon. I need a new  Highest end Chromebook. So that's where my money's gonna go. So I'm very happy with the 3a  Yeah, Barry 3x la. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pixel book has been serviceable for you for you, right? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Suppose superb. I've been on  Sorry, I don't know when the when the first not the original Google pixel or Google Chromebook came out  But but I've been on this probably for four years three or four years now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is the original one the the one that's like kind of has like a metal like a  Metal casing or is it though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but it's it's like that it's yours. Okay. Okay, so this is I had the prior one. This is two years old

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think right. Yeah. Yeah, this one is two years old last year was the slate this and then before that  Did they skip a year and then prior to that they had the so I remember the Chromebook pixel the Chromebook pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think they went pixel pixel book after that. I believe that's how yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's that's definitely the direction that it went. So  Yeah, I mean I'm on the pixel book obviously right now and I've like who was it that asked me here a couple of days ago  I think Anthony asked me like are you are you itching to upgrade?  I'm like, I don't feel like I need to like this thing's still rocking two years later  Like I can't I can't tell you of a situation where I've opened it and been like  Like it's it's fine. All right, it never reminds me there's never a reminder that it's that it's two years old  It's totally fine. I don't like the slate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well slate was was your BAME late had its own issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I wouldn't necessarily say like it being outdated and slow was was one of them  It was just from a usability standpoint. It was just it just didn't make a whole lot of sense  so I'm happy to be back on the on the pixel book, but  I'm I I would imagine that they're gonna have a pixel book update for you Jeff. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think what's gonna happen not good for me. It's behind you knock some wood

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Feel I feel good about it though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What has been knocked? All right, let's take a break  We'll thank the sponsor of this episode and then we'll get into some of these other this this mishmash of news  Because there is some news in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got to talk about and I found I found a new Instagram account with a little tiny dog that carries big sticks  We could do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I saw that video or I saw one of them where the dog was trying to get through the little passageway and kept

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On his lot of those are dumb dogs. This one this one makes it through no  No, that's what I mean and eventually right like yeah trying and then figures it out that we don't need news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can do dogs with sticks if I knew that was an option man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stuff all right. We got Bosco and his big stick boss on the rundown  The best video is there Bosco he has his own

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instagram account all right Bosco loves big stick. I'm curious to know if this is the one that I saw on Twitter  I'm not really doing a whole lot of all these day these days  But I saw this one I stuck with it because it took about a minute for the dog to get through are you seeing it Carson?  Okay  Okay, he's logging in he's liking it. He's subscribing. Ah yes  This is the one  This has an entire account I didn't realize that when I saw the tweet  I just thought it was a funny video, but no you can follow this dog  Day and night this is what happens when Apple  As we can Google turns into dog videos, but it really is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bosco really wants to get through these pillars. You got it. They got a bit. Let people see how Bosco gets through

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do it you got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at this little guy look at him go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Screw that other dog and I'm out of here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of reminds me of of the the Grinch the dog in the Grinch with the  Reindeer yeah the reindeer horn

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bosco's cool now while we're on this okay the other one to look up Carson is my Aussie gal  my underscore Aussie underscore I love her gal  There's one of the dog doing Jenga you seen this no I've not seen this  The Jenga the Jenga dog then we'll okay  So does someone work with their dog for like weeks and months on end to this young woman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How to do Jenga and then create a video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are really smart dog these Australian shepherds are really smart the one right there right Jenga right there  So you can go to Jenga  There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There we go, okay now it's a dog  Sorry audio listeners. There is a dog  Sorry audio listeners. There is a dog panting at a stacked Jenga tower  pulling a piece  Slowly no it is it is that dogs just really good at playing slow going really really slow because when you play Jenga  You don't just want to like tug a piece  How on earth what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm struggling just to stop Kylo from eating my socks and this kid this dog is playing Jenga. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was the famous dog that went down up and down the hill and its own sled, but well, that's for winter  All right. All right, we made up for Apple time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So apparently I need to get get on Instagram more often and subscribe to accounts like these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think this social media stuff is bad see what you're missing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I feel it  Should I should I then point out that that there was a nasty like Instagram?  Thing that was going around that basically an easy hack using HTML and a browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hack has always been a screen you can do a screenshot. That's what they said. That's what Facebook said. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's basically the same as like doing a screenshot. It's like well, no, it's linking to the actual file  That's hidden by the private. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mean, it's a little weird three bylines on this. They're treating this like it's some big  Investigation that you could you share a photo with somebody they could actually share it with somebody else

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No  Yeah, I mean I see I see what you're saying like I don't follow it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But isn't it just someone taking a screenshot and resharing it? No, so what it is is using HTML

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're able to get a link like okay if I follow someone's private account. Mm-hmm. I can get their image using HTML  I can take the link to that image and share it with someone else who is not following that account  And they can they can link to it  So it's basically just take a screen shot just take a screen  Everybody's the same world around right?  Oh because it's linking to something that should be behind a wall that prevents people outside that becomes a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got you took three bylines to do come on BuzzFeed. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You said it will ever be Mike techno panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Stacy's not here to yell out before

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did you guys think about Facebook dating that would be no that would be no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not using it. I can't use it. Yeah. No, I mean, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  None of us is using Facebook dating for those who aren't aware basically Facebook  Is rolling out the dating app in the US? Of course, you know the taking on the likes of like ton  thunder and tinder  tumble  thunder Bimbo  All of those  Matches will not include your Facebook friends. So that could have been awkward. They are not allowing that to happen  Also, there's an option to limit to only people where no friends are in common. So really I think the big privacy kind of  Potential here is you're on Facebook dating. You don't want your friends or people who know  people who know you to know that you are on there for there to be some awkward moment where  Suddenly meet someone then you realize oh, wait a minute your so-and-so's brother or whatever, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can appreciate Facebook trying to to  Cut the web a little bit. So it's not not as interconnected  But yeah, it's I got a hunch that's still gonna come back and bite you in the butt, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably bite somebody in the butt. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know how many times it's gonna bite you. There's so many people on Facebook. Yeah, there's so many people that are connected  That don't realize they're connected because that's true. Mr. Jarvis has my contact information and and  He has miss Stacy's contact information, but miss Stacy doesn't have mine  But now she could probably get my contact information because of mr. Jarvis and yeah, you know it  Why wouldn't this be any different with the Facebook dating thing because there's so many people out there and it's so many ways to draw that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the interconnectivity the six degrees of separation six degrees of Kevin Bacon  There's apparently a secret crush mode or feature  You can only you can you have a limit of nine crushes, right?  And that's the kind of feature where like I add you as a crush you add me as a crush  We are both revealed to each other as being crushed, you know having a crush on each other and yay  we can fall in love and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Live happily ever after I don't know what's interesting is the business of this match.com stock went down  I think I saw five percent last week, you know with this coming out  It really was the only game out there and you look at it's another thing newspapers used to have. Yeah personal sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey kids in my day  Swipe to find somebody you turn the page

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Classified ad for dating  But it's true. It was a whole section that doesn't really it was it was huge. It was well wasn't huge money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wasn't like jobs, but it was it was sizable money for publications, especially alternative. Absolutely  and and that's all gone now and so Facebook's going into a  basically monopoly market  With match.com and now we'll see what happens. Yep  Yep, well enough to remember when online dating had cooties  Had cooties like playing you don't do it people. Yeah, you didn't do it. No, you know  You obviously found someone from you just simply from your charm  illuminating the streets as you walk down and there there a woman I  knew  Who lived in Japan when she left that was the case when she came back  When she came back everyone of her friends have found their mates with online dating she kind of looked around and said wow what happened and  and the the the norm  Just changed like overnight. Yeah, it really did and it makes perfect sense  You you know, you don't have enough people in your pool. You're busy working all day. You don't want to date  You know there you and and so to find new people it made perfect sense the way to use it and it lost its cooties

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quick. Yeah, interesting. No, I know exactly I  Remember that  96 I can't remember if I already told this story on this  I have this like weird deja vu that I already told it on this week in Google  but in 96 I met my girlfriend in IRC and  She lived in Montreal. I lived in Idaho Boise  Oh  You both geographically undesirable. Well, but she had dual citizenship and so so we like  You know got to know each other over the course of a couple of months  Online and eventually, you know kind of talking to each other and everything and then she invited me out to Montreal  All right, and at no time had we ever exchanged photos of each other  We were just kind of trusting that we were telling the truth  right  and this is 96 and  So when I told my family that I was gonna get on a plane and go to Montreal and meet this girl  I'd never see a picture of you know that I had met on the internet  Which was very new to most people at that point in the shock and horror. Oh, yeah friends and family  We're like you're gonna get murdered, right?  It was like such a stretch for me to do that, but you know what I time movie  All right, I wouldn't have ended up in San Francisco. Yes  Of the times I wouldn't have ended up in San Francisco had I not done that. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phone with my wife I  Was still I was I was in a long-distance relationship with my wife over the phone in 1996  So I was I you you were ahead of me, sir  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How you went up in San Francisco so I missed it I missed a chapter right I yeah, I kind of skipped to there basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically everything went well. She had dual citizenship. I ended up doing a six-month work visa in Montreal  Montreal was amazing  But then once that was up there's like what we got to live somewhere that we can both live if we want to continue  Dating right she tried Boise but coming from Montreal Boise who is not necessarily a step up  But I give her props for trying and then we chose San Francisco we were like San Francisco sounds awesome  We ended up San Francisco. We broke up probably a year later. She's still one of my best friends. That's all right  Yeah, that's it. That's cool. That's how that all came around  But I would not be in San Francisco had I not met her in IRC chat  Now I go is one of those like those what is it the swinging doors or rotating doors? What is that?  that Gwyneth Paltrow movie about  Which is lighting doors sliding doors there we go you either go this way or that way and it changes your entire life  And that's what the IRC chat was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyways, wow that was actually interesting. I know what I had not heard that on this show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't sure  There you go, there's a little piece of my my dating history for you  But I do remember how how like how people were very worried for me  They really thought like I was gonna go there and get my don't blame. I can't blame them  Yeah, I mean at that point you just weren't doing that and that I think it was my point for even bringing it up at that  Point dating online was so for such a foreign concept. You just didn't do that. I guarantee you  Classified ads dating was way more natural and normal and you know that was considered somewhere. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that you're classified ads classified ads dating had cooties  Yeah, but this is also a time of  What was the name of the movie looking for mr. Goodbar novel and movie Diane Keaton?  Okay, and so yes, it was Diane Keaton plays a woman who ends up dating people in bars and I think gets murdered  His stories always end up with murder comes back around the murder

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Show title dang it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some SEO magic there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looking for mr. Goodbar  She teaches deaf children during the day but cruises single bars and discos at night

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and then she gets murdered

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two stars the likes of Tony Richard Gere who's threatening knife and swagger exciter  This is the danger that lurks out there in bars where women go that was that was that was the view back of the day  Okay  Now it's looking for mr. Good swipe, you know, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That might be the title actually I like that one a little better  That was good, let's see here some some pieces and everything Google Assistant  Apparently on some devices gonna going to enable a new feature ambient mode  So if you have a smart  Smart screen or the smart home screen like the nest hub max that just released as one example  then you know, you have a certain interface and and you know, it allows you to do lots of things like with your your weather or  notifications reminders music controls all that kind of smart home controls well now  Apparently to some devices for now the assistant is going to enable ambient mode  Which will basically turn phones and tablets into that which makes a lot of sense. I like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that gives you a simplified interface for when it's just sitting on the counter  If it's connected to some of your other stuff, I dig that  As I know I yeah  I have a dock that I use at the desk here and it would be nice to be able to just sit it there and  As I'm listening to music and have my music controls a little bit bigger a little bit bigger than that tiny little touch point  I dig that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one of those things like oh why didn't you do that sooner that makes a whole lot of sense  Although I do remember years ago on Android when you docked  They used to have come what was the name? Was it daydream mode? It was daydream mode. Yeah  Like  It is going back  But it was kind of like this when you had it plugged in you had it on you're like your phone charging dock or whatever  it would go into daydream mode and it would turn into almost like ambient light going on a digital like a  Picture frame or whatever and I remember that and you could have my next round that's like that. I think it was my next

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I probably was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it probably was about that time  Right now for now it's launching on select Lenovo tablets and Nokia phones  I guess we'll see if it comes to other devices as well, but  Does any one of us have one of those smart screens like I have Google homes  But I don't have any with a screen in my house. Do you I do I do ever use it. I never use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have an Alexa little little  Whatever dot the show screen. No, not the show the five inch their little five inch screen. There it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the little is that the Lenovo one? Yeah, I wish I wish I had the smaller Google one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well that was the first one and that was and still it was a great device

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thankfully it just sits there I'd rather have that large one  I remember looking at the Google one and thinking it's no bigger than my tablet, you know, yeah  You know, it's just I could do the same thing just right mount the tablet somewhere, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you wouldn't get the interface now you will  I will potentially it's possible. We'll see  What else is in here so there's stuff in here there  That grabs you right now Jeff is there something I should have said that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will deflect to you  Google X or does change like never mind. Okay to that. Well, you could I'd say why don't you play the trumpets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then I'll find something. Oh, okay. Yeah, why don't we do that? Let's let's play  The end of the show we can do that whenever we want right and do that it's time for the change log  Google is changing the nofollow link attribute. That's right. We're digging deep this time around  Used to be a flag to tell it search ranking to ignore those links now. It's simply gonna be treated as a hint  About which which links to exclude so you could flag a link as a sponsored  You know REL equals sponsored that would idea it as part of an ad or a sponsorship and tell the search the search engine  You know that give it a hint as far as what it is whether it wants to include it in its results or not  UGC would identify links for user generated content things like comments forum posts that sort of stuff  Google did say that's gonna continue to honor  Nofollow attributes currently in place so no need to change your existing ones quite yet on March  2020 all nofollow links will be treated as hints and not  specific like  Actions to ignore these links. So I know that kind of seems like a big change right before  People had control over what the search engine sees and now not so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A big change to who?  That's true no I get it  Again you start thinking about marketing standpoint. It makes sense. It does. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google chrome 77 is rolling out and offers a new feature for sharing pages between devices  so basically if you're on  One device and you want to share a web page to your phone like you're leaving the house, you know  I feel like we've had this solution before but maybe it was in the way of an app or whatever  Well now it's gonna be built into Chrome. You could right click on a tab  Choose the device to share to and then that device will appear on on that device  The tab will appear you have to tap to receive it  I like that so it's like you have to accept that link before it will just appear there once you do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There it is. I like that for you. I like that  I've done I've been working on a project or what have you in and wanted to take a break if you will  And so I would say alright, I'm gonna go downstairs or something like that  But I'm just gonna take this with me while I go downstairs  Yeah, so much that would be a nice easy feature just to write

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't you go to the history on either device and see the other device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's typically what I have done as I go on today tab and pull it up that way  But this was I like the idea of this is just a click or two, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that's the that's the thought is yes  You could go into history  But that requires you to kind of go into the menu dive into their search through a list  This is like a very specific like share this over there. It's probably using the same exact syncing functionality  It's just making it appear more intentionally. I like that idea. Yeah  Not bad  also in mobile search a query of something like good shows to watch or  What to watch will now fire off?  I couldn't get it to work for myself  But supposedly it'll fire off a carousel for you to rate TVs and or TV and movie shows  movie shows TV shows and movies  You could swipe left and right thumbs up thumbs down skip all in an effort to better identify through the search engine  What you like to get it for recommendations  Supposedly you do a mobile search on your mobile device is something like good shows to watch or what to watch  Those are the two examples that Google put in their blog post, but when I did it, I didn't get the little carousel  You could also search for genres so like horror movies from the 1980s or  Adventure documentaries about climbing and it would know how to handle that as well as surfacing  where those

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those the movie shows are available. Yeah, that was my next question is you're giving me all these recommendations

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where will I be able to find them? Yeah, so it'll give you those results and then it'll also tie into I think your apps  Installed on your phone. So if you tap Netflix, oh nice, I think it would take you through there. It's pretty slick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's interesting. I didn't get that but as I just looked what I got, you know, I got a bunch of movies with  data on theaters and then I got a  Google thing that appeared people also search for it has a Netflix movies list, which it does not appear that Netflix paid for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then movie movies list so it's like all the movies on Netflix. All right  But Netflix didn't have that out there. No, no, they just don't people were searching for it. That's smart. Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting. Well, there was there was it there was a scraping scraping scraping. I'm sorry. I come back to it  I come back to it. Keep going. Okay, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's it's all good we're almost there there's really only one other thing it's really so short  Yeah, Google Express is about to be added to the Google graveyard  Apparently it closes in a few hardly new you we hardly knew you we never used II  I never really used Google's press. I think I used it once  Google's redesigning its online shopping experience as such. Google is calling it an integration  But let's face it Express is just sunsets. It's just a  Dying it's gonna be added to that graveyard that never-ending  Page that gosh that highlights all the things Google has killed  But at least this isn't something that was big the way those other things were

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reader they wanted it. They wanted it to be big. This was yeah. Nice try Google  Google Express had some deals. I remember I even saw some pretty decent deals on you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were really trying to like pull people in it was like but I don't know  I don't know about  Walmart and Best Buy  Yeah, I don't know maybe with Costco as well  I try to do this locally or I try I talked to  eBay and when they still loan PayPal many years ago when I was working with a newspaper company

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried to do this locally or I tried I talked to  eBay and when they still loan PayPal many years ago when I was working with a newspaper company  Trying to figure out how to do this because we figured that that you had delivery coming with  Uber and stuff and could could local advertisers compete with Amazon by saying we got it. It's a mile away  We'll get it to you the problem that that that PayPal said and eBay said was  merchants just don't have their inventory digitized and  It's not there and I wrote a business plan to do that  But this is the structure is not there and people are so accustomed to using Amazon  I have a group of people we bring in the on commerce in media at the Newmark School and  One thing they've said when they things like wire cutter and places like that when they put up commerce links on their sites  The thing that drives conversion more than anything else is available for prime  Right, so people are just accustomed to Amazon. Yep  And happy with it. Absolutely  Absolutely until the government protects them from yes until whatever's happening with the probe is over

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Until until Amazon has been probed  I think that's it for the change  Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't mean to go there and I did  Okay, what were you gonna say Jeff what while we're in the  Stories here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What one is which is a follow-up to story we talked about in the show you guys weren't there  We heard two ago is the MIT Media Lab  and  Joey Edo the director resigned this week after blockbuster reporting from Ronan Farrow, you know  Ronan Farrow is calling the answer is okay. I quit whatever it is. I quit now. Yeah, it's not good when Ronan Farrow is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where it is unclear how high up in MIT this reaches but Jeffrey Epstein's money  was taken and then hidden  in the Media Lab and  You know, there are those out there who are now screaming kill the whole Media Lab  Well, there's some good work going on good people are there. They've announced a new governance structure  Patty Mays who's a wonderful researcher professor there for many many many years is gonna head a committee of five  Three women two men who will govern the Media Lab and  Look for a director who bloody well better be a woman  and  So that's just kind of a follow-up on that story where we were it but it's it was I was I was glued to Twitter  all weekend last weekend as this story was rolling and rolling and rolling and rolling and there people like Jenny Jardin of  Boy boy has really been hard on the case here and bravely and she's taken a lot of crap for it  But the whole Epstein story including MIT and where Epstein's influence and connections and God knows what else and money  And God knows what else reached so she's been great on the story  and  So I just wanted to mention that as a follow-up. I thought that was interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think Media Labs still has a chance? Is it just gonna fold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's lost a chance. There's a guy named Deb Roy runs a lab about about  Civic conversations and a company called cortico out of there Deb ex Twitter  You know we've people I work with have working with him so I know how smart he is  Kate darling does a lot of great stuff up there  With machines and you know new loads of machines, but they also are in trouble for other things  They had a supposed plant growing computer and the Chronicle of Higher Education  I think it was had a big story today just saying that it was all hype that they were they were buying plants outside  Putting it in the device and wasn't really working so there was fraud there that kind of stuff  I think I almost do more damage in a way, right?  You have companies paying a lot to be near this technology now in truth  So my old employer used to pay them every year and I got up, you know  Went up there a few times when we were supposed to be able to look at all this wonderful new technology and  There were a few things there was  Electronic ink came out of Media Lab that was worthwhile  But otherwise it was a big dose of BS  Google Glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three out of yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Turner. Well, as I said a fair amount of BS. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No that Starner  Almost got a P a PhD for his wearable  They were they were debating whether they should give his  wearable computer that he had gone through the Media Lab with a PhD because  He had to wear it for his for his final  oral  Presentation and  There they were going back and forth over should he be allowed to use it should he not be allowed to use it  Should it?  itself be given a PhD  So what happened?  I'm putting a link in the chat. It didn't give it didn't get the PhD he did  But it's a fascinating story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm. Yeah, but I think I think they need a major house clearing clean there  They need a major regrouping on what value the lab does have  They need to do a lot of apologizing but that doesn't mean that you get there  There are people there are some up to thousand people Ethan Zuckerman said who are involved with the lab as students professors or  projects and to just overnight say it's dirty that's kind of the moral panic of  Saying technology bad. See I told you people were grabbing on to anything like this  This had very little to do technology it had to do with  financial corruption really  So anyway, so that's that's a follow-up that I think was worth mentioning now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so then I will tack on to that and say this news about Bill Gates  Right. He has a new three-part  Documentary it's about to hit on Netflix  This is a really flimsy story. Yeah, like I'm curious about this one. I don't like you know, obviously there are  No, no, I'm just gonna say there are a lot of people that are atoning to their relationship to Jeffrey Epstein in a number of different ways  And now it's come out that Gates, you know, he was on flight logs  He also met with Epstein in 2013 has other ties  Like do you think that any of that ire is going to strike Bill Gates as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, we don't know enough yet in the Ronan Farrow story  Epstein was taking credit for  Directing Bill Gates to give money to the Media Lab as a lot of people pointed out  It's real hard to envision anybody directing Bill Gates to do anything. Yeah, that's true  So we haven't really heard enough yet  We need to hear more from Gates in his own interest, but I have my doubts that Epstein had any  puppet strings over Bill Gates

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Type of proxy always in place  regarding any type of transactions or discussions between  Epstein and Gates  By proxy you mean a middleman a middle person that you know, they wouldn't oh, I don't know  I don't know. That's a good question seems like I read something along those lines of yeah  They they knew each other knew of each other or what have you but any communication or transactions usually has some type of middleman

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you get I was trying to take credit for the person directly with right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so there could be something there  But it's far too soon to condemn Bill Gates and anything that he's involved in as a result  Investigation will show if Ronan Farrow starts calling him I'd run for the hills, but right but so far we don't have that. Yeah. Yeah  Fair enough. So that's interesting story another interesting story that I just added that I forgot about  Is there was a big court decision this week on scraping? Oh, okay  High Q  Had gone after LinkedIn  IQ was building a business upon scraping data out of LinkedIn and LinkedIn at some point gave a cease and desist and under the  computer fraud act  LinkedIn thought that was enough to make them stop but they went ahead and took them to court and high Q1  And what the court said I haven't read the whole decision  but what I read a lot of smart people about it and and among the things that the court said was that  LinkedIn's data is presented publicly public  And for LinkedIn to then say no, no, no, no, no, no, you can't see that  Is  inconsistent and wrong and is going to be harmful to  Knowledge and that notion alone I celebrate  And I think this notion of being in public and be other people to be able to build off of  Knowledge they get from that is what's gonna build our future world. So it was a it was a fascinating discussion  EFF is celebrating a lot of people I know aren't quite sure what to think  but  And haven't really figured it all out yet. That's as as Kate Klonick who's a brain or maybe Daphne Keller Daphne Keller is brilliant  Stanford  Law professor said that now these these these what you see in the world  These these these what used to be separate domains of law that you know, you were special is it now  We're all mushing together in one decision and it's really hard to figure out  but this is gonna turn out to be an important decision because what it means is that  Trying to restrict information  Won't work and that's the essence of  fights about copyright and stuff copyright only protects the treatment of the information not the underlying information itself  And if this information is made public  Then you can go in and you can get it and you can draw on it and you can do things with it  And that's gonna lead to growth and that's gonna lead to good things. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is a big one. I don't understand how the LinkedIn Council would would say  Potential fraud abuse see, you know, it's public information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What were their ground? They're saying that that that you I?  Didn't have a rather decision to answer. I'll get this messed up  But I think it was  Almost like a terms of service that you you came in as a user, you know to find a job  but instead you made a company and  Under CF FA under the other computer fraud act if you gave someone a cease and desist  That was sufficient notice to make them stop doing something and you had the right to do that and now the court's saying no  That that doesn't hold

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because this public data. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a lot of people mention this in light of  Senior moment Jonathan Schwartz, right the the the young brilliant man who killed himself. Yes, and the J store account Jonathan. Thank you  And  That they wonder whether this would have had an impact on that because what he did was use MIT computers to scrape  Every article off of J store the  academic repository of  papers and  That that scraping then we'll be okay now J stores behind the paywall  And I suspect it wouldn't have worked because that was a  Contractual obligation. I don't want to get too legal because I'm not qualified to do so  But this this got a lot this this decision got a lot of buzz in geek legal circles  Interesting stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see here I'm realizing we need to take a break  We might have a few more things to talk about after the break and then we get to our tips trip tips tricks numbers things  Whatever we happen to bring to the table first. Let's take a break and thanks sponsor  This is episode of this week and Google's brought to you by Express VPN  If you think that your data is not valuable enough to be snooped on you are wrong  Maybe you think nobody cares about your online data. You are wrong. Nobody  Nobody has data that is valuable to somebody  Let's just say that because you listen to this show you understand that your privacy is under attack  In a number of different ways hackers governments ISPs. They're all gobbling up your data  That's why we recommend getting the software that we trust to protect our online identity. I know I do it's Express VPN  Their apps use power. They're not going to be used by anyone  Their apps use powerful encryption to secure your data  Express VPN runs in the background of your computer your phone  And you use the internet just as you normally do all you have to really do is just download the app click to connect  And you're protected and you know if you're going to public Wi-Fi or wherever you happen to be really at any time  Use Express VPN  It's gonna protect you no matter where you are. You know, even if you're at home, you don't trust your ISP cool  You could set it up so that it's just running all the time and then you don't have to worry about it  Express VPN is the fastest VPN that I've tried to cost less than seven dollars per month comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee  Express VPN uses new cutting-edge server technology called trusted server  That actually prevents the operating system and apps from ever writing to the hard drive as you can see  This is a whole new standard of privacy and security a whole other level of it  It's time to stop hackers big brother and internet companies from grabbing all your data take back your online privacy  Like I did with Express VPN. I do love Express VPN. I've used I've used a number of VPN services  Over the years Express VPN is probably the easiest  VPN that I've seen because you literally just press that button and boom you're on and things don't slow down  And that's another big issue that I've run into with VPN things just seem like they're creeping along  I don't feel that with Express VPN. It's basically it's the same experience  Just protect it  That's what it's all about protect your online activity today and find out how you can get three extra months free with a one-year package  At Express VPN comm slash twig. That's e XPR ESS VPN comm slash twig for three extra months free  with a one-year package  One more time Express VPN comm slash twig to learn more and before we jump back in I also realized  That we do this now a little bit of information on triangulation if you missed triangulation recently  You definitely want to check it out Micah Sargent just last Friday interviewed David Weinberger author of everyday chaos technology  Complexity and how we're thriving in a new world of possibility. They actually talked about  artificial intelligence big data modern science  How they're all revealing one fundamental truth  That's that the world is way more complex and unpredictable than we've allowed ourselves to see  all that and even the magic of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chicken sexing. Yes chicken sexing is indeed in there. Yes, I I interviewed so I read the book. It's wonderful  But David's a dear friend. He's brilliant  The book is great and I talked about on the show before  And I also interviewed David at a bookstore in New York where he did in fact talk about chicken sexing  I'll let that I'll let that mystery stay so you can watch the show. But but David talks about how  Machine learning artificial intelligence, but even just a B testing takes away our  sense of control and  Predictability that is to say we think we know how people can operate but the data says something else  The data doesn't come with an explanation. There is no explanation. That's just what happens and the data reliably predict that well  Sorry, I can't explain this behavior to you  But we are addicted to the notion that we can't explain right we can tell a story that's gonna explain all this and that  Takes the rug off underneath us and it's very unsettling. So David's a very calming influence as a philosopher  wonderfully sweet nice guy  brilliant and but also gives you kind of  Of the one hand frightening things with the other hands has relaxed about this  This is the reality of where we're going and and it's probably okay  So I would recommend even though I haven't seen it yet. I look forward to watching  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David is somebody I recommend highly. Yeah pay attention to and I mean chicken sexing. That's all we got to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right there right there in the headquarters of chicken sexing. Yeah, had a little bit, California. That's right. See it's it's totally on brand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was last week's last Friday's episode. You can find it at twit TV slash TRI  Or triangulation is found this Friday Leo's actually gonna talk with John O'bacon about  His new book people powered how communities can supercharge your business brand and teams  And you can check that out this Friday. That'll hit the feeds twit TV slash TRI for triangulation  Awesome show. I love when I get the opportunity to do triangulation. I'm sure at some point and you'll do an episode of triangulation  It's just a cool opportunity to like sit down with really smart people and talk about the thing that they are just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dialed into it's been it's been great watching those conversations and I watched that episode last week  It was really really good like a ride home

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any last bits and pieces before we get into the numbers like Samsung's Galaxy fold is is now apparently available in South  South Korea, it's gonna come to the US probably by the end of the month. Forget about buy that pixel 4

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know you're gonna buy the phone for what you thousand dollars. You're all about the fold, right? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on someone here has to be all about the fold. No, no, I don't I don't get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I'm not productive enough to think that multiple screens on a  Mobile device like that is useful  Cary, I mean, yes when I'm at the workstation, I have either a really large screen or multiple monitors  But something about it on the mobile device just doesn't scream productivity to me. I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm interested in it from a curiosity standpoint  I'm not interested in it from a I've got to have that because if I do it's gonna open up all these

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Worlds that I never knew before so you're interested just enough to go see it in the store  Yeah, or get a review

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm interested interested enough to live with it for a couple of weeks and then be like, yeah, but this is what I really want  Yeah  But who knows maybe I would get it  Yeah, isn't it it looks like it probably is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people to see the person they talk about it being a tablet this in your pocket  And yeah, yeah, I guess that's that's great and innovative  But again, I just don't see the extra use for it and then and I'm sure it's not gonna have the horsepower to be productive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, yeah, I mean it's it's running a pretty top-of-the-line, you know 855  12 gigs of RAM, I believe like they've put some nice  Nice power into it. Okay, I stand corrected and it's almost $2,000 new

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That might be the deciding factor to grand this right here MSI workstation. Yeah  Quadro RTX GPU from Nvidia, you know that's same. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take your pick  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One last thing for me. Yeah, go for it is I mentioned before we came on the air  Fascinated by this so the protesters in Hong Kong were really truly a movement  Zainab to fix the  pointed out that they have a new national anthem for Hong Kong's, you know  Screw you China what they're saying and it was written by one person, but then he put the music up put the first  verse of lyrics up online then they collaboratively did  the next  Verses and then  Are now record they're singing at thousands of people in malls on multiple levels. We're singing this  There's now an or an orchestral version which is on the rundown  Which is really good  it's just fascinating to see now god help us we could find ourselves in another Arab Spring where  Oppression comes afterwards, but this is pretty amazing. A lot of people have said to me over the years  Oh the Chinese people don't want this kind of freedom. They're having a great time now  They're done. No, as we see you. How could you possibly say you can't listen to them? You don't know you can't hear  but Hong Kong they can still they can speak and  This is how they're speaking and how they're singing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow like a crowd-sourced national anthems, yes with a cause  Yeah, we were talking about this a little bit prior to the show I was telling you guys we have an interview tomorrow on  Tech News Weekly with a gentleman. I'm pulling up the doc so I can get his name John Coits here  Who wrote an article for Forbes about how?  Protesters in Hong Kong, you know, they're being cut off from the internet  So communication between them was next to impossible  But now they're using an app that that allows for communication over Bluetooth  They basically bypass the internet entirely and they get it's like basically like this big distributed messaging mesh network  it's just like the the the lengths that they're going to to  Get their message and be able to communicate have a voice. It's yeah, it's really crazy. That's pretty cool pretty inspiring but  Anyways, that's that's really neat Jeff. I have not heard that  Nice song, dude. It's not nice  This reverse  Absolutely stirring is the right word for it  Cool. All right. Well, I think we've touched on most of the things. Why don't we get into the numbers and stuff?  We'll start with you Jeff. What's your what's your number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see here. I  Think I'll go with the the use by seniors of Facebook has doubled since 2012  Now we could we could pitch that story two ways one is don't worry about Facebook the kids are okay  It's going to the grandpa's the other one you could argue is grandpa's going crazy. And part of the reason is Facebook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because fake news is being spread by old people who look like me  Not young people let us say old wait men for those of you on audio as if you didn't know  So  Yeah, Facebook is becoming more and more and more the place of old folks and and  That's probably more worrisome for the future of Facebook than anything which I found interesting. Hmm. That is that's fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of not surprising either

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing I had to put it there is kind of a change log thing was it was even too small  For a boring change log  But I'll mention it really quickly is that Google has a new feature that lets you display your word count as you go  Oh in Docs or in Drive, which I kind of hate I kind of cuz it's I can imagine students saying they said 2,000 words  Okay  19,000 there are  1900 19 to 110. No, I gotta put in some more words

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of a cool tool I could see though getting too obsessive about it like there's something about  Writing something and then having to go up to analyze what you just wrote instead of like real-time readout of like I just need  three more words  Done. We were talking on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't worry. I won't do this again those of you who are listening  But I did a whole thing about we did a whole long grandpa thing about word processing in the early days  One of the things you had to do is when you wanted to to spell check it was a batch thing, right?  Right, right, right, right, and then you hit a button to spell check and I'm gonna go through and mark all the words you go  Through a list separately. You'd have to change the words on the list to change it in the text back in my day  Yes, so so people were complaining about having to go in and kind of batch word count  This is by going up to a specific feature to kind of run it in the old jargon and now they're taking that away

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just just there. Yes, so ten years from now  This this will just be will be so used to seeing our always on word count  That thinking about having to batch word count is gonna seem so quaint

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The writer you won't have words anymore you'll just have a meme account we're gonna write an emoji and memes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right language is shifting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what you got? I didn't have anything initially

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you were after all asked to do this show like right before you went

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I wanted to bring up a project that I did  month or so ago in  recognition for yesterday, I know today is September 11th, but yesterday September 10th is worldwide  suicide awareness day and  We I think we need to continue  To have conversations about mental health and  the effects of it and  That project that I worked on is with a friend of mine that wanted to help get the message out about mental health  Awareness and he allowed me to just sit down with him and we just talked he suffers from PTSD  He is a US Army vet  Served six years had some great stories and he just tells it like it is far as  dealing with mental health issues and  The fact that no one is really talking about it, especially in the black community and how it's been blackballed and  did it in three part videos and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vulnerability begets vulnerability, right?  It is yep. Yep opening the doors for vulnerability  And I feel like honestly this is this is a lesson that I've only learned in the past year to  Great length and work that I've done in my own personal life  But vulnerability when you open yourself up to that man  It's like it's like the world opens up because suddenly you give everybody else the permission to explore it with you  There's and freedom with that.
