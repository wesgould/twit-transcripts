Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, you can host it if you want. Yeah, I don't know if my stomach acid can take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  BuzzMachine.com. Were you buzzed yesterday by the C-130 flying around over Maine?  No, I wasn't. I wasn't around. I saw it. I already had that. Yeah. If you go to Fifth Avenue,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that was at Fifth Avenue. And it's always crazy there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's funny is we have helicopters buzzing us all. The coast guards down the road,  there's training missions and stuff. And we run out, we look up and we go, okay, and we go back in.  But Manhattan is like the same size as Petaluma. But it's got a lot more people in all the media.  And so suddenly that's a massive story, right? Yeah. It's just, you know, it was a military  exercise. But I understand why people are a little feared and nervous. Some people thought it was  Obama coming to take over. Seriously. I am not kidding. I saw on Twitter. He's still in charge,  you know. I saw on Twitter. Well, no, but it's the whole point is that there are people who expect  that Obama will prevent this transition and King himself. And they expect military action.  And there were people. See, this is why I love Twitter. And you know I love Twitter. Stacey  Higginbotham, iotpodcast.com Stacey on iot. She's our iot guru. And wonderful to have you both  from Austin, Texas. I have a little something, something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it a minion? I want it to be a minion. Minion like you will now be my minions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are my minions. Oh, you got it. You don't have to stand in line. I took advantage of this  thing called eBay. How much over the market was it? It was only 200 some. It wasn't much.  So they're down from a thousand. Yeah. And it was a buy it now. And that's because the store  in Manhattan is open all the time. Or not all the time. All evening. And so it's a lot. And you can  make a reservation. So it's a lot easier. So I think people are actually, you know, content to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  make a hundred bucks. I would be content to make a hundred bucks. They go. They get a few. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here you go. Should I open it? I mean, it's sealed in the box. I'll have to charge him.  But I thought it's probably important for me to know about this. I'm not a big snapper,  but it is. It's totally important. Yeah. This is, this is something the kids are,  the kids are doing. And I chose black, not coral or turquoise. Well, okay. Call me insane, but  I just want, I didn't want to look too weird. I'm going to call you old Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I won't call you insane. I'll just be, Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now I don't know. Is this supposed to be speckled like that? Or is that mold?  I guess it's supposed to be speckled. That looks legit. That looks legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Smell it and see what happens. Oh, it smells like fine polyurethane. Oh, that's the charger

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right there. I'm going to need a, Oh, yeah. Cause they charge in the case.  Well, these are, this is new in the box kids.  All right. I'm going to put them on. I don't think there's a charge on them,  but I'm going to put them on. You tell me how good I look. Goofy time. Ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually think for your face, they should be a little bigger, Leo, which is, I have a very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they look huge on everybody else. Don't they? And I have such a melon head. I have the world's most  massive head and I have to actually buy special wide glasses. Like the big and tall glasses.  I go to the big and tall glasses store and these are too small for me. Dang it. I thought if  anything would be big enough. Kara, come here. Kara put these on and see how it looks on you.  Kara is a beautiful young woman who has a normal size head. See they look great. Oh, Kara, they  look so good on you. Oh, I should just give them to Kara. Oh my gosh. I was actually, I was going  to, I think I'm going to keep them because I want to, I like the idea. I've heard that streaming live  videos all the rage these days. So I was thinking maybe I should do some of that. I don't look like  Casey Neistat. That's for sure. So look at this. They get a nice USB cable and it's, it's, this is  proprietary. It's not a traditional USB cable. It's got pogo pins that go in the back of this.  But you know what, John, I'm just going to plug it into the computer. I don't need to,  I don't need a special dongle. I have, I have, he just has to walk three feet to get to the computer.  I have a special computer. Okay. Oh, that is hard. Now you know you're old when it's a  workout to get up and go on the other side of the table. Well, when you go that way, yes.  Yeah, that is the long one. All right. So I'm going to put them in this box and I have to peel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stuff off. Peel that off. Oh, I see. Can I say that I love charging things in their boxes. I love,  I mean, as I've got all these like proprietary cable dongle things. Yeah, it's ugly, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see behind you, you've got a charger. It's a pain in the butt, right? Yes. Behind me, there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a charger and a connected blood cuff, blood pressure cuff. Are you okay? Oh yeah. Oh, you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know what's cool? This is good design too. So the pogo pins, I was wondering, well, where do I plug  these in? Cause you don't see any visible, the pogo pins are hid behind the hinge on the glasses.  So when you fold them, you have to plug them in. Well, you put them in the case, but there's got  to be a way to connect to the case, right? And so to the charger in the case. And it just goes,  it's not the most, oh yeah, you could see, oh, oh, oh, you could tell you're doing it right because  the little led array lights up and actually they're mostly charged. They're mostly charged. So I want  to let them sit there for a little bit and throb gently while we do the show. And maybe a little  later in the show, I'll, I'll snap chat this. I think you snap it now, right? It's now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, I know the company snap. Do you, so do you snap chat it? You're still snap chatting your  video. Is that how the, is that how the kids are saying it now? I can't imagine you're,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do you really have you snapping everything? No, let's see. I don't know. Turn on your phone's  Bluetooth and put on your spectacles, install the latest version of snap, snap, snap chat. See it's  still, the app's still snap chat. Open snap chat and swipe down to view your snap code. Look at  your snap code and press the button on your spectacles to pair. Oh, wait a minute. I gotta  do that. I mean, I can't, we gotta, we gotta do that. We gotta, we gotta do the full unboxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I gotta pair it, right? Yeah. We gotta see the world through Leo's eyes. I know more so than

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  usual. Yeah. Frankly, that's all you see around here. Uh, it's gonna take me a little bit because  I have to download the latest. Oddly enough, I don't have the latest snap chat on my iPhone.  So Stacey. Hit me. Eero in my house. Oh, uh, I, I got the Google wifi. Okay. Had some, had some  problems. Oh, had to call the goog. Oh, it said to call the goog. So I called the goog. Um, they said  reset it. I said, well, how do you reset it? Well, they don't document this, but there is a button  on the thing. If you plug it in with the button push that resets it. So I did reset it. One of  the three units was wonky. When you reset it, it re downloads the firmware paired. Everything's fine.  Some thoughts though. Uh, you can't run it in bridge mode. Now I have, unfortunately,  and many, I think at home will have a situation like this. I have a router from a cable modem  router from my Comcast, my internet service provider that does DHCP does the networking,  the routing. And in my case, cause I have a business class service, I can't turn it off.  I have to pay 18 bucks extra a month to turn it off. So the Google thing says, well, I see your,  uh, we're double natted. Uh, you should turn your best thing to do would be to turn off bridging,  turn off for routing in your router and let us do the job. And, but if you can't,  we can go in bridge mode, but we should warn you. None of the cool stuff will work. None.  Oh, and, uh, somebody told me the Eero is really in the same situation. If they're not fully  controlling the routing, obviously, and that makes sense. There's, there's some of the cool stuff they  can't do, like, you know, choosing which point you're on and things, but Eero doesn't tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that Google tells you that Eero has it in their advanced settings. I think. So if you go into  bridge mode, you get warned. Cause I got a big, I've never, so I've never gone into bridge. What  about ubiquity? Cause they have their routers that are actually enterprise class. So guess what? I  just ordered the amplify. Okay. Cause I want to try them all now. So I will, you want my update  on plume while you're waiting or have you downloaded? So I let my network marinate for a week because  you had to let it live and learn, live and learn. So it has done that. And when I did the testing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so you can't really use it or you can use it, but you just don't want to test it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so, oh, before it marinate. Yes. Can you test it? You can, you can use it and you can test it,  but the results are going to be different because what it's doing is it's learning your network  settings and how things are used and optimizing for it. Okay. So technically it won't be as fast  as it's going to be. Yes. A more accurate representation is probably. So that's good.  You have the patience to do that. Cause I do not. I, okay. So here's where we get into it. So what  we talked about last time with there only being one port. So I thought I was like, no, no, it all  works because some of my devices were connected, but that's because I had plugged them in some,  I had plugged them into one of the little pluggy things. So I actually have now decided in my house,  it is impractical. And for anybody who's running a switch or needs to, you know, has a situation  where they want to plug into a LAN, this is not the group. This is not the wifi for you.  You can run it also in bridge mode, but it's complicated. And if you're buying this,  you're probably trying to get coverage without the stress of like an extender. So I think it kind of  takes away any useful there. I also noticed. So for the last week, like I haven't been able to turn  my lights or work my printer because they're on the land and work my Sonos. So sad, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I think the Eero has killed my Sonos.  What?  We'll talk about that next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Cause someone else complained about that, but they found a solution.  Oh, good.  So, but the plume wifi was consistent everywhere, but it was about 60% less than the Eero's wifi.  Yeah.  So I was kind of like, I mean, it was still 80 megabits per second to the plumes, 140 megabits  per second, cause I'm on 150 megabit per second connection. So I was kind of like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you got it right backward. The Eero was 140. The plume was 80.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry. Yes. I did get it backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, but no, but you, you don't want to see that that see that's not mesh. The promise of mesh is  that that's not going to happen. Cause if you do as an extender, that's what happens. You cut in half  your total bandwidth so that they can have a back channel. And the whole theory behind these,  apparently loom is really more like an extender system than it is.  Loom plume or loom plume is more an extender system than it is a mesh system. And that would  kind of explain why you put one in every room. Yeah. It's too hard. I see. Okay. That's it. Okay.  Right. So I want to try the Orbi. That's another one, although I'm nervous about net gear because  the word just went out that net gear has a massive exploit in its firmware. So I was getting the Orbi.  Well, yeah, you might want to update before you use it. So those are the old ones. Those are the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  new ones are fine. But they are so yeah, the Orbi's are actually en route to my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, see how this is good. There's very few people are going to be able to test all of them.  And so we really want to kind of get a sense of what they can all do. I'm, I've decided that  you're using the amplifier, right? No, I'm you didn't get the amplifier. Okay, that's the  ubiquity. I ordered the amplifier and I decided to order the there's two of these the long range  and the high density. High density is the higher end more expensive, more radios, more antennas,  more juice and so theoretically faster. So I got the you know, it's not that much more expensive.  I got the HD just to see. So I'll have more tests. But right now I'm sticking with the  euro the euros the one and partly because I have five units now I ended up getting more.  So saturated. So I've excellent everywhere five bars everywhere. But all of a sudden the Sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just stops working. Did you reset it? Because sometimes you have to reset it two hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got up at 6am this morning and was cursing and swearing through every room in the house,  resetting everything I ended up resetting the whole euro system. I ended up resetting the  whole Sonos system. Okay, and the Sonos comes and goes and I here's my theory. I have so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  saturated the spectrum with the euro right there. It's own little Wi Fi network. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah. The 2.4 gigahertz spectrum euro uses both 2.45 but it's on two four and I have so saturated  it because I mean, think about it. I've got hundreds of watts of Wi Fi pulsing through the  house like a frying egg that the year that the Sonos just goes I can't I give up and I have a  boost and everything I have the nothing. So I don't know I'll I'm gonna call I didn't have time  this morning call Sonos I'll be calling Sonos and I'll have an update for you. Are you ready for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to pair? Did you just kind of confuse the hell out of the Sonos by just having so I saturated

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I what it is I saturated the spectrum and the Sonos can't get through it and it's just it's  but it's frustrating your neighbors hate you too. Well, we live in the country so  they're gonna love you as well relatively disdain but that's actually something to consider  a lot of these Wi Fi solutions that are supposedly improve your Wi Fi like multiple radios and super  are actually terrible. They suck all the bandwidth out of your neighbors house.  They're really terrible for neighbors. All right now what did it say? It said take a picture.  Where's the button on this? Here it is. There's the button. So I press this button and I'm supposed  to see a QR code right? What happened? I gotta read this again. Install the laser for the Snapchat.  Oh swipe down to view your snap code. Oh I wasn't viewing my snap code. Okay look at your snap code  and press the button on the spectacles. Okay there's my snap code if anybody wants it. You  can show my snap code. Oh snap chat would like access. Yes looking for keep looking directly  at the snap code. I'm looking. Spectacles found. This has to be easy because this is aimed at you  know name your spectacles. What should I name them? Banana. I was gonna say Blues Brothers come up a  lot. Oh yeah yeah yeah. It's dark. We're wearing sunglasses. We got a full tank of gas. I'm gonna  call it hit it. Isn't that what they say at the end of that quote? Hit it and then only I  will know what I'm talking about but it's a little Blues Brothers reference. These are the  hit it spectacles connecting the spectacles. So exciting. I can now select an accessory.  Oh hit it. See hit it. It's a little emoji with sunglasses on. Setting up spectacles. Alright so  it's fairly easy. It's you know this is this is what the arrows and the  Orbeez and everything these are all like this same kind of thing where you  I'm paired. Okay press once to take a 10 second video snap. Press again to extend by 10 seconds  or press and hold to stop recording. So I've been reading there's articles on how to get good snaps  and one of the things it says is if you triple tap you get 30 seconds. Double tap the side to  check your battery level. Okay if you're running low put the spectacles in their charging case.  Specs light up when they're charging. Yeah I noticed that charging case holds about four  full charges. Oh that's neat. So I'm charging the case. Oh that's cool. Alright alright and then I  oh apparently I have a story already. Alright get HD. What does that mean?  By default stories are imported in SD. You can import your favorite stories in HD. I got it. Okay  Alright no no. Alright so should I do a story?  Probably. Alright alright look at me now. Look at me. Alright ready I'm gonna tap it twice for 20  seconds. This is what happened when Leo got his brand new Snapchat spectacles. Everybody was so  jealous. They just turned bright green. Hello everybody I'm is it snapping? Snapchatting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Snapchatting? I don't know. Snapping sounds snappier. I'm with the kids man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does the light go around in it? Yeah that's to let you know that it's going.  That's really cool. Can you see that it's recording? Yeah. That's the light that was around.  From your perspective? Yeah. Oh no you can't see anything. Okay. And now it's so the thing I read  said a couple of things. Put your hands in the Snapchat a lot otherwise it just looks like a  video. But this way now you know it's first person if you do that. They also said have a beginning,  a middle, and an end. They also said what else did she say? Anyway stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of like the idea of just being like surreptitious videos that you've snapped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or. There ain't that surreptitious but yeah. Well yeah. I'm everybody's gonna stay away from  the guy with the goofy glasses. Right after the show I'm going to Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. You're gonna use it to count cards? Send it to your hedge fund dude in the back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think if I go in the casino with this and try to play blackjack? They're not gonna like  that. Yeah I think you should record whatever happens. Were there any stories of Google Glass  in casinos? Oh probably not. Probably you don't get through the door. I will try. I do have  experience with this because one CES we were going to an event through a casino with a camera crew  and I said get everything. And we immediately got stopped and said you have to turn your camera off.  And my camera guy who bless his soul fought him. And I said not physically but he was no no press  I got it. So I said no no sorry don't just pretend you're turning it off. We actually I think we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  streaming live. So just. Yes in June 2013 the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement issued a  directive for Atlantic City to ban casino patrons from using the glass. They don't want any video any camera in the casino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huh is it because of things like tracking and card counting? No I think well possibly but also they just don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  want anybody to know. It's the same reason the TSA doesn't want you to take pictures at TSA.  Well that's that's silly. Also you're catching people in affairs. Oh that's true too. What happens in Vegas  should stay there. Shows up on Snapchat. Well everybody should follow me. I just showed you my thing. I don't  remember what it was but I'm that guy on your handle. Your handle. I think I'm Chief Twit.  So can we watch it on Snapchat now? I don't know what happens next. It goes to PSS on Snapchat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You may have to approve it actually. I don't know what happens next. But it should tell you because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could somebody go look and see if I'm Chief Twit on the Snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on. I don't know how this stuff works. Snapchat is intentionally by the way obtuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because that's all part of the mystique. So good news. Breaking news. Thank you guys  smiling in the chat room. If you give me a link I'd appreciate it. Yahoo says hackers stole data  from more than one billion user accounts. How do they have that many? Who knew?  Is that true or are you making that up? I don't know.  We'll find the story. Moving on. As we speak the tech summit is going on.  I don't know. Is that a fair thing to call it the tech summit? I think that's what they have called it.  President-elect Trump is meeting with Tim Cook, Larry Page, Eric Schmidt, Elon Musk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the rundown there's a layout of where they sat. Oh you are good.  There's hilarious picture of the looks on their faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay look who's at the table. Is that the one?  That's the view to the third link there. Who sat where?  Okay is that Sheryl Sandberg? Larry Page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Click on the image because you'll see the whole thing then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's this guy on the left? He looks familiar. Oh wait a minute that's Jeff Bezos. Oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at their faces. They are so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't project too much into that. They could just have been told that the only  thing available for lunch is egg salad. I love egg salad.  I know I do too but you know here's some more expressions.  Grim in a room full of people. Yeah a lot only egg salad. Come on.  I thought you were the president. This is another one that maybe is more telling.  This is from Reuters. Trump is speaking. Teal is listening intently. Tim Cook is going.  I don't know what is Tim saying. There's another hilarious Tim Cook photo.  Yeah and then that's Safra Katz who is the CEO of Oracle.  She's the one who said Mr. President-elect we will be glad to make any database you need.  It's interesting. She and Ginni Rometty of IBM both volunteered to make databases for  just whatever he wants to keep track of. IBM already did that for Hitler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. They've got references. If you look at the Politico story on why Jack wasn't invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So oddly yeah that would. Now if you look I did see one thing that said they're all billion dollar  plus companies. So there's a clear line and everybody was invited who was bigger than a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  billion dollars. No there were there are bigger tech companies that weren't there. There were  a half dozen of them. Salesforce wasn't there. That's true. They invited Chesky from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Airbnb. He didn't come. He couldn't make it. Travis Kalanick couldn't make it from Uber.  That's weird. That's surprising. Yeah it is surprising but maybe he legitimately couldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was another story that said that Kalanick and Elon Musk were having their own meeting and  that they were already signed up to be advisors to Trump. Okay. Teal is bringing in everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right? I mean this is Peter Teal organizing this. Yep. What I'm really I think the pictures at the  table are less going to be less telling than the pictures of them leaving and I'm hoping some of  them will talk about what the conversation was. It could just be it could be simple stuff. I know  one thing that the president-elect is offering them is the inexpensive repatriation of their  tax money from you know for a lower cost and I know a lot of them would welcome that for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the funny quote. You'll hear Trump saying to them you'll call me you'll call my people it  doesn't make any difference. We have no formal chain of command around here. Yeah that's a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  weird. That will change when he gets in the White House. I think that's not the case.  He met with Bill Gates yesterday independently  and Kanye.  Yeah that's a that's a that's a day that's a you know that's a big day  when you met with Kanye and Bill Gates in one day that's a big day.  So we don't know but I you know of course many of the people meeting with him are immigrants.  Satchin Adela,  Kate's is an immigrant, Kat's. Peter Thiel himself is an immigrant from Germany.  In fact much of Silicon Valley was built as we know by immigrants. So you know I don't know if  somebody's going to bring. The question I wonder is anybody to challenge him is anybody going to  stand up and say look you got to help us with immigrants this is who builds Silicon Valley we  can't be kicking people out. I don't know or do or I think if I'm them I sit and listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well the first level question is do you go? Well obviously you go everybody go went right. Who

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  didn't? It's the president. That's it no that's the president. It's a question. Well you read  of course Kara Swisher's Shust brilliant skating article which she said you don't go and Chris  Saka she she couldn't get substantive comments from anybody who went or was going at the time.  This was written a couple of days ago but she did call investor Chris Saka who's always been  outspoken and he said well what's the quote scroll down a little bit it's a really good quote.  It's the bottom the very bottom. Yeah I'm a little at a disadvantage here because I'm trying to  add this Windows PC got rebuilt last night and it's not fully functional yet.  I can't read it but he says funny in every tech deal I've ever done the photo op comes after you  signed the papers if Trump publicly commits to embrace science stops threatening the censorship  of the internet rejects fake news and denounces hate against our diverse employees only then would  it make sense for tech leaders to visit Trump Tower short of that they're being used to legitimize  a fascist. Wow. Leave it to Saka to say the blunt thing. Here from Felix Salmon is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  layout I think. Yes that's the one that's what you try to click on the image so you get the  whole image. Yeah. Because the tweet cuts it. Not really loading very fast. I also just put  up the cook the hilarious cook photo hilarious cook. I'm sorry I don't know what's going on with  this. You have a gigantic screen you can't find it. Well we rebuilt it. It's why. Why would you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do that. Because it was a little slow and so Father Robert did brain surgery and you know what my  mistake is I'm using Microsoft's Edge browser. I'm going to stop doing that right now and get  Chrome. That's my mistake. So OK let's parse this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Elon after all. Although the code and then Safra Katz of Oracle Tim Cook of Apple. Now take a  take a moment and show the Tim Cook photo. And now then it's Teal Trump and Pence. So that's the  center of the table there. Then to the to Pence's right Sheryl Sandberg CEO of Facebook not Mark  Zuckerberg Larry Page and Jeff Bezos Jeff Bezos ended up going as well. So some of the people we

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thought wouldn't go did go. So show the picture of Cook if you would. Yeah I'm going to have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  let I'm going to download Chrome and while I'm doing that. Oh dear. Look at that face. Oh Tim.  Oh Tim. Click on it. Carson you'll get it full screen then. And then Carson the story above all  that. You know is that maybe the way to do that is to go show respect for the office go listen  but don't look too happy while you're there. That's the that's that's that's the diplomatic

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  way to do it. I think there's I think Saka has a point there's there's a you know you  if you read Kara's piece and maybe you want to read it Leo without the certain word in it.  But what she's saying is oh hell we're going to get used. We're going to be part of his reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  show. Well that's that's the bigger that's the big story. I think that was the kind of this the  chief theme of this is it's a reality show and you get invited up and into the tower. But honestly  this is the kind of conversations that any president-elect would be having. I would in  fact shouldn't we be glad that we're that he's asking people to come and talk. When Elon Musk

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  according to the story and Kalanick be advisors to him and you know more official role in Musk  especially you know I bemoaned that on Twitter. No surprise you know where I stand people's wasn't  it better and I said well no if you if you believe that you can change him and you you know it was  like what choice do we have. You've got to try to you know influence and change his mind. No no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you've got to say it look like I could see Elon when Trump went to the White House it sounded like  Obama had some influence on him. I could see Elon saying look Mr. President-elect  you've got to really got to consider your position on on on energy on renewables even if you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  believe in global warming. All right and so so Al Gore went up to visit New York Times does a  story. Yeah we don't know. This gives hopes to environmentalists. Next thing what does he do? He  points people who believe the climate change is a hoax to key positions so you know you get used

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you got to decide. But were you used I mean you're not legitimizing that just because Gore  was there doesn't legitimize that. It makes sense I think everybody understands. We don't know yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean the sad truth is we have no sense of what Trump is really going to do because he's-  Now you go. You go and then but I will say once or if he starts  doing things that are abhorrent to you then yes you would go and I mean it going would legitimize

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you but until he actually takes- I don't think it legitimizes you I mean I think it's for instance  okay. It will at a certain point in time. So he's got an oil he's got Rick Perry in at the  Department of Energy. He's got an oil man. He wants to dismantle it. Yeah so in charge of  Interior. So if you're Elon Musk you go in and say look I don't like this you shouldn't do this  you got to- But he already did it. He did it. But so what do you walk away you've got to continue

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the conversation. Resist. Well you may want to end this conversation because I'm going to get bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You resist. I think it's I don't think that's appropriate. I think the right thing to do is  as with anything you you're glad to be at the table and have the conversation. It does not  legitimize it to be at the table. It does after a certain point in time. Exactly the question is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  exactly Stacy that's right. We're not at that point. I don't think we're at that point in time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  though Jeff. Stacy doesn't think we are and I think that's a legitimate view. I think we are at that  point we aren't. I think we are at that point because he's shown him his character and he's  appointed these people and I think we're already down that road. But that's a disagreement and it's  a fine disagreement to have but I think it's also legitimate to say I won't go. That's what we're  discreet about Leo. Would you think ill of someone who said no I choose not to go? I would do exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what Tim Cook did which is he's clearly not happy being there and I don't blame him.  Trump said a lot among other things that boycott Apple after the San Bernardino thing.  Apple has to bring all their manufacturing back to the United States so we're going to charge  him 35 percent tariff. Of course he also said Apple can bring its money back at a 10 percent  tax rate instead of 35 percent but I think Tim Cook has reason to be uncomfortable and showed  his discomfort. But you want to be at the table and try to influence him. Stacy you would go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would go at this point in time yes and I would listen and try to figure out. I would go forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would go every any moment he lets you. Let's say he does something crazy like literally actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  does deport Muslims. Yeah. At that point in time when he invites you to sit down at the table with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  him you're sitting down with somebody who deported. Yeah so you make it clear I went so I could I could  yell at him so I could try to influence him. I don't think it's okay what he did. I don't think  it's de facto a sign of approval that you have a conversation with somebody you disagree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a big statement though to say that none of the tech media, none of the big CEOs of business  will meet with this man after he's done something like that. That's it's drawing a moral line and  you have to do something pretty significant to to hit that point but there's just a point in time  where you're like I'm sorry and I'm not saying Trump is a serial killer but you probably wouldn't  sit down with Hannibal Lecter. Yes you would. As a journalist you totally would. Well that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  point I think you would I think at any point you would you make it clear I don't approve of this.  I'm here to try to try to talk some sense into this guy but you talk to him and you always I  think it's a huge mistake and I think it comes more from a feeling of revulsion than a feeling  of actual political ardor. It's more like oh I don't want to talk to this guy. I think if you  care you talk to him you keep talking to him and you try to convince him. When you're being used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But how are you being used? You're not being used. You are being used because at a certain point in  time sitting down at the table with the leader who has done something terrible indicates that you  still respect him as a leader. That you're still going to the table. Well you know what we always

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  say is if it's a president we disagree with you respect the office doesn't necessarily mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you respect the man. You could argue that someone has disrespected the office has tarnished the  office so much that you cannot you know you don't agree. And that hasn't happened yet he's not even  in the office. No right well that's what I'm saying I'm not saying that that is where we are.  I'm just saying that that is totally something that could happen. Hopefully it will not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if I'm Tim Cook even if I'm revolted by the idea I go and I think he did go for that reason.  And you look at his expression if you know it's easy to get a bad expression on somebody's face  if they're animated. You could freeze frame any one of these shows and make us look like.  But oh it has been done yeah. So I'm not going to assume but that's why I'm most interested  in what they say and how they look as they come out. I'd like to see the video of that.  But so you can and you can even with body language if not with words and I would say even with words  you should say I don't know you know look this is we're not happy. In a sense we want more H1B.  This happens all the time we want more H1B visas you know whatever this happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you're also talking to him like he's an alleged politician or like an adult. It's kind of like  and again I'm not saying he's reached this point but you know in some people's minds he has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think that's part of the problem. I think that's as bad as you know when the Republicans  refuse to have anything to do with President Obama and said whatever he says we're just going  to stymie it. That's exactly the position that's exactly where we got into problems in this country.  We need to kind of figure out a way to now you're going to maybe you'll say oh well you're assuming  that he's influential that you could he could be influenced he's influenceable.  Yes right well I think we have to if we if not then what is the other choice. I mean then what

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do you do. Is it too soon Leo to sign for 600 technology people who have signed a statement  saying that they're not going to build a Muslim. No that's appropriate that's exactly what you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  should do and you should go in and talk to Mr. Trump and say by the way don't ask us for help in  that because that's that is such an outre idea it's so much against the principles of this great

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  country that we will absolutely refuse to. Okay so let me ask the question another way. So you  have a spot at that table today if you don't use that to say we will not build that registry for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you is that an opportunity wasted. Possibly but you know you can also say it in an open letter  to the president you can say it in a press conference you can say which means you don't  have to be there you don't have to be there but you have to be there if you want to talk to him  and by the way it's not just notices not just him there's a whole his whole many of his whole  family there well but also members of the future cabinet his vice president his advisors this is  a group I think I think you'd be wrong to turn down this opportunity however you feel this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  an opportunity to say you have the full range here Stacey's Stacey's in the in the in the in the  moderate and sensible middle you say you have to go or to keep on going I say don't go and Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  says there's a line well right Stacey here's my question do you care more about the country  or about your own personal beliefs and ideology it's not just about your own personal beliefs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when you're the CEO of a big company like that you are representing an industry right but you  care about the country more than it could be that you care about the country and that's why you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  meet with him I mean that is still a rational progress though I mean what is where does that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  where does that go it may be because then then people are like well this guy can't get the job  done you know let's bring mike pence on this is exactly what the publicans did to obama by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not cover to congress to disagree with him to show that there's a political force you write

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  letters you let congress know we disagree we forcefully disagree we think it's the wrong  thing to do but you first you go and you talk to and you hear him I think you have to and we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not well okay so Jeff may be saying this but we're not saying that they shouldn't hear him at this  point in time and I think actually mark Benioff strategy is really why is Benioff not there  did he get invited if he if he did get invited I could see Benioff deciding not to go I you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he's he's enough of a maverick to firebrand firebrand to do whatever he wants so I'm surprised

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  musk was there I'm really sorry I thought I thought musk would be that firebrand who says I go my own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  way I think Elon is is a sensible guy who says musk is pretty coldly practical I need to influence  the direction that this next administration takes and I'm gonna do everything I can to influence it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  including there's also the cynical view is that I influence it for the benefit of my company and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know screw the rats in the room where it happens if you're not in the room you dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is not where it happens this is where the tv the cameras come yeah this is not where it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  influences this is like I really do believe that I I believe that Donald Trump does this for  this is how he presents and shapes coverage in media in yeah I mean I understand that that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  part of the the kind of the problem people have with this is they feel like they're pawns in an  attempt to um create stories and create news but isn't that isn't that how Washington we in media

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and we in media I mean ABC News last night led with Kanye West visiting Trump versus Tillerson  the head of Exxon being interesting isn't it that's bad news judgment that's bad judgment

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well it depends what you're judging for it's probably judging for economics I know I know  but you know what Trump is a media genius and he's going to be the first new media presidency and  he's a master of it and I told you you should have shut Twitter down before this happened  so so Twitter talk to me about Jack and all right I have my chrome up so I can now actually look at  and open them and I can actually participate in this conversation in a reasonable way here's  the I'm sorry I didn't realize okay here's the politico story Twitter cut out of Trump tech  meeting over what failed emoji deal Twitter was told it was bounced oh this can't be true  bounced from Wednesday's meeting between tech executives and President-elect Donald Trump  in retribution for refusing during the campaign to allow an emoji version of the hashtag crooked

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hillary oh my gosh that can't possibly be true think about think about the tweets of Boeing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the Boeing tweets think about no no I can see the retribution thing I buy oh oh I buy the retribution  but really they tried to get an emoji version of crooked Hillary they even tried oh do you think  they tried that this sounds like this I mean this sounds like fake news this sounds like a  this is a plant by somebody who likes to mess with people that can't be true  maybe it could I don't not believe anything anymore I don't not believe there's no there's  that's part of the problem with fake news I don't not believe anything anymore  it's absolutely conceivable that there would be some retribution we've seen  Donald Trump do that many times many many many times before  if you ask me Donald Trump should be shaking Jack Dorsey's freaking hand I don't oh god yeah god  yeah I mean I again I think that I think idiot savant or genius I don't know which but somehow  he is a master of manipulation you know probably coming from his background running you know being  part of beauty pageants the wrestling world wrestling and and the apprentice I think he's  probably learned a lot about media although that's all old media he's certainly learned a lot about  new media they master they were masterful in manipulating and continue to be masterful and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they put on twitter I'm surprised he hasn't tweeted the media oh he will oh yeah his tweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  really he those are late night affairs they're usually when he's mad at someone yeah I'm you  know what I'm glad I'm not in his position because I I could see myself doing that I've I've had and  Jeff you've had intemperate tweets oh lord knows have we shouldn't we shouldn't we shouldn't really  cast stones in our glass houses at people who have intemperate tweets should we

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he's the president-elect it's a little different now it's it's the power it's it's using the power

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well things like saying I'm gonna I'm gonna take down Boeing stock or I'm gonna take down Lockheed  Martin stock or this or I'm gonna take down this union guy that's petty it's abusive power it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  abusive it's it's maybe he doesn't think of it as abusive of power maybe he's just pissed and he

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  says it oh he does listen to I heard an interview with Megyn Kelly and read her book but I also  heard an interview with her when Trump got mad at her he said I'm going to use my beautiful tweet  the words beautiful twitter account and my 17 million followers or whatever the number is to  get you so he's very well aware of the power of that oh yeah I would also say the intemperate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  tweeting thing and I may be overstepping but I think that's a that might be a you guys thing  and a maybe it's even a guy thing like I very rarely tweet without thinking because I'm aware  that it's going out a lot of places so that means things like I don't I don't share information on  people I don't talk about things that really upset me I don't always give my full opinion  because it would be crazy I don't have a lot of leeway for bad here's the and you're a good person

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and that's why Stacey and we've always known that about you and Jeff and I are far from good people  well I'm at the other end of the spectrum again but this is why that happens we talked about this  a couple of years ago there was a great article I think in the Atlantic and it's a it's an  understandable confusion because Twitter feels like you know water cooler talk it feels very  informal quick off the cuff and a lot of what we write is written in the style of something that's  an off the cuff offhand remark unfortunately the nature of Twitter is it lives forever and so at  the same time as you're in a medium that is really looks like and feels like and emotionally is much  like something very offhand and impermanent it is the exact opposite you're you're and so that's  where this disconnect happens and that's one of the reasons I think kids don't use Twitter as much

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  as snap chat yeah because the impermanence of it Stacey let me so yeah I've been grappling with this  I started writing a piece uh because I got very intemperate one night um when he used the f word  I used it in a particular way did oh did you get it did you get letters too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo no no I just I follow you on Twitter there's a guy who I get an alert when Jeff tweets anytime

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of the day this this guy tweeted sent a letter to everybody around me and so the so so the next day  I tweeted that in upon reflection and and morning and morning light I regretted the incivility of  one word in the tweet but not not the rest um and so I've been thinking about this and here I've  been writing about the angry white men who elected Trump who we didn't listen to and I'm saying that  hypothetically I'm saying that that there's an anger there that we didn't understand we didn't  listen to we didn't reflect back and more than a few but then what am I what am I I'm being an angry  white man right my response to the angry white man is to be an angry white man and and so yeah I think  Stacey you know you're right it's uh is it a guy thing or just a crazy person thing I don't know  I see plenty of crazy women on Twitter too it gets the better of me Rosie O'Donnell is a classic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right well she's in a very privileged and yes she's in a different position but hey you want  to talk about actions on Google and and weave and Brillo I know you guys do we will you're trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to change the subject and I don't blame you one cotton pick a bit in fact really we've we've  milked this one to death let me just quickly go through this Yahoo story and then and then I would  very much like to talk to you uh Yahoo has this is from uh uh Yahoo tech so I think it's true  well it's the they're quoting the boy genius report so I don't uh understand if this counts  as an official acknowledgement from Yahoo since it's on a Yahoo page or it's just like an automated  repeat of the boy genius report Yahoo has reportedly confirmed the existence of a hack  that affects more than one billion user accounts Yahoo said it's likely distinct from that other  hack you remember with hundreds of millions of Yahoo customers so if for some reason CNBC is  reporting that Yahoo has confirmed the existence of new hack and it affects more than a billion  users and it's different hack um so uh I and what we don't know what I'd like to know is the  time and date of the hack so in other words if you change your password as I did and I hope  everybody did after the first 500 million people were hacked do you need to change it again  or should you just get off Yahoo completely right now say forget it goodbye unbelievable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  unbelievable this this one Yahoo believes that it happened in August 2013 oh okay so it is a second

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hack but it is a second hat it believes this before we all learned about the first tax so presumably  any changes we made after the first tax hack also protect us however they have information

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh the investigation okay so here's Yahoo's press release uh the stolen account user account  information may have included names email addresses telephone numbers dobs hash passwords  and in some cases encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers but the information does not  include passwords and clear text what payment card data or bank account information okay  what passwords are being stored in clear text are those the ones you're just sending over email to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people sorry no they whether they they whether they were storing passwords in clear text which

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they weren't well they shouldn't be doing that in 2013 even i agree by the way okay i now have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  retract my skepticism over the crooked hillary emoji okay good somebody looked it up good all  right this is the uh medium post from uh gary kobe director of digital advertising and fundraising  for the trump campaign from when uh this is 13 november 2016 more specific this is his tweet  ceo jack dorsey personally made a call to restrict us we had an upfront deal this is from the trump  campaign we had an upfront deal with twitter where we commit to commit to spending a certain  amount on advertising and exchange receive discounts perks and this is the key phrase custom solutions  uh five million dollars spend blah blah blah what they wanted was a custom hashtag emoji  uh they wanted to launch emojis for the first debate one was a contrasting emoji for the hashtag  crooked hillary they were going to be featured in our promoted trend this is what it was going to  look like this is designed and approved by twitter probably by an agency inside twitter to be used  crooked hillary it's a hand holding a bag of money then i met with tw in new york at trump tower i  guess twitter twitter to tweak the already approved emoji designs pushing the envelope the  hand money bag emoji evolved into a running stick figure with a money bag jesus the tw team thought  this had a good chance of getting approved since all that was changed was a hand to a stick figure  here anyway a day after day jack dorsey was never named just adam bain  the tw told me the new design was yeah it was causing a lot of heartburn in big meetings  in fact the trump campaign and the person of gary kobe confirmed they wanted a custom emoji  and jack dorsey blocked it okay i now believe that story that was unbelievable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so the fakest sounding news can sometimes sometimes you just gotta do some research

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just gotta believe i believe that's how crazy this world is now the things you can't believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are probably true i'm just gonna hide behind my snap spectacles from now on  and record it all i am gonna record it hey what if somebody wore this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to trump tower for a meeting i imagine the secret service would tell you to take it probably no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no yeah they take your phone too i'm sure the secret service seems pretty good at their job

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i know i know they had the fence climbing incidences but in general so i heard i heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  something today from a very reliable news company who went and did some stuff at trump tower with  trump and they when they went they went to the apartment of an l.a they had to wear booties  to not schmutz the company so this is a i make all contractors do that when they come to my house

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah everybody comes to our house does that too but there is and it may be a character assassination  but i think it sounds kind of true there is the story that our president-elect is a germaphobe  much like howard hughes was yes that the betting on the plane for instance has changed not not  really changed each time it's used but thrown away and new betting is purchased  purchased you notice he never shakes hands there's some there's some evidence of that anyway yes  but booties i'm with you don't don't go tramping your your dirty contractor feet all over my dirty  your dirty journalist feet hey journalists they're not too mud all the time yeah we're  muckrakers all right so what did you you had something for us stacy that uh you were trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to dangle a shiny object in there i was i was like look at the google actions google home you guys  so i'm excited about this i'm excited about this yeah i am too super stoked it's not out yet so  basically there's two separate things actions on google which did y'all talk about that last week  did we talk about that last week did it come out then i don't think so let's not really know oh no  because it's wednesday it came out thursday sorry yeah it's always hard to know because we talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  everything so obsessively all the time so let me zoom in on this and we can actually watch this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if i mute my microphone does that help if i mute it on it doesn't because then we can't hear him  well that's kind of the point no i want to hear him i don't care okay ready here we go an exam

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  okay i'll back it up just a little bit here we go through a detailed example of a user interacting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  with a conversation action think about something as simple as helping a user choose what to have  for dinner based on their mood and the ingredients they have around let's call this action personal  chef the user first needs to invoke your action with something like okay google let me talk to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  personal chef this is very similar to what happens with the echo right you you if you want to play

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no it's very different we'll talk about that oh oh all right i can't wait for stacy's analysis

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  good continuing on the assistant will then introduce your action and now the user is talking  to you directly from this point onwards you get to interact with the user and have a conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  okay google let me talk to personal chef sure here's personal chef hi i'm your personal chef

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what that's the difference because it's not just uh it's a new person it's a new pass you off

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to the other cup yes and that's really interesting because well two reasons one it's like you total  new thing so not elect are the echo but two you can create branded voice experiences so if you  think your personal chef should sound like that nice lady great um you could have like your  current spokesperson be your voice from an ad perspective i think it's really interesting and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  really smart okay go ahead you might find yeah keep going into how it's made because i think

Transcript:  that's that's that's the classic google auto translate i got some cancer mottos all right  okay so so she's so it's not like it had a camera in your refrigerator he had to tell her what he

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  had yeah yeah yeah yes but but but the way that you have to anticipate the conversation and the  way you code that using their ai structure is really interesting right stacy yes because notice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  how he speaking but yes but notice how he phrased his question so he was like it's hot it's no it's  cold outside so i want something to warm me up and from that you know they took soup and whatever  and then she asked proteins like she she knew that he wanted a recipe i know it was a cooking  thing so but it was actually not a direct request for anything and that i think is really cool and  on the back end it's really complicated to get that right despite the cancer mottos or cancer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mottos well ironically she understood you saying yeah it was the auto translator on youtube youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah maybe they're not the same systems evidently not so this is a pretty rich interaction think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  about all the sentences i spoke and how the action needs to extract the meaning out of this  how would you implement this if you're an expert in the area of natural language so now this is  going to be you can use the conversation which allows you to do it yeah you want to keep going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's actually really cool okay yeah it is you to process the raw strings that contain the spoken

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  text from the user you can then use the actions sdk that includes all the tools and libraries you  need to build the actions however if you don't want to process the user's transcribed speech  yourself you can use one of the tools that have integrated with actions on google one of these  tools is api.ai which provides an intuitive graphical user interface to create conversational  interfaces and it does the heavy lifting in terms of managing conversational state and filling out  slots in forms this means you'll no longer need to process the raw strings api.ai can do this for  you to handle a conversation use the api.ai developer console to create an intent this is  where you define the information you need from the user for our example finding a kitchen recipe  this would be the type of food the ingredients the temperature and the cooking time you then  specify example sentences api.ai parses these sentences and uses them to train its machine  learning algorithm to process other possible sentences from your users you don't have to  write regular expressions or a parser you can also manually set what the acceptable values are for  each piece of information once this is done api.ai uses these definitions to extract meaning out of  spoken sentences the user can provide information naturally out of order all at once or in pieces  the action can ask follow-up questions as needed pretty neat right once you've set up everything  in the api.ai console you can then test it out immediately with example sentences then you can  test your project with the web simulator preview it on google home or deploy the full project at  google all from within api.ai next you can connect up in an optional webhook to your intent to allow  it to interact with a backend server when all the details you need are filled in your webhook is  called with the appropriate details provided as json data so you don't really have to know anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at all about uh understanding language bingo exactly wow they they give you everything in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like think about all the things like i could have google home talk to people through like one of the  things i want to do yeah is most common question i get is stacy i want to start in the smart home  what should i do but there's there's too many decision trees that branch out from that for me  to like create like a nice article but i could do a chat bot that actually does all the so  do you have an android or an iphone you know then i could route them one way do you want to have a  hub or you just want wi-fi bluetooth and so i could create this conversational interaction that  is way better than doing like a flow chart or a how-to article for my readers listeners people  yeah you're gonna do that yes no maybe oh actually no i might be because i i flirt with this all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  time but it's just it's then you sit down and it's well it's not it's quite as easy as it looks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  no more if you have if you have a big database of stuff right and you're creating and i have a  database yeah if you're epic yeah you do if you're epicurious and you have restaurant recipes right  if you have how-to things like stacy does um that's when it gets interesting there's all you're  doing is creating a bridge between the two so somebody can get to the information they want  you're prompting them to make the right kinds of searches basically right stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's the hope yeah and if they now what they didn't show and what i guess i should play with  this and see if i can make one that fails because i'm curious what happens when your interaction  when you walk when google doesn't understand you right what happens then  so hopefully it in an ideal situation it would it would prompt you with something that might help  it would give you like hey um i'm not sure what you asked do you want to cook a you know meal with  meat or chicken do you want to make a salad or a breakfast meal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well i guess you could get more complicated i would love to i've always thought we should  have some actions that play uh play twit segments and things like oh you know so you can do well you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  can do that on the echo oh okay so can i can i like tie this to some other stuff yeah sorry  i'm getting excited no okay sorry i love it i'm so okay so yesterday also microsoft announced  its cortana sdk and its translate stuff so you guys should look that up because this is kind of  like what the echo does with their skills so actions google actions is akin to echo skills  right and then amazon at aws reinvent put out its own machine learning stuff so its own artificial  intelligence stuff with amazon lex is it amazon lex or aws lex and aws poly and then so what we  basically have now is microsoft has done an sdk google has an sdk for personal assistant and so  does amazon right and now amazon has done speech to text and text to speech and computer vision  much like google has microsoft also did something with translate which is they have some really  powerful speech stuff um so i don't know did you guys follow that did that make any sense  yeah so basically the battle is being joined all the pieces we've established what the big pieces  are and everybody's got something and now next year we're going to see what people can do with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it i'm so excited yeah it is so great so stacy who so if you have um uh apple amazon and google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who are you betting on okay so i have microsoft apple and microsoft wasn't even in there happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doesn't have anything because they they want to protect your privacy or something they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they're focused on privacy so they have serious they could they could theoretically do a  so this is there's a big question because is it your voice interaction that's going to win how  well you can handle speech is it your ai or is it your ecosystem i think ecosystem ultimately

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is what's going to make the distinction even i mean you could assume for instance google home  and echo are roughly equal in ability to recognize your voice i don't think that's true at all i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  echo i think google has a way better handle on what i actually want it to do so i did a video  it's the cheesiest video but i asked the echo what does a dog sound like and then i asked google  what a dog sounds like and if you want you can see the video no no i agree with you so in both cases

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i presume they understood what you were asking right but it was the response that was different  so i'm not disagree that's not what i what i was saying is in terms of voice recognition  understanding your voice they're equal and it was exactly what i was saying which is how the  knowledge base the database differs and going forward i think even more important the api the  integration the right now there's 5 000 echo skills that gives echo a real leg up on google  but google has a leg up in terms of understanding what you're saying  and when it comes to knowledge graph which is where the dog bark or the whale sounds come in  google has its knowledge graph amazon never had a knowledge and google knows more about you as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  person they have a more well-rounded view of you amazon knows what you buy i mean amazon has some

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  things yeah but amazon's developer platform so the way that what we just saw with google  that is far more flexible than what amazon offers people today you have to actually type in your  your commands for things you don't get the ability to be like oh a protein it could also mean chicken

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  beef or yeah no if google can really make it easy to integrate uh you know artificial intelligence  and uh and learning it'll have it so that's what i kind of mean is ultimately the api is what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to win i so google is google is in google's interest to bring this to absolutely everything  that google does and they're going to open it up to other companies amazon has less that they need

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to do although they're making deals you uh you know uh the late great pebble uh that the product  that they had to kill was a little basically an echo in your pocket right can i just tell you i

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  got my refund on that and i'm so sad that i'm not gonna give you wouldn't we have liked to have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah um and apparently google just hired a company google just acquired a company called  chronologix which was going to make an alexa powered i always they always say alexa i mean echo  i don't want to say the a word an echo powered co-watch and it's expected google will put that  into android wear so talk to your watch talk to your phone talk to your house talk to your car

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  are okay so then the other side to this because this is only this is only half the problem half  the battle half the problem half the set off um today no yesterday google basically detailed  its plans for weave and what used to be called brillo and now they're calling oh my god what  are they android things thank you my brain things right so things is the os kind of vision right  for individual devices and weave is a communications protocol that's going to  basically google calls it traits but it's like this is what a light bulb can do this is a light  bulb that can turn on it can turn off these are the colors blah blah blah so everything that speaks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  weave now knows what a light bulb does i'm so glad you're here because i i had no idea  what they were talking about here and i was i was thinking to myself stacey you'll understand this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i will um so what's exciting there is google home supports weave and belkin okay here we go  belkin honeywell wink first alert and a bunch of other companies are also supporting weave and  their products which means soon those things will work with google home we've already said that  they're going to put out something i talked to wink and they're going to put out something i  don't have a time frame on that one though so we're about to see a lot more thanks to weave  integrations with google home and then they're also for those of you guys who've been following  this nest had its own version of weave that was called nest weave yeah and they're going to  finally integrate those two things so we don't have to think about that anymore good yay well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it makes sense for them to start consolidating and kind of making a user uh you know facing product  or having companies make user-facing products they they and that's we've even brillo two years

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ago yeah they did but they didn't know what they were quite doing and i will say and we talk about  this on the podcast to use weave google's confirmed to me that you have to have a we you have to use  the weave server so you have to use the google cloud which means you're if you want to do aws

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh uh but they're doing it for security no yeah yeah they're doing it for security aka we want  a database of everything you say that is the other thing yes yeah it's for uh security security is  now becoming the word that people use when when they asked nintendo when they asked me a motto  at nintendo why you could only play the new mario run game which comes out tomorrow online there's  no offline play he said security and credit to the interviewer mashable who said by security you  mean anti-piracy yeah and he said and then but also credit to shiguro who said yeah that's what  i mean he did three paragraphs on security and really was what he meant is anti-piracy and of  course when google says security they don't mean any piracy they mean so we can collect all the data

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well they mean so they collect all the data but they also need to understand there's there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  huge fragmentation problem there's good reason for them to collect all the data i'm not saying that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's not just not collecting it's not just collecting the data though it's also being  able to offer assurances on to understand what's working with weave and what isn't so you can get  all that log data from these devices because right now troubleshooting a connected device

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right oh you think troubleshooting network does that i think a lot of people don't know actually  we were talking about this on windows weekly a minute ago because microsoft has been talking  about a kartana platform and it's unclear that initially they implied that you needed to have a  device with a screen to use it and paul but you don't right it well it turns out you maybe you  don't but it was unclear and paul was saying well that's just dumb because the echo doesn't need a  screen but the echo really in fact as we know amazon's doing this an echo with a screen for  the kitchen and the echo really does have a screen if you have a kindle fire tablet or you're running  the echo app you can see what you said you can confirm that echo you know you can help echo learn  if it's there you can see the music that's now playing you can see a lot of stuff so  there is a secondary screen it's just not always on but you have it and i think there's something  to be said for that anyway we're going to see kartana i think i still think apple is not out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of this game i don't think they're out of it but they're they're behind their vision for home kit  in and this is something worth thinking about we are very excited about this because we are super  nerds when you talk to other people you know they're not thinking about sdks they're not  thinking about that they're thinking about the experience and apple's like you know what everyone  pays attention to us let's not blur what's happening with tech talk let's just get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on and offer it they don't do it in public they don't pre-announce they just kind of do they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it and it'll all become full-blown that being said they are behind i think their partners are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kind of like let's face it though google was behind echoes two years older and they're catching up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pretty quick well yeah once you once you've built the kind of paradigm i guess which is kind of what  amazon did it's easy to come in and be like oh let us improve upon this yeah google we now understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what's google's doing with self-driving car it's not going to build a self-driving car  it's going from being a moonshot to an independent alpha company called i kind of like this name way  mo like it too waymo i like it waymo vehicles it will not be a vehicle without steering wheel and  gas and brake it will be a platform they sell to other car manufacturers so they won't make cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is that that's what they're saying speculation that's yeah and i think that's well well all of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is speculation um they except for the waymo part i was like no they confirmed waymo yeah john  kraftchik who is the new ceo told reporters at a press event yesterday that waymo is a company  with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to move around what you're feeling this  is all a quote what you're feeling from the waymo team is confidence that we can bring this technology  to people we're getting close we're getting ready it's time to tell the world about that  but they you know he does say our next step as waymo will be to let people use our vehicles  to do everything things like run errands so it sounds like but but i think that they mentioned  that they're partnering with chrysler right fiat chrysler and in fact uh  i'm not it's not clear i think you're right jeff that this is speculation yeah i couldn't i couldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  get a definitive um there's also the the rumors about or not rumors about they're going to work  with chrysler on on the thing is that real are they going to make their own or they're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  offer you know let me log into my account because this is of course amira friday who's got the  great connections at google writing for the information and i pay money for this so let's  oh me too yeah it's well worth it they've been breaking even more stories than than ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  frankly yeah they're doing a great job yeah i have a kind of fun business model too  yeah 400 bucks a year that's a good business model i got it on half off just a couple weeks ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah oh too late for all of you jessica uh you know this is all part of that we've talked about  it before uh the new cfo ruth porat uh belt tightening and spinning it out of the uh moon  launch means now it's a company that has to have you know performance they're going to have to do  profit loss statements and and so forth so um chauffeur what is chauffeur the broader strategic  change allowed the leaders of chauffeur as the self-driving unit is known at the co as the company  to consider launching a commercial ride sharing service this is a amir at the at the information

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with autonomous vehicles by the end of next year like a year from now there's there's a lot of  rushing going on here i mean supposedly um right uber is offering autonomous rides now in cleveland  and san francisco right but there's still a driver so you can't really tell if you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i mean that'd be like me saying get in get in the car jeff and i'm gonna let uh that my tesla drive  us over the golden gear bridge that made me feel better or worse should make you feel better  whether chauffeur can launch what this is amir rafrati again whether chauffeur can launch what  is called a robo taxi service in that time frame depends on the performance of a new self-driving  car prototype manufactured for google by fiat chrysler the first of the prototypes were due  to be in chauffeur's hands by the end of this year and then they have a deal to increase production  with an electric hybrid the pacifica minivan  which retails for more than 42 000 without the extra google hardware and software into the  hundreds of vehicles car could then be used in the new service so maybe boy 2017 this is rushing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  along isn't it yeah yeah because i think we were all thinking oh it's going to be you know 20 25  2030 this is way off for them they're they're pushing this well they said i mean everybody's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  committed to 2020 i i mean for what it's worth and that's coming up sarah gave brin who's had

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a hand in chauffeur from nearly the beginning had been hoping the unit would continue to work on a  system for vehicles without a wheel according to amir's sources the self-driving car unit's former  chief chris urmson had also wanted to pursue this approach he left this summer less than a year  after mr page hired mr kraftchik to lead a chauffeur and bring much needed structure and urgency to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  program so without a wheel like a steering wheel yeah remember the google the little google car

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  here's the so that's also a benefit of twitter though because you can see things that otherwise  the media wouldn't let you see that are arguably worth knowing about jeff does kind of have a

Transcript:  exiting we'll uh we'll watch for that if that of all that they've all disappeared

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a puff of smoke a greasy black puck of puff of smoke  uh let's see what else there's a lot there's actually a lot of news this week  yeah there is a google decided not to give the usual gifts every year google gives phones and  chrome books and stuff to its employees instead they're going to take that 30 million dollars and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  give it to charity nice just like i.o. yeah i think that's great by the way is the right and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the right thing to do in both cases and incidentally our wedding this is the did you you you you didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  give uh bridesmaids and uh you did you did not get candy dolmens or a pack of cards with our name you  got a uh we donated to make a wish i was going to do planned parenthood but my in-laws were against

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you shouldn't do it and i'll tell you why because it implies that you know like you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  planning parenthood yes or not but sick kids everyone could get behind everybody get behind

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sick kids uh incidentally this is the other thing you do besides go to those meetings which i think  you do google also is hiring lobbyists and in this case hiring republican lobbyists to get into the  you know get in the get in the conversation you don't want to always had republican lobbyists  there so google's getting any good business including by the way i'll point out the trump  organization donates to both parties and wants to have a seat at the table no matter who is in the  white house because you have to do business in that country that's part of the deal i think i

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  haven't really said this to my bosses yet here but i think that as a school we should be recruiting  conservative students well hell yeah now it's not gonna be a very comfortable position for them we  have to make a safe space for them so to speak it's a diversity program well it's also just  it's good for all the other students to be able to have discussions absolutely one of my in my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  intro my intro to journalism class at ut the guy who did some hyper christian magazine was our  journalism professor and he was i mean this was all these mostly liberals who go into the media like  i'm gonna change the world and do good in society and he's like this hardcore christian conservative  and we were just like wow it's good for you it was it's good for you yeah yeah it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's a great story in the washington post about young children like five and six-year-olds  who even when cameras aren't on them are doing youtube videos so this is i feel like this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not just youtube but it is also a small part of the population but i will say like my  younger children that all they know is like facetime for interacting and that sort of thing so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i can see how they are acting the the lead is this kid max who's six years old and has learned how  to flip bottles you know so they land uh upright upside down and he's doing it and he's and and  this is really wild he shouts dude it landed waves his arms he knows just how to overreact  to get his audience excited which makes them click thumbs up and comment and subscribe he jumps he  wiggles his hips he does the dab oh my gosh he yells this is insane but no one is watching  play that's what kids do he's imitating what he sees on the tube well but where where is he

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there that's it's this is this is techno panic that just drives me bananas nothing to worry about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah yeah i i would not i mean it if anything all it does is show that these parents really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  show their kids a lot of youtube videos well they they watch i mean i don't yeah they let their kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i don't know if the well in some of them do have videos but i mean yeah my kid she doesn't watch  tv she watches right people on youtube right so that's what she acts like you know that actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ugly back then yeah it's uglier now so here's the question the phone green i saw you this is as an

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  divide tech reporters into people who care about tech and people who write about features and  products which i feel are totally it's totally different styles of journalism and it's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there's a third and i and i dearly love the guardian i work with but there's a third is  there stacey which is also the start there's starting to be a tech writer group of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who don't like tech oh that's nothing new john z dvorak made a uh made a career out of that  nothing new at all in fact i i kind of embraced that oh i know i know the big story i wanted to  talk about magic leap yeah so uh not quite theranos but speaking of dystopian tech writers  yeah nick stat famous for that magic leap was actually way behind like we always  suspected it was by the way it should be as we always can i just wait a minute let me just  get my uh my blue pencil out here is it red or blue what color should i use red red all right  and then what do i do i put as and an arrow like that you uh that would be that that was the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to do it no you'd cross it out and then put an arrow underneath it and above it put as

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you just do one line i gotta learn about the copy editing thing yes because this is gonna be  fun  so magically has been sung at the praises have been sung google big investor in magically  the idea is this was one of the augmented reality technologies and many said the  best of them but the problem was the technology  was net nobody ever really saw it and it thought they did yeah people come back and say oh i saw  life changing well and even magically now is admitted that the the video they used to uh  recruit new employees was completely faked was done by weta the folks who did the special effects  for the hobbit that's so funny um this again the information had the story and it was it was a  this was a great story and unfortunately i mean the video says uh the games are playing around  the office right now this is completely fake now of course this is what they want it to be  the information said well we got a demo of the magic leap it's a giant helmet you can barely  hold your head up connects to a desktop computer with multiple cables it's kind of like hololens  which is a microsoft product that exists right now let me turn the sound off on this  but the images are in some cases blurrier and more jittery than microsoft's prototype  so apparently uh the information says the problem lies with magic sleep magic leaps gamble on fiber  scanning displays which shines a laser through a fiber optic cable that moves rapidly back and  forth to draw images out of light that's actually very similar to the way your old tv set worked  the company thought the fiber scanning display could be magic leaps breakthrough tech allowing  it to shrink down the extremely expensive hardware used on a previous prototype a refrigerated  refrigerator size device known internally as the beast magic leap still has not been able to get  fiber scanning to work  so i'm actually disappointed but man it just so this is why if you're a tech writer and you're  you know pessimistic about it you're usually right that's what i learned from dvorak you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  look at anything not always that's not true and i think you might be right in the short term  but in the long term a lot of the trends that we expect to see do actually happen i guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah but often they take longer well yeah but that's i mean this is hard stuff yeah no i know  yeah but don't get your hopes up you're not gonna it doesn't sound like you're gonna be getting a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  magic leap helmet anytime soon well you know how many people do you know who went to see it and  came back believing they'd see it so i don't know how much they actually saw maybe they did see  more maybe it's not so maybe the video was was bad maybe maybe the farther along i mean part of  the problem it said the story said is that miniaturizing all that technology is hard it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not practical the way it is right now yeah there's in fact the whole story on why it's so hard to do  although some have said it's kind of a little theranos like i don't think it's that bad i  don't think it's a scam let's put it that way uh bots the bots act we should probably mention that  congress has passed a law or moves has moved to pass a law it's passed through the house of  representatives called the better online ticket sales act or bots act actually the bill passed  the senate a week ago so now it goes to the white house so it is almost a law if i remember my  schoolhouse rock schoolhouse rock jingle uh lind Manuel Moreno the creator of hamilton one of the  strong advocates for this it's true you can't get tickets to hamilton because the minute new  tickets go on sale these bots go out and buy them all up and then try to sell them back to you for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thousands of dollars so how can you how can you outlaw them how can you really know it's a bot  a clever bot you wouldn't know it's a bot right um well no you can easily put in um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you can easily put in yeah there's all sorts of ways or you prevent somebody from buying more  than two tickets every five minutes or whatever i mean there's it's not but you need to make it  illegal first the problem is you can catch them but it's not illegal now it will be illegal  ticket bots are illegal in new york uh they increased the penalties last month that didn't  stop uh broadway sales uh an investigation by the new york state attorney general found abuses like  a single scalper buying more than a thousand tickets and under a minute for a u2 concert in  madison square garden  so yeah actually that's an interesting question i think the first step is really make it clearly  illegal uh to well the bots act makes it illegal to bypass an online security system

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so interesting twist and we're not there yet but what if i tell google home to hey  get me some tickets while i'm out yeah i don't think that would rise to that level

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well i think the real issue is if people buy me a thousand yeah thousand tickets that's really the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  issue well but that's that's kind of an interesting thing when they're writing that law because when  you're writing a law like that if you ban bots you ban potentially useful services right although  you could argue then that you know by virtue of having broadband in google home i am thus  privileged above other people so right and you could argue that rabbit hole you're also  privileged by virtue of genetics all kinds of things where i live what can you do it's just life

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh how about we take a break and come back with your picks of the week unless there's a story  i'll give you oh wow oh jeez i know well we're only an hour and 43 minutes into the show although i  think karsten if uh if we can get one of the editors to tighten it up a little bit all that  stuff where i'm fompering around because i'm trying to do this show in sunglasses  that would probably be with no good browser with with edge be nice to tighten it up a little bit
