Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twig! This is the show where we talk about Google, the cloud and anything Gina Trapani damn well wants to talk about.  And that's the truth. Gina Trapani is here from SmarterWare.org, founding editor of Lifehacker.com.  Hi Gina.  Yeah, and you know, really we don't want to limit ourselves to anything.  It's whatever we're in the mood to talk about.  Yeah.  Chipotle, Glee, whatever!  Also here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York, blogger at blogmachine.com, buzzmachine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's a big drinking game week, folks. You got Glee on, we got Chipotle.  Chipotle.  Leo's hungry. It's getting ready to get drunk.  Much fun ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now they're calling you Iron Man, Jeff Iron Man Jarvis. Did you just do something like come back from somewhere or?  The dead?  I don't know why the chat room's calling you Iron Man.  I don't know why either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well you do travel a lot.  I do.  Yes.  No, I just got out of a trip to Moscow. I'm actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. But we are going to lose you for a couple of shows, I think.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe, no, maybe not. I think I can do, Seoul and Sydney, I think I can get up.  Oh, yeah.  By PJs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seoul for sure. You'll have unlimited bandwidth in South Korea. Australia can be hit and miss sometimes.  But yeah, you know, we'll be the middle of the night. I'm sorry about that.  It's dedication.  Also with us, Mr. Mike Elgin, who is on our suggested users list. That's for sure.  Suggested host list, Elgin.com, big user of Google+. And actually, you were a big story this week on  Google+, because as you said on Plus, you had been bumped from the suggested users list. I mean, of all people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it all turned out to be a big mistake.  Oh.  So I've been restored to my unfair position on the recommended list. It's awesome to be on there. But  yeah, I was off for about three days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Vic Gundotra put you back. But what did he say?  Why can't we get Leo on?  Well, that's all right. I don't give up. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said, he said, it sounds like a mistake to me. Let me look into it. He looked into it and he  fired 20 people and now I'm back. I don't know what happened. But  I'm happy to be back on.  And what category are you in on the suggested users list?  I'm in tech, which I guess is better than the categories that Gina and Jeff are in.  They're in news.  I shouldn't be where Gina should be.  Oh, they never fixed that, huh?  No. They're still in the opposite categories. Tech is okay. I post a lot of stuff that isn't  tech though. But whatever. I think a lot of people who are interested in tech start circling me and  they get enough tech for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there it is. How many people you have in circles? Okay, good. Yes. The number is there.  So this is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm approaching a million, which is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It makes sense that Google do this because, and Twitter does it, Facebook even suggests users to  you. Because when you first get to a social network, it's kind of unknown what's going on  here. And if you don't follow people on these networks, you see nothing. So they give you  categories starting with featured. Let's see, Ashley Tisdale, Jim Kramer, Cristano Ronaldo.  I imagine these rotate. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They kind of do. And very slowly. It's the same group for like three months and then they  get rid of like 12 people and add 25 or something like that.  It's very controversial on Google Plus though, because a lot of people aren't very good users.  They're just famous movie stars or something. I mean, some of these people never post anything  and they're on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If anybody should be on this list, it would be you. Because if posting is important,  you are very active. You use this as your sole one and only thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I also encourage everybody who's on that list to sort of spread the love around.  And I try to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, because with great power comes great responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, like Spider-Man.  Like Spider-Man.  It's a lot like Spider-Man. But I think you need something. When people first arrive,  from Google's interest, they don't want people to sign up and then circle nobody and then just sit  there with...  All they hear is crickets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is a good list. It's eclectic.  What Google does, which I think really gives these people a huge advantage,  is there's a kind of follow all button.  Yeah, that's what happens.  So when you press that follow, you go, oh yeah, I definitely want to follow.  So I think probably most new users go click, click, click, click, click, click,  write down the list. Oh, I'm not interested in music. They might skip.  I'm not interested in news. They might skip.  And certainly they get to the bottom of the list and they go to technology.  And that's important that these people be on there.  But Google doesn't say how... I mean, there's a lot of power.  Did they say how you get on this list? Did Vic tell you that?  No, that is completely...  Because I used to be on it. I feel like... What did I do?  Which is ridiculous. You're the guy who wants to be on it.  I don't want to whine. See, you're on tech.  You should be on news, you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is even though you have... I now have 103 million followers, which is absurd.  I'm sure the algorithm does not show all of my stuff to somebody in Thailand.  Right? I don't know.  Does it?  There's some flow in there because the comments I get are generally from people who are  interested in what I'm interested in and not people saying, would you shut up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. That's what I get.  I think what I noticed that's funny about being on the list is that  I often see all these people circling me. It's literally oftentimes thousands per day more,  which is crazy. I try to see who they are and 99% of them are brand new.  These are... A lot of these people are just coming in, clicking that button,  and now they're circling me and they have never posted anything.  They've hardly circled me.  How many of those are spam beasts though, you think?  It's significantly less than 1%, but that's a lot of people.  Now that Google is automating the... Suppressing the spam thing,  which I'm not sure is a great idea in the long run.  They used to just let the spam comments exist in the comments and then it was up to the  user to go in and delete them. Now they... If anybody flags them,  they go into this invisible area where you can go delete them, but nobody goes in there now  because they're out of sight, out of mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're still there. I still see them, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody has to flag them. If nobody flags them, they'll just sit there.  I'm actually much happier with it this way.  Yeah. It's funny. I think in terms of users, Jeff and I are very,  very different in terms of the types of things we post. Jeff posts all this intellectual stuff.  You pretty much have to... Anger. Anger is what I post.  Well, no, but you have to be pretty well educated and pretty good with English.  I post a lot of stuff that's just visual or just very simple and it plays really well in  countries where people aren't speaking English very well.  I get on the What's Hot list a lot for that very reason, I think.  If you post a lot of stuff about, obviously, journalism and privacy and all those kinds of  things, which if you barely speak English and you live in Madagascar or something like that,  you're not going to relate to it as much as something that's almost purely visual or  something that's just an amazing yacht. Animated GIFs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I don't post those, but... I should post more animated GIFs. I think that  would get me on the suggested user list. It might.  I know I'm not because I only have 294,000 followers, which is up 10,000 from six months  ago or something. The reason that's important, we talk about this, and I'm sure it was important  to you, Mike, is a million followers. That's something. Even if some of them are spam,  that's a lot of people. I think that means anybody who joins Google Plus is very likely to follow you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really funny. Sometimes I post things and I get... It's hard to believe with so many  followers, but sometimes I post things and I get three comments.  It can really be that. I saw somebody analyze what you do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which is I think really interesting. You always have... I started doing this too because I think  this is really cool. You bold the first line. It's a headline, basically. Then you do a lot  of paragraphing, which makes it easy to understand what you're talking about and a lot of links. Is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that true? Then you always have an image. That's true. It used to be with the old design,  if you shared somebody else's post or just pasted a link and let it automatically put  the little picture in a blurb, then you get this unappealing thing that doesn't get a lot of  engagement. I found that if you just post an original post and then put just a regular old  fashion link in there, put your own picture in there, you get a lot more engagement. It feels  like... I don't know. I really don't know what it is. Now, if you reshare a photo, the photo is full  size. I love this. It's nice. Yeah, big. Full size photos and videos are really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Let's get to the redesign. I'm done bitching. Congratulations on getting back onto  the suggested users list, Mike. I'm proud of you. You're only going to start bitching now.  Well, yeah, that's a good point. Let's talk about... Let the bitching begin.  You know what? I don't want to be that guy who hates anything new. I think I actually,  I'm pretty proud of myself. I think for an old fart, I tend to like new stuff more, in fact.  I'm kind of a fan of the new. So I'm not going to say anything. I'm going to let you guys convince  me why the Google Plus redesign is so cool. Gina Tripani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina? It's much better. There are a lot of things I really like about it. First, I really like the  way that you can customize it. I like that you can drag items in the left sidebar and hide them if  you don't like them. For example, I don't play games on Google Plus, so I just drag that down  into the more link, which makes it go away, which is really nice. Yeah, that is nice.  I like the activity drawer, what they're calling the activity drawer on each post, which is  on the bottom right. It's a little arrow that will expand activity information on the post,  who liked it and who shared it and that kind of thing. It'll replace the comments with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where is it? Show me that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On a post that has activity on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen that. I don't see it right now. On the right here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, go to that. I've got his back.  There it is. Here we go. This shows the activity.  Calling that the activity drawer. It flips down and shows you who liked it. You can replace  comments, which is a nice UI to me. I really like whitespace in general. I like the way that-  You don't mind this column here?  That does look a little weird to me. It was interesting. I hadn't seen that because my  browser wasn't full screen. That is a little strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really, it seems that Google wants you to take your browser, and this is an 11-inch screen,  and squeeze- Oh, wait a minute. I'm sorry. It seems as if Google wants you to squeeze your browser.  Wait a minute. You see what I'm saying? This is stupid. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  It's bad HTML.  I'm sorry. Tell me more about why this is great, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I also like the way each one of the posts is kind of contained inside of a particular  box where, hey, I'm saying something. I like the layout. I like how the emphasis is on the stream.  I really like the profile. If you click on your profile, this is very actually- The new thing in  the profile is very Facebooky. You can add a banner image across the top. Click on that profile button.  Oh.  So you can replace those photos. Mouse over your photos at the top there. If you  choose change photos, you can choose just a banner photo across the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't I have that, Leo? If you were to mean-  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it gives you a really big profile picture too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. So wait a minute. No. Stop. Go away. Okay. Go to Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at that huge, gorgeous picture of you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had to change it because it was so ugly that I realized, oh, now it's going to be- So now you  have- Oh, this is neat. That's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, in general, just the big pictures, the big videos, it makes it just a much more compelling

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looks a little bit like- Gosh, what does that look like? It seems familiar. I've seen that  before somewhere. It's so ridiculously light.  I'm trying to think about where I've seen that.  Where do you have that big thing going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's the most pathetic part is that it looks exactly like some other service we're  trying to remember right now. I don't know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Facebook. That's it. Facebook. Now, by the way, this is even more interesting. Now,  apparently, these things, this item slides under that until it gets to- Oh, then it disappears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's slightly responsive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess. Okay. One of the things that- What else do we love about this? Tell me. I do like  the fact that I could change these buttons up here. Christmas Sena did a fun post. If you go  to your circles, you can, by dragging, it's the first three circles in your circles are the  buttons up here. So I decided, or the first two. So I decided I needed Twitter and friends more  than I needed acquaintances, whatever those were. So you just move these around. What are these  first two circles you're going to have in the homepage there? That's nice. What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The pictures are- They're emphasizing hangouts a lot by putting that constant hangout in the  right and the chatting with, they're trying to increase. They keep trying to push hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hangout obviously matters a lot to them. Hangouts has its own page now. If you look in the  thing called the- What are they calling it? They're calling it the- They want you to video chat  with the whole family. Calling it the ribbon on the left. And so now it's a whole hangouts page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got its button, right? Here's the hangouts page. Yeah. And there are hangouts to watch,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hangouts to join. And all those ones that are available to join are ones that you've been  invited to. So they're either public or you've been specifically invited. Right. And they even

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have a very large banner, which I hope someday I'll be able to close advertising all the  wonderful features. That's a, you know, on an 11 inch screen, that's a third of the screen,  this banner, this ad. Is that going to go away? Yeah, I'm surprised that there is a, don't show  me this anymore button there. And usually, Facebook usually, Hey Google, you should go look  at Facebook. They usually have a close this button there. I like how they do that. Leo's  salty today. This is horrible. I'm not kidding. This is so retro. These boxes around everything.  You think that's good? Look at all the boxiness. They call it a card. And the idea is that there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so much stuff associated with the post. You've got the likes, you've got the buttons for controls.  There are third party browser plugins and you can have, you know, a dozen of these things that  translate the language, do all these things. And those are all contained with the comments in a  single container. I like the idea that they're corralled together. So it's a single unit that  can be passed around and so on. The other thing, the other thing that that's, there's a lot of,  for a service that specializes in something called circles, there are a lot of edges,  there are a lot of right angles, which is a little bit visually annoying, but they've really  improved the appearance of photo photographs. I do like that. They clearly know, they clearly know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that photographers love Google plus and they want to encourage that. Yeah. So now we've got trending  topics, always visible a lot Twitter, by the way, one of them, of course, as usual, Nikki Minaj  and Britney Spears are included in the list. They always will be. You just might as well just leave  that there. One of them is hashtag white space, which shows you that it's kind of,  it's kind of something people aren't crazy about. I'm not alone, I guess, in my,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see the white space is future-proofing. This is a very future-proofed design. Apparently,  Vic Conductor says we're going to use this. Yeah. And they can, you know, the stuff on the,  in the ribbon on the left, that is, you can add an infinite number of stuff to that.  There's a lot of places to add more stuff and you can be sure they will. So I might be able to drag

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a piece of something there that I use a lot or? Could be, but it's, they seem to have given

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  themselves a lot more flexibility, but it has to be said, I think one of the, the one in,  totally non-controversial change, the performance is way better. Is it? When you click, when you  used to click to do a new comment, you'd click the mouse pointer in where you're going to add a  post and you used to have to wait, you know, two or three seconds before it responded and let you  start typing. Now it's pretty instantaneous to start a new post. I find that when I try to add

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people, they're recommending to me, that's taking forever in that box. So if you go to,  where does it, where does it suggest people to me?  Or you may know, and you click on that thing. This must be in this white space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have it either. I don't, I used to occasionally get stuff like that there.  I don't know what's going on. It's actually really good. It makes good recommendations.  Yeah. No, it's the best one in the out there. I don't see it either. So, so top three hated  things about it, Leo. I just, well, I mean, you know, I've  go ahead. I don't know. I mean, it's just, it's a, it's an overall feeling. I, I feel like  these boxes feel very constipated to me, especially given the waste of my screen real estate that  they've imposed on me here. Um, it's, you know, it's, it's my opinion, I guess in general that  Google is very clearly going to start using my screen real estate to promote Google.  You know, this is why everybody liked google.com. Now all of a sudden it's full of crap.  It's, and it's just the beginning. And I think this is the new Google saying,  whatever we're on your screen, we're going to be in your face with all of our stuff.  Oh, was the old design good? It was simple. Oh, okay. Look at now. It's trying to get me  chrome. It's trying to be, visit the Google art project. It's got this bar up here. That's  just google.com plus video, Google plus design. Well, I don't, you're right. I mean, I suppose  this is more functional, I guess. I don't know. I just, um, and you know, maybe it's a response,  maybe it's designed for Chromebooks. Oh, look, I didn't know that, but apparently I changed my

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  profile. Oh, when you, yeah, when we were looking at the banner, you had chosen the, I chose it.  Yeah. So yeah, click on that and you can go back to your photos. Oh, I see. You're right. I clicked  there. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to leave that. The gripe with this is that the comment text isn't,  doesn't have enough contrast. It's hard to read the comment text. It's not great. I don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that either. It's a weird choice. And bold doesn't really show up very well in the grade comments. So  I used to use bolding as, as Mike does, it looks great in the initial posts. Let me find the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The person's name is black, but what they say is gray. Yeah. And that seemed a little strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, those things they can fix, right? Yes. Yeah. You see here, it's great. They tend to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that's, I don't think they will fix it because I think they, they're trying to create a  higher hierarchy. So the, the, the, the more readable it's the same, the type is the same size  in the, in the post and the comments, but by giving the host a white background, it de-emphasizes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what's in the gray background. Right. Yeah. I think that's, that makes sense. Right. So making  the comment kind of an addendum to the post, but I think you can do that without making the comment

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  text, you know, difficult to read. Leo, can I, I have a prepared statement essentially about.  Yes. Let's hear your prepared statement. Because I, because I, they've, they've been a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  discussions about this concept of. By the way, this is a stream while you talk, I'm just going  to show the stream. This is the hashtag uses for white space. What you could do with that white space  that you've got. Put your kitten, a lot of people put Facebook there. Oh, Clippy. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some bacon would be nice. I wouldn't mind. I think people should harass apple.com to fill up all that  white space. Cause it's so horrible. All that wasted space. Yeah, but that's, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a difference, isn't there between this and apple.com? Well, the apple.com, they want me to use  this apple.com is an ad for apple. Google wants me to use this. Right. Right. I mean, I'm a big fan

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of white space. And one of the things I hate about Facebook is there isn't any. And so you're just  hammered by this cacophony of visual noise and I can't stand to look at it. It's like, it's just  way too much. There's stuff. Remember the controversy of, of the, of the hidden messages where,  you know, if something, if Facebook decided you might be spam, put it in this folder, it was right  there in the left nav bar. This just click it and you would see the stuff, but nobody ever did.  Nobody ever paid attention because there's so much stuff in the left. There is a lot going on.  And it's just, it's just too much. And, and I kind of like the white space, but back to the idea of  all these different features being foisted upon the user, it, it was, it seems clear to me. And,  and in fact, Google has actually announced this explicitly that what they're doing right now is  are reversing course in terms of being a company that has here's a fee. Here's a product. There's  a product. Here's a product. There's a product. They have nothing to do with each other. First,  they long ago, they unified the passwords and then eventually unified the privacy policies.  And now everything is showing up everywhere. What they're doing is they're taking different  products and they're turning them into features of a single product. They want you to be a Google  user. And here are all the things. And, and, and if you think about it, if you look at  Facebook, nobody complains that messages is being forced on you. If you're a user of Facebook,  you think, well, that's just a feature of Facebook. So Google is doing something,  you know, unusual in that they're starting with a bunch of products and they're moving to a unified  product. But I mean, look at Apple, everybody loves Apple because it's all just, you know,  if you use the iPhone, you're also using iTunes, using all these other things.  Nobody complains about it because it was like that from the beginning. So I really think that  people should take what Google said more seriously in terms of genuinely unifying disparate products  into a single product. And I think they're doing it for survival because they found that there's  so much stuff going on out there for, for, for Google to just have all these disconnected things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  isn't really serving their, their mission. But I'll agree with Leo here that I don't  disagree with unification. I do think that if they did it with better designers,  and a better aesthetic sense and a better sense of use, that would be a good thing.  Yeah. And they're up against tough competition. They're not saying Facebook is gorgeous,  or Twitter is gorgeous, but Apple is. And I think that Google could be a lot prettier than it is.  And the white space, I like white space, but white space, because we didn't know what to put in it,  is not white space. It's, it's a mistake. Yeah. You know, I think, I think it's probably fixable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you're right. I think that what do they call it? The bar, the toolbar on the left ribbon,  ribbon ribbon. That's a Microsoft word. Yeah. The ribbon makes a lot of sense. The fact that  it's customizable is fantastic. That's exactly what you want. I think there's potential here.  It just, it feels simultaneously cluttered and a wasted and a lot and wasted space. It's a bizarre,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's better. I think it's, it's got some elegant, you know, things about it,  like the ribbon, but I think that it's not art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Jason Callicast, putting Twitter in the white space. I think that's what I'll do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I do, I do think that, that, that it's an interesting change for Google because recently  they've been a design driven company, whether you like this design or not, it's a design.  It is a design. Their websites used to basically be design free. Yeah. And, and now they're,  they're actually designing things and using design as a, as a, as a strategic advantage or,  or the, you know, they're attempting it. And that's a very big change. And  that's another way they're unifying their products is through design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me show you one other thing that I, that I think is probably an unintended consequence.  I often use, increase the font sizes on my pages because I'm an old man and this is a fairly fine  font. I'm going to just do it, notch it up one and that's the result. Notch it up to, I mean,  now it's certainly legible, but boy, it's not, it's not what I would call responding probably  in an intelligent way that if you really like this chat bar, they disappear at the drop of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hat. You know, the truth is I don't like the chat bar. It's why I like to get rid of the chat bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, give me a chat with anybody. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. I don't want that there.  I want the option to get that and get rid of that. And I don't, and the truth is I don't use  hangouts and so much space is dedicated to getting to me to use a hangout. I feel a little  put upon, but here it is that you might like things. So this is the, these are the things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you might want to add. If you click over, if you, if you, if you mouse over that you might like,  you will see on the right, no mouse over the top line and you'll see it go to a full page of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, maybe that's different from people you should follow.  You may know. Yeah. You may know.  Yeah. That's another one. I mean, I think that it's not, it's not the end of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously. Well, you were just dissing Google Plus last week anyway. So yeah, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're trying to, trying to keep this fresh and interesting and useful.  I think they've deprecated the content and they've upticked their promotion.  And I think that that is not the direction I would want it to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More than it was already on Google Plus. I mean, they already had hangouts there and trying to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you to join Google and all that stuff. Is this, is it my imagination or is the content,  the posts aren't, it's a smaller portion of the page, it feels like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they're emphasizing media in ways that they weren't before.  Right. I mean, the images are much bigger. I do like that.  I think that's a good, yeah, that's a good choice. I mean.  And video too. And video too, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is how a hangout is now displayed, which I think is nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, I feel a little put upon by hangouts as well because I don't use it as much as I thought  that I would, but hangouts is the one big differentiating feature for Google Plus.  And it's a really cool feature. I think that a lot of people really like it.  So it makes sense that they would say, you know, that they would promote it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I think the internet, all of the tech giants have discovered that the key to  mega success is the ability to change user behavior at scale.  And this whole design and even the previous design is designed to get you to change your behavior.  They're trying to move the world from a non hangout using world to a hangout using world.  I kind of percent that.  Instead, yeah. Well, it's and it's different for Google. Google used to be like, you know,  here's our stuff, do whatever you want. And now they're kind of like,  here's what you should be doing.  Right.  So, you know, but it works for Apple. That's for sure.  Apple's really masterful at changing user behavior.  And that's the key to their success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's maybe a little disappointing for me because I always thought of Google as the  anti-Apple, right? The alternative, maybe in some ways. And if they're just going to be  just like Apple, well, what have we gained? Where, you know, they're the alternative to  Facebook, too, for many of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is interesting to see these companies kind of move toward one another. Right. I mean,  one of our big gripes with Facebook is that it's this closed, unified space that you have to sign  in to get content. Right. And Google was the opposite of that. It was open. It was public.  You didn't have to be signed in everything. You know, was it? But now Google's moving toward  being more unified. And I think probably Facebook would benefit from being a little more open.  And we're seeing a similar kind of thing with Apple and Google. Right. I mean, Larry Page  talks about his discussions with Steve Jobs. And I know those are driving his this this  unification and this emphasis on a clean, simple, beautiful interface, which he talked about in his  year-end memo, which I think came out after our episode last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, we should talk about that. I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's just interesting to see these companies recognize, you know, in the face of  their own strengths, recognize their weaknesses and try to kind of move toward, you know, the others  strategy. But when you do things kind of half-assed, sometimes you get products that  are, you know, don't don't quite make it. What's the most beautiful Google product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's the circles editor in Google+. That's pretty cool. That's the Andy Hertz  filter. I'd love to hear from some designers and maybe there's some designers in the chat room or  somewhere who could talk to us. But I'd love to hear from some designers about what they  think about this. It doesn't there's I can't articulate it, but it feels to me a little  framed and claustrophobic and like escape proof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you compare it to Facebook, like Leo, when you're switching, Facebook's a horrible design.  Yeah, I think Paul Ford said it's like a police van crashing into an Ikea continuously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And everybody agrees on that. It's you know, we all know that it's a horrible design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I know you don't agree with me, Leo, but I would say right now Google  Plus is the most beautiful product that Google has.  Well, you have better taste than I do.  No, I don't. I'm not a designer and you should but you should get a real designer on to discuss  to discuss these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Roro says and this is true. He says it's left justified. That's one of the reasons you don't  like it. It is left justified, which is kind of nowadays, I don't think necessary, but  OK.  Well, let me ask you another question. What's the most. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say I've been using a new to do list called Appigo to do and it's a really  interesting design thing that they did and I would love for Google to to to sort of copy this  approach that it's a to do list that has separate apps for the desktop for the iPad and for the  iPhone. And each of those apps is completely different from each other. They look like they  were designed by entirely different companies. The desktop app looks like a desktop app. It  kind of looks like a Windows app rather than a Mac application. The phone app looks very like  iPhone and the iPad app is just an entirely purely iPad creature. Now they make you pay  for each one of these individually and it's not that cheap. You know, the lot cost you like 35  bucks or something like that for to do app. That's that's that's a little bit of money.  But I would love to see I would I would love this new design, which I do love anyway,  but I would love it even more if they came out with an iPad app for Google Plus,  which now doesn't exist right now. You have to use the iPhone version that is a really  tablet version that's completely different from this. No corrals free flowing. I would  love to see them do that because I think this makes a certain amount of sense for,  you know, they're shooting for hundreds of millions of desktops.  But this but but a tablet version, if it was completely different from this would be fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here was one of the yeah, here was one of the complaints from a Thailand Google Plus user is  a great example, though is yes, I like the choice is and he comes obviously to look at your stuff is  Ria Pari Parit. He says the problem is here on my 1280 by 800 screen. Well said content consumes  26.9% and the rest is essentially wasted. That's a good point. That's well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're if you're if your browser is open up that far, I personally, and this is you know,  I'm not an average user in this case. I think a lot of people go full screen on this stuff. I have  two Google Plus windows open at all times. And then I have another third window for the most part.  And it actually works better for that because if you crunch down the browser window size,  it's actually crunches down into a smaller thing where the content takes up 90%.  Yeah, but you are unusual in that way.  Exactly. Yeah, exactly. But but hey, I love it. And so it's the point is that that is designed to be  right sized. So if you go all the way out, they keep adding more junk to it with the you know,  shouldn't call it junk, but like the chat list and all that stuff. And if you shrink it back down,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but they should optimize for the user for full size. And what they did was they optimized for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google for full size. Well, what they should do is they should be responsive design and use.  We know how to do this, folks. Yeah. They should use the screen, however big or small I want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  make it, they should use it appropriately. No doubt they have the numbers on you know,  what the average screen size of most users is. Well, I'm glad I'm not I guess I'm not average,  right? So you do have a lot of white space, white space there, though. Yeah, this is an 11 inch

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  screen. Tiny screen. All right, we're gonna take a break. Come back with more. I'm done bitching. I  apologize. I don't I really hate it when people when something changes, inevitably, everybody says,  horrible, horrible. I've gone through that. I mean, every time we change something on Twitter,  we get that. And so I understand. But there's something wrong with it that bugs me. And I can't  quite place it. And I'm not alone. But maybe I'm just joining the chorus of people who say  changed it. So and it's true that Facebook is hideous. I mean, there's no question about it.  And others do it worse. I just I maybe I thought I was hoping Google would do it better.  We're gonna take a break. Come back with more. Gina Trapani, Mike Elgin, Jeff Jarvis,  brought to you today by stamps.com. I'll tell you what else I hate wait in line at the post office.  But who likes that? Who likes that? Oh, maybe you like to socialize there, right? Now that they got  well, they got a new stamp coming out, right? They're closing post offices, I could tell you  those lines are going to get longer and longer. Parking is tougher and tougher. Wouldn't you like  to bring the post office to your desk, you can do everything you do at the post office right now  right here with your own computer and your own printer with stamps.com Mac or PC. You print the  postage you need always exactly the right postage. In fact, they've got and they offer for free a  USB scale that will exactly weigh your packages or your letters and give you always the right postage.  They have discounts the post office does not offer up to 21% on Express Mail up to 15% on  priority mail. Because it's a computer, it's smart. It does things like, you know, it can use your  address book from QuickBooks for filling out invoices. It can if you're if you're doing  international mail orders, it does international and will fill out the forms and everything.  And the best part is you never have to take that now to the post office. Your mail carrier who comes  every day will pick it up or you can even call and schedule a free pickup mail. The post office  loves stamps.com because it's offloading them. And that's why you should try it. I want you to go to  stamps.com when you do go to stamps.com. You're going to see initially an $80 special offer done.  Don't go for that. Click that microphone in the upper right hand corner. That's I consider that  my microphone and you'll get my offer, which is $110 bonus offer and includes $55 of free postage.

It's really great. You're going to love this. Stamps.com. Click the microphone  and then enter the offer code TWIG and you will get this $110 bonus value. Stamps.com, the offer  code is TWIG. I've been using them since the turn of the century. I want to say 2003, 2004.  And it's just great. All right. We're going to move along. There are many other things we can talk  about. The Google Plus one. You know why it hit me hard is because it's my homepage. That's how  much I love Google Plus even though they don't like me. I like them and it's my homepage. And so  it's funny when your homepage is so dramatically changed. I opened it while we were doing security  now and I literally, it's on tape. I gasped. I went, what happened? So maybe I just have to get used to it.  That's all. Instagram. We haven't talked about that since we convened last week.  Are we in a bubble? $1 billion. Jeff Jarvis, why would Facebook pay $1 billion for an iPhone app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, they've got it. They got the money. The arguments are many. The arguments are many.  They needed mobile. They needed better photo. That they needed the audience. That they were scared  of it because they see themselves, Facebook sees itself, I think perhaps too much as a photo service,  but so much of their usage is photo and Instagram is better. As someone said in one of the clips  today, $1 billion for crappy filters. I'm not an Instagram fanatic at all. I hardly use it ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I love Instagram and they used it a lot. When it first came out, I was a big early supporter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of Instagram. And that's what they purchased for $1 billion. They purchased you-  30 million me's. Yes, exactly. I just wrote a column about this, which is going to go live  any second now. There are basically three things that Facebook got out of this that they  didn't already have. Don't tell me about users because most Instagram users also use Facebook  and it's only 30, 35 million people versus 800, 900 million. They didn't buy users. They didn't  really buy technology. There's no technology in Instagram that's worth the damn-  You can steal it all.  It's pretty good design, but it's a free app with cheesy filters that's really easy to use and clean.  But people love it. They love Instagram and people don't love Facebook. People love to use  Facebook because the people that they love are on Facebook, but you'll never hear the phrase  Facebook fanboy. Nobody's a fan of Facebook. No, that's true. And big companies can't engineer  affection unless you're Apple. And so I think this is the beginning of a trend where  companies will be purchased and highly valued because they've been able to engender  super high user affinity. And that's what Instagram is. They're not only buying the love of 30, 35  million people, but they're buying the ability to be lovable. And I think a lot of the Instagram  pixie dust is going to end up in their mobile apps. And the hope is that it will make people  love Facebook more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they're buying a soul. This is from Paul's New Yorker piece. He said that basically Facebook  is buying soul, the soul of a startup, a thing that people just love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you really buy that though? Don't you kill it when you buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question, Leo. I tend to think no. I mean, I saw a lot of people write a lot of pieces  about how to export all your photos from Instagram and close your account once they heard about the  Facebook acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what, Gina? That's what got me pissed off. There's this digit snob movement that as soon  as Facebook touches it, well, I'm going to kill it. 845 million people against you. I mean, how out  of touch are you with what's going on? How uncurious are you about what the world is using?  Kill it, kill it. I don't care. But to make this announcement that I'm going to unsubscribe to you  or I'm going to kill this account or I'm going to do that, I don't care. The business is still  growing. It doesn't frankly need you. If there's too many of you, that's true.  But this idea that Facebook has cooties, I think it's kind of ridiculous. Facebook may well ruin  it. You know, everything that AOL bought, everything that Yahoo bought got ruined.  But Zuckerberg does do things differently. And he said in his message, it was very important  that he plans to keep this running independently. He still wants it to be part of an ability in the  ecosystem to send to other services. I don't think this is the creation of a unified social  network. I think it's the creation of the first social conglomerate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, note that he said that he would keep it running separately. But he didn't say that we're  not going to make Facebook more like this also. Okay. But back to back to the point, I think,  I think that you can actually purchase love like this, because the reason people  love Instagram is because of how it makes them feel. Instagram, people love their lives. They  love their cat, their friends, they see a sunset, they're inspired by it, they want to share it.  It's a human impulse to want to share the things that you're inspired by. And Instagram lets you  go snap, make it a little arty. So I feel like I'm being expressive and creative, even though I'm not.  And then click a button and everybody sees it. Yeah, Mike, that feels really good to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But okay, but I think that love is is hard to earn and easy to lose. And I don't say that because of  the cootie aspect. Oh, Facebook touched it. But look at Flickr. I think people love Flickr.  Yahoo bought it. We still use Flickr. I use Flickr a lot. But Yahoo abandoned it. So my love for Yahoo  was diminished. Not that I ever had any any any possible respect I have for Yahoo, put it that way,  was diminished by their abandonment of Flickr and delicious worse. So you can't buy it. You can at

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  most borrow it. Yeah. The other thing I think that I haven't heard very many people mention is that  one one reason to purchase Instagram is to prevent them from supporting Google Plus.  Because right now it supports everything but Google Plus, like a lot of things. So buy them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  before there's a right API. Exactly. Because you know, I mean, when you take a picture here,  we'll do this real quickly. We'll take a we'll take a picture of Gina because I don't I think  that's the best thing to take a picture of. And then I will make it arty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read somebody say that, you know, these filters make everything look like it was taken in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  70s. Right. And now I can share it. Twitter, Facebook, email, Flickr, Foursquare, Tumblr,  Postras, everything but. Where's the Google? Where's the Google? Yeah. And yet, and  a couple of things come to mind. First of all, I don't think that the that the naysayers  are really important. I mean, after all, when Android when there was an Android version of  Instagram, it was probably the same people who said, Eww, you got Android in my iPhone.  So those people are probably just, you know, they're not going to make a big difference.  But I wonder, can you inject, you know, in in some now and when they're making bio,  bio genetically enhanced products, they inject DNA. Can you inject DNA from face from Instagram  into Facebook? Or is I think Facebook's a juggernaut. I think there's only 30 people work at this or 20  people that work at this company. How is that going to change the monster that is Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, to your point, how did how did the acquisition of FriendFeed change Facebook? I mean,  does anybody remember FriendFeed? It was like the remember it was the flavor of the month and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook bought it and just kind of Brett Taylor became who came from friendly, became Facebook's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CTO. Yeah. Wasn't FriendFeed bought? I thought FriendFeed was probably was the walking dead

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  at that point. Yeah, they were bought for the people. And this is in fact, up till now,  everything Facebook's done is an aqua, aqua hire. That doesn't work in audio. It only works when  you write it. A Q H I R E, where they would get I'm thinking Sam Lesson of dropio, which was a  great product. And they killed it because all they really wanted was Sam. FriendFeed was a dying  product. But they really just wanted Paul and Mike. Obviously, they mostly wanted Brett.  But this is going to be different, I think. I think it's more like maps, isn't it? This is more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like Google buying the folks who made and making it a big part of Facebook. Because you look what  they do with Sam. So I think Sam's a good example, right? So by hiring Sam, by buying his company,  he became key to the timeline. And the best thing that can happen here is that yes,  of Instagram can exist on its own. But I think you're right, Mike. The point is that Facebook  becomes more like Instagram rather than Instagram becomes like Facebook. That's the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If those 20 people and it's really not 20. It's really probably Kevin,  Sisterman, nobody else. If he can go in, I guess Sam did, Brett did. I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sam did. They're open to that kind of culture. And they hired those other guys who were involved  in timeline. They went and hired the brightest they could. I think that's part of what Zuckerberg  tries to do. He walks them through the woods to convince them to come there because it's part of  the cult of Zuck. And I think that that means something. That's part of what they pride  themselves on Facebook is that they're not the behemoth that Google has become.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cult or not, if anybody offered me a billion dollars for anything, including my firstborn,  I think I'd really consider it anyway. Three days before this announcement,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who got a piece of that billion dollars, who doubled their money in three days.  That's what's really absurd. You're the lottery man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just kind of know where you're investing. That's all. Sisterm, the founder, got 400 million.  The investors, of course, made off like Bannetts. And in fact, they had a hundred million dollar  pool. It's divided among the remaining employees. So each of them is going to be a millionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the thing about the acquisition announcement that made me kind of crazy.  This is the thing that fascinated me or maybe galled me a little bit. It's like a 20-year-old  guy gets a one billion dollar exit. It has such a huge impact on the technology community,  the tech media, and then I think the startup community, because suddenly the whole conversation  becomes about who had the most spectacular exit. There's all this weird jealousy and there's kind  of the Facebook backlash. And then I just think you have a lot of young people who are trying to  make good products on the web, which is what we're all supposed to be trying to do, not trying to  have the most spectacular billion dollar exit possible, kind of get distracted.  It is distracting. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, I think you're way right. I think you're way right. And I think that this creates a 1%  of the technology world. Yes, it does.  Right. And that's part of the problem where we are now. And it skews the ethical view. If it skewed  banking, it's going to skew geeks too. And it's worrisome that that's where we are. Now, I don't  begrudge them getting the money they can get. God bless them. But you're right. What does it do to  the rest of the world around them? There's this very small contingent of young men, young white

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  men who have a lot of money because they won this lottery. And like you said, good for them. It  makes me sad that the conversation about web product development becomes about the exit  and not about making something really good. I think Instagram does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This has been going on since 1994 and Netscape. I mean, this is frankly always the undercurrent  in Silicon Valley is, are you going to make a big score? I like this trend because essentially,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  years ago, if you're a young entrepreneur, you wanted to go for that big payoff either by becoming  a company with a lot of revenue or by selling to a larger company. That's always been the case.  But in the past, you had to always demonstrate, well, not in the past, since the crash of 2000,  you had to demonstrate that you had a business plan. This is the revenue model. This is how we  can make money. And these guys never got around to that part of it. They just created a free app  that everybody loved. And I would love to see everybody focused on creating things that everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  loves and stop trying to figure out how we can make money. I think sustainability matters. I see  that disease in journalism and news and media where people say, I just want to do what's cool  and neat. And they don't put any thought into sustainability. And so then what happens, this  is where the true bubble comes in. Then they say, well, okay, I'll get bought. And they don't give  any thought to it, which is really just a bad way to create a feature. There's no reason.  Isn't that what it is? Yeah, it is. But here's the issue. What we should be critical of is not the  makers of, I think, Instagram, which we critical of Facebook, right? That they have a structure  that meant that rather than developing something cool and nice in house, they had to go buy for  a billion dollars. Something wrong there. The other thing is, I really want to go back to what  Gene said, because I think it's important that we have to look at the future financial structure  of our world. And I've argued, and I argued this in a post about the jobs bill, not jobs, but JOBS,  the investment, which I'll talk about in a second, that we're moving from a world of vertical  industries fully owned, where you control product creation, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution  to a world of ecosystems. And the ecosystem, as I say, that there are three layers. There's a platform  layer. There's an entrepreneurial layer now made possible by the platform layer existing. And there's  a network layer that is often necessary to get those small entrepreneurial ventures to critical  mass. Okay. What's happening in our world today is all the value is falling to the platform.  That's why Google was worth so much and Facebook and so on and Zynga. The entrepreneurial layer is  possible to do because those platforms exist, but you're small. You're never really small until maybe  you get in a network like Glam. What I like about the jobs bill, apart from taking away regulation  that we probably still do need on companies because companies and Wall Street are all screwed up,  but the idea of being able to get funding to new ventures on their own now, easier than going  through venture capital from crowdfunding, and the idea of being able to exit without having to sell  out for a billion dollars or go IPO, and you can get earlier exits and get some value out of this,  I hope drives some value back up to the entrepreneurial layer, which is the one that  Gina really loves and I love and that we want to encourage. If the only way we're encouraged that  is the absolute long shot blockbuster economy, it becomes like Hollywood. A few people will make the  movie that succeeds and the rest will starve. Okay. Instagram did it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  interrupt you, Jeff. Instagram did everything right. And it's great that they're being rewarded.  They have a very lean operation. No, I understand that. But we want the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Gina, right? You're not criticizing them. You're criticizing the structure that this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  leading to. But the billion dollar, the unusual billion dollar purchase price, the radically  unexpected is a reward for having done everything right. If this had never happened, Instagram would  have still been very, very successful. There's 10 ways they could have been very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't think that's the only gauge. You can also be Mark Cuban, who basically did nothing and  got a huge amount of money from a very stupid company that in turn then turned around what they  bought for $5 billion. And the fact that you've got a lot of money is not necessarily the reward  or quality. What Gina I think is going to, and I want to hear back from Gina, is that I think that  there's an ethic that you want to see rewarded, right, Gina? Yes. And it's got to be more than  just, oh, I made something nice. It's got to be that I can have a sustainable business out of this.  I can raise funds to do it. I can take some money off the table to buy my house. I can make  something good and be good and have a business. And we want lots of that happening rather than

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a few blockbusters. Gina, I'm sorry. Yeah. I mean, my last trip to New York, I visited a startup.  I won't say which one, but it's been in business for almost 10 years. It's profitable, doing great.  And the founder said to me, well, you know, I feel just so old and slow. Like when you look at things  like Zynga and I bet now, you know, or OMG Pop and I bet now he'd say Instagram. And it was like,  wait a second, 10 years in business, you know, with a profitable internet business, media company  and the internet, that's something to be proud of. That's something to celebrate. I only hope  that, you know, 10 years, my company will still be around and I'll still be passionate about it.  And I'll still be doing meaningful, interesting things on the web. And I will have made something  that people love. You know, I, I, listen, Instagram is an awesome app. I loved it. They made an  incredible product experience. Those guys did a great job and good for them and their billion  dollars. It just, it makes me sad that it kind of sets up this goal or this, this standard, you know,  that people are like, well, if I don't, you know, if I'm not, I don't build this blockbuster product  in, in, in two years, by the time I'm 26 and sell out for a billion dollars and I failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they should. Good. Listen to Gina, entrepreneurs, you haven't failed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, you haven't failed. You've built something good. And you know what? Most people  like 99.9% will never have a big payday. Like Kevin's sister, Matt, this is really an outlier.  That's the goal. You know, that's the problem. It can be the goal. And you know why it's good?  Because what it does is it gets everybody at pay on a page mill road to start putting money into

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lots of little startups. Okay. But that, but yeah, but that's, that's part of the issue is that they  expect that kind of their definition of failure is not the definition. They know, they know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're, it's a long shot, but it means there's more money to invest because there's more money  to be made. Most of, most entrepreneurs are like me where I'm just going to be happy if I could  survive a year or two and make a profitable business. That's the way most people think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's going to change how people feel. I'm going to go wonky for a second. I read,  I read a great book. I just blogged about called the institutional revolution. It's pretty wonky,  no Gutenberg in it, but it tries from an economics perspective to explain why there were these  ridiculous institutions in pre-modern England of the aristocracy and bought army commissions  and dueling and private roads. Right. And, and really interesting analysis said before you could  measure performance, you had to get trust in other means. You got means and things like he calls  a hostage capital. You, you sent your daughter to the court and if you screw it up, you couldn't  see her again. You, you bought a huge, you made a huge estate because you invested in that. The  point is then other means came along to measure. People could find longitude, longitude and latitude.  We had clocks that worked. We had measurements. You could measure success in new ways. And so  the institutions changed. What Gina is talking about here really, I think is that we are creating  the new institutions of society. The technology industry is creating new institutions and how they  operate and under one, under what ethics and mores and with what goals. And we have to stand  back and say, if a billion dollars becomes the goal, again, God bless Facebook and God  bless Instagram, not complaining about them. What are we building? What's the society where

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we want it? We want it to build a society where all of the above is celebrated and possible and  common. And in fact, that's exactly what we have. Lots and lots of small entrepreneurs in technology  are building companies and making going concerns of it and doing very well. And it's, it's fantastic.  The thing that excites me about these big splashy billion dollar payoffs is it's something that  inspires high school students to want to become entrepreneurs because starting a little company  and making a nice profit off in the corner, doing something is, is, is awesome. And there's something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that everybody should try to do. That's like saying, that's like saying, it doesn't matter if there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how many, how many, how many, it's the lottery people buy lottery tickets, who bought mega millions

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tickets, everybody, even the, even my smart employees, which is a terrible, terrible society.  But, but, but look, I think both entrepreneurs and investors know that this is an outlier.  It's the outlier that makes people feel good and say, gee, we could buy, you know, like win the  lottery ticket. And I don't think I don't see any real harm done here. So what's your making the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  basketball in the ghetto argument, which is that very few can make the pro teams, but if many hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to that it's good. Well, well, in fact, the reality is that a lot of young people think the only way  to make it in the world that they either have to become a superstar singer, rap, rap singer or,  or Beyonce or something like that, or they have to become a major sports person or they have to be  famous or nothing. It doesn't take no, but we're dealing with a smart class of people. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The tech community is smart. They're not stupid. They know that this is an outlier. They're not,  they understand what Gina is saying. You should build a company. You should build value. You should  do, you're giving them no credit. They're not, they're smart. They know this is, they're not going to  get a billion dollars. That might happen. It gives them a little hope, a little something to dream  about, but almost everybody who starts a company, I would guarantee you is just trying to make  something good and, and make something that lasts, make something profitable. Yes, we all think about  big exit, but that doesn't change how you do things. Does it? I mean, I think you still try to add

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  value. I hope so. I hope that young entrepreneurs are not aiming for the hockey stick big exit,  you know, crazy. I hope that people are, want to build businesses at last. I just think that stories  like this, they get the amount of hack that they do and you know, it's a billion dollars. It's a big  number. I understand. I'm not, I don't, I'm not blaming the media. I just, it seemed like a really  big distraction. I mean, at one point I had to close Twitter because I just couldn't, you know,  the joking, the snarking, the commentary, the opinions, the, you know, it sure gets a lot of  attention when that, it gets a lot of attention. By the way, if it had been 900 million, it wouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have gotten that much attention. It would not. It's one billion that makes such a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. And you know, in my fantasy and I have no idea how this actually happened, but my fantasy  is this, that Facebook went to Instagram and said, okay, we want to buy you from this much.  Instagram said no way. And they said, we want to buy you for this much. Instagram said no way. You  cannot afford us. We care about our product too much. And it got up to a billion dollars, right?  Everybody has their price and it makes me really happy that Instagram's price is a billion dollars.  That's great. That's exactly what happened. That's what happened. That makes me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they, you know, their last round, they were valued at a hundred million.  Some wild, crazy people a few months ago said 500 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's based on the last round. I think the last round was valued at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's clearly more than, than you would normally, you're not going to say I'll take a billion  dollars. You might say it in jest. And then when Mark Zuckerberg says, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who's going to go home then and say, Oh honey, I'm proud of myself. I turned down a billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dollars today. You want to the moon. That's grounds for divorce. And now I'm going to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff wired up round up here because it's with at a billion dollars, it's worth $50 million more than  the New York Times. The New York Times market cap is $950 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The 551 day old company is worth more than a hundred plus dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you're right. 30 million is more than whatever, than one or two million that read  the New York Times. I would argue. No, they have a large online audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's more than, they actually do have, they probably have about, they probably have more

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  than 30 billion. Yeah. And you know what we don't know? This could be a broadcast.com moment.  We could be watching Kevin Systrom and the Portland, you know, jumping onto the  floor at the Portland Trailblazers game, making an ass of himself, spending his money like,  like Mark Cuban in 10 years and everybody will go, remember, yeah. Remember when Facebook bought,  what was the name of his company for like all that money? Whatever happened to that?  No, I'm talking about Instagram. I'm saying 10 years from now. Oh, right. Right. Right.  Facebook bought, what was that? It was a fellow. Polarized. Polarized.  He'll be on Dancing with the Stars. I'll tell you who's really feeling bad right now.  Do you remember a company called Text America? It was a mo blogging company, had a lot of attention  about eight years ago. We were all doing it. We were all taking pictures on our cell phones  and putting it on text. It was Instagram. It just was a little too early and they couldn't make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you think Hipstamatic feels? Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Well, a lot of this is timing,  right? Timing, connections. I mean, it's talent, but then there's a lot of other factors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they tried to monetize. Right. That was their mistake. So... Oh no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Too early. Too early. Nothing wrong with monetization, but they clearly... Build

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  quality first, worry about monetization later. That's actually okay, Gina, because that fits  your model because they're not trying to say, let's make money right away. Let's build a great  product first. Let's build a great community first. Okay. As long as we can survive, let's build a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  great community. And they were frugal about it. That's the thing that's underappreciated.  For a long time, Instagram was just those two guys. Yeah. I remember we interviewed them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We interviewed Kevin and we said, where's the Android product? This was a year ago.  And he said, it's just the two of us. You know what? We don't have time. It's just two of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Jake thought that actually, among some of his friends, my son Jake, that people were upset  about the Android coming out because part of the allure of Instagram was that you had to have an  iPhone to have it. And that was part of what made it limited in special. That's why it was sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So, Patty Power, who was apparently a very well-known Irish bookie,  is taking odds on Facebook's Next acquisition. And Foursquare is leading with four to one odds.  The long odds, MySpace, YouTube is 40 to one, Friends Reunited, it's in English.  That's English. Yeah. So same thing with a couple of these.  That's the Replacebates.com. Yeah. Tumblr, 25 to one, Spotify,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  701. I think Spotify should be higher. I disagree with Evernote being on that list.  I don't think they're going to go for Evernote. No. 92 for Evernote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. Hey, Jeff, tell us the name of that book  because you just held it up. So people on video saw it, but we didn't hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. It's called The Institutional Revolution by Douglas Allen. It's pretty wonky, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And no Gutenberg. Do you know of any good Gutenberg books?  Yeah. What would be a good book about Gutenberg? The best Gutenberg, the authoritative one that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  out of print is by Albert Kapper, K-A-P-R. You tried, Mike. You tried. You did your best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's called Gutenberg the Geek and it's only 99 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  99 cents. You tried, Mike.  I walked out. But while we're at it, if you're really into Gutenberg, after having read my thing,  you want to read something really good, John Mann's Gutenberg biography is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will read that. I will read that. I love it. Facebook is never going to buy you stuff.  Now, this is why we love Jeff. Well, actually, the best Gutenberg book would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  glad you asked. All right. Busted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the only people I want on Twitter on any of our shows are people like that.  No, nothing about promotion or marketing. Yeah, we just want to inform. That's all.  We're just here. Santa Claus. Go to Gimbals.  Oh, exactly. I want to tell you about Squarespace.com,  the secret behind accessional websites. If you go to Squarespace.com, here's a perfect example.  Squarespace could make this so much harder. They could say, give me a credit card number  and in two weeks. But no, if you want to try Squarespace, all you do is go to Squarespace.com,  click a big green button that says try it free. You don't need a credit card. You need your first  name, your last name, an email address, the name of your site and your password.  For the next two weeks, you get the whole thing. Everything Squarespace does.  I'm telling you, this is great. It's hosting, of course, the best hosting out there. Really is the  best. People always ask me, what's the best hosting? But the thing is it's tied to the software.  There's an advantage to that. For instance, it's always up to date, always secure. They take care  of that for you. Fully manage your server. You don't have to worry about it. Then you create  a website on top of it using their incredible software. The templates, they've just added 13  new template redesigns, 85 new style options. They've got two brand new templates and the  templates are gorgeous. But what's great is they're just the starting point because as soon as you  pick a template, you start dragging and dropping and adding and changing fonts and, did I mention  fonts? Over 300 fonts available through the Google font library. If you are super sophisticated and  you want to do CSS, of course you can but you don't have to. But you will like the fact that  they have a built-in IDE, a CSS editor that colors the code and gives you everything you need,  including undo, redo, insert style variables. It's really sweet. They have three color themes  available for editing so you can choose the color you want. They theme their editor. How about that?  But you don't have to. I hesitate mentioning that because I don't want people to go,  I see, yes, that's what. You don't have to use that. In fact, if you look at the, if you go in the  example sites and take a look at the various sites that are built with Squarespace, 90% of these,  no customization. They're straight out of the box. But the beauty of this is they all look different.  And for e-commerce, for photographers, for portfolios, for artists, you cannot bring a  Squarespace site down. The best hosting, the best software, the best stuff free, just go to  squarespace.com, click the green button. If you decide you want to buy, let me show you this  because they've updated the pricing. It's new and I think it's very simplified, very streamlined.  There's basically two prices. $8 is the standard, $8 a month, billed annually. $16 a month for the  unlimited, billed annually. And they also have month-to-month plans if you just want to go  month-to-month. I do suggest the annual plan because I'm going to give you an offer code that  will give you 10% off. So if you get the annual plan, you will save a lot of money. Twig 4,  T-W-I-G and the number 4 gives you 10% off your first purchase on a new account. Squarespace is  fantastic. Highly recommend it. Give it a try today. We know you will like it. Mike Elgin is here of  elgin.com. That's really just a link to his Google Plus page. That's right. All Google Plus all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  time, most of the time. Mike, were you nervous when you heard there was going to be a big redesign  since you are so tied into Google Plus? Was there any little tiny bit of you that's nervous and  says, oh, I hope they don't ruin it? It's my life. I feel that there's so many sort of beta rough

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  edges in the old design that I was pretty optimistic that they would fix more than they broke.  And that's definitely the case as far as I can tell. So I was pretty excited and I was really  pleased this morning when I saw it. What's your one favorite thing from your point of view?  I just like the way the pictures look and go full bleed. And my second one favorite thing  is the performance. You click on the thing to type, you just immediately start typing and  it's everything is a little zippier and nicer. I just think it, I think the whole thing looks  better. We were talking about how we'd love to see it be different or better. If you think about  all of the all purpose social networks, I don't think there's any question that this is the best  design of any of them. It's better than Facebook, it's better than any general purpose social  network you can think of. I guess it's really hard to cram all that stuff into a single page  that's going to look good on everybody's screen. But I think this is pretty darn good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You talked me down. I feel better. I'm going to let it grow on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good job, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Thank you.  High res photos of Sergey Brin wearing the Google glasses. Not clear whether they actually do  anything. He was at a charity event, Robert Scoble got some closeups.  Of course.  Scoble said Sergey wouldn't let him use them. So it's unclear. Some in our shows say,  oh, that's just because they don't do anything. But Robert said he saw light flickering on Sergey's  eyes, light emitting from the glasses. Sergey said-  Sergey says that all they do is reboot.  It just reboots over and over again.  He continues reboots.  Awesome.  Kind of like my Windows laptop.  That's what I want. Glasses that crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder if it's going to say, aw snap when it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would that be great?  That's what happens when you get hit by the car because you're watching your glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think these glasses are ever going to be a mainstream consumer  product, by the way. I really don't see it happening.  Who's it for?  I think eventually it'll be something really cool for verticals, for people who have policemen and  people who have special purposes in professions. But for consumers, I think people think they're  going to be walking around like a cyborg, have Terminator vision and have all this data coming  down. That's going to be problematic in a number of ways. First of all-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imagine this. Just to ask, I think you're right if you believed as that video shows that it's on all  the time. Oh my God, I'm connected all the time. But what if without having to pull out your phone,  without having to go anything, you could just say, oh, where do I go? And you could turn it on,  for instance, and get some information without having to pull stuff out and turn it off.  Would that be- So it's like your phone. You take it in and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would that feel better to you? Well, first of all, it's not going to work like their video.  They were conjuring up things and it was recognizing 100% of what they said and all  that kind of stuff. And so that's not going to happen. In fact, showed an example in New  York City. Google Maps does not work in New York City, period. It will send you to downtown when  you're trying to go to uptown. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. It works for me all the time. I use it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. So- It just got to know the secrets, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the secret? I'm not telling you because you're a bunch of Californians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Let me get this clear. I believe the Bronx is up and the battery's down.  The people run around in a hole in the ground, right?  If you have an iPhone, the battery's always down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Snap.  The other thing that I don't think people realize is this is going to be an uncomfortable  experience, most likely. It's going to be kind of like 3D glasses where you can stand it for a  couple of hours and after that you're kind of like- Because it's going to be putting something  into one eye and it's just going to be- I just can't imagine that this is going to be a comfortable,  natural feeling experience. I just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's going to be that the dork factor is going to be the problem. I think it's going to be  like a segue. You know what I mean? We're all really excited about it, but now only policemen  and street tours use them. You know what I mean? I think the glasses might be kind of a similar-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, you're dying to be dorky with this, aren't you?  Oh, yeah. I'm all for a dork.  You're dying to dork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Gina should do a Google Glasses tours of Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me and Zooey Deschanel, a dorkable. I'll do it. Absolutely. But I think the dork factor is  going to come into it. I really do. Especially in the streets of New York, you're going to get  mugged if you have those things on your head. Instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about the creepy factor? People don't know if you're videotaping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey. We're safer now. That doesn't happen now. People walk around with iPhones and  we're okay. I used to say, don't take your iPhones out. Now we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not if you're in London. Your iPhone is gone if you have white headphones.  I don't know if it's stolen. You might just get beaten up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey. We've got jellyfish and other crap in that water with you. We don't have these  problems now. You know what? There's no squeegee men either anymore. It's okay now. New York is  safe. But you know what? That's the secret. We don't want all you Californians coming with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your billion dollar buyouts and all your cool stuff. We'll build our own world here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. Completely lost control of the show. Hey, did you like the Edward Mybridge Google Doodle  a couple of days ago? I can't show it because I guess it's gone, but I just loved it. It was  the horses and you click on it and it would go faster and faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't there an archive of Google Doodles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there? I just loved it. I think there is.  Maybe if I Googled that Google Doodle archive, they would have that for me. Yes, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google.com. Seek and ye shall get search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, here it is. Edward Mybridge. He's the guy who photographed the horse to prove a bet that the  horse at some point had all four whos off the ground. You know whose horse that was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whose? Stanford, the founder of Stanford University. It took place on the grounds  of Stanford University in Palo Alto. I just think that's a great doodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, if you go to twitter.com slash smart arg, it's a really neat, similar thing,  really neat use of Twitter. I don't know if you guys have seen this. It's smart arg.  It's ARG. ARG, yep. It's a pirate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ARG, me matey. Once it fully loads.  Smart Argentina? No, I've got the wrong one. Yeah, no, that's right. Now press J

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  continuously and move down the page. It's a really cool use of animation.  Oh, I see. I have to... Yeah, so press J.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something's wrong. Maybe it doesn't... I'm not on Chrome, that's why. So I have to do space.  Oh wow. Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so you can see the car kind of moving along. So what's going on for people listening?  Boy, somebody needs a life.  Yeah, seriously, each tweet is an ASCII representation of a car going down a street.  And if you J down the page really quickly, you can see the same animation as the horses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a couple. That's pretty funny. It's pretty neat. Sorry, I'm a smart arg.  You know what? It's an advertisement for, guess what? The smart car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The smart car, yeah. From Argentina.  Sorry to give them free advertising, but that's a really...  I don't mind.  ...use of Twitter and it just reminded me because of the horse animation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Has anybody else done animations with their tweets?  You know, if you follow these guys, you'd be very puzzled. What the hell is going on with my tweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seriously. Oh yeah, it's completely impractical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Maybe we found a way to monetize Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ASCII animation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ASCII animation. It's the future of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the future of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, they only have 34... No, they have a thousand followers.  They don't have a lot of followers because you really wouldn't want to follow this.  No.  No, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd set it up so your phone rings each time they post something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no, another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are a bunch of dots and lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there are some interesting uses of Twitter out there. I'm starting to see some  clever work around kind of stuff going on with Twitter. Somebody sent me a link, but I'll have  to find it. Let's see what else is big in the news. I guess we have to do some dull stuff.  Just going to do it and, you know, try to live with it. Microsoft  buying AOL's patents for $1.1 billion. Should that have been a bigger story than Instagram?  I don't know.  Sure got...  It got buried by the Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the Instagram news just killed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's 800 patents. This really, I think this is really... Is this the end of AOL  why are they selling these patents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's a great deal for AOL. I'm not so sure about Microsoft. Many of these are expiring soon.  Really?  Many of these are from the Netscape. Yeah, many of these are Netscape patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in fact, that's kind of a funny thing because they're... In the statement there's like,  and we're selling a little bit of other stuff, one of the things was Netscape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They hold onto the brand, not that it's worth anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, remember AOL bought Netscape. Now they're selling it to Microsoft, which  Netscape basically killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe 10 years from now we'll laugh about how...  Killed Netscape, I guess.  Facebook in trouble sells Instagram and what's left of its assets to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For cash injection. Yeah, to Twitter. They retained the right to use all these patents though,  forever, which was kind of a good deal for them.  There was something interesting going on here. Microsoft owns part of Facebook and so now AOL  can't sue Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that was what this was really all about. I bet you Mark Zuckerberg wrote a check for some  of this. That's what I thought.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because some of these patents were being used against Facebook in the Yahoo Facebook lawsuit.  Or it could just be a defense portfolio, right?  Right.  And since there is this nexus between Microsoft and Facebook, I think that's very interesting.  That is interesting. I hadn't thought of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus there was some talk, I think it was up there, about maps.  And that a lot of the patents are around maps and this may go after Google on maps.  So I'm not sure I agree with that. I'm not sure that's a great battleground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you always want to... there's two ways you could use patents, offensively and defensively.  Are these defensive or is Microsoft going to go on the offensive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of the institutions that we build, we deserve God, the patent institution is just...  Such a mess.  I know we say it every time we bring it up, but this is just an example of an absolute waste of capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Netscape, ICQ and MapQuest. Also CompuServe,  advertising.com. These are some pretty old ones.  75106, 3139.  What Jeff and I are saying.  Do you know what we're talking about, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your CompuServe handle.  Very good.  Okay, all right. I'm in the dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She was like four when CompuServe was sold to AOL.  There is a termination fee if it doesn't go through of $211 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the bonanza for AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're doing good.  You're doing good.  AOL is going to use some of the money to offset income taxes.  The deal expected to be completed by the end of 2012 includes the sale of an AOL unit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Netscape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's necessary for taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, got to get rid of that Netscape thing.  By the way, did you see that now the latest dump Google Maps?  Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Foursquare did it?  I think Google Maps was foolish to start charging for it.  It's de minimis revenue and it's going to affect their branding.  It's going to affect their use data.  I think that was a bad move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I don't think there's going to be a lot more of this.  I think each of the defectors has its own reason that is different from the other's reasons.  For example, an open Wiki based mapping service makes infinite sense for Wikipedia.  Google Maps probably never made sense for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I was kind of surprised.  Why did they do this before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple, who got rid of it for iOS.  What was it?  iPhoto for iOS.  That's part of the thermonuclear war.  I think Apple is going to be dropping Google products left and right  just as payback for Android indefinitely.  As soon as they can get rid of stuff, they're going to get rid of it.  I don't see any connection between the two and I don't see a lot of  a lot of others lining up to get rid of it.  I could be wrong about that.  Plus, I think that Google very well could ultimately beat them at their own game  and kind of open it up and bring a lot more contributions in.  I can see them doing that as well.  I don't think it's a crisis for Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only thing more exciting than talking about patents is talking about lawsuits.  We're going to do that too.  This is a big story and I'm sure TNT will be talking a lot about it as well as our law  show this weekend.  Twill.  Denise Howell.  Justice, that's coming Friday by the way.  What time is Twill on Friday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  11 a.m. Pacific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So tune in a couple of days and I'm sure Denise and her team of cracked lawyers will  talk about this.  It may be over by the time they start talking about it.  The Justice Department has filed suit against Apple and a number of publishers  colluding over ebook prices.  According to this story by CNET, actually Bloomberg's reporting that most of these  publishers are looking to settle today.  They're going, okay, you got us.  What do you want?  Simon and Schuster, Hachette and News Corp's Harper Collins will settle according to  Bloomberg as soon as today.  Apple and Macmillan are not engaged in settlement talks.  They're going to fight it.  They've denied wrongdoing and they're going to argue their agreement actually  to improve the competitive environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is one that's not simple.  It's complicated.  I think Timo Wiley has written good stuff about it.  The part of the argument, I believe, and I've not followed this closely enough, is  that this was an effort to actually get more money into content creators pockets and  what's so bad about that?  One wonders why Apple's on the horn here, not Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what Apple's saying.  Hey, we're just trying to compete with Amazon.  We're trying to find a competitive environment.  It's a very confusing story.  It's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is something that I wonder about because if you do what Amazon does domestically and  you do it internationally, it's called price dumping.  For example, if Samsung sells something in the United States for less than it costs  them to make it and less than they sell it in Korea, that is an international trade problem.  But if you do it domestically, it's legal.  What Amazon often does, they have a thing called the wholesale model where Amazon negotiates  a price for content from the publishers.  Then they sell it at whatever price they want, which is oftentimes, in the case of electronic  books, lower than what they paid for it.  They lose money on that ebook.  That's okay for them to do that.  Then Apple comes along and says, okay, well, we're going to let the publisher set the price.  We'll sell it at any price the publisher wants to sell it, but we get our cut.  But they can't go to Amazon and also use their model.  So you have to pick either the agency model or the wholesale model.  Take your pick.  That was Apple's collusion that the Justice Department sued them over.  That is freaking out the publishing industry because people kind of thought Apple's model,  not Apple per se, but the agency model could save publishing because it allows publishers  to set the price, allows publishers to pay editors and all that stuff.  So this should be way more controversial than it is.  I'm not saying that they should crack down on Amazon and I'm not saying that they should  or shouldn't crack down on Apple.  But Apple came up with an idea for how the publishing industry could continue to pay  editors, continue to pay writers and all that kind of stuff.  Without that model, we're looking at a future where professionals don't make any money  making books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  I'm glad you explained that.  Yes, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm glad too because my comment about the story was, I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  Whatever Mike says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What he said.  He's right.  What he said.  We're going to take a break.  We'll come back.  We've got tips, picks and more in just a bit.  Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, Mike Elgin and of course our friends at carbonite.com.  Backup done right.  If you're not backing up, you ought to be.  You know this.  I don't have to tell you this.  I might question your strategy if you're just backing up to a hard drive right next  to your computer.  That's good.  I'm not saying don't do it.  I do it.  I use Time Machine on the Mac.  It's great.  I use a sync program on Windows.  Great.  But what happens if there's a fire flood?  Somebody breaks and steals all your stuff.  You got to have disaster.  You got to have kind of a disaster mentality.  Disaster protection.  And that's where carbonite is the way to go.  Carbonite is backup done right.  Carbonite.com.  C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.  It's three things that every backup has to have.  Automatic so you don't have to remember.  Continuous so every change to every document gets backed up instantly.  And finally off-site.  It's backing up to the internet.  By the way, you control the encryption keys if you want to encrypt.  So your privacy is 100% protected.  It uses SSL.  Whenever you're online, even in an open access spot, you're safely,  conveniently, and privately syncing your data.

You get automatic continuous off-site backup for less than five bucks a month.  It's a no-brainer.  If you don't have a disaster plan, you need Carbonite.  Use the offer code TWIG.  I'll just run through a couple of other stories and see if there's anything that anybody wants  to talk about the Google Power of the Internet campaign.  I got an email.  I personally got an email from Vince Cerf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you?  Did you sign up for the...  Yeah, you must have done the petition.  We all got that interview, right?  Mika Zifri from Personal Democracy Forum was trying to ask questions about  basically lobbying Google about how they could use that email list of people who signed up  for the Sova petition to start something ongoing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those of us who signed up or signed the Sova petition got an email from the father of the  Internet, Vince Cerf, saying, hey, we beat Sova, but let's not stop now.  Let's start a conversation.  What does the Internet do for you?  Interestingly, and I like this, they're using not just Google Plus, but Facebook and Twitter for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that too.  Inclusiveness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Gina, complete this sentence.  The Internet is the power to blank.  Have you done it yet?  I wrote a book about that.  Read my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm reading the ones going by.  It's amazing.  It's pretty neat.  Dream, collaborate, and create.  This is from a church.  Engage your congregation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's okay.  Do business on the consumer's terms.  I like that.  Breathe life into a new business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, for me, it's reached the thousands of amazing Twig fans that listen to us every  week and watch live.  The show itself is such a privilege.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's huge for me.  The Internet gives me the chance to do what I love without having to be  beholden to big corporations who control media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Internet is the power to make a living from Santorini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the power to make a living from Santorini.  I haven't figured that out yet, but that's a good idea.  That's a good idea.  If I had good Skype connections in Santorini, I'd be there.  More Internet.  Anyway, look for an email from Vint Cerf.  Even if you didn't get the email from Vint Cerf, I think it was just kind of cool.  I have to say it was a little bit of a surprise when I got it.  I thought, wow, the father of the Internet writing to me.  And then I realized, oh, it's junk mail.  But it's not junk mail.  He even said my name, Leo.  Earlier this year, you did something amazing.  What a great way.  That's a good lead.  The Google bot loves you, Leo.  The Google bot loves me.  See, all is forgiven.  All is forgiven.  So google.com take action slash start dash something.  So is Google Take Action going to be there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I think this should be something bigger.  I think it's right for them to start off in the general way.  It's starting.  But Google and Facebook and Twitter should be defending the Internet.  I keep on coming back to it.  I agree.  There's all these efforts to control the Internet.  It's frightening institutions.  Institutions are being disrupted.  I can launch into that again, geeks.  And they're not defending the Net enough.  Neither are we all.  Well, this is a start.  It's a start.  And I want a lot more of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to see more.  You're right.  Okay, good.  We got some good discussion out of that.  Let me see what else I did.  I just want to make sure we don't miss anything.  Did you see that they're going to now add Windows to Chromebooks to Chrome OS?  That was very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is kind of like what's going on with Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't used Chrome OS in a while.  It's not requiring full screen anymore.  Google Chrome Beta 9 brings live tab syncing.  What?  I like that.  So if you have a bunch of...  I guess, I'm not a big tab guy.  I mean, I have a few open right now, but most geeks have hundreds of tabs.  Yes.  Yeah.  Why?  What's wrong with you people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lack of attention span for me.  Is it a form of hoarding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, well, I don't want to close this window.  I might need it someday.  Yeah, I have the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to do a thing with that page and I just haven't gotten to it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many tabs do you have open right now, Gina?  Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, enough that I'm only seeing like one letter plus the favicon.  But you know, we're doing the show.  So I basically have all the stories open that we're working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  22 for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a Chrome extension that lets me select an infinite number of links  and then click a single button to open all of them in tabs.  And I use it constantly.  So I usually have anywhere between 30 and 60 or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can see bloggers, somebody like you, because you're doing a lot of research.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When Chrome crashes and it can't restore my tabs, it's just like Zen lesson in that.  Like I own nothing.  You know, it's like it's all just gone every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And even I lose my pin tabs.  I worked hard to have my half dozen pin tabs and they're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the pin tabs too.  That's it.  It's like my house isn't set up if the pin tabs aren't there.  Chrome is a great product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  YouTube live now adds pay per view, which is very interesting.  You can now monetize your live events with advertising or paid options.  A live event can be claimed in a new video manager,  just like any video and monetized with in-stream ads or paid options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't see that working for mass things, but I can imagine it working for kind of B2B things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've been using it for UFC, which does a lot of pay per view stuff.  This is off the Google.  Somebody sent me a note saying, oh, now you can put your own ads into your YouTube live.  I don't know if that really is true or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does that work, Leo?  Is that they won't let you on YouTube live because you just read your own ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we wanted to be part of YouTube live.  I've always wanted to be because I would love another.  We have three live, four or five, actually more four or five live streaming partners,  Big Gravity, Ustream, Justin.TV.  I would like more, more ways to get us a BitTorrent live.  As soon as YouTube live came out, they put Jason Calacanis' this week on.  Cali's on, Cali Lewis.  I thought, oh, we should.  We called them.  A sales rep called us who didn't know us from Adam.  He said, well, you can't have ads.  I said, I don't understand.  Revision 3 has one ad, so maybe they've made a side deal.  Anyway, I don't think this means we can have our own ads,  so we can't be part of YouTube live, which is too bad because I really would like to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they ever give you any hassle about having ads in just recorded videos?  You mean like on YouTube?  Yeah.  That's not an issue there at all.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't bring it up.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't ask.  Yeah, don't ask.  Really?  I didn't even think of that.  Will there be a .YouTube or a .Google?  Google confirmed on Tuesday it will apply for a generic TLD.  Remember the ICANN said now if you have a hundred million dollars or whatever it is,  you can get your own trademarked TLD.  Google has applied for the use of Google's trademarked TLDs.  Those applications closed on April 12th.  Google didn't say exactly which TLDs it applied for, but you got to figure.  I don't know.  Maybe they'll be .Go.  Is there a .Go?  That'd be good.  YouTube seems long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ABC still owns that in Go.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could you just have a plus sign?  Could it be .Plus sign?  Wouldn't that be cool?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's a valid character in the top level domain, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think they added Unicode in the top level domains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You might be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's a point.  I mean, amazing.  I don't know.  Or ., I guess you could do .PLUS.  Facebook did not apply for a top level domain by the deadline.  .Zuck.  He's rich.  He could afford .Zuck and only he could have it.  That would be so cool.  Wouldn't it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Let's get our, oh, I guess I should mention this.  Hillary Clinton likes.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it true that she likes it or just Politico says?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  She met the guys.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She autographed it.  Hills.  So I didn't know this, but there's apparently a Tumblr log called text from Hillary.  I haven't read it.  Is it funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hilarious.  That picture you just had up of Hillary looking really tough.  And so people just imagine what's on the other end of that text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What could she have written?  So they put a picture.  Okay.  Sup, Adam.  Nice selfie.  Stace.  OMG busted.  Sorry Hills.  Or OFL.  Your Tumblr.  G2G scrunchie time.  TTYL.  So there's a Vice President Biden with Obama looking over his shoulder,  looking at their iPhone.  Vice President Biden says she's going to love this new Justin Bieber video.  She texts back, back to work boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's such a badass photo.  That's a great photo.  And there's so many great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huffington Post, Hillary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's Ariana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hillarypost.com.  Guess what I just bought says Mark Zuckerberg walking in front of a blue truck.  A shirt with a big boy collar?  Apparently there are quite a few pictures of Hillary texting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, is it that one?  It's the same one.  They just flip it?  That's different.  Look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are two different pictures.  She does it a lot.  By all means, move at a glacial pace.  You know that thrills me.  Daily Show This Week.  Texts John Stewart.  Already booked Colbert.  Says Hills.  This is funny.  So she likes it.  Why wouldn't she?  It's great publicity, right?  Right.  Adam Smith who created the Tumblr account with his friend Stacey Lamb, both communications  professionals from Washington DC, said after they met with the secretary of state that he was still  in shock.  He got invited to the state department.  That would scare me, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh God.  My favorite is Rachel Maddow texted her girls and she wrote back, run the world.  You got the Beyonce reference.  I mean, there's just like so much to love about that.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm still, I'm absorbing it.  It was great, he said.  She came out, she was all smiles.  She told us how much she likes the site and the people have been telling her about it.  She just thinks it's great.  And she even submitted something featuring pictures of the two men with her and herself.  That's really great.  And she autographed it.  Thanks for many lulls.  Signed Hills.  Good.  You'd like it when the secretary of state has a sense of humor.  Far less likely to go to nuclear war.  Let us get our tip, our number and our tool of the week.  And if you at any point, Mike Elgin would like to throw down with any of those three  or anything you can think of, just raise your hand and I'll call on you.  But first it's Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of Google junkies like us have more than one Google account.  And we were actually complaining about this a couple of episodes ago  that Google supports multiple sign in, but it doesn't work across all the products.  And it's kind of, it's kind of clunky.  It'll sign you out here and there.  Well, subtle, subtle change, recent change.  The Google system, Google operating system, excuse me, blog picked up  that they're making account switching a little bit easier.  Now, when you click on the little cog or I'm sorry, the profile picture  in the upper right hand corner to switch accounts,  you'll see your list of Google accounts listed there.  And you can choose one before it was, you know,  you'd have to click on another link that said sign into another account.  So they just reduced a click.  So very subtle change, a little bit easier.  The second part of this tip is, you know, we got an email from a very helpful Googler  our rant about this multi-account.  And I think Jeff and I were talking about how much of a pain it is.  And this Googler basically said, you know, multi-sign in doesn't work as well  as we would like across all of our products.  It's an internal discussion at Google all the time.  We want to implement this, you know, well and securely.  And an alternative while it's still rolling out to all our products  is to use Chrome's user profile switching.  So in Chrome, you can enable multiple user profiles  where you sign into one account in one Chrome window using one profile  and you sign into another with another.  That makes sense.  It's a little clunky, a little bit of a pain,  but that is actually a pretty cool feature of Chrome.  You also get the benefit of all your tabs and bookmarks and stuff  seeking across those accounts as well.  So multi-sign in getting a little bit easier in web pages  and a solution if it drives you crazy like it does us every once in a while.  When I whenever I check my Android app sales,  Google checkout doesn't handle it well.  You can use multi-profile support in Chrome itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good just today.  I was on Google+.  I erased my curses because I do tend to get a little a little overboard.  I know that because what happens is it falls out of sync at some point.  So I lost my Chrome, like I got my Chrome back  and then I would sign into one account and then try to go to the other one.  So no, you can't.  You're in the other account.  So I would sign into that account.  Then I would sign in at the first account and then I would go to another window  and I would do that and it would just drive me nuts.  And I literally had to do it a dozen times.  And then suddenly I got the sequence right.  It's like an old game, you know,  push the thing left first and then right raise your left foot  and then it lets you do it.  And I cannot figure out what makes it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's definitely wonky.  So I don't know, it might be worth enabling multi-user profiles  and just switch between between, you know, browser profiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then you got to switch between browser windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you don't get the benefit of tabs.  I have my pinned tabs.  I have my one Gmail account next to my other Gmail account  next to my Google+, which is associated with one of them.  Next to my documents, which is associated with the other one.  I would have made sense of this, but this is the way it developed.  Google, I had to do all these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're too far gone.  Forward your email from one email account to the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, your number of the week.  Numbers, plural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So everybody, you know, I hear all these shows, everybody, oh, Google, they're evil.  Oh, I don't want Google to have that.  Oh, nobody likes Google.  Google's going down.  Well, ABC Washington posted a poll and found that everybody loves Raymond and Google.  82% are favorable to Google, 9% unfavorable.  The rest don't know.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Apple, 74%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook, 58%.  Twitter, interestingly, 34% favorable, 36% unfavorable, 31% don't know.  But no question here, the world loves Google.  So we're going to keep calling this show this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting to me how many in the world don't love Twitter.  Isn't that amazing?  Why do people hate Twitter so much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think they don't know numbers very significant there, which may have some impact.  But yeah, just say that you don't like Twitter.  You know what?  I think it could be a couple things.  It could be one.  Number one, it could be most likely that the reputation is, oh, the breakfast service.  I heard of that.  Or number two, it could be, wasn't that where people spread bad rumors and things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or number three could be,  what a stupid thing.  I just don't like it.  I guess that's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You never know.  People are people.  I was going to do Spring Pad, but I can't remember my password.  So it's worth noting.  It's a Chrome app, but there's iOS and Android apps as well for Spring Pad.  And they've relaunched in kind of an interesting way,  but I can't show you because I'm waiting for them to send me my password.  But it's got more social in it.  It was always a Notepad app, kind of like an Evernote that I liked a lot.  I think I'd recommended it in the past.  If you haven't used Spring Pad in a while, or if you've never used it,  go to the Chrome store, install it, and take a look.  Meanwhile, I'm going to actually show you something that's, frankly,  a hell of a lot more useful than anything anybody said in this entire show.  It is the Zombie Survival Map, a map of the dead.com.  When the zombie apocalypse comes, I just created a new thing.  Thezombieapocalypse.com.  This is me in Petaluma.  You see I'm armed heavily.  And it will show me the gun store, the convenience store,  the hardware store, the liquor store, the outdoor store,  military, police, radio towers, gas stations, harbors, hospitals,  everything you need to survive the zombie apocalypse,  including the location of the nearest cemetery,  which of course is where they'll all be coming from.  It's a Google Map mashup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Map of the dead wants to track your physical location, Chrome tells me.  Hell yeah.  Deny?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll show you danger zones.  It'll show you no danger zones.  I mean, this is good.  Right now there are no zombies in the area.  So I feel much better.  I feel much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will the internet be running when the apocalypse comes?  Better memorize all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is good.  Mapofthedead.com.  We see the red zones.  That's where the zombies could be.  And look, here's a Department of Homeland Security installation  I didn't even know about, so that's good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PeopleWhoNeedLives.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, planning for the zombie apocalypse is not optional.  Mike Elgin, did you have anything you'd like to share at this juncture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just a quick thing.  People always ask me, how do I automate a bunch of stuff?  Where did I get my RSS feed for Google Plus?  How do I automate posting to Twitter, etc., etc.?  And the best resource that I'm aware of is a site called sociologyplus.com.  And this is basically an all-purpose information resource slash blog for Google Plus.  But the upper right-hand corner has a menu item called tips and resources,  under which you can find an option called guides.  And the top item there links to 11 categories of tips, guides, and resources.  This is great.  Yeah, so you see tips and resources over on the right on the top.  It's a great site just for learning about Google Plus and all the things that are possible.  But these resources, if you look under, for example, if you look at Section 8,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Extensions, tools, and apps.  And I presume they're keeping this up to date, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I believe they are.  But this is just, there are so many different resources available for browser plugins and  all kinds of services that exist that let you automate things, optimize things.  You can do things like, you know, on TV when you're on Fox News and they put the, you know,  Jeff Jarvis, busmachine.com or whatever underneath.  You can do that for Hangouts.  Oh, I was wondering.  Yeah, that's cool.  Yeah, you're on the third.  Yeah, but there's just, you can spend all your time on this site finding  ways to customize and automate Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think I appear on Fox News?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  They asked me once.  There you go.  It's called Sociology Plus.  Sociology, S-O-C-I-O-L-O-G-Y-P-L-U-S.com, the sociology of Google Plus.  That's where you'll find Mike Elgin.  If you just go to Elgin, E-L-G-A-N.com, you'll pull it pulled you right to his Google Plus account.  You should follow him there.  He also writes for Computer World and anything else you want to plug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just every Thursday morning at nine o'clock, I do a live streaming Hangout.  It's almost never about tech, but I find communities on Google Plus of  people who are doing interesting things.  For example, I did one on Lego Maniacs at Chris Perillo and other Lego Maniacs.  And we talk about their passions and how they use Google Plus to build community around  whatever it is they're doing.  Did filmmakers.  We did even skateboarders, stuff like that.  It's a lot of fun.  It lasts only half an hour and Thursday morning at 9 a.m.  I'll have to join.  Thank you.  Yeah, it's called The Flying Circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York,  the author of Public Parts, his latest book.  And of course, don't forget the Amazon single, Gutenberg the Geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You said it, I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Follow him on everywhere, Google Plus and Twitter, the hated Twitter at Jeff Jarvis.  Gina Tripani blogs at SmarterWear.org.  She's also the author of Think Up, the amazing app at ThinkUpApp.com.  And she's living long and prospering.  What is that word that you use that you and Zoe are?  Dorkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I aspire to be the dorkable Zoe Deschanel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm telling you, it's our new show on the Twitter.  Gina Tripani is a dorkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm there.  I think it's great.  In the classes.  We didn't do any Glee guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One twit length review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there a new Glee?  Was there a new Glee?  New Glee last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Best song was the last five minutes, which Eileen sent me the YouTube video last week.  Really good.  But you know what?  The Glee cast was on Inside the Actors Studio this week on Bravo.  It was also very good.  I won't bore you all, but yeah.  The whole cast, really?  Well, that would be cool.  Writing storylines, not so great.  Music's still pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the storylines just totally got down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not as crazy storyline.  And I just wanted to complete the drinking game.  You're welcome, world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're all passed out.  And thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.  TNT is coming up next.
