It's time for Twig This Week in Google, the show where we cover...  Gosh, it's so hard to say just really anything we feel like it mostly having to do with the internet and computers and technology.  Jeff Jarvis is here. He's the professor of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, he's almost blue now from trying to trying to do.  I'm trying to do.  This is working better for a while.  Doesn't matter.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fine.  Jeff is for some reason always confused cameras.  I think he's like a vampire.  He doesn't really exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am. I am.  I also can't do those sinks that require you to turn on.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  He is our esteemed colleague and expert in many things.  Author of what I'm actually dead.  And he is he died in 1987 right after his appearance with on that show.  What was that show?  Moonlighting.  And no, he's always welcome to have him.  And I'm thrilled to be back from France to say hello to Jeff and to also the wonderful Stacy Higginbotham of IOT.  Stacy on IOT.  That's her newsletter and of her IOT podcast.  Hello, Stacy.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is a really big day.  We had a massive, very important announcement, a huge announcement from Sonos.  Oh, boy.  You're going to start with that.  Actually, it's interesting because Sonos had to really think about this because both Apple and it turns out Google are coming straight at them along with Amazon.  Sonos has promised for a year that they would put Alexa into a speaker.  They did.  They finally did.  It's the Echo powered Sonos one, which has a lot of interesting features.  It knows where it is.  It will.  It's a smart speaker.  And they announced, which I'm very relieved to hear, that every Sonos speaker will now be Amazon enabled because if you can connect a dot to the speaker, you'll be able to do things like play, you know, Yanni in the bedroom and things like that.  So this is a they announced this a year ago, but they finally delivered and we're happy.  Right, Stace?  I'm super happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you forgot like a huge deal.  The biggest deal is the new Sonos one that will come out later this year is going to have both Amazon Echo and Google Assistant on it.  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They really highlighted the Echo.  Oh, so it's going to have Assistant two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  So there's a couple things.  One, the first thing that we care about is if you have an existing Sonos, you will get Madam A on it today.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So today or whenever you get an update, you'll get an update soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  Where's my update?  And then two, you'll get Apple Airplay 2, Apple 2 Airplay, Apple 2, whatever the order of operations there is.  That'll come in 2018.  And then the next big thing is they launched a speaker for $199 that's going to give you, hey Google and Madam A.  Sorry, I just set off people's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it though that I can connect my dot.  I have a few dots lying around as you know.  I can connect my dot to any of my Sonos in my house.  I have even more Sonos and that will echo enable all my Sonos.  To add next year, it'll add Google Assistant to do that.  I presume I'll have to add one of these Google devices to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you'll have to add a new Sonos.  That's what they're saying.  You'll have to get the new Sonos one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your old stuff supports Madam A and Apple Airplay 2.  That's why I was confused.  Your new one will get those two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got it.  All right.  That's good news.  The new Sonos one comes out October 24th.  It's only $200.  It's kind of like the Play One speaker.  It's the simplest of their speakers.  And really, clearly, its main purpose is to integrate into a larger Sonos system.  So that is very good news.  And they were smart to announce it early this morning because at 9 a.m. Pacific,  Google just dumped a ton of new products on the world.  And wow.  I said at the time as we were covering the event, Florence Ion and I were here in studio  covering the event at the San Francisco Jazz Center,  this is the largest product announcement I've seen from any company ever,  certainly from Google.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight new products.  And arguably, the new phone was not even the biggest of these products.  But let's start.  Let's do it in.  We'll walk through these in order.  They started with the Google Home and the new Google Home Mini,  which looks curiously like a donut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it weighs less than a chipmunk.  Sorry.  How do you know that it weighs less than a chipmunk?  That was the ad they did.  Really?  It's smaller than a donut or it's about the size of a donut and it weighs less than a chipmunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially the coral one.  At some point, guaranteed somebody's going to pick up the coral one and say,  where?  Mmm, donut.  But this is kind of like Amazon's Dot,  except that Google's decided to put an actual speaker in it.  So the Dot has a tinny little speaker, the Amazon product,  but this will have supposedly a better speaker.  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you lose in the Dot versus the regular Home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it really comes, oh, with this instead of the bigger one?  I mean, this, whatever, Mini.  The Mini, the Home Mini versus the Home.  I don't think anything except the size of the speaker.  The speaker in the regular Home is pretty good.  I can't imagine in something the size of a donut and the weight of a hamster  that it will sound as good as the larger Home, but...  Squirrel. No, no, chipmunk. Chipmunk.  Not hamster.  There's a big difference.  This will connect via Bluetooth, they said, to other speakers, though.  So you could have it power a bigger stereo or a bigger Bluetooth speaker if you wanted more.  And, and I know, Stacey, this was of interest to you,  it will work not only with the newly elaborated Nest line,  Nest announced a whole bunch of products last week,  but will also work with Wemo, with Samsung SmartThings,  with Hue, TP-Link's Home.  You liked that new TP-Link Home, I think, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have the cool, what are those called, outlets that are rectangular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like those.  It will work with August door locks.  That's my thing.  You like the Augusts.  So you will be able to say, hey, gee lady, ask August if my door is locked.  I don't know if you'll be able to unlock the door.  That'd be kind of cool if you'd say, hey, let somebody in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple, or Apple, August lets you do it on Amazon Echo if you enter a passcode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's smart, because otherwise a burglar might shout through the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can see.  Siri, unlock, oh wait, Siri, talk to me.  Siri, unlock back door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's usually what I get with Siri.  Here's what I found on the web for unlock back door.  I hate her.  The Nest thermostats will work, but I presume it will.  Nest now has what, a lot of security stuff in Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just announced, last week they announced their security stuff.  They also put Google Assistant on their indoor fancy cam.  They call it the Nest Aware cam or Nest IQ cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have one over my shoulder here, because Lisa wouldn't let it be inside.  Lisa's a smart lady.  She said no cameras inside, which is ironic because last week Amazon announced an alarm clock from my bedside table that unaccountably has a camera in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that thing is weird.  I put it on my desk.  I ordered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a home show on my desk from Google, I mean Amazon.  That's in my kitchen.  That little, what do they call it, the dot, spot?  Spot.  Spot really begs to be put on your bedside table, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's what they wanted us to do, but who's going to stick a camera on their bedside table?  That seems dangerous.  I mean it's weird to me that I have a speaker, or a microphone, sorry, a microphone on my bedside table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a dot on my bedside table because it's hooked up to speakers and it's really nice to ask for music.  I love that.  I think that's a great use.  So that's the new Google Home Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of the best looking of the bunch, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's very attractive.  Again, even Google recognizes it looks a lot like a donut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you order the colors or are those colors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's gray, chalk, and coral.  And you can also, there are new bases.  You see here's a nice copper base for the Google Home.  Yeah, so they have a whole bunch of new bases for the Google Home.  Google, well done Google, by the way.  They were able to get this up and running on their store right away.  Yeah.  Many of these things can be.  And I was able to order something.  Yeah, I ordered a bunch of stuff with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember the old days where we kept on hitting?  Yeah.  And then we were out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things that really became clear to me during this event is that we are now,  all three of the big players are doing ecosystem plays, Amazon, Apple, and Google.  Yeah, really good point.  Be in our ecosystem and everything will work well, but no promises otherwise.  Google seems to be pretty open in terms of the home automation stuff.  But even then, it'll probably all work better with Nest, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't have to.  So it's unclear if Google Home and all will have, will have weave,  which is the device communications and discovery protocol that Google and Nest are both now doing.  So if they have that, then things should work better.  But I don't know if they're going to have that yet.  Yeah.  Or I don't know how well that's or how that's going to work.  Guys, guys.  Uh oh.  It is very important.  What's that?  Google is doing pop up stores with donuts.  I love donuts.  Who is making these donuts?  That's actually, I have a very specific donut.  Like, love.  Are you a voodoo donut person?  No, because I cannot eat a five pound pastry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm willing to try.  Google's New York City pop up shop is now open at 96 Spring Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Austin's is going to be the 21st of October on rainy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Run down there right now, Jeff Jarvis.  Oh, sorry.  Do the show from there.  You can get to SoHo.  How long it take you to get down there?  About two and a half hours.  This is the verge.  I'm looking to see the donuts.  The Made My Google pop up shop, Monday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're doing not only Manhattan, but also Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's a very large place.  Seems that Francisco October 4th.  Are they really crispy cream donuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Crispy cream donuts.  Hot damn, I'm going.  You had me at Krispy Kreme.  Is that your brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is one of my brands.  Yes.  That's what I'm looking for.  A sugary, light, fluffy donut that I can eat half a dozen of.  Shipley's is my brand.  Don't you feel terrible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Austin and voodoo donuts.  It's different every city.  Food.  Oh, dang it.  I love October 21st and 22nd.  It's San Francisco and Johnny's donuts.  To me, this is all academic.  I haven't had donut in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should have done howdy donuts for Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All that diet you've been doing, Leo, it'll just go away.  You have one donut.  They call them sinkers for a reason.  I got the schedule on the rundown.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks, Jeff.  And I presume that you can go in there and you could.  This is actually a good idea.  You could try this stuff.  Because there are lots of questions.  For instance, Karsten Bondi, our producer, is wondering if those new Google headphones will do the translation thing,  which is the coolest thing.  We'll talk about that in a minute.  With the old pixel or if you have to have a new pixel for all the benefits of the Google earbuds.  That's a lot of processing power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, that's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't want to get ahead of ourselves.  Here, by the way, are the bases I mentioned.  If you have a Google Home, as we all do, you can get coral.  How much do they cost for those?  Around 20 bucks and black.  It's not worth it.  Yeah, you just pop it in there and it will complement your home decor if you happen to be coral, brown or black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think people are more attached to these things than they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google really was big on fabric.  In fact, they even brought out their industrial designer to go on and on about the fabric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am actually I hate the fabric.  I really do.  I do not like it.  I do not like it.  Sam, I am.  It gets gritty when I am.  No, I just I don't like the look.  I want that copper base, but I don't really want to spend more money on a device that I'm like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this is Google saying, look, this isn't Skynet.  This isn't a scary robot.  This is a friendly little donut sized, durable weight, fabric covered, covered listening device in your house.  So why would you ever be afraid of that?  Come on.  It is.  Unassuming, unassuming, perfect word.  That's the that's the semiotics I was looking for.  He is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My goodness.  I should have taken my adderall or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Never mind that.  So moving right along after they announced that they talked about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the Google Home Max premium audio to its assistant speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also fabric covered.  Hard to tell from this image how big it is.  It's not as big, not as monolithic as it looks.  It's actually if you look at the screen, you can see the size of the screen.  It's not as big, not as monolithic as it looks.  It's actually if I had to look really hard, it has four speakers, two tweeters.  They call them subwoofers midrange really.  And I look hard.  That isn't that big.  It's a little.  What does the size of a loaf of bread?  I would say it's the size of a loaf of bread.  Three ninety nine.  That's expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is insanity.  But you know what it is?  OK.  The fact that the coolest thing that it does is Google calls it neural beam  forming, which is a fancy way of saying, hey, it knows where it is in the room  and it adapts its sound.  Smart.  But smart sound.  This.  This struck what struck me about this announcement was what the heck has Sony  and JBL and all these other companies been doing for the last decade as like  machine learning has become much more accessible to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, even so, those came this close to losing everything they that without  their announcement to this morning, even they would be out and they're much more  intelligent, much more than they're connected than JBL or anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did their tuning.  So remember probably three years ago, that was like Odyssey or the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stereo tuning systems where you put out a microphone and it does all these sounds  and then it tunes it up.  The Apple HomePod and this new Google Max do it without doing it.  I think we you know, they're not out to the end of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what the HomePod does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't know it to the end of the year.  But my sense is they just automatically kind of listen and sense it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, this thing is big is 13.2 inches by seven point four inches by six point  oh inches.  Eleven point seven pounds.  It's heavy, which it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speakers are usually heavy because of transformers, the big magnets in the speaker.  It's a loaf of bread, maybe a little bit bigger, but it's roughly a loaf of bread.  When you say big in speakers, that's what we call a small bookshelf speaker.  How big is a Sonos?  This is this rough.  It's bigger than that.  The Play 5 is a little taller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Play 5 is actually wider too.  And wider.  The Play 5 is I think like 16 maybe.  I'm just looking at a Play 5 right now and I'm like, it's wider.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's wider than 13 inches.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you could get it smaller with big sound, that would be better.  So we'll just have to wait and hear what they sound like.  They look fine.  They look good.  The good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's amazing on the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing that I'm really happy about, they support not just YouTube music.  Interestingly, they didn't mention YouTube music.  They didn't mention Google Play, but it does support that.  And Pandora and Spotify.  And so that is all very good news.  Google is not saying it's just us.  Also iHeartRadio and TuneIn so you can listen to us.  TuneIn is what allows Amazon Echo users to listen to all of our stuff.  You just ask for whatever you want on TuneIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  iHeartRadio is a radio show.  So it lists Netflix.  How is it Netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because you can say Play.  Notice Stranger Things had a big role at this event for some reason.  You could say Play Stranger Things on my living room TV.  That will require Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So didn't Chromecast just add functionality?  Didn't they just add you can do new things with Chromecast?  Like assistants?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it doesn't have a microphone.  So you need some other words.  They've always talked about this at Google I.O.  They talk about this at Google I.O.  Now what they did show, hold on, they did show something cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that was today.  They showed, show my front door from like my Nest Cam.  And that would pop up on your Chromecast or pop up on your TV from your Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they promised that again in June at the Google I.O.  They promised that.  They did.  But they now, I guess they will do that.  This is, you know, as this forms, as long as they do everything they promise,  which isn't a guarantee, this is a nice ecosystem.  If you're all in on Google and you get Nest and you get assistants everywhere,  you have a Pixel phone, you have a Chromecast enabled, everything,  your house will be pretty responsive to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Nest has doorbell, indoor camera, outdoor, or I mean outdoor camera, indoor camera, yes.  And a security system, which they announced last week.  Security system and thermostat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the smoke detectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, smoke detectors too, right.  Don't forget the smoke detectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the video doorbell.  They're competing with Ring.  They have something called the Nest Hello video doorbell.  That's coming out next year.  That's coming out next year.  Yeah.  But this is really, this is to get you into that whole, this is, this, we're going to try to,  they offered us Rick Osterloh, who's head of hardware at Google and took the stage this morning.  They, Google sent me an email saying we'd like to get Rick, Rich Rick on one of your shows.  So we'll, I mentioned this show.  I mentioned the three different venues.  He wanted to be on Twitter on the Sunday show.  I said, wait, on the Sunday show?  I said, that's actually not a good place for him because we won't have a chance to really talk to him.  So I mentioned Twig, all about Android, our new Tech News Weekly, which is a newsmaker interview show,  and the new screensavers.  And I'm just going to let Rick decide what he wants to do.  But we will get him on.  No, you should tell him to come on this one.  It should be on this one because of you, Stacey.  Yes.  Because of the Internet of, no, because of the Internet of Things thing.  But boy, this is Rick because he's-  It is her middle name after all.  The Internet of Things Higginbotham.  That's actually how I mentioned her.  This is an ecosystem and he's in charge of all hardware now, right?  He's not just Nest.  I mean, he is in includes Nest, right?  It's not just-  Yes.  He came-  It's all this stuff today.  He was at Motorola when Google acquired Motorola.  He ushered the Moto X and that's where I first met him.  Nice guy, smart guy.  And I think this is what he's been charged with.  Make this all work across the ecosystem.  I like it.  Do you think, Stacey, I should just throw everything out, all the smart things, all the Amazons, all the Sonos's, and just line the home with Google?  I mean, if you want to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, follow me to the line.  You see the advantage though because there'll be one assistant.  It is fine here.  I'll learn the syntax of that assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything will work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I would say you should probably go all in on Google Home's Google Assistant.  So the Google Home devices as opposed to the Echo.  Because it's confusing.  Because their home ecosystem-  It is confusing and their home ecosystem is much better.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but they don't have anything like the Echo Show.  I can't-  They don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, my TV can-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried it yesterday.  I have an Nvidia Shield, which they just updated to version six.  Oh, yeah.  It has assistant.  So I pressed my shield remote and I said, what's the weather going to be like this weekend?  It turned on my stereo receiver, my AV receiver.  It turned on the shield, turned on my stereo receiver, turned on my TV, and displayed the weather.  And said, it's going to be 78 degrees and sunny.  How long did that take?  Or you could have opened the damn window.  It took a long damn time.  But if your TV were already on, if you were-  I mean, yes, because it had to do a lot of-  But it did it.  But it did it.  That's what's interesting, using CEC and all that.  No, that is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I probably wouldn't go all in on the smart home devices with Nest, to be honest.  I find them very expensive for what they are.  I like my Ring stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, this is the problem.  I've invested a lot in Ring.  I've invested a lot in Echo.  Well, so Ring is going to come to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ring and Google, they already did announce will work.  So, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then, you know-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am not ever putting an automatic lock on my door.  That seems like a recipe for disaster.  Okay.  Do you use August locks on your front door?  My front doors are weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're multi-point locks.  So I have an August lock on my back door.  And I have a-  Don't you worry that somebody could hack your back door?  You know, beforehand, if you wanted to kick my door in at the back door-  That's a good point.  Locks are just a suggestion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're just an indicator that please don't come in here.  Because really-  And I had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A couple years ago, when I had those hacker people come to my house and hack my house  after I gave them my Wi-Fi password, they had locked and unlocked my back door.  And I was kind of like, not so freaky.  I don't know.  Because, you know, you make an excellent point.  You break the window and open it or you kick the door in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Locks have never really been fully secure unless you have a metal door.  I mean, you'd have to really do a lot of structural stuff to keep it completely secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you see my dog?  Look at her.  She's-  I guess you can't see her.  She's all on her back.  She's by the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no.  The left again.  There's our sweetie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is she alive?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what she does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She just does that.  Is she hoping you'll go over and scratch her?  No, she doesn't.  She gets it.  That's just how she likes to lay.  Is she more comfortable that way?  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello, sweetie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that comfy, Sophie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you sure she's not mad?  She doesn't even react.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, you sure she's not mad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm positive she's not mad.  She blinked.  She's catatonic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  What's her name?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's dogatonic.  Sophie on her back.  That's the name of the show.  All right.  So the Max, the Mini, the Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now we get to the-  Sophie on her back.  Sophie on her back.  Sophie on her back.  Sophie on her back.  Sophie on her back.  Sophie on her back.  Sophie on her back.  Sophie on her back.  Sophie on her back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we get to something-  It's not even new with the Home.  Just the color of things?  There's nothing new.  Yeah, there's nothing new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Mini is the Mini Home and the Max is the Maximum Home.  Good.  But they're all home devices, which is interesting.  That is now a product line.  That's a good way to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a little surprised they didn't include the Nest stuff here on the Google Store page.  Just go ahead and integrate it.  Also, it was in charge.  The fact that they keep Nest separate is kind of silly to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, can't you go to Home?  Let me see if I go to Home and Entertainment.  Can't you get Nest?  Yeah, you can get Nest stuff.  Yeah, you can get Nest stuff here.  You do?  Okay.  Oh, I see.  It's in the Home and Entertainment.  In fact, on that page, this is the lineup.  Google Mini, Google Home, Google Max, Google Wi-Fi, Chromecast Ultra, Chromecast, Chromecast  Audio, Nest Thermostat, Nest Protect, Nest Cam IQ, Nest Cam Indoor, Nest Cam Outdoor.  So, it really is the full range.  Does having Google Wi-Fi in any way help?  I don't think so.  In fact, I do not particularly like Google Wi-Fi.  I think there are other better mesh systems.  We use Plume and Iroh.  I think the Orbeez are better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was surprised that Google said it was the number one selling mesh Wi-Fi system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was too, and I didn't really dig deeply into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin and I were IAMing back and forth, and I was like, really?  He's like, it's available at retail stores, and it has the Google brand name.  He has one, and he likes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or he has a couple.  It's adequate.  There's nothing wrong with it.  I like it.  You use it?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to buy five of them and compare them.  Yeah, that's what I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, because you're weird.  I feel like I don't think there's any reason that you need it.  They didn't make any case for that.  It's just another one product.  But if there is, I'd love to hear about it.  We'll ask Rick that.  That's one of the things we can ask Rick.  So now, we get to the thing that...  Well, let's take a break, and then when we do, we're going to get to the thing that Jeff is most interested in.  Yes.  Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, you're a good color now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, hey.  I did some more adjustments to the weight balance.  You got some color in your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got a quick tan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm the president.  Oh, a little spray orange?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, a little spray.  That does this amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, you're warm, and I'm cool.  So it balances out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's true, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You wouldn't think going to France, you'd get a tan, but I think I did actually get a little color.  Yeah, you did.  Well, I was in Provence.  It's sunny down there.  We experienced the Mistral, the famous wind that drove Van Gogh crazy.  Oh, no.  I understand why.  It went for three days.  It's just constant, strong wind.  It's extremely annoying.  But then it stopped one day, and everything was...the skies were blue and clear, and it was beautiful the rest of the time.  And so it was kind of...I was actually really glad.  We walked in Vincent's footsteps, went to his where his little yellow house was.  We had a drink in the night cafe that he painted with the awkward pool table and stuff.  We had a cup of coffee there.  Our guide said, it's fine to have a drink there.  Don't eat there.  It's still there.  It's painted yellow still.  We went to the asylum where he ended his days.  And everywhere in Arles and Avignon that they do that, they have his paintings positioned on a...  outside where they were painted.  So you could say, oh, yeah, there's the mountain.  Oh, yeah.  It's really...I was actually kind of moved.  It was really beautiful.  Really was glad to be able to do that, actually.  How do I get on that?  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  That was a digression which went...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was my fault.  It was something about you going in France and the color of your skin.  Yeah, it was my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I brought it up.  We're doing an ad.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I brought it up.  My friends, our show today is brought to you quite literally by Sonic.  We actually have the best internet connection in the world here.  Well, at least I feel pretty good about it.  10 gigabit symmetric internet fiber from Sonic, the best internet provider in the country.  I hate doing these ads because most of you can't get Sonic.

And thank you for gigabit.  10 gigabit.  By the way, nothing in this building can use 10 gigabits.  The best we can do is a gigabit.  But I love it.  I mean, all my devices are gigabit.  And we use it's not just me.  We have all the everybody's uploading and editors are working and no slowdowns at all.  It's just marvelous.  I just 40 bucks.  How do they do that?  I interviewed Dane Jasper, the founder and CEO.  He's actually an old friend.  I've known him for years.  He has his license plate says Linux.  I love that.  And he said, no, we make money if we get one in five in the neighborhood, one in five of  the people live in the neighborhood to subscribe.  We make money.  I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to come to New Jersey.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I do think that Dane's ambition is to slowly roll it out across the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He really has wanted that's that's been his ambition for like seven years, though.  It's hard to do.  I'm still waiting.  I mean, it's tough.  So in addition to the capital costs, like a lot of Dane has similar capital costs.  But he doesn't have unionized workers.  And if you look at the infrastructure behind Comcast or Verizon, his company is much smaller  from that perspective.  And then a lack of union workers helps and pensioned workers.  So less so Comcast.  But the older telcos got they they just still.  They still have people on pensions.  Really?  My father in law is on a AT&T pension.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, actually, that's that's the blight of a lot of old companies, including all our  car companies.  Right.  Well, I mean, that huge number of people who are pensioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But anyway, it's a promise they made.  They got to do it.  And you see some of those companies not.  And I think that's really criminal.  In fact, a lot of public public groups, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they don't have the funds.  They can't.  I mean, firefighters, police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can't.  And and then they stop.  And I think it's that's a that's a breach of promise.  It's sad.  Anyway, we're not going to solve pension problems today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is true.  Well, I remember when when my friend Drew Curtis was running for governor of Kentucky,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the guy from FARC, he said, This is the crisis that is unacknowledged that Kentucky is going  to face.  They they have pension obligations.  They cannot meet this year without going bankrupt.  And this is the this is the problem.  And none of the other candidates would even mention it.  Your family's home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might be or Sophie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, she's barking at the door.  Sophie said, Yep.  See, I hear Andrew.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  My family is home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Family's home.  Good.  I was saved from the boredom of being with mom.  I was I was catatonic, dogatonic on the floor.  I can't wait to your home.  Oh, thank goodness.  Let me out of here.  Why did they trap me in here?  So cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because Jeff Jarvis made it.  Jeff is Jeff is me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell me again what breed she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's a much she's a much.  She's really sweet.  We rescued her.  She's exactly the size Lisa wants.  Lisa wants to get another dog and she's this exact.  Would she like mine?  Yeah, we'll take Sophie.  She's sweet.  You love Sophie.  Don't say that.  Don't say that.  She's also a beautiful color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's yes, she's nice.  She's stubborn and she's loud like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, hey, I told her we can get a dog if it's 10 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want an older dog.  Get the pet insurance system.  So Jeff was waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff loves his waiting his Chromebook.  I do indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm on my hands on my pixel.  I have two.  I have three pixels.  It's superannuated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's another great word.  It's you are just doctorable tabular today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to need a glossary for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Superannuated is a fancy way of saying old, but it's a nice.  I like the word superannuated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yours is you.  You like me.  You have no.  You have the first generation.  No, that's Jason.  I have first and second.  I have two seconds in the first.  OK, so one of the reasons we all bought Chromebook pixels is  because it had I five Intel processors.  It had lots of RAM, but they weren't cheap and they're not  cheap this time.  This is the new Chrome pixel book from Google.  And I think Google might have overpriced this once again.  Nine ninety nine for the base unit.  It is a convertible.  That means you can use it as a laptop.  You can fold over the screen and use it as a tablet.  You can tent it.  They do now offer a pen and we'll talk about that.  That's a separate hundred dollar add on.  It is a twelve point three inch screen and it's the first laptop  with Google Assistant built in, even that it's to the point that  it has a Google Assistant button, although when it's folded over,  it will listen for the OK, you know who.  So you can.  So if you don't want to talk to it, you can press the button  and type to it.  I like seeing this because it feels like Google Assistant is now  the future voice for Google, right?  They're just going to kind of make this be everywhere.  Does support Android and they mentioned I was glad to see that  Adobe who was it?  No, Snapchat was going to make a special Adobe keep saying Adobe  Android Play Store version of Snapchat for the pixel that would  use the full screen.  Ten point three millimeter thick, very, very thin.  All aluminum unibody, two point four pounds.  Yep.  Just a kilogram.  So this is this is pretty sweet until you get to the price.  Nine ninety nine gets you a I five with eight gigs of RAM and a  one hundred twenty eight gig hard drive.  Two hundred dollars more.  You get double the size of the hard drive.  That's all.  I'm kind of regretting paying that now because who needs a big  hard drive in a Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're going to use it to I know same here.  If you're going to use it to that, I I use Google Play to watch all  my shows.  So you download them and I use Netflix and I use Amazon.  And so I download a lot onto my Pixel C.  But even then, one hundred twenty eight gigs, one hundred twenty

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  eight gigs would probably be enough, I would guess.  That's a that's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you'd have to be kind of diligent about clicking things  off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then if you really think, oh, you know, a thousand bucks isn't  enough, I want to spend seventeen hundred dollars.  You could put an I seven in here.  Sixteen gigs of RAM.  I wish the middle one had 16 gigs of RAM.  Same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the one thing that was to me.  That pisses me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want 16 gigs and five to 12 gigabyte.  But you can't get that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember the old days when you could actually just add memory on  that nice.  Yeah, I do.  But I'm old enough to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But those were not those were not 10 millimeter thick machines.  No, they were not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just looking at the pictures, type C connectors, as before on  the left and the right, that's handy because it could charge it  on either side.  It has a stay on that picture for a second on off button here.  Look, what is this button?  A volume maybe.  Well, it's kind of a headphone jack.  I don't know.  This is a longer button here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So on that picture, Leo, yeah, that's what four hundred and  that's what fooled the.  What is this thing?  Rumors.  That's just a shadow.  I know.  Maybe not.  Was that the keyboard was going to slide underneath.  Pixel.  I don't like about this is in tablet mode.  I know I'm going to knock keys off.  I did that originally with one of the another machine I had and the  flip around 180.  I don't like much.  I have a Lenovo convertible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is this this this technology, despite what Google calls it,  they call it a foreign one isn't called foreign one in general.  It's called convertible.  And I have a convertible Lenovo X1 yoga and it retracts the keys as  you flip it over.  So that's what I want.  But the negative on that is it means that the hinge is a little creaky  because you have to do more with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's physically retracting or the Microsoft model or I mean, there's  lots of different models, but my least favorite is that I don't know  if I'll use it in Best Buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think somebody goes into Best Buy.  They look at this.  They go, that's really nice.  How much?  Nine ninety nine.  Well, wait a minute.  That ASUS is four ninety nine.  It's the same, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.  Same thing with the chrome.  The chrome.  They sold the pixel in Best Buy for a month and obviously, they had staff  there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only people are going to buy this is you and me.  I already did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty much.  Now I'm getting buyer's remorse that I should have gotten the 128.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Me too.  You know, if only they'd put 16.  That would make it so much more.  That would be the right then that would be the sweet spot.  Yep.  The pen is not unlike the Samsung Chromebook Plus or Pro where the pen is  thinner and smaller and embedded, you know, has a little slot.  The pen is just a standalone pen.  It is even loosable.  It isn't even like the Microsoft pen, which has a magnet.  I don't think has a magnet on the side so you don't lose it.  It's just a it's like you're going to put it in your pocket pen.  But the good news about the pen is it is a Wacom style.  It is from Wacom.  The screen in the pen.  Wacom or Wacom?  I've never known.  They said Wacom.  I think it's Wacom.  But they said Wacom.  What Stacey?  Stacey Yawning?  No, no, no.  She.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My Sonos is updating.  Oh, oh.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Bethany Sonos.  You too.  I'm so jealous.  So jealous.  I'm going to go home.  I want to go home right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been checking throughout the show.  I'm like, come on.  I go home right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't have Sonos?  I'm surprised, Jeff.  I thought you would.  All the smart kids do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it was so when it came out, it was so damn expensive.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  It's ridiculous.  And then one way that's why I'm thrilled that Sonos finally just did something right  because it was starting to look like I was going to have to sell my Sonos stuff and buy  all Apple HomePods or now that they Home Max from Google, maybe all of those.  Solid state NVMe drive means a very fast drive.  Having a seventh generation Intel processor, even to the i5 is plenty.  That's really fast.  Lots of RAM.  OK.  That's good.  This will be the best Chromebook, but you will pay the premium price for this thing.  The pen has 2000 levels of pressure.  It's very it's just what you want, frankly.  And they say 10 hours of battery use.  The Pixel had excellent battery life.  Yeah.  So I'm going to count on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still as well.  I don't know what's going to happen.  So I just need to have the best Chromebook because that's what I live on.  Right.  What I don't know is whether I'm going to travel with it.  Number one, because I still like I like my yes, I don't know, but it's bigger.  I like my Pixel.  But, you know, if I'm on the subway and I want to turn over and watch something that  versus the Pixel C, I think the Pixel C is better or playing even.  I don't want to ruin the keys.  So I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'll be whining about this for a few weeks after we hear the pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the only pen that works with the Google Assistant.  They demoed that.  I thought that was cool.  You circle a word, it'll give you the definition.  The assistant goes, oh, you want to know what that is?  It'll give you the definition.  You circle a face.  It will look that person up with Google Image Search, which is very cool.  Pressure sensitive tilt support.  They say virtually no lag.  That's always an issue with artists.  Both Apple, Apple, especially on the iPad Pro and with their pencil and  Microsoft with its Surface Pencil.  They've done a very good job of making it almost very close to really drawing.  And that's really what artists want.  When you draw, it feels like that's ink coming out of the pen.  We'll see if Google can do that.  That's one of the reasons, though, that you want to put a fast processor and  lots of RAM in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says edge to edge trackpad.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They say they're doing a better trackpad.  We'll see.  I don't know.  This trackpad is not traditionally very good on Chromebooks.  By the way, the pen uses a replaceable quadruple A battery.  It's not rechargeable.  Just a quadruple A battery.  Yeah, they have they were like triple A's only smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, oh, OK. Yeah, that means it's a common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. How do you say it?  Four A's, AA battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never. I've never encountered common, but it's a very widely available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it common for a laptop to have a gyroscope and a magnetometer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not to my knowledge.  Why would they have that?  Because of Android apps.  The Android apps expect the features of an Android phone.  Yes.  And one of them, of course, gyroscope is so you know the position of it.  The magnetometer.  Well, that's a compass, right?  Yes.  So it would be for Nav, I guess.  It doesn't have a GPS, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also doesn't have LTE, which disappoints me.  Well, it does have automatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did the right thing.  If you have, but you have to have a pixel.  If you are using a pixel, it senses it, it knows it, it will automatically turn,  put the pixel in hotspot mode and connect through the pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you have to have a pixel that's not on an AT&T grandfathered account that won't let you tether.  I said whining. I'm whining.  Yeah, you should be on Google Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, all Windows Ultrabooks have gyros for rotation.  That's where you have the gyroscope.  Oh, right. OK, right.  Thank you.  Yeah. So when you when you that makes sense.  So when you rotate it, it knows which way is up.  That makes sense.  I don't know what the magnetometer is for.  I would guess it's a compass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, here. Oh, don't don't guess.  We'll Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why guess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't guess.  It's a big word, Leo.  You should just know it.  Well, I know what it is.  Magnetometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instrument that measures magnetism.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a compass.  What does it do?  No, that's the question is what more does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would you have that?  They're used in the military to detect submarines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you can detect submarines with your Chromebook Pixel or your Pixelbook Chrome.  It uses. OK, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It create a miniature Hall effect sensor that detects the Earth's magnetic field along three perpendicular axes and it produces.  Aka a compass.  Right. I know.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, a compass only needs one axis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's crucial for detecting the orientation of your device relative to the Earth's magnetic north.  So the gyro and the magnetic work together.  It's about orientation somehow.  Yeah.  Device Procipit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this will be a beautiful.  This is why Google does the pixel in general.  The Pixelbook is to show what can be done with Chrome.  Well, they finally have that mid range machine that we want to show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They finally have that mid range machine that we wanted in the five hundred dollar Samsung convertible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the Samsung.  I bought a couple of those.  So we want to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you talk about how I feel it is misleading of Google to keep.  They called it a laptop so many times during this thing and it is not a laptop.  It is a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it is not accidental to call the laptop.  They're really trying to emphasize that a Chromebook is a laptop.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't.  No, but it's not.  I can't do things like run my audacity program.  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey, you can do 99 percent of what you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I spend like 10 hours a week on that.  Audacity programming?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Try Ophonic.  So try the Android app Ophonic and see.  I mean, there are Android and Chrome extensions that will allow you to do some of the things.  I agree with you.  I mean, the main reason I still use an all purpose laptop is because I want to do photos, right?  Photo editing.  Yeah.  And there's polar and there's stuff, but it's not quite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's priced like a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not quite like a laptop.  I agree with that.  But that's my big point.  That's exactly my point.  You go in the store and you're going to see even Windows laptops are 500 bucks.  You're going to see all these things in the five to eight hundred dollar range.  And then 999 and all this is Chrome OS.  I think it's going to confuse people.  But if you are all in, if you get Chromebooks, you'll love it.  But the real market for Chromebooks is schools and businesses that don't want to spend a lot of money.  They want something simple to manage.  They don't want any viruses.  That isn't somebody's going to spend a thousand bucks or more on a laptop or a Chromebook.  I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I'm so with you.  I look at this thing and I'm like, some people might even buy it and be pissed when they figure out the limitations.  That's the only risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think Google cares if they sell a lot.  They know they're not going to sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also know people who just say, thank goodness, all the hassle is gone.  Yeah.  New OS is installing crap.  All this stuff depends on how you're using a machine.  Right.  Most people are doing podcasts and editing audio.  Most people are doing Microsoft Office stuff.  Right. So this is this is the equivalent of.  I'll give you an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I get up and I have breakfast and there's I open up a laptop.  But all I ever really do is I do my newsbeat checks.  I surf all the news sites, answer email, you know, see what's been going on.  Maybe maybe look at a YouTube video.  That is all possible on a Chromebook.  Chromebook is my breakfast laptop.  It is not my work laptop where I have to get something done.  It's not my photo editing laptop.  But it's but for most people, if they're not doing podcasts or editing photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would they spend that kind of money?  You could buy an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I see I this the speed matters,  especially before there was a five hundred dollar Chromebook.  If you had a two hundred three hundred dollar Chromebook,  it was not capable of having tons of tabs open.  It wouldn't work well.  And but this machine works incredibly well.  This is I've been on a pixels since they started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So two and a half years, three years I had with Sundar Pichai when the first CR  forty eight black Chromebook came out.  I said, Sundar, I don't understand why anybody buy this when you could get a  computer, a full computer for the same price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Snubs. This is also a Stacey.  I argue this for people who for the post computer world where all you have is a  phone. This makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, the post computer world better not rely solely on me looking at my phone.  The post computer world we're finally getting to and it's going to be things  like my computers.  You see, actually, Google did such a great job showing this off.  It's things like show me this and it pops up on a screen that's useful or  circle something with my pen on my exorbitantly expensive not laptop and tell  me the information I need.  So I see what you're saying.  I feel like the marketing around it is not good.  The marketing calling it a laptop when it's not a laptop and then pricing a  Chromebook so high just feels snob and a lot of it's a laptop.  Not a snob.  I just have programs I need to run, man.  And I think about like my daughter who does video editing for fun and giggles  because she's a tween girl and she's going to have Snapchat on her new

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chromebook.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Lord, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, you get snaps once you get Android, you get Photoshop.  I mean Lightroom mobile, you get Snapseed, you get plenty of great tools  in Android.  And if companies like Adobe and Snap decide, you know, see that this is a  form factor that we're going to want to support, they'll make their software  automatically fill the screen.  They'll use it.  And that's exactly what Google said on the stage.  Snap is going to make Snapchat for the Pixelbook.  That's what's going to cause me.  Are we worried about fragmentation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this is inherently part of fragmentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With Android?  No, there's no fragmentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you talking?  I'm like, my God, now you're going to have to have two different apps.  One for the phone form factor, one for the...  They already have two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yes, that is an issue, Stacey.  And where it's most awkward now is when I'm, let's say I'm on the Washington  Post and I want to tweet an article there and I hit the Twitter, it opens up  and I want it to just go to the web Twitter situation.  It opens up the Android, it opens up the Android Twitter app and it doesn't  work well.  So I have to close that.  And I still can't find where I take off those defaults of going to the Android  app instead of to the web, which is what I want.  I live in fear of clicking always and never being able to go back on things  that I care about.  I live in fear of clicking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my web story right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm with you though.  I agree.  I hate how it defaults to why aren't you using the app?  I'm like, shut up.  If I wanted to use the app.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  And it pushes that too much.  So that's still very awkward.  That's not great.  And so it's not ready for saying, oh, but all the Android's on there.  It doesn't work perfectly yet.  And I don't know that it ever will.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at Google highlights for apps on their page.  This is on the store page.  They show all the Android apps in productivity.  For creativity, AutoCAD, Infinite Painter, Jamboard, Lightroom, Sketchbook.  It's interesting they don't mention Snapseed.  For entertainment, Google Play Music, Instagram, Netflix, YouTube.  It's no accident they made a big deal about Netflix because that brings movies  to your Chromebook and works with Pixelbook, Pen.  Only two programs so far, Sketchbook and Squid.  But the two is enough.  I mean, it's, you know, be nice to have more.  Certainly the iPad has many.  I want some note taking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those aren't note taking ones.  I want Pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They talked about that as a use case.  So I imagine there will be.  I would.  I am.  You know what?  Both Jeff and I will be using these, Stacey, and we'll get back to you.  I agree.  I think the price is on the biggest negative.  The price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's the same.  It was exactly the same for the last Chromebook.  It's no different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, they didn't.  And I don't think they care about that.  But the people who have them love them and are devoted to them.  Stacey's absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Best Buy, this ain't going to sell at all.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Let's take a break.  Come back.  We'll talk about the phones.  And kind of a surprise.  So the first of this, the rumor mill was very right on about, but they missed two,  not sort of missed.  They mentioned that they thought there would be some earbuds, but they missed some of the  critical features on the new earbuds.  And they did completely miss the camera.  Because why would Google make a standalone camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a reason for that.  So you're going to love it.  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stay tuned.  Stay tuned.  Because that's coming up on This Week in Google with Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey and I.  I.  T. dot com.  Jeff Jarvis from Buzz Machine dot com.  Our show today brought to you by 23 and Me.  Love these guys.  I did 23 and Me way back when when they first started.  Started by Susan, not Susan Wojcicki, Esther Wojcicki.  One of the Wojcicki's.  No, by Anne Wojcicki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Esther's the mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  And her relationship with Google was she rented a garage to Sergei and Larry in the early  days of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anne Wojcicki was married to Larry Page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Anne fell in love with Larry.  They got married.  The other daughter, Susan, runs YouTube.  So this is all in the family.  But Anne started this 23 and Me and I love it.  My whole family is doing it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brilliant family.  It's spread.  I couldn't get it when it first came out and I got it.  They said that was a little nutty.  Now they are fascinated with the data.  Well, that's what's cool about it.  And everybody's spent into a tube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once you do it.  So that's important to mention.  Some people might say, well, I don't know, what do I have to do?  Go to a lab?  Do I have to give blood?  No.  It couldn't be easier.  They do this all from your saliva.  You spit.  The only hard thing is you have to get enough spit.  It's a lot of spit.  It's not that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My father did it and he didn't do enough spit the first time.  So they sent him a free kit to do the spit again.  That's cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You really have to kind of work up the saliva because that's what there's the I guess your  DNA is in there, right?  So once you do this in a couple of weeks, they'll say, okay, your stuff is up.  And what I love about this, I did this years ago, but I have all of the benefits because  as they've learned more over time, they add more and more to my reports.  So I now have a hundred plus archived reports.  I have wellness reports, traits, ancestry, DNA relatives.  That's really fun.  That is a really fun one.  They found a second cousin on my grandma's side that I never knew about.  I just love this.  You could find out, you know, here's some of my relatives, right?  And it's based on that.  Now they're doing it and you're doing it.  You have to give permission.  Okay.  So don't worry about somebody finding you that you don't want to find you.  But if everybody gives permission, then you can see it'll pin you down.  It'll pinpoint some relatives, which is really key.  Also, if your relatives or family does it like Jeff's, you can compare yourself to those people.  Maybe you'll find out that your mom isn't your mom.  Who knows?  So they did.  Actually, I shouldn't use that as an example, but you know what I'm saying here.  You can find out stuff.  I love the ancestry reports.  I am 4% Neanderthal.  That's a good example of something that they didn't know about until recently, about five years ago.  They, for the first time ever, were able to analyze Neanderthal DNA.  They found some old bones.  And for a long time, there was a debate among scientists whether we are intermingled with Neanderthals  or whether Homo sapiens could not interbreed and just killed them off.  We now know, thanks to those bones a few years ago, that they did intermingle.  And we knew what the traits are.  And so this was a report that when I first did 23andMe, they couldn't have given me.  But they did now.  I am in seventh place out of my family and friends.  A lot of my family and friends have more Neanderthal than I do.  But I have 4%, a little less than 4%, of my genetic material comes from Neanderthals.  Isn't that fascinating?  You can find out what part of the country your people came from, part of the world your people came from,  and when.  You can follow your maternal or paternal haplogroup as they migrate.  So 180,000 years ago, my maternal haplogroup, L, was down here in kind of central eastern Africa.  Migrated north, across into the Middle East, and from there into Europe.  Isn't that cool?  I mean, this is just amazing.  This is the kind of stuff.  Now, you do this with your family and your kids.  Think about what they're going to learn.  I'm related to the cheddar man.  They're going to learn about, first of all, everybody's fascinated by stuff, right?  They're all by themselves, right?  So they're going to get naturally engaged in this, but they're going to learn so much about genetics and DNA,  the thing that's going to really change our world.  You can even get access to the raw data.  So this is, I can actually search for specific markers and chromosomes.  23andMe.  This is very reasonable considering what you get.  Go to 23andMe.com slash twit right now.  And can I suggest this as a gift for family members?  This would be...  It really works.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My daughter was so delighted that she's only 49.9% me, which is a majority of her mother's DNA.  It's made her very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the kind of thing that's really cool, isn't it?  My kids always are asking, how much of me is you and how much of me is mom?  And you can now...  Well, let's find out.  23andMe.com slash twit.  Discover where you come from, who your people are.  So much fun.  Really love doing this.  All right.  Let's get to the phones.  Unfortunately...  Are you going to take calls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  Let's go to the phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Joe in New Jersey.  You're on.  It's fun.  I do that on the radio show.  I love taking calls.  I know you do.  I wish we could take calls.  When we first started with some of these shows, we tried different platforms like Talk Shoe.  Oh, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin built one for us on the IoT podcast and he posted a how-to on the website.  Do you take live calls during the show?  No.  What we do is you send it to us, we record it and then...  You do the Twilio thing.  You do the Twilio thing.  Yeah, it's a Twilio with a raspberry pie.  But it's awesome.  With a double twist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's fun.  But what we used to do is actually take live calls.  That's an interesting...  Someday I might...  It would be fun.  It would be fun trying it.  You know what?  Maybe we should...  We could make once a quarter or once a month do a live call-in.  I think that would be fun.  I know you guys would love it.  Our audience would love it.  So, Pixel 2.  Everything we thought was going to happen did.  No headphone jack.  Sigh.  No wireless charging.  Sigh.  Sigh.  Somewhat waterproof.  It's IP67.  That's really water resistant.  Sigh.  However, the things that people really love Pixel phones for are here.  For instance, it's the most secure Android phone because Google keeps it up to date.  That's great.  It's really got great integrated support for Google Assistant.  It's a simple, clean design.  I'm really glad the XL, the large version, is almost bezel-less but not fully.  And the reason it's not fully is they have front-facing speakers, top and bottom stereo speakers.  Thank you.  Really like that.  One lens.  Go ahead.  Yes, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was going to say, somebody I just talked to doesn't use a Sonos or anything.  They use their smartphone speaker.  I realized it was Matt Cutts from last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you have to have a good smartphone speaker.  This is the way to do it.  This is the phone for Matt.  This is the HTC DNA.  This is the BoomSound DNA.  HTC started this with the M1 and that really sounded great.  I really like the front-facing speakers.  Nobody else does this.  Apple has one cheesy speaker.  Samsung has one cheesy speaker off the side.  And it's really nice to have front-facing stereo speakers, especially if you ever watch video, which I don't.  But it sounds better.  We'll see if it sounds as good as a regular speaker.  It probably doesn't.  All the flagship phones these days have dual lenses.  Apple started it with, actually I think LG started it, but Apple was the first really well-known flagship to have a wide and a telephoto.  And they can do a lot of things, portrait mode and so forth.  But Google was at great pains to say, we don't need two lenses.  We need one lens and lots of computational power.  And they can do portrait mode.  They don't need both lenses.  What they do with this camera is they take a lot of images and they change, I guess, the focal length and the lighting.  And then they optimize by mixing images.  And that makes sense.  You're doing this so fast.  Why do you have to have two lenses?  You could do it all with one lens.  One lens optically image stabilized, F1.8, so it's fairly fast.  Not the fastest out there, but fairly fast.  And DXO Mark, Google was very happy to say, gave it a 98, the highest score they've ever given.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take that Apple fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny because yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't the Apple get like a 95?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yesterday, the iPhone 8 and the Note 8 both were touting that they got 94.  They tied.  And I feel like this was a setup because the next day Google says, oh, yeah, well, we got a 98.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's, you know.  Is there a 101 or is it a top of 100?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it must go past 100.  I mean, we're so close to 100.  I don't know.  Does that mean it's perfect?  No, there must be a way to go.  What is the scale?  We don't know.  No, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not what is the scale.  Just what is it?  What is this measuring?  It's DXO Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  DXO Mark.  They are an independent third party.  They've done this for years.  They make software.  So they have a business selling software.  But they've been for a long time reviewing not just camera phones, but all sensors and all cameras.  The Pixel is the highest mobile, but it's got a score as high as the Sony A7R II, which is, you know, easily one of the best DSLRs out there.  It's not an SLR.  It's a mirrorless.  So I don't know if those are comparable.  I don't know what the scale is.  They do lens ratings as well on a different scale.  And I would say they're reliable.  They're trustworthy.  But I wouldn't say it's that meaningful.  I mean, look at the Google Pixel.  Last year's Pixel was 90.  The iPhone 7 Plus was 88.  The iPhone 8 Plus is 94.  And now the Google Pixel 2 is 98.  How much better is that?  Maybe a little bit.  Scooch better?  Scooch better?  I don't know.  I think the smidge.  The truth is, if you're getting a flagship phone these days, even like an LG V30, you're getting a really excellent camera.  And some do, like they say, the Note 8 is the best smartphone if you want to zoom.  It's funny because the iPhone 8 Plus, when it was reviewed, said the best smartphone camera we've ever tested.  But that was all the way back in September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you think?  So I have my Pixel XL.  Love my Pixel XL.  Oh, you should definitely upgrade.  Okay, so tell me why.  You always cost me money, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the biggest thing is that when the Pixel came out, it was a rush job.  Everybody agreed that Google had to kind of make some compromises to get it out the door.  This is my Pixel XL.  And I love this, right?  It's a great phone.  But look at the size of the screen relative to the size of the...there's big bumps at the top and the bottom.  Those will disappear on the XL, too.  This glass window is now smaller, the fingerprint reader is below the glass window.  And this is a soft touch.  I think you'll like it better than the metal finish.  Usually you're going to put a case on it.  Right.  Snapdragon 835 processor.  That is a better processor than that.  I think you have an 820.  We have an 821 in our Pixel XL.  Camera, I think, is going to be the biggest difference.  I think there is going to be a noticeable difference in the camera.  Boy, I'm glad I didn't buy last year's smartphones.  Well, truthfully, the tough one is buying one every year.  If it's a two-year difference, yeah, it's like a no-brainer.  But here's the...this actually helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can trade in my Pixel XL and get $410.  That's a great deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do that.  That means that this is now a $450 phone.  That makes it a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fantastic.  If you look at the trade-in stuff...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should have been able to get $115 for my Nexus 5XP or 5X, except it broke because it was part of that whole flawed LG thing.  Grr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a 6P 128 gets you $165.  That's so great.  No, that's to the two-year-old.  A Pixel 128 gets you $360.  Oh, it's an estimated...  Oh, they ask you, does it turn on?  Yes.  Does it have any cracks?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mine's perfect shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next, can I reset it?  Estimated value, $230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For the small Pixel, but for the XL...  Anyway, if you can get the trade-in, I think that means a big difference.  Better graphics processing.  Yeah, it does.  And I really think the camera is going to be noticeably better.  What else is different?  Oh, you can squeeze it.  Oh, you can squeeze it.  Come on.  That's big.  I'm very skeptical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happens with the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the case, if you buy the case from Google, they've designed it to accommodate the squeeze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they say they could distinguish an accidental squeeze from an intentional squeeze.  And the squeeze launches Google Assistant.  So I kind of think that's a smart way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it could do other things, too.  I thought you could...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the demo she gave was she squeezed it and then says, take a selfie.  And it immediately goes to the camera and literally two seconds later goes three, two, and takes a selfie.  That's a good application.  That's not bad, yeah.  Or what's the weather going to be?  Or what time is it?  Or set an appointment for tomorrow at 430 to get a haircut.  That will be fairly useful, I think.  I'm skeptical again because that seems like a weird gesture.  We've talked about this on and on.  If it's an intuitive, simple gesture that kind of comes naturally, that could be a big breakthrough.  We need a good way to launch an assistant that doesn't involve turning on the phone or saying things or whatever.  I think the squeeze has the potential being very good.  I'm excited. I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talk to me at the end of October.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the old assistant, I just tried to do it with my old assistant and the existing phone won't do it.  Take a selfie?  Oh, I thought it did.  Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not doing it for me.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why is mine red?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And meanwhile my Google Home is saying, I can't do that yet.  Stacy, what?  I love it when Stacy gets excited.  This is like the old brrrrbrrbrr breaking news.  Stacey has the noise.  Stacy gasped.  We must hear that now in the cause of the gasp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Play Taylor Swift on Rover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you talking to your dot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it's not playing it on the right speaker.  It is!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is big.  I can't wait to go home and do that.  That's nice.  That's really great.  I'm very excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, you guys.  It's it's I've been waiting for like eight, nine a year even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google is once again giving you free unlimited original quality storage for your photos and even 4K videos.  That's nice.  They are.  They show some pretty impressive image stabilization.  They have OIS and what they call EIS.  The EIS is camera stabilization, video stabilization, software technology.  So on the left, the shaky cam is without OIS and EIS on the right.  That's only on this phone, not on the old.  This is on the Pixel 2.  Yeah, it requires hardware with OIS.  Right.  I think that they I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we can we talk about what Google didn't talk about briefly?  Because this is part of that.  All this camera stuff.  Clearly, Google has done something on the chip side related to AI and processing that is as good as if not better than what the A12 or sorry, A11 Bionics chip that Apple has done.  Why do you say that?  Because the type of stuff that they're doing and the processing they're doing on the phone is phenomenal.  And we're talking both the image recognition, the amount of computational power it takes to stitch together images like that, the image stabilization.  And when you look at what they talk, they hinted at it briefly with the clip.  And we'll talk about that in a second.  But I don't know why they didn't dig into this, because I am insanely curious about what they've done on the silicon side.  So that sorry, I just I'm like, why don't they just use stock Snapdragon chips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they doing custom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are. So they are using Snapdragon.  But I think there's definitely some sort of either co-process not a co-processor would be its own thing else going on.  Yes, I think there's got to be something else going on.  So this is my this is my bet.  I look at all of this like that image stabilization and I'm like, Qualcomm has some lovely image stabilization for drones.  So I know they've got it.  But this when you take it to the when you take it to the clip form factor, but this is where Google's going to win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If unless some of these other companies really get it together, they have more data than anybody else.  They are all in on artificial intelligence and machine learning in the face of people saying, oh, gosh, you know, this is Skynet or we don't want Google to know all this stuff.  They're they're not slowing down.  They're saying, no, this is our special sauce.  Apple's saying, no, your privacy is more important.  We're going to do everything on the phone we can.  We don't. So Siri is never going to compete.  Amazon has a lot of data, not in the ad business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. That's why Amazon has a lot of data there in the retail business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But their data doesn't really, I think, become as useful as Google's data.  They don't read your email, for instance.  Facebook knows a lot about your connections, but doesn't read your email, doesn't know a lot about what you're doing in other respects.  Google stopped reading your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they stopped reading it for the purposes of advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. OK, so here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't remember that.  Google reads your freaking email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. If anything that has anti-spam filtering is reading your email, the question is.  Well, they're looking for keywords.  The question is what they do with what they see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Google keeps reading your emails.  Just not for ads.  Variety did a lovely story.  But what I was going to say is Google has shifted.  Like I've and these are not people talking to me on the record,  but I've run into several Google product managers at various events and their focus is on using your data to give you better products.  Yes, they will sell ads against it, but it's a much more subtle and probably a smarter strategy.  So look at their AI for the sound and their speakers.  Look at Google photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that doesn't make them any advertising money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, look at Google Translate.  In fact, let's look at it right now.  These are this is the earbuds that come with this.  This this is actually really interesting.  So Apple's AirPods are arguably a big part of the iPhone because there's no headphone jack.  You can tap them to use Siri.  But this is Google's version of this Bluetooth earbuds or Bluetooth earbuds that have a string.  That's just you know, I think actually is smart because the AirPods are a little easy to use.  You can also loop them over your ear.  It looks like which means it keeps them in your ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't. That's the no.  You put them in there.  Well, that's even better.  They'll never stay in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they loop inside your ear is good because that means no, that's no, I like that.  That actually because it goes against that ridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're very strange ears.  Well, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It won't work with anything.  I immediately ordered them because the thing that most excites me is the demonstration they did of translation real time.  Oh, my gosh. Can we show that to people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because that was that was like magic.  It was so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, Carson.  OK, maybe we can't.  No, I'm a Google.  Let me just do the Google keynote and watch the Google to event in 19 minutes.  I bet you somewhere this is the verge is cut down of it.  I bet you somewhere in the 19 minutes we're going to find this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's that lovely lady on stage, the Swedish.  The Swedish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She brings her Swedish friend.  Here we go.  Here we go.  So you have my audio.  All right.  But I got to turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an incredible application of Google Translate powered by machine learning.  That's like having a personal translator by your side.  Isabel is going to speak Swedish into her pixel buds and I'll hear the English translation out of Pixel 2's front speakers.  And then I'll respond in English and she'll hear the Swedish translation in her pixel buds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's let me make this clear what's going to go on because it isn't immediately obvious the way it sounds on the recording.  But she's got earbuds, so she's going to hear what he's saying in Swedish.  We won't hear that part.  And then when she speaks in Swedish, the phone will hear it and translate it into English, which he will hear.  But it doesn't.  It's not clear to hear the sound.  So she's holding a Pixel 2 and she's got the pixel earbuds in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've done this with the phone itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you pass it back and forth kind of.  But this is much more natural.  And look how fast it is.  Hey, Isabel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How are you?  I'm fine.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now it's hard to tell because they're played back through the PA speakers.  They screwed this demo up a little bit.  They should have played it back for us to hear it.  But it's coming through her Pixel phone when it comes out in English.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And note that she has to press the button on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which makes sense because it says, listen now, I'm going to speak.  I want you to translate this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't think it's listening to you all the time and all that.  Let's watch it a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think of these cool new headphones?  What do you think of these cool new headphones?  My team designed them, so I think they're pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My team designed them, so I think they're pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that is as close as you can get to UN style.  Babelfish.  It's the Babelfish.  It's the UN style simultaneous translation.  It's not quite simultaneous, but it's very, very quick.  Enough so that you could have a conversation.  Faster in fact than the phone translator, I think, by a little bit even.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  So I cannot wait to try this out with my daughter who speaks Spanish.  And I don't.  Because I'm very curious.  I don't speak Swedish.  I have no idea the quality of the translation.  Because sometimes Google Translate gets exciting for people.  But I'm still like, I'm so excited about this.  This is almost magic.  It could be magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember way back when, pardon me for this Davos, when Eric Schmidt demonstrated  and Marissa and what's his name?  We used to be in charge of Android demonstrated this the first time.  And Schmidt said, this will bring world peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  If only.  That sounds like overstatement and I don't think it's going to happen.  But it's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It will translate Donald Trump to Kim Jong-un.  Then OK.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe if it could intercede a little bit.  No, you fools.  Don't do this.  Please don't do that.  Google's Pixel Buds are much like the Apple AirPods in that they have a separate case,  cloth covered though to distinguish it from Apple, and the case has its own battery.  So the Pixel Buds, just like the AirPods, have five hours of listening time and the  case has another few charges in it.  So they say 24 hours when you include the case.  I think that's very good.  It is a full Google Assistant.  That sounds like a really nice marriage.  And since you don't, in fact, have a headphone jack, you kind of need wireless headphones.  It will work with other Bluetooth headphones, but that special translation stuff and all  that stuff requires a Pixel 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the is the cord?  Does it carry charge between the two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it looks like it's just a physical cord to hold them together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have two Bluetooth connections at once?  Does each ear have a Bluetooth connection to the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I. Oh, that's an interesting question.  That is an interesting question.  On other ones, and I can't remember how Apple does it.  One it does and then it sends and then it talks to the other one through your head.  Well, we'll see.  But maybe it does use that cord.  It's not clear.  It's not clear.  You do have to, the touch piece is only on the right ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is that all it does is touch or are there multiple commands or?  Yeah, there's multiple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's multiple sweep forward or backward for volume control touch to activate the assistant.  I think those are the two they demonstrated.  There may be more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My problem with that always is because they fall out of my damned ears.  I put I want to push it in and of course I activate.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Assistant on the Google Pixel Buds is only available on Android and requires an  assistant enabled Android device and data connection.  So I take it back.  It does not require a Pixel.  But it does require a phone that does Google Assistant.  So that may be a more limited subset.  I'm not sure.  That was, I thought, really an exciting part of all this.  I think the the pencil circling things and getting assistant to respond on the Pixelbook and then  this these buds doing the simultaneous translation were two of the highlights as far as I was  concerned.  Then they announced something that was a little weird.  But Stacey's going to explain this all to us.  They call it the Google Clips.  And this one people weren't didn't know what it was.  They saw the word Google Clips in the in the something.  I can't remember firmware or whatever.  But nobody really knew what it was.  It's a standalone wide angle camera with 16 gigs of storage.  You don't wear it.  You put it somewhere and it decides what to capture.  And it gets smarter over time.  They say their motion stills.  So they get seconds of motion on in front and after there is no audio.  And it does not upload it to the cloud until you tell it to for privacy reasons.  You see in this picture the two girls are playing.  They're doing Lego and on the pillow is the camera sitting on the pillow.  Spying on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do something cute girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how it knows where to take pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is really so this is cool slash creepy slash.  It would be awesome if you think about it getting embedded into the devices like the Nest cams.  So what it's looking for it talked about looking for people you care about.  Right. So it's recognizing that's.  But it also recognizes like when people stand still it recognizes smiles.  So there's a lot happening here that is actually really hard to do.  I mean computer vision and image recognition like this is not insignificant.  Even if it's only a few models that it's running like recognizing faces each face is a model and then recognizing like when people smile in a dog or cat.  So it's kind of creepy.  But it's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you just put this like if I put this here during the show and then what happens is you take your phone and you pair it you say OK let me see what you got.  And you can swipe through it and say save that one save that one.  So it's not saving everything to the cloud unless you say so.  But imagine if it got 10 really interesting shots.  That's I think that could be really interesting really cool.  But but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you got to remember to put it somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes. But imagine that on drones.  So think about something like that on drones. Yeah.  Or just around the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like what you said if it's on the Nest cams.  It just says you had an interesting day.  Let me show you some of the things you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think two things going on with this which is admittedly kind of a strange device which may become awesome all on its own.  I don't know.  But I think there is whatever A.I. hardware stuff is happening under the hood that Google's not talking to us about.  I think that's part of this design.  And they did talk about like how to do it in such a small form factor.  I think they're spreading that out across as many of devices as possible so it can they can understand how it works.  Tune the algorithms better and get the cost down on something like this.  So this is kind of a research.  This is a yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two hundred fifty bucks. Yeah.  Can't buy it today but you can get on the waitlist.  But it's more a research project than anything else.  They're going to learn from doing this.  Two fifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then then it could be somewhere else.  That's that's my quote unquote conspiracy theory around clip or the clip or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if they were good I mean we there's a lot of unknown.  But no I think that's exact.  I think you nailed it Stacey.  That's of course that's what they're doing.  That's what they always do. Nailed it.  Nailed it.  But I think even two fifty isn't that much.  If you think about what you might get out of this especially if you're a family and you don't you know the worst.  My kids always hated me because I was always taking pictures and they would always go no I don't take pictures.  Stop it.  So I didn't get a lot of good pictures.  But if you just put this thing on obtrusively and let's let it sit there and at the end of the evening you looked at what you got you might get some.  It depends.  It depends on what you get what the quality is what the images look like.  But if it works as promised I can see that I can see that's worth 250.  Or you get 60 seconds of the burglar coming in your house.  But see asking me if I'm going to buy one isn't isn't demonstrative of anything because I have to buy it.  Well no I'm going to buy all of this because I have to talk about it in review and if this thing is terrible I want to get it so I can tell people no no no really this doesn't do what anything it's promised.  Or on the other hand if it does I might be able to say hey this is believe it or not this is something you really want to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you know what would be interesting.  So think about like I'm just thinking about my daughter and how she uses technology and how she communicates with her friends via silly kind of fun things.  And I wonder if I'm a teenage girl or a kid how this fits in kind of with the Snapchat generation right.  And that actually might be kind of fun.  I mean I don't.  That is very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe it's like those when I was growing up I had my first camera was like this little pink click that took the crappiest pictures ever.  But I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a here's a happy Google family using their Google clip it says be in the moment.  That's the point right.  With the people matter most instead of dad annoying everybody by taking pictures and really not being a part of it.  You just put that on the flower bag.  You leave it there.  And then you just do what you do.  And then at the end of it you see what you get.  And if you get you don't have to get a lot if you've got a few good images that are keepers that's all you need.  Right.  It doesn't have a button and you could force it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you know that you that you're not cutting off your kid's head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well supposedly it's very wide angle and that's why it's very wide angle.  That's going to be one of the negatives is it's all the pictures are going to be very wide angle pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But judging by these shots I think actually no I think look at they must be doing something that they're assuming.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That might be because these people do not look if you had if you had a 4k camera on here which you might I mean the sensors are cheap enough.  You're right.  I mean that's this third picture in with the guy playing basketball this kid that's wide angle.  They put it on the basketball.  I don't know.  That's it.  See that's why we have to get one to review it.  If I were a civilian I would wait to read the reviews before I buy it.  But I'm not so we need 130 degree field of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty wide.  Fifteen frames per second.  Where's the specs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't say what the sensor is.  No they don't.  It's a fairly slow sensor.  It's F2 for F2 six but it's F2 four.  But they don't say much about it.  This is I think Stacey you're right.  This is this is a stealth project.  They're trying to get into people's hands so they can learn more about this.  But I think you nailed it when you said this could easily be applied to nest.  Oh yeah.  The nest does that by the way the nest zooms in because it's a 4k sensor on the inside the new nest IQ it zooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so the software that it gives you lets you pick out cute moments.  It shows you what's interesting.  And it knows it learns you people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It learns who's who's who and will warn you if it sees somebody it hasn't seen before.  It has a lot of this smarts in it.  I bet you they're related.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So that's the clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also announced a new daydream form factor for 99 bucks which is just a little bit improved over the existing daydream.  That is a massive massive product dump.  That's a lot of product and add the nest stuff last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have to ask though because I I saw their AR stickers demo and I was stunned that they spent so much freaking time on.  So no.  Well am I old.  I kind of wanted to get my daughter to explain this because I'm like it's dopey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the same reason Apple spent a similar amount of time on animated emojis using the camera system and you make funny faces.  I think both of these companies.  Look you're no older than the people at Google.  They're both they don't they don't know either.  They just notice all these kids using Snapchat filters.  And so what can we do.  I don't think it's that important.  I think it's Florence Ion said this morning when we were covering the stream.  And by the way we do have if you want to watch the stream we have a twit special where Florence and I comment as it goes on during the event this morning.  But she said you know this is kind of thing you use once never use again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah OK that's that's how I didn't even want to use it once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So and it's not new.  We've seen this kind of placing a thing in augmented reality before.  So there you go.  If you include the pencil it's actually even more new products one two three four five six.  It's a ton.  It's a ton of new stuff from Google.  And I think well let me before I say what I think what do you guys what do you think Jeff what is is this what is this.  What does this tell us about Google's ambitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I was hoping you go to Stacy first.  I think I think you're right about the ecosystem.  I think that that that Google recognizes it has to be in the hardware business.  It needs to provide an ecosystem you need to live with assistant.  It needs to provide the you know assistant across all these platforms.  Nobody else is going to build it in for them build it well.  So you know and building the best phone they can on the best laptop they can.  I'm personally glad they're still doing that when we thought the pixel was dead.  The only thing is when they thought the pixel was dead I went on eBay I can only find one I bought it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I was the Chromebook Pixel because I was so addicted to it.  Yeah.  And I had I had the version one in my office in New York and it was just to get too slow.  So I have to Chromebook pixels because I love it that much.  Stacy.  Sorry Stacy.  I love my people.  I love my pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff is not alone.  The people who love their pixels love them.  I mean and I know a lot of people.  I love my I love my pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I think it's I think it's a good I think it's an impressive.  And you know here's a question.  What's more impressive today's Google announcement or the Apple announcements of late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh Google for sure times a thousand.  Wow.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a that's a big deal.  I think I mean Leo's worrying about the the assassin hits are going to.  No I'm thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Apple you know we really thought Apple would going to be all in on augmented reality and there'd be a lot to say about augmented reality on their event.  And there wasn't they just didn't mention much at all.  It wasn't it wasn't any higher quality what Google did today with a.  Dinos the stranger things animal.  I you know I don't I think Apple's a little bit disappointing.  They know they announced phones.  And they announced phones that are incrementally better than their existing phones even the like this like this the iPhone 10.  They we know they want an ecosystem they didn't even talk about at their event.  They didn't even talk about their home pod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they missed out with the biggest architectural shift is in computing today which is computing is about.  Context it's about an ecosystem of things that are helping you get stuff done.  And a phone that is incrementally better is not the vision forward the vision forward is things like hey when my pixel Chromebook gets next to my whatever pixel phone it automatically tethers and Apple's done a little bit of that in the past.  But things like series like when they announced their stuff I wanted Siri to be so much better.  I was waiting for that.  And until Siri is good the home pod is going to suck.  And I look at what Google's done they've done a very I mean I was Kevin and I were joking we were talking about like every time someone says machine learning drink.  But they really have done a good job integrating the computational power that these all of these things now have access to in really creating a really compelling product in a new vision for how we're going to use devices.  And I think that's that's super impressive.  This is the future and it feels like Apple is kind of like not with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I would say I agree with you but I would I the way I would phrase it is Apple has intentionally chosen to value user privacy over gathering the data necessary for machine learning.  Well wait as a result again I would argue that's because they're not in the ad business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not it's not an altruistic act.  It's just that they're turning a bug into a feature in their business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah but I think it's that they're doubling down on it because there is a large segment maybe growing maybe even majority segment of people who are concerned about Google.  We didn't we won't get to talk about today because we're running out of time but I really wanted to and we'll do it next week talk about we spent some time on Sunday talking about it about the professor who wrote that Silicon Valley is is has lost its shine and get ready because governments are about to super regulate companies like Google because of these privacy concerns that you know I'm talking about gallows.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  This is if if it weren't for this great Google event we would have spent the last hour and a half talking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But next week, and we'll actually have a triangulation with him on the 20th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How exciting.  So, Professor gallows will be on his name gallows or am I something like that.  Galloway Galloway.  Okay, I accidentally turn it into a hangman, Professor Gallup but he is kind of saying, get ready because the hangman's noose is coming for you Silicon Valley.  So we'll hear from him on triangulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wrote a piece to that I put up on moving on next week.  Yes, but but arguing that they have to go out of their way to be virtuous, and they're not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I think it's quite the opposite I think Google has decided to double down.  That they're just saying they're going to look at Apple's doing privacy.  They're all in on privacy.  Great news for us.  We can win now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yes, sorry someone stuck a thing on here is Ron Amario who's smart and lovely from his review of the pixel to in to excel once nice ones not.  And so I bought the two I'll be honest because I have tiny hands, and they're not tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which one did he think was nice or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He thought the two excel was nicer because of the bezel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the same corners as Google put was great pains to point out the same internals.  It's it's really the big one of course.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He basically says, it's ugly.  But I don't know what a chamfered edges so I kind of feel like this is a very gadget or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and also remember this is Ron based on what he experienced for 15 minutes this morning.  This is not a review.  This is a hands on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  I mean, Ron's a good dude.  Oh, I love Ron.  He knows his stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I love Ron.  But I don't.  This is not a review.  This is just here.  Here's what I experienced that when I held it.  So the hardware is exactly the same.  Maybe there is a look and feel that's I kind of agree with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the hardware is not the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's not like the internals like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The processor, the camera, the camera, the screens are different ones, LCD ones, PO LED.  But the the internals are the same.  So you're not getting a slower phone.  Google pointed that out.  You're just getting a different phone.  And I mean, that's just purely subjective.  Which one looks better to you?  I think that's subjective.  I don't think that that's a it's going to function the same.  It's going to have the same speed, the same smarts, the same photography skills.  It's just whether you like big ears or not on your screen.  And we've you know, all of us, we've had phones that looked like this all our lives until now.  This is only now that we're getting bezel as phones.  I kind of agree with him that I prefer a bezel as phone.  But not but I think if you want a smaller phone, Stacy, you're not going to be unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will not be unhappy.  No, I don't think that's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This he says, he says the bezels are massive and awkward.  But no, they're exactly the same as the bezels on the current.  Look at the current.  Show it over my shoulder.  The current iPhone 8 and the current Pixel XL.  When did this suddenly become, you know, unacceptable?  This is this is what we like.  Can I get a screen turned on here?  This is what we've been living with all this time.  I am highly fashionable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe I'll care about bezels.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do think that in a couple of years, having big ears on a screen will look kind of silly.  But by the way, I should point out one of the negatives to me on this new Pixelbook is that  while we're seeing many laptops with virtually no bezel on the screen,  the Pixelbook has big, big bezels on the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that because it wrapped its antenna around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe. I don't know what the argument is for it.  But it is. I don't think it's.  If you look at this compared to most modern laptops, I don't think it's particularly attractive, frankly.  Look at the size of the bezels on this.  What big bezels you have.  This looks like an old fashioned laptop with those bezels.  So but that's a purely subjective, you know, a design or a taste thing.  I don't think that that I don't think you would be unhappy with the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks very much like my present.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, my my current choice of laptops, Windows laptops, most of them have much thinner bezels than this.  But that's fine.  Good. Well, I will read his hands on.  But I don't think that's cause to to for concern if you've already ordered the little one.  We didn't talk about. I'm not concerned.  Yeah, we didn't talk about Google Lens.  They've been showing this since Google goggles.  I was just going to ask about that. Yeah.  The demos looked good, but until we have it, you can't really say much about it.  I. Jeff needs to go.  I think we got to take a break and get your final picks of the week.  Is she and in just a moment, but first a word from our sponsors kept Tara.  People call me all the time on the radio show and say I have a business and I need some software for my yoga studio or my dental practice or my contractors business.  And I say, I don't know what you should.  And, you know, most of the time people will just Google this.  You know, what's the best contractor software?  I got a better idea.  Go to cap.  Tara cap.  Tara.  Cap.  Tara.  Let's you find the business software.  You need hundreds of thousands of programs in 400 categories with the reviews with the information you need to make a smart choice.  What are you looking for?  I management software, audit software, augmented reality software, barcoding software, bug tracking software, call center software, catering.  Let's do catering, catering software.  I have a catering business.  I need some software.  Do you have some choices?  Fifty seven results.  Cater ease, total party planning, gather better cater.  This is kind of one of the things that's kind of kept her open my eyes to how much vertical business software there is.  But that maybe is a little bit overwhelming.  So what if we say, well, I only want to see four stars and up and let's have it be web based.  I would love it if would allow me to manage events, facilities, inventory and customers.  How about that?  Now we'll filter the results and well, we got it down to four products.  Let's add to compare, add to compare, add to compare, add to compare monkey software.  I like that.  And now I could take these products and I can look at a chart created just for me on captera.com slash twig that says who uses this software, what's the target customer size, how much it costs.  Is there a free trial?  What platforms it runs on, what it can do?  And then you get the reviews, reviews from real users, hundreds of thousands of reviews from real users.  They're very careful to vet these.  So you're going to get the information you need to make exactly the right choice on the business software you need.  And best of all, it's absolutely free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Jeff, I'm getting hungry.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a short show by any means.  But there are so many things I wanted to talk about the fake news that surfaced on both Google and Facebook safety check page after the horrific Vegas shootings.  That's a problem.  I know you have some things to say about journalism in particular.  What was it that I saw?  Oh, I oh Jeff's going to want to talk about this.  Well, I can't remember.  But guess what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We get together every week so we can talk about it and we will not be coming on from Berlin next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you doing in Berlin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking at a newspaper digital conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Facebook's revealing that there are some of the Russian ads now.  Is this enough?  I want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wrote a piece arguing that they need to do more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I'd say.  Wither news.  Moral authority is a platform, writes Jeff.  We shall we shall read more about it and then talk discuss for next week.  Jeff, you got a number for us this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I do.  So Google has now also announced a street view ready program.  And there's a camera now for thirty five hundred dollars.  You can make your own street view and you can contribute images to Google Street View.  Why would I not understand why you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, you could make a business out of it, couldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're not paying you for it.  I guess what you could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You go because remember when we we had a street view, an internal street view done of our business.  This is auto ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is you put in your car.  It's got a mount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what the business would be for that.  Maybe you could map a campus.  Google's going to have loners.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's it's fairly weird.  It's a 360 degree 8K camera, the Insta 360.  And you loaded up the street view.  It's for parks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's for private and, you know, private places that Google can't get into.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just it was a little odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was kind of freaky because I hate the idea of like getting caught.  I mean, I hate the idea of being caught on a street view camera.  But like this will increase the number of the velocity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the new Creep View.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  You just surreptitiously drive around like right.  Right.  Hmm.  Put it on top of a van.  You won't even see it.  What if they sold that to law enforcement, the police departments?  Would you or governments?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that is that is a real concern about when we put cameras on city buses or anything  else.  How do we how do we govern that data use?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The number is 35.  It's a number.  It's a number.  It's a number.  No, it's a good number.  What does it mean?  Stacey Higginbotham, your pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a thing to show you.  This isn't exactly a pick, as many of my things are not picks.  They're just things.  This is the August Smart Lock.  This is the new base model.  So this is the cheapest August that you can buy for I think it's one forty nine.  It's Bluetooth enabled and Nest enabled.  But it doesn't.  You'd have to spend the additional I think seventy nine bucks for the the bridge if you  want it not to work with Bluetooth or if you want it to work over Wi-Fi and have like Madam  A or whatever on it.  But as locks go, this is actually really impressive.  It is very sturdy hardware.  It looks like it is like this lock weighs at least a pound.  I mean, it is kind of ridiculous.  I'll be honest.  So it also comes.  I don't I didn't see the door sensor in here.  Oh, no, it's in there.  So it comes with their new they launched something called DoorSense.  So if your door is kind of a jar, but the lock is closed, it no longer will say, hey,  your door is locked.  It'll say your door is a jar.  So I just wanted to show you all because it's hefty.  It's a new form factor for the August.  And that's kind of that.  The other one is on my door.  So it's working.  So, yeah, that's that's what this is.  The back looks like this.  What you do is you'll take your deadbolt out.  Just the deadbolt part.  You leave the locking mechanism.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  You leave the lock locking mechanism and you stick this on the thing you removed from the front.  So the back your key lock stays the same.  You stick that on.  And then what you'll do is these have little wings and you'll just mount it on.  It takes like possibly not even 10 minutes really to install.  So I prefer to install my entire lock to swap out my entire lock.  But people do like this.  And it's it's the most popular, I think, smart home lock out there or something.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to have to take a look at it because I've been resistant to the idea of automated locks.  But you're right.  They can just break the door down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm not.  I mean, if you want to hack my door, right, be easier to get in.  It would honestly my door has a window next to it.  You could just lock the window in.  That's a good point.  A lot just suggesting.  I've also this is this is not really a thing, but this is a thing because I bought it for eight bucks.  Your pride.  If you don't wrist towels, if you don't want you also there's a sweatband, but I did not wear that because that's hot.  But I bought it to cover my Fitbit for two things.  One in the middle of the night.  It glows whenever I move.  It thinks I need to see the time and my husband gets cranky about it.  Yes. So it puts it up.  But it also I've done kettlebells for a while now and it protects your your Apple watch or your kettlebell or from any sort of like if you're working out with something that's going to hit your watch because a friend of mine cracked her fit.  Oh, I thought you were in a bell choir.  I guess if you were doing handbells, that actually is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the equivalent of Russian bell, bell, bell ringing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, I just throwing that out there for you guys because I never even really thought about them.  But then I was like, hot damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you look like you're a gay tennis pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, yes.  I'm OK with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You wear those to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I just wear one over my Fitbit.  Oh, that's super comfortable and sporty, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're rain rainbow towels.  That's extremely.  That's a good point.  If you're going to wear a sleep tracker to bed, you probably should cover it up so that doesn't wake up your spouse.  It's an excellent point.  I don't I've been on vacation.  I'm groggy.  I have nothing to say.  I have nothing to pick except jet lag.  You too.  I pick you guys.  I'll tell you I'll pick our twit live special three twenty six.
