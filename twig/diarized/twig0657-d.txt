Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you can't get rid of me man.  You try and try everything.  No I'm still here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  He's the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the Great New York Graduate  School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Question that has been burning in my soul.  Yes.  For a week.  Yes.  What are you sitting on today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sitting.  It's a bicycle seat on a stick.  You're still sitting on that damn thing?  No I'm getting used to it.  My butt's numb but my core strength is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He sat on this last week and couldn't sit still because his rear end is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not supposed to sit still.  You're supposed to be constantly moving.  So we brought in the big guns to take over for Stacey and Ant this week.  Joan Donovan is here from the Shorenstein Center.  We should get Carol Shorenstein a song.  Carol Shorenstein, Center on Media Policy, Media Politics and Public Policy.  It's great to have you Joan.  We've had her on many times before.  She is the research director there and an expert on disinformation which has kept you  pretty busy I'm thinking of late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh I don't even know if you heard of it.  It's like such a niche research area these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all Joan's fault.  Nobody cared about this before.  Then she came along and suddenly you know.  There were a few people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There were a few good people out there.  Jeff I remember meeting you at the beginning of all of this and being like oh we're in  trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should have all run away.  When was that?  When was the beginning?  Just out of curiosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was back around like when Google News Lab was bringing together people trying to  figure out you know.  Did this fake news thing have anything to do with journalism?  I was just starting up at Data and Society and Jeff of course had a longer relationship  with them at Data and Society and Dana Boyd and I was just getting my sea legs but I really  relied on Jeff for a lot of input and insight into how this you know whole thing came together  and how the field was going to mature.  Well I think we learned from each other maybe.  I think you know you've been around.  There's history in those in your you know just embodied in your experience.  Yeah.  That's what they say after a while Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's history embodied in that white hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah but it's like you know I came on the scene as an internet researcher that knew  a lot about social movements, knew a lot about online coordination and I was always interested  in pranking and digital shenanigans and then I'd done research on people who hide their  identities online, particularly white supremacists and so I was like showing up at a moment when  everybody was like wait the internet isn't just a force for social good.  There are baddies on the internet.  Where?  And and then it just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Joan was doing very brave things from the beginning.  It is great isn't it.  In the bad groups.  Oh really.  Yeah it is.  Very.  Yeah those people are creepy.  And bringing understanding of what they were doing and why they were doing it that nobody  else really had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually since we have you on Joan this is a story from last month but I'm curious what  you think about the linguistic analysis of Q. Did you see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did you know and there's just been there's been a lot of analysis and you know until  like until the day that the person who was Q that had access to the keys of H&N stands  up and says it was me haha you know I think we're all going to have our doubts but I  think this is a pretty decent approximation.  I also don't think it was just one or two people.  I think that there was always a Q was like one of those you know names that was like  a moniker for a collective.  And so when you do look closely at some of the posts there's some really weirdo like  you know yoga spiritual music stuff that's in Q post and you're like where did where  did that come from and and then there's like you know this very bombastic militaristic  language and you're like that just seems like a whole different vibe.  And what's your theory Joan?  I think that yeah I think personally like this is not anything I can sustain with any  research is I think it was something that was tested and got out of hand and then was  reigned in by the Watkins on 8chan who saw a marketing opportunity a way to drive people  to their website a way to drive people to their political convictions and they were  a bit of a hooligan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it was it sincere or was it a hoot from the beginning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it actually came out of this you know on 4chan and whatnot there'd been a lot of  talk about psychological influence operations and if you could really do it and I think  it was people playing with some military strategy playing with psychological theories  about repetition and and facts and evidence and so I actually think it was plotted out  probably not as strategically all the way to the end because they could have never known  you know what was what was going to be around the corner but what they did strategically  that I thought was always really interesting is they took breaking news and made it relevant  to the conspiracy and so there was always something new to discover and to be part of  and so it generated all of this participation and excitement and you know there are all  these like Easter egg hunts and so in that sense I do think that the Watkins saw that  there was an advantage here that their website could really bring people together and could  be used as a place to launder information out to other platforms but because it was  always bigger than the messages from Q itself there are all of these you know sort of centrifugal  rings of influencers around Q that it was always more than just one layer of people  and it's hard to tell if they were even coordinating at all more so than they were just trying  to keep it alive because it made money it generated attention and it got political things  done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah so really it's of interest I guess to think of who the original creators were just  like it's of interest to figure out who Satoshi Nakamoto is but not really of real import  because both Bitcoin and Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah because you can study what it did without knowing who it was but there is you know there's  that great series on HBO about this.  Well that's what got me really interested in it yeah.  Yeah and that does talk to some of the major players that would really know who was behind  it and what you know because eventually you know if you run a website that has user generated  content and someone's demanding that much attention and causing that much chaos you're  going to want to know who they are.  Right.  Like you know and in the Watkins especially if this had been some kind of government op  would have been you know intensely suspicious of FBI CIA DHS involvement and so it's just  like it strikes me that the people who ran the website would have to know a little bit  more about the subversive intentions of Q if not be you know the ones behind it themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The documentary is called Into the Storm and the creator of it Colin Hopkins Hoskins I  think pretty much concluded that was Ron Watkins at the end and it was very conclusive for  me as I watched the documentary but again that's not that's not as much important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah I think Ron played a significant role but again it's like if you look at the multi-level  marketing around QAnon and just the like you know the spirituality angle of it you  know I mean it's t-shirts, it's keychains, it's self-help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's germane only in one aspect which is that Ron Watkins is running for Congress so it  does I guess in that respect have some importance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always hoped it was like a washed up comic like Gallagher.  Wouldn't that have been better?  Oh it was a hoot.  Like Carrot Top shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah Carrot Top that's better.  Or Andy Kaufman.  Andy Kaufman comes back.  It would be an Andy Kaufman movie.  All right well there is stuff that is more up to date today to talk about so I guess  we should get to the news of the week although when you have Joan Donovan on.  You can talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very tempting to go down a lot of different rabbit holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where she lives in those rabbit holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know you guys don't even want to know.  I often tell people they're like what have you been looking at and I'm like no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No you don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like asking a Facebook moderator hey how was work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How was work?  Oh no not the conversation we had here.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's talk a little bit about this information in Ukraine.  It was a very interesting strategy the US information agencies pursued to defuse what  they saw as the coming war and the coming disinformation from Putin for instance to  say no no no those stories about the chemical weapons bunkers the US has in Ukraine are  really just a straw man to distract you from the fact that they're going to use chemical  weapons to attack Ukraine.  Russians are going to.  Pay no attention to.  So the Russians who have historically been kind of kings of disinformation I think have  been at it again considerably.  And do you think that was a good strategy on the part of the information agencies to  inoculate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah I think it in the evidence points right back to what happened in Syria.  And so we know that this is part of the strategy to say this horrible thing's about to happen.  This other person.  Yeah.  You know and in that kind of attack and deflect strategy is something that we've seen from  Russia in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Gary Kasparov says that Putin's strategy has always been sue for peace talks so he  can rearm and reload and then attack with great vigor again.  It's like we know the playbook now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah and I think that you know the US and NATO understand that there's a common enemy  afoot and that's why I think you know news media was making a pretty big deal about the  end of Biden's very cinematic speech on Saturday with the castle and the dark lighting and  everything very ominous.  But I was like this feels like the moon landing you know in a way.  Do you think that was intentional all of that staging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everybody loves a good stage.  Yeah.  And have you seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry I can't hear you sometimes.  Have you seen a uptick or down tick in Russian disinformation?  Are they a little a little busy now?  Pay attention to what they're paying attention to or in terms of America or has it had an  impact on the flow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting.  Yeah the kind of stuff that we see like that used to be pumped through Russian state media  of course you know the platform companies have shut all of that down and so there's  a lot less RT.  What we're seeing then is clips of those shows show up on TikTok and in Telegram much more  frequently.  And so the media out of Russia is coming back.  But the Russian focus on the US and I thought it was really interesting.  Love to know Jeff your opinion on you know when Putin started to mention J.K. Rowling  and cancel culture.  It reminded me a lot of this kind of dog whistling where you're like well the US media is going  to have to cover this because we mentioned you know Harry Potter.  And so that's why that's interesting.  A way to sneak back into the American.  You know it is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good theory.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  They must have a fairly big operation.  You know I noted for instance we had a story yesterday that Verizon customers are getting  spam text messages from their own number.  They say click a link to receive a gift.  In many cases the link led to a Russian news site.  And I thought wow that's interesting.  Is that their strategy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean yes.  Spoofing you know to try to get people to see things from their perspective.  And I think that you know the use of spam is something that's also been interesting  on the activist side.  I have a colleague Julia Minson at the university that's been working with some hackers on building  repositories of messages that can be then spammed to Russian emails so that they can  get information one on how to install things like Tor and circumvents Russian suppression  of the Internet and then also to messages about from independent media that make people  think twice about the media that they're ingesting.  But who knows?  Are they opening the spam?  We don't know.  But it does seem to me that there's going to be some low-grade information warfare tactic  playing out as people experiment with different gateways into other people's networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do it all right?  And it's cheap and easy to do thanks to technology.  So as long as you have the manpower, which Russia does, to do it you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put in the story about the bot farms that were shut down in Ukraine.  And the great thing about it is pictures of the racks used to create all the different  identities to go to go spin off and other things.  10,000 SIM cards, 100 sets of GSM gateways.  All this was just to spam us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and in fact, yeah, that's used in Florida as well.  It's used all over the world.  These spam farms in Asia too.  Yeah, here's some of the pictures.  These are almost 10,000 SIMs of various operators.  The idea being it looks like these are genuine users.  It's been used for click fraud in advertising.  I guess this was for disinformation.  I don't know what they were.  I would assume so.  Yeah.  The bot farms operated in Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Ternopil, Potava, Zakarpetia regions, fake  accounts.  Ah, they would use these to create fake accounts on social media.  Right.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then post fake news about the Russian war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I've known a few of them.  I wonder, Joan, if this, I mean, this is this a, how new is this phenomenon?  Is social media really allowing, this has kind of been something that poor Jeff has  to hear me say all the time, allowing this to be weaponized?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we've been here.  You know, if you look at the sort of now canonical case of the Russian Internet Research Agency,  when they were creating fake accounts, it was, you know, they were, some of them were  originally lifestyle accounts, things that were, you know, on Twitter that were very  spammy until they were turned into, you know, mostly anti-Dem or anti-Hillary accounts.  They weren't exactly pro-Trump.  And so, yeah, like we've seen this happen time and time again.  We were also looking at a bunch of Facebook pages that were being operated and were selling  identities to support the convoy protests that were happening in Ottawa and then, you  know, started to roll out, you know, in the U.S. and there was a, you know, nobody really  paid any attention to it, but there were a couple of convoy protests in D.C. over the  past few weeks.  And, but yeah, it's just, you know, part of the nature of the design of these platforms  themselves is this, you know, engagement farming and building out these fake profiles  because the goal here is to have an impact on the algorithm, not just an impact on public  conversation, but you want to be able to put information out there and then have it be  discoverable.  And so it's like if a single person tweets and nobody retweets it, you know, did anybody  really see it?  And so having a bot network or, you know, fake influencers or fake accounts that follow  you that's job is to reshare that information, it's just part of the industry.  It's part of social media's, like, it's just what it is, is, you know, social media itself.  It's a communications medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, whatever the communications medium, you're going to use it.  And if it's, you know, more friction free, you're going to use it more.  It's easier to take advantage of.  Not all this information comes from Russia, surprisingly.  Facebook, for instance, paid a firm called Targeted Victory to push the message that  TikTok was bad for kids.  How stupid can that be?  Employees from the firm Targeted Victory worked to undermine TikTok through a nationwide media  and lobbying campaign portraying TikTok, which was an existential threat to Facebook,  I guess, as a danger to American children and society.  This is according to The Washington Post, which saw internal emails to this effect.  Here's one quote, quote, Get the message out that while meta is the current punching  bag, TikTok is the real threat, especially as a foreign owned app that is number one  in sharing data that young teens are using, end quote.  Bonus point, here's the best one.  Bonus points if we can fit this into a broader message that the current bills aren't where  members of Congress should be focused.  Pay no attention to that meta problem.  Look at TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, this had echoes of a campaign that Facebook had also run in 2018 where they  used a similar firm called Definers that had attacked Apple and Google.  And they had come up with some anti-Semitic messaging that also attacked George Soros.  And so Facebook, in response to that New York Times story, it was a really big deal when  it came out.  And it was a Shira Frankel, Cecilia King piece.  And so this is nothing new that Facebook has done here.  This is just a different firm doing the same media.  Do you think all companies do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they usually hire, they create a fake organization and fund that and let that organization  right.  Microsoft has been doing this for years going after Google and company.  And so it's usually, they're smart enough to create a separation.  They create society for responsible adolescents.  Microsoft did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And give them money.  It sponsored ads and videos about Gmail man reading your mail.  So they didn't try too hard to obfuscate the source of that information.  Targeted Victory does not deny it.  They say, quote, they didn't say what they did, but we are proud of the work we've done.  You can hire us.  With Meta.  We're your enemies too.  And Meta spokesperson Andy Stone defended the campaign saying, quote, we believe all  platforms including TikTok should face a level of scrutiny of a level of scrutiny consistent  with their growing success.  TikTok says it's deeply concerned.  Well, it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you're out here as a, you know, if you're out here as an academic, you're  like, wait, you know, we're trying to work with these companies to battle misinformation.  And here they are paying PR firms to blast each other.  And it's like, how do we get a handle on like authentic debate and discourse, especially  if you look in that article, Taylor Lorenz and Drew Harwell do a really great job because  there were a couple of viral campaigns.  We were sitting on a case study about the slap your teacher phenomenon and we were just  like, we just can't figure out how this thing became so popular when it's not actually that  viral and there's a few things on TikTok and there's a few things on Facebook.  And this really connected the dots for us is that there was a paid media campaign to  get out that, you know, TikTok was hosting these viral challenges and there's a threat  to children.  Yeah. And so it really, we were just like sitting here reading it this morning.  My whole team was on signal just like, oh man, we can finish the case study now because  we know how it became popular in the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how much of moral panic is seeded in this way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And so we got to just be really careful when we start to read these stories.  And it employs a classic media manipulation technique called trading up the chain.  So it's well known.  There's a really great book by Ryan Holiday called Trust Me I'm Lying, where he's this  whole chapter on describing.  Yeah. Read this chapter again, because it'll just it.  But it's you plan a story in local news or a blog that doesn't have a lot of overhead  like oversight in terms of editorial.  And and you get that story and that establishes the facts.  Here's the perfect other things can be built.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a perfect example that happened in Northern California a couple of months ago.  This is from Oakland's Channel 2 News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  New video sweeping TikTok has law enforcement watching.  It's the door kicking challenge in which young people kick someone's door to beat out  to the beat of a song, then run as KTVU's Deborah Villalon reports, causing damage  and safety concerns. This sparked a series of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This sparked a series on TikTok of prank that began in college

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  newspaper articles in Petaluma.  Doors are being damaged.  Plus, we're worried when this happens, somebody's going to get shot.  Well, if you think you're being broken in on, here's the Petaluma police  community engagement officer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. This is this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As far as I know, I was localized to our small town.  I asked our 19 year old and I asked my son, who's a fairly well known  TikToker, are you aware of this challenge?  No.  No, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's a lot of this one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Line 109.  Line 109.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kick the door when you hear it.  Sixteen percent.  Of British toddlers are on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, like like as like their parents or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They serve to the survey them.  It may be affecting their attention span.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe toddler.  Mommy, mommy, please have the check, talk, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  British toddlers are increasingly likely to be users of TikTok  with a substantial number of parents saying their preschool children  use the video service, despite the app supposedly being restricted  to those ages 13 and older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excuse me. Excuse me.  The little Sally here.  I know you're only two years old, but did you fill out that age thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you go down to the.  Come down to the pub, Sally.  Get your age thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't even know how you get statistics on that.  This is from OSCOM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the funniest thing.  This is the British.  Ofcom, the British enforcement radio media regular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're the ones they're the ones who are going to be enforcing  the new regulations against the Internet. Ofcom.  This is these are the folks who are going to protect us from ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This rises to a third of all children in the five to seven year old age group.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if they just ask like parents, do you let your children  use TikTok on your phone?  And they're just like, yeah, show them funny cat videos.  I don't honestly.  How else do I get my dinner down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The 13 year old age limit is about collecting information on kids.  It means you can't make an account on TikTok, which means you can't post on TikTok.  But I don't think in any respect, it limits you from using  viewing video on YouTube, TikTok or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how does a five year old get access to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's just.  Mommy, mommy, can I use the phone, mommy?  It's especially three year olds.  It's mom's mom's going, shut up and watch TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's how I self-soothe at night.  I'm like, oh, I'm just going to kick back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why shouldn't three year olds be able to do scroll like the rest of us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's that's weird.  I mean, you know, if we're all out here trying to get headlines, it's one thing.  But, you know, you really want to like tie that to some really  like clear analysis of facts.  And and I think there is a bit of a, you know, moral  techno panic going on in the world these days around, you know, access and tech,  you know, access to technology, meaning exactly that this this child or this person  has been corrupted in some way.  And I don't know, I hate to hold myself out as an example of anything, but I consume  more horrible media than most people on the planet.  I think I'm OK, you know, I mean, you're watching, you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're binge binging Bridgerton.  Is that what you're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I guess I just I don't know, maybe I don't believe in anything.  So I'm like, yeah, flat earth. Let's watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So where are you on the third person effect, Joan, and the first person?  Yeah. What's that?  Is that what you mean? Tell me.  The third person effect says that everybody else is influenced by this horrible stuff.  Poor, but not me.  And the first person effect says that I'm better than everybody else.  Right. That's so much of what goes on here is that there's a big  scope of that. Everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can I can handle it, but I really worry about the mush minds in my community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are things that I am totally dupable on and I need to know what those things are.  And and so like I'm like, you know, I want to believe probably the worst about Bitcoin.  And so I'm like, dupable about people.  I was just talking to a colleague the other day and I had shared that like, you know,  New York City Scammers sells Chuck E.  Cheese tokens in Times Square as Bitcoin makes a million dollars.  Like I was like, that's funny.  Like I believe Bitcoin was real, you know, and and so like, you know,  you just kind of know what you might be susceptible to, where your biases are.  And then and then show up with sort of a relentless skepticism towards everything.  But, you know, I have criteria by which makes it so that I believe certain things  more than others, especially when it comes to long form investigative journalism.  And like, you know, but it's it's it's crazy to think like, you know, that  there's a great book, if I might divulge my my book choice early.  But there is this great book from Kelly Weill about flat earthers  that has recently come out. Oh, yeah, I've ordered that.  And yeah. And one of the things that goes to this talk about like,  does tick tock tick tock corrupt children is there's this line  from one of her respondents in there is he says, I didn't find flattered.  It found me. And what he's talking about is he was watching a bunch of conspiracy videos.  But then flat earth conspiracy videos came up in his recommendations and he got into it.  And so, like, you know, I think part of that underlying fear  about what the algorithms are doing to people is animating people's fears about,  you know, what's under the hood at tick tock and, you know, are they Chinese  propagandists that are trying to make us feel better about U.S.-China relations?  Is that part of tick tock's, you know, adoption, you know, in the U.S.?  Like, and so it's it's important for us to to be skeptical of things,  but also we can't just get into this, you know, belief that, you know,  these companies can do all this stuff that is just not actually possible.  And how much people are affected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Joan, can you explain this to me? If anybody can, you can.  I mean, flat earth is clearly just wrong and dumb and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All I have to do is take a ride in Jeff Jeff Bezos's penis ship and you'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, right.  I'm dead. I'm dead.  Sorry, that one killed me.  Just take a ride, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, yeah, you'll see it's curved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's curves. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll stop. And so I feel like flat earthers might be the our birds real crowd.  Like, is it performative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it just I'm going to piss off people and that's why I'm doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not as performative as our birds are real,  which is definitely got a bit of like showmanship and a bit of,  you know, a bit of pranksterism behind it.  Whereas the the flat earthers, like they do believe it.  They do. They have like a lot of work into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can fly or sail around the world and never fall off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can't fall off because it's really, really far to the ends  where the ice wall exists that keeps all of the thing on the disk  inside the disk. It's like it's like to get to the crust of the pizza.  You just it's really, really far.  And so you sail for a really long time.  No, you know, that makes no sense.  I'm not explaining my position.  I'm just explaining the position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we're going to do an intervention in a minute.  So let me so it's crazy.  So but we should ask, really, the nut of the whole thing.  This whole conversation that we've debate we've been having for years.  Is is it the platform's responsibility to somehow curb this?  Is there anything they can do should they do something about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's their products.  This is this is how they're going to make money and build their  build their product and build their design.  And, you know, eventually, you know, different products  are going to come along.  That's a better curation that give people more of what they want.  And we're going to move away from these platforms  that are everything to everyone and more into platforms like,  for instance, Twitch that serves gamer communities.  It knows what the the feelings and the ethics of the fans are.  And it works really hard to remove problematic content from its  from its platform.  And I think like the model of Facebook and Twitter and YouTube  has always been, well, we'll take anything and we'll, you know,  we're structures here and, you know, we build infrastructure.  But that just doesn't hold anymore.  It just doesn't make sense.  It you're continuously negotiating in on the national media stage,  like if you should keep all of these horrible people on your services.  And it's just it's a drain on resources.  And so it's better to try to fix some of these problems up front.  And, you know, Twitter's doing, you know, different than Facebook  is in terms of trying to clean up these messes that are left behind by,  frankly, like the biggest messes are left behind by the biggest influencers.  And so we are going to revisit the, you know, presidential question  around Trump returning to social media.  And these companies are going to have to decide which communities  they're going to serve and if they're going to if they're going to play  on this national stage and if they do, they're, you know,  there's a really good opportunity for more innovation  that does more niche platforming work.  And you can kind of see it with the the creep of young people  away from Facebook products and towards, you know,  things that are more  things that are less social, networky and a little bit more ephemeral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is TikTok one of those things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Definitely. Yeah.  It's hard to find things on TikTok.  You can't. I can't. I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My son's things on TikTok.  It's crazy. And I follow him and I can't find I have to search for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, I agree with Joan, as always,  that they have to make choices and they are allergic to choices,  because choices are expensive.  And I think that we will see more things serving communities.  All that good.  But what if they're not allowed to make the choices?  I had an amazing  encounter this week on Twitter with with Brendan Carr, an FCC commissioner  who was going crazy on it was going after me and others.  And I was having back channel chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't see this. But let me add them, Jeff.  I'm like, it's on. Nobody comes after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine 67.  Yeah, Joe Jeff protect me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm coming in. I might be like three days late, though.  I don't know what that means about me, but, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we wonder why he was doing this.  And then he had his testimony before the  Commerce Committee in the House, in which he at the end of this whole,  long, boring thing with with thickly veiled references  to basically saying Big Tech has to allow our speech.  And so they're not going to be allowed to take things down  if certain people get in power.  And so all the all the yelling we do about you better be responsible platforms.  You better take this stuff down.  You better care about your product. You better care about society.  It could well turn around on a dime and move.  I can't do anything. Sorry.  Mm hmm. Yeah, we're not there, but we could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if it happens like that, you know, who the right like  who the public attention and the conversation then turns to  is to Congress to do something.  Oh, like, yeah, they haven't really done anything.  And but there's going to be much more accountability on political accounts,  you know, in the public ire and the journalism  that beat is is going to is going to come back to bite them.  And so, you know, and I'm, you know, Daniel Citron's,  you know, someone who's thought very deeply about she's a professor of law.  She's thought very deeply about the codes and rules of of Internet speech.  And, you know, I come down with her is that the the companies have  a duty of care to do content moderation in a way that is  responsible, ethical, you know, has public interest at its core.  And, you know, we're in this moment where  you have these very,  very different political views on what the Internet is good for  and how it should be governed.  And this point of view, unfortunately,  I don't know, like you might think wrong and think think I'm wrong on this.  But I kind of feel like Facebook changing its name to meta  signals a really big transition where Facebook is probably going to go away  in the form that we know it currently slowly over time and be replaced  with something else.  I have a feeling that Twitter is actually going to turn into a kind of banking system  with, you know, with messages attached.  But it's, you know, like the things that these people become interested in,  the same rails that move information also move money.  And so I'm not I don't feel like we've really seen our final form  in terms of social media here.  And so legislation might accelerate legislation like that.  That would say, you know, hands off, no moderation allowed would probably accelerate  the death of social media  pretty quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know how low you've seen it, Joe.  Elon Musk actually is, I think, in hand in hand with Brendan Carr  when he suggested that Twitter,  maybe he should create his own Twitter or the Twitter, he says,  serves as the de facto public town square.  So it should support true free speech.  And maybe we should do something about that.  Car, I was funny because if you're on the left, you might have might agree with Car  when it comes to things like corporate media.  You might say, well, yeah, there's too much corporate dominance of media.  So we don't get a really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no, here's what Car is arguing.  And I find it extremely offensive.  And and white supremacist racist in the end  is that anti-discrimination laws should be applied to right wing speech.  And so I just simply said, well, no, it's a private, you know,  you used to be a Republican.  It's a private company.  And like a bar can refuse you service for any reason.  And he hated that.  And he's trying to argue that this is a matter of civil rights akin to laws  around racism to that, that he says it to the House,  that anti-discrimination laws should be should be applied to their speech.  That's just offensive.  Stupid. And it's against the First Amendment.  But hey, look at our Supreme Court.  Look where the Congress we could get soon.  Yeah, we could be there. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a little break.  Joan Donovan is here from the Shorentine Shorenstein School,  the Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University.  Always a welcome  visitor to these shores.  Jeff Jarvis also Stacey and Aunt have the week off our show today brought to you by.  Now, I've talked about mattresses before,  but I want to talk to you about something that's on top of my mattress.  It's the eight sleep pod pro cover.  And it is very cool, also very hot.  It can be either for, you know,  Lisa and I have toyed with electric blankets, electric mattress pads,  various ways of, you know, warming up the bed at night and so forth.  I used to have one of those things they have in colonial homes.  You put coals in it and you rub it between the blankets.  But that's not what this is. This is so much better.  This is a high tech answer to good sleep.  It turns out evolutionarily,  you might go to bed, the fire, you just put out the fire.  The house is still warm over the night.  The room cools down.  Your your body's tuned to that.  It cools down. And then in the morning, the sun comes out.  It warms up and you and you get up.  And this is kind of the natural sleep cycle, a cycle that we frankly don't get  anymore because we have climate controlled homes and lots of blankets.  Eight sleep is bringing that sleep cycle back.  Now, I'm not going to dictate to you how you use your eight sleep,  but I'll tell you how I have it.  And by the way, eight sleep, which is cool,  it's a cover that goes over your mattress.  It's computer controlled, internet controlled.  You have a app that you can choose temperatures and so forth.  But it also observes your sleeping, how you're restless, how you're not,  when you get up, when you go to bed and it then programs the bed.  So when I get in bed, it's nice, toasty, cozy and warm.  It slowly cools off as the night goes by and then warms up again to wake me up  around eight in the morning. And I have never slept better.  Kevin Rose was the first to tell me about this.  Amy Webb and Kevin both have the eight sleep.  And we're saying, you got to get this the best thing that ever happened.  30% of Americans struggle with sleep.  And one of the main reasons is temperature regulation.  Night sweats, we sleep too hot or we're freezing cold.  This is the solution. Eight sleeps pod pro cover.  It pairs dynamic cooling and heating.  It does both with biometric tracking.  In fact, you can even get your sleep score and all sorts of information  about how you slept from it.  You add the cover to any mattress.  Temperature range is huge.  Fifty five degrees to 110 degrees.  You can control it. Lisa.  And by the way, we have a double bed.  Lisa has her side. I have my side.  She likes to have it really warm all night long.  I like that cycle. You can control that.  Each side of the bed is adjusted based on your sleep stages, your biometrics.  It actually even tests the temperature of the bedroom  and reacts intelligently to create the optimal sleeping environment.  I know this sounds a little bit like hocus pocus, but believe me, when you do it,  you will never go back.  I'm totally hooked on this.  Eight sleep users on average fall asleep up to 32% faster.  Reduce sleep interruptions by 40%.  Overall, get a more restful night's sleep.  This is the ultimate.  In sleep, I have to tell you, they have mattresses as well.  If you want to get a mattress with the pod built in, but I have the pod pro cover.  That's the most affordable, easiest way to do this.  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you, it makes a huge difference.  We've been doing it now, I think, for about six months,  ever since Kevin told us about it.  And I've become a big fan.  Eight sleep, E I G H T spell it out, eight sleep dot com slash twig.  Check out the pod pro cover.  Read up about it.  I think you got to try it.  You can save $150 to check out, by the way.  Eight sleep currently ships within the US, Canada and the UK.  Get that $150 credit if you go to eight sleep dot com slash twig.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable. I don't know how to explain it better.  I wish I could.  It's fantastic and it's cozy.  I really like it.  Eight sleep and cool as well.  Eight sleep dot com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, eight sleep, for supporting this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just a tip, just a tip to you customers out there who buy it.  Using this thing, make sure that unlike Leo, you read the instructions for.  Oh, yes, this is the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I were talking about this when I got it.  I put it on wrong because I thought that you have the cover and then you have  there's a bottom part, you put that underneath and you know,  I should have watched it.  There's a very good video explains it.  It's very straightforward.  I wasn't paying attention.  It actually uses water in the pad.  So it's very quick when it heats up, it heats up fast.  When it cools off, it cools because water is very conductive.  So it really, you know, immediately, you know, it's it's really great.  It's really amazing.  I don't I have a hard time explaining it, but can I hit rewind for one quick second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Joan, I was thinking about in the break,  the story you told where you said, oh, finally we can.  I have no memory. I'm old, so it's just what's happening to me.  Finally, we can close that that case because we heard who had paid for it.  What was that story again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it was just like understanding, you know, where, you know, we had seen this  slap of Facebook, slap a teacher story, right?  And it was being pumped out like this was this viral TikTok challenge.  And, you know, amongst researchers were like, we don't see it.  Like we don't see it on TikTok.  There's a little bit of stuff about slap a teacher, but it's not viral like this.  And so we had kind of worried, wondered why there was media pickup of something  that hadn't really happened. And we were kind of, you know, we will half  write a bunch of case studies here and there just because we want to save that  data and we want to hold on to it.  And so what this story allowed us to connect the dots between is that there was  actually a media PR campaign behind, you know, getting people to think that TikTok  was allowing these abhorrent challenges to happen on their platform when in fact  the op ed or the letter to the editor that was written was written by this  targeted victory organization.  And did you find out who was behind it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who funded it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In this case, it was Facebook that had been funding the disinherited.  This is this is one of the Facebook cases.  This is one of the Facebook's cases.  OK, that's one of the things that was discovered.  Yeah. Yeah, no.  And yeah, and they had done this in the past in 2018 with Google and Apple.  They had placed they had paid another PR agency to place stories saying that Google  and Apple are not as privacy for it as we may think.  And really, yeah, surprise.  Facebook might not want to put it together.  Yeah, I mean, you know, I just my mind becomes a repository for all of these like  corporate shenanigans.  And it's just like the end of the day, you just realize, you know, the there can be so  many books written about this stuff.  But getting accountability for massively resourced companies is going to be impossible  without some kind of legislation that, you know, makes transparency a priority.  And but we're we're in this, you know, space where, of course, yeah, Microsoft has been  up to this stuff for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the best solution?  Just to say you have to report if you're doing a campaign like this, you have to report it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like you said, just be transparent about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you know, you don't want to outlaw it.  It's a fine line between that and that.  It's speech. It's speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's speech. Yeah, but it's also just this like we use it when we're studying this.  We look at that kind of framework as a true cost of misinformation.  So getting the Petaluma police to comment on door knocking in dormitories is a waste of  somebody's time that is getting paid.  And so we have to wonder then where did these Petaluma stories really generate from?  And if they were a target of this PR campaign and they were like, look, the doors are  getting injured.  Who knows what's going to happen next?  The puppies might die.  You know, like the cats will get out.  Who knows? Who knows what's going to happen?  Only time will tell.  Yeah. And so we often wonder with these made up stories that, you know, how do you make  someone responsible then for that if, you know, the punch a teacher challenge is causing  hysteria in a high school that has, you know, some violence and already and like teachers  get afraid of this and then it's not really even a thing.  It reminds me, too, of the Tide Pods challenge that nobody was eating Tide Pods.  Yeah. You know, and it's never where did that come from?  Where did that come from?  This it because it's that one.  I think I remember that there had been a rumor where someone said, you know, kids are eating  Tide Pods. They look like candy.  And then like people on TikTok and other social media did pretend like they were going to  about to buy it into a Tide Pod, like saying looks delicious.  Right. And and then it kind of fueled that that panic for a while.  And and, you know, poison control centers and other places were responding on social  media being like, if you do eat detergent, you know, go to your local hospital right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  away. You're just like, it's like you try to put light in your veins and drink bleach.  But all that the president. Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. This is it's called public relations.  Public relations is about spinning.  It's about spinning things in your favor and in your competitors disfavor.  And that's I don't think you want to outlaw that.  I mean, the responsibility for not using public funds for this is for the Petaluma police  to say no. When Channel 2 comes calling and says we'd like to interview you about people  kicking in doors to say no, I have I have things I need to do now and I'm not going  to do that. And for Channel 2, when they get the PR call from targeted whoever.  So say, yeah, we're not interested in that.  The problem is you get, you know, complicity all down the line.  You know, Channel Channel 2 is using I'm sure all of the, you know, they use these EPKs,  these electronic press kits from companies run these videos produced by companies all  the time without disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the problem is, is that the kids are crazy and teenagers will never listen.  Yeah. And that's a trope as old as time.  You know, and but you do have to worry like in the long run, the acceleration of these  and how many of these are we going to have to go through until is it is it foolish to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  say that rather than holding the platforms responsible.  And I know you said that we have to.  But to say that we should inoculate people and just kind of transparency is good and  then teach people look for the label that says it's made up.  I mean, shouldn't that shouldn't that be how you handle this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would love it if that was possible.  But the the way content is displayed on social media is a play of appearances.  We had a whole rash of recontextualized media, just repurposed video and JPEGs and to  say, you know, this is images from the war in Ukraine.  And it was just it was an overwhelming volume of content that had been served up very  early on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff helped me to that and said, watch the video you're seeing on MSNBC and CNN.  It comes from Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then some of them were video game simulations, that whole ghost of Kiev story.  I mean, we all like like the X-Files, we all wanted to believe that, you know, it well,  but we wanted to believe the ghost of Kiev was going to save Ukraine from Russian air  supremacy. And it was it was nuts.  You know, and it was what was circulating was a video game simulation of a fighter  pilot downing other warplanes.  And and people were sharing it as if, you know, Ukraine could mount a defense, which  we we know they couldn't.  And so the problem here is what ends up getting in the way of people's truth seeking  behaviors. And so if you're looking for truth and you're and you're saying Ukraine air  support and you're getting a bunch of like disconnected videos, some of them real,  some of them fake, whose responsibility is it then to put those labels on to make sure  that the truthful stuff comes up first and and to sort and rank like if you if you  break these platforms down to their base function, their function is to discover, rank  and represent information.  They just that's what they do.  Right. And so it's the ranking.  But it's the ranking.  Yeah. Yeah.  It's the rain. Can I ask you a question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That problem. Yeah.  Because one of my theories, I have a whole bunch of crazy theories, but, you know, at  least none of them are about the earth being flat, is that we're concentrating still  too much on the wrong end.  Now, don't take any insult to this is at the end you could concentrate on.  But is is people want to say to the platforms, play whack a mole, get rid of all the  bad stuff and everything be OK.  And instead, the job has to be as it has been since printing.  Sorry, Gutenberg moment that we need institutions to find the good stuff.  The bad stuff is always going to be there.  We can't get rid of it.  But but too much attention is paid to it because we don't have the mechanisms, I think,  to find that which is credible and relevant and and certified and so on.  And we need to invent and the institutions we have, newspapers, editors, publishers are  inadequate to the scale that we have.  And so I just think we need to kind of shift our thinking a little bit and realize that  there's always going to be stupid stuff there.  And the trick is to find that ways to ignore it better.  Does that make any sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and that's part of the discoverability ranking stuff.  If if it's if the platforms are continuously going to serve things that are outrageous  and nearly unbelievable, then that's what we're going to get.  I don't think there's a deficit of true and correct content or factual contents.  The the the issue mainly is that there's an industry behind producing disinformation or  misinformation at scale that has to be reckoned with in order to make sure that these  algorithms are not being gamed and the repeat offenders are removed from these platforms  so that they can't just keep reinventing new ways to do the same old thing.  And so I think there's a bunch of interventions that need to happen.  And and you know, the hard part is, is you have you were talking about this in the context  of America, which is, you know, anti-institutional at its core in a lot of ways.  You know, we have institutions, but the people don't love them.  And so, you know, that's why you see people who are anti-institutionalist rising up on  YouTube as these like very, you know, very well-known creators, right, because people  will engage with their content because they're like, look what Google's doing now.  They're partnering with the WHO.  This is terrible.  And you're like, well, it's better than partnering with nobody or, you know, letting the stuff  from, you know, the conspiracy theorists reign supreme.  And so I do think you're right in the sense that there needs to be better and more stable  linking on the Internet to things that have these, the things that are wedge issues, things  that, you know, kind of make people think twice about other people's humanity, right?  Racism, sexism, transphobia, you know, homophobia, religious bigotry.  And so there does need to be clear content rules that are enforced.  But I agree with you that also the institutions are going to have to  step in in a different way.  And I'd love to get you guys' opinion on the White House briefing TikTokers on how to talk  about Ukraine.  Like, did you guys follow that story?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We covered it.  And we said, yeah, that's fine.  That's appropriate.  They're thought leaders, thought makers, taste makers.  I mean, it's pretty clear the White House's main goal was to kind of feed them the line.  And I had some question about whether these people were kind of trained and journalists  enough to know that they were being spun.  But, you know, this is...  See, Maya...  They weren't trained.  No, I know.  That's the point is they didn't know.  Easy to spin.  And that's why they were there.  But also because they were very influential.  I'm kind of more laissez-faire.  I really feel like more information is good information.  We know more about what's going on because of that, for one thing.  I'm sure disinformation is as old as dirt.  But we know now more about how it spreads and stuff.  This is what you study.  But I don't think that this is necessarily a bad thing.  Do you?  I mean, do you...  So, you know, do you put a judgment on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm two minds about it.  One point is that, yeah, like there was a heavy hand in the NATO messaging, right?  So it wasn't the voices of Ukraine.  It wasn't the oppressed of Russia that were meant to be represented here.  It was very much, you know, US NATO party line here.  Which was that, you know, Ukraine is an underdog, but a strong contender for survival, right?  Which I thought was really problematic in the sense that I couldn't tell you if any  of these TikTokers actually feel that way.  And what it reminded me of is the use...  Bloomberg paid a bunch of TikTokers in the 2020 primaries to make him relevant  and to meme him into existence.  I didn't feel like any of those TikTokers or Instagrammers or whoever were going to,  you know, vote for him.  Right?  And so, you know, that's where this stuff becomes dangerous territory where you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we've had advertising, we've had coercive advertising as long as that's...  We've had campaigns.  We haven't liked it.  Yeah, but it's just another form of it.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's also this sponsored advertising, this entire industry that's not really regulated  in any way and there's no, you know, serious effort to get disclaimers out there that,  you know, this information was provided by, you know, Bloomberg or whoever or sponsored by.  Like, you know, I think there's also a difference if you're getting paid to do something versus  like the White House's good faith efforts to make young people aware about what was happening  in Ukraine.  But it's just...  It's hard to tell.  Like, we're headed down this road.  We have to start to, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we'd be mad if they ignored it.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  We get mad all the time.  We get mad about everything.  If they only briefed mainstream, you know, networks...  It's like the bloggers.  We'd like the bloggers and we'd be like...  You'd get mad about that.  So, I mean, I think this is democratizing information.  My only qualm is, as I said, that, you know, they probably were spinning them in a way that...  But, you know, that's life, you know.  That's how you learn.  Next time, they'll be wiser about getting spun.  And I think it's the White House's job to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, you know, the problem is that the too much skepticism...  And this is a Dana Boyd point, that if we teach our young people to not trust anything or anyone,  then that's where we end up here.  I just was going through Twitter because I violate the rules and I do that on the show sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm doing it too right now, so it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I saw this amazing one.  Rumor is that Pfizer, who sponsored the Oscars, needed a big moment around alopecia  because they have a drug coming to work.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a conspiracy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right.  You know, so that's the kind of stuff that people are gonna gravitate to if they want to.  But the other thing, Leo, I think is important is that survey after survey after survey  has the majority of people saying they don't trust what they read on social media.  That's really good news.  That's great news.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just called growing up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, learning what to trust, what not to trust, what to believe, what not to believe.  Choosing...  I mean, every human, one of the things every human has to do, many don't do,  is figuring out what their values are, what their core beliefs are, what they care about.  In kind of in a vacuum, having taken in all this information as they grew up,  now really thinking about it and then acting from then on according to their values  is something everybody has always had to do.  So I think more...  I don't think more information or information flooding is necessarily a bad thing.  People, it's, you know, this is just life.  You have to learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it comes down to quality and like if you...  But there's always been crap.  Yeah.  But one of the big conundrums with misinformation research is basically like...  I grew up with Gilligan's Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's always been crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, don't I know it.  But I think the moment that you're searching for something online and you're...  Is the moment where you're most susceptible to misinformation  because you're in an information seeking mode and you know that you don't know.  And that's where the companies play an incredibly important role.  Whereas, you know, maybe it was harder back in the day before, you know, internet search.  You had to go to a library to kind of figure these things out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you had your neighbors and your friends and family telling you.  And I think that this is when you go out to your peers and you say,  you know, do you think it's alopecia that became a story because Pfizer wanted to...  And then they go, what are you nuts?  And then you go, yeah, I guess that's probably not really happening.  And you say, I feel like this is a normal process that we're pathologizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think so though, because if I were to search online and because that story about alopecia  is ranked really highly because a lot of people are sharing it,  then that's a story that I probably wouldn't have run into if not by virtue of  internet ranking systems.  Or listening to this podcast.  Or listening to this podcast, but it is going to reach many more people,  especially in moments where they're seeking information.  If they were just like, well, what is alopecia anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you more vulnerable because you're seeking information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  You are.  Because you're asking, a lot of people actually ask full questions now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because now you're in the...  I think you're most vulnerable when you know the answer and you don't question it.  I think you're less vulnerable when you're saying, I want to know what the answer is.  And you're weighing facts.  That's when you're best capable of saying, let's look at the truth.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My problem is, is it's not all facts that you're weighing things against.  Well, so you throw out the troughs.  You're looking at a social media return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Joan, you would agree that there's no way to create a perfect stream of factual information.  There's always going to be misinformation.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there will always be misinformation in spaces that  have a preponderance of user generated content.  Right.  Humans are really good at it.  Yeah.  But I do think that to Jeff's point earlier, that there is a way to create streams of more  factual or public interest information that have not been explored yet.  And that aren't prioritized by these companies.  And maybe it shouldn't be the role.  And maybe you got me here, Leo, on this is maybe it's not the role of social media companies to do that.  Maybe.  Maybe they tell you that you're in a landfill of words.  Yes.  Their job is to pile it on.  Yeah.  And so, but you want to demand more from companies that are in the information space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want them to be an arbitrator of what is good and not good, what is true and not true.  But they already are.  Well, that's right.  But that's what I always convey against.  You know, when Twitter says, well, you don't really want a chronological feed, I say, no,  yes, I do.  I don't want you telling me what's important.  I don't do Facebook because I don't want them giving me information based on their values.  But I don't want them to filter out stuff.  I want them to give it all to me.  Let me be the judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You really don't want that.  Because then you're going to get the alopecia stuff right next to and equal to the New York Times,  which is what the FCC commissioner wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an old media point of view that there's somebody, the New York Times or somebody,  who should be judging and that you should trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's next to you that the alopecia stupid theory is right next to Twitter.  Fine.  You don't really want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, who do you want to say not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's in charge?  This is why we created the institutions that are now outmoded.  But, you know, in 1470, I'll be going to Gutenberg here, 1470, Niccolò Parotti said to the pope,  you got to fix this print stuff.  It's all messed up.  Right.  You got to censor it.  And what he was really asking for was an editor.  No, what he was asking for was not censorship.  What he was asking for was the institution of editing and publishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would submit, and this is kind of a change of pace for me, that all judgment is,  editorial judgment is censorship of some kind.  It's deciding what's good and what's not good.  And I don't, I want to get all, give me all the information.  Gee, who decides what stories we talk about in the rundown?  Well, no, but at a meta level, you decide what podcasts you listen to.  You decide who you want to hear talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're talking about consumer choice.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm saying, I understand that what has happened over the intervening thousands of years is  the amount and quantity of information has gotten unmanageably huge.  And everybody who encounters the internet, and I'm sensitive to it because I didn't grow up with it,  goes, whoa, there's a barrage of information.  But you quickly, but the truth is that's life.  Your sensorium is barraged even the minute you come out of the womb.  And you learn how to triage it internally using inputs from friends, neighbors, family,  mother, father, and your own judgment.  And that's up, it's on you.  And I don't want anybody telling me what I should know or not know.  I want all the information and I will decide.  I think anything else is censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but here, let's go back to the example then where definers are like a targeted victory.  The PR firm that's working on behalf of Facebook is getting ghost writers to plant  letters to the editor.  And you're just like, don't you feel like there should be some truth in this delivery?  Yes.  The answer to that is more information, not less information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So just as you said, transparency.  So I want to know, oh, Meta paid for that letter.  That will help me judge the value of that letter.  That's more information, not less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's also just this, I hear you and I don't agree that all editing is censorship  because to be honest with you, some words got to go.  I'm not saying you, yes, of course, you and I and everybody else should edit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't want to put somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't want a computer, an algorithm doing it when you're subscribed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or he doesn't even want a human being now.  You don't even want the editor of the New York Times now.  You want Dave Weiner's view of the river.  No, they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then if I choose the New York Times, I'm choosing to read their viewpoint.  It needs to be clear in my mind.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm reading a viewpoint.  If you listen to Twitter, you're listening to a viewpoint.  But I should be able to choose.  I shouldn't.  I shouldn't.  There should not be.  And this is where big tech can be gatekeepers because they control the faucets.  Open them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Open them up.  But beware, you're going to sound like car in a minute and say you are required  to carry everything.  And no, it's still my bar.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kick you out when you get.  I agree with you.  I choose to follow Twitter or even people on Twitter.  So I get the choice and Twitter gets the choice.  And if I want to go on Truth Social or Gab, I can.  And so that's the way it should be.  That's the right.  And I think that's what the First Amendment is about is that there shouldn't be some higher  authority saying you, you, you, but no, not you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the no, not you is about like griffs, scams, hoaxes.  Like, you know, so the way that this field developed around disinformation, I had been  in research about white supremacists and white supremacists using social media and other  places to raise money and to recruit new followers.  And, you know, and the entire scene of these people on social media was about hiding who  they were about using coded phrases so that, you know, it was hard for content moderators  to figure out what they were doing and planning.  And these are some of the same jokers that eventually planned Unite the Right in Charlottesville  using apps.  And so it's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wouldn't have stopped the you wouldn't have stopped the clan from marching through  Skokie, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would have.  You would have.  I would have done it with my own two hands.  I'm not a legislator.  I would have, you know, I would have put this body on the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the classic free speech.  ACLU story, though, right, is to defend the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can also protest.  Joan can show up and protest and shoot the shoot their feet and get them out of there.  Yeah.  No, you can't shoot their feet.  Well, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do not own any firearms.  But what I'm saying to you is I'm not going to have a dialogue with the KKK any day of  the week.  I know where I stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I want to be that bicyclist in Washington who was in the front of the truck of the convoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just going real slow.  Yeah.  But the thing about it is, is, you know, as you start to move between the wires and the  weeds and you go from these like online examples to these real life examples, you have to also  think about, well, what is the community that the KKK is routinely trying to march on?  They're routinely trying to march on black communities.  They're provoking fear, causing in many cases riots and chaos in their wake.  And so, you know, it's in the planning of that happens on social media.  Right.  And so I do think that there should be more more accountability for these systems and  these mechanisms of coordination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a tricky gray area.  It's tricky.  It's illegal for them to burn a cross.  It's is it illegal for them to go on Telegram and say, let's go burn a cross and who should  be responsible?  I would submit it's not really Telegram's job.  It's maybe law enforcement's job.  But but you can keep going down that government.  Well, there's a point.  But that's what I'm saying.  This is the tricky gray area where there's clearly illegal acts and and you know, that  they should be arrested for that and put in jail.  And and then there's this gray.  It gets grayer and grayers go back and back back, you know, to what they first start  talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're the owner of the Baskin Robbins, you know, and the KKK is using your business as  a place to have their Tuesday night meetings so that they can plan their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're allowed as the owner to say, get the hell out of here.  I don't like what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, then all we're asking is the owners of Facebook to be like, get the hell out of  No, it's a garden party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can.  It's a garden party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one's saying they shouldn't be able to.  I'm not saying that.  No.  Well, Chairman, the FCC Commissioner is.  But I just I agree with you, Jeff.  I disagree with him.  No one should say to any.  But that's what I'm saying.  It's not the platform's responsibility.  They can do what they want.  They should do what we as a society would like them to do.  But that's up to them.  But, you know, if you don't like it, get your bunch.  If you don't like the basket, if the Baskin Robbins owner says, good, I love it.  These guys eat a lot of ice cream.  Then I reserve the right to go and march outside and say, let's never go to this  Baskin Robbins because the KKK organizes there.  That's all of that's appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's the kind of public pressure that's been put on like Twitter, for instance.  So Twitter had blue checked a bunch of Charlottesville organizers and people were like,  why are you blue checking white supremacists over here, Twitter?  And they were like, we I don't know.  We're going to suspend all blue checks from here for a while.  And reevaluate our system.  Fair enough.  Eventually, they started removing the blue checks and that's the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just don't want Congress or the FCC to tell them what to do.  Amen.  Could I ask Joan a question here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's the that's a line we all agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there was a paper from Cambridge, Dan Williams called the Marketplace of Rationalizations  that came out this month.  And what he argues is that there's a marketplace of belief.  And then people have a belief.  They go for a rationalization.  And he said there are agents that basically sell these rationalizations.  Yeah, this is what we see happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Kahneman as well, which is we decide what we want to believe based on emotion and  then find reason to support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What it said to me was the journalism is set up, as you said a few minutes ago, Leo,  in a marketplace of facts.  When facts are insufficient and people are going to have these beliefs, and I don't I'm not buying  filter bubbles and echo chambers, but they do have beliefs.  And what they're seeking is not necessarily facts.  They're seeking a rationalization.  Help me believe in the truth.  Yeah.  Right.  So we're set up wrong.  So if we judge journalists whether or not people understand they should wear masks in a pandemic,  duh, then we become educators, propagandists.  What's our role in a belief based market rather than a fact based market?  How do we in journalism deal with managing to serve the marketplace sensibly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before Joan answers, I want to turn this on its head and say as a consumer of journalism,  I would behoove me to understand the mixed motives of a journalistic entity because  one of the clear motives is profit.  And I don't know of any journalistic entity that doesn't consider what its readers or listeners  or viewers want and to some degree or more or less pander to that.  So as a consumer of journalism, it's important to know that.  Right.  And I would say you act as a journalist, you act as you think best.  And I as a consumer of journalism are going to act as I think best.  We'll judge it.  And by the way, fascinating.  Here's a good, this is kind of a good example.  Then I'm going to let Joan talk.  Sorry, Joan.  But here's a good example.  We've been talking about masks a lot.  Somebody in the tweet community, and I love this, said, you know, Leo, there has been a study  because somebody sent me an email saying, he was actually a prisoner at Lompoc.  And he sent me, you know, saying, you know, among other things, masks don't work.  Everybody knows that they don't block the virus.  And I said, well, tell that to the surgeon next time he's operating on you.  And somebody posted this fascinating article, I think from Science, saying that actually,  that's more of a widely held belief without any scientific evidence.  That every study that they've attempted to do on this shows that in fact, masks in the surgical  theater don't necessarily do anything at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do have studies on masks and viruses transmitted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But my point, my point being is I've always used that as a retort.  Well, to tell that to your surgeon, it's not the best retort, as it turns out, given more information.  And what's great is, and I'm proud of myself because instead of rejecting that information  outright, I read it and said, oh, well, that's kind of interesting.  I might, oh, and this is the hardest thing.  I might have been wrong about that.  I think that's healthy.  That's good.  And that's because of more information and more information exchange.  All right.  If you even remember what Jeff's question was, Joan, you may get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Believe versus fact marketplaces.  Go ahead.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you know, when it comes down to the way in which people make decisions,  you know, there's been a couple of things that have been sort of thorns in the side of this  research field for a long time, which is essentially like once people adopt a political party,  it's very rare that they switch it.  And in most elections, you're talking about the shift from, you know, party to party as being  less than 5% of people.  And so people become very locked into their beliefs and then it does become a shortcut to action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's who wins elections is the swing voters, right?  Because the ones who are willing to vote against the last time they vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's huge.  Or the people who win elections are the people who vote for the candidate, right?  And, you know, it's like, but the swing elections, the idea that there is this like  middling small group of people that can make this big difference.  So deciding if you're going to be one of those people or not, of course,  is actually fairly rare compared to consistently following a party or,  and in this case, I would imagine it would also carry to a set of beliefs.  And, you know, there's not a lot of beliefs that we end up taking action on.  And, you know, of course, some of us can be more hypocritical than others, like,  you know, and so it's it, but it's hard to say, you know, in terms of a fact based market  versus a belief based market, if you have settled on something, it is very hard to  do what Leo did, which is take a step back and say,  well, do I really know how the question I ask myself all the time is, how do I know that?  And I have to, you know, I kind of have to remind myself that if I don't think about how I know  something, then I am trafficking in belief and it's more likely than not.  And so, you know, for people that are trying to think about, you know, their positions on  certain issues, and if they do have an anecdote or story that's really compelling to them,  they should ask themselves, well, how do I know that?  And then and then, Dick, and to try to figure out if if that was part of some kind of propaganda  or that was part of some PR campaign or it got to you because you were, you know,  a voter in a swing state that was being heavily targeted by marketing, you know, and so I think  it's important that we do that, especially around really hot button political issues.  Like I was reading some of the fallout around the quote unquote, don't say gay bill.  And it's a pretty nuanced bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it doesn't, by the way, it doesn't say don't say gay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it was a meme.  Yeah, it's a meme.  Yes. So we think that's what the bill was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, death panels, you fight fire with fire, you know, the romance with death  panels.  Just because they do it doesn't mean we have to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but now you got like teenagers screaming the word gay in their high school and gay people.  They did it at the Oscars.  I like that.  They did it at the Oscars.  I'm just trying to live out here, you know, and so it can like, but at the end of the day, like  we want to have conversations with representatives from communities that actually have a point of  view and are affected by the issues.  And that's what journalism is great at.  And then there are these other times when you have these PR folks or these political operatives  slide in and really cloud the field or muddy the waters with very catchy, non-nuance takes.  And so from our point of view, it's like that kind of stuff, especially when we see it happen  memetically, like something like don't say gay is like really easy to remember.  And so all nuance is gone.  I'm not defending this bill by any means, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but to be clear, the bill is, it says that you cannot, you cannot teach  content about sexual orientation or gender identity to kindergartners through third grade.  It doesn't say anything about not saying the word gay.  I understand, but you know, believe me, I understand the discussion, but I think it doesn't help  in the discussion to, to misrepresent stuff because then you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the intent is pretty much the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you get down to it, the intent of that bill was about, you know, transgender library,  you know, transgender story, drag queen story hour, right?  And, you know, and it was about young people, you know, there's a whole other moral panic  happening in preteens where a lot of teens are now opting to be called they them.  And parents are like, what?  Yeah, it's throwing her.  Is my kid gay?  Like, what is this?  How? And, you know, most parents are like, whatever, I'll call you whatever, as long as  you're not like getting, doing bad in school.  But a lot of parents are alarmed by this.  And so they, they're like, oh, they must be getting indoctrinated when they're young.  And, and, you know, I, I live through a period where you weren't allowed to talk about  being gay in high school or like, you know,  That long ago, frankly, it wasn't that long ago.  And so this kind of legislation, of course, is intensely problematic, especially if you have,  you know, kids that are asking, you know, why do I have two aunties?  And why do they live together?  And why do they only have one bedroom?  And why do they share a dog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, it's like, you know, and this is the conversation we should be having,  not don't say gay, because that doesn't, it's not actually what the bill was about.  And so now I don't want to be paternalistic.  I think that the natural thing is to say, well, we're smart enough to figure this out.  Third person effect.  Yeah, the third person effect.  And I think it's, I mean, what do you say about that?  That's paternalistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most people don't have a lot of time to figure that kind of stuff out, right?  And this is like the difference between that kind of fact based or belief based  marketplace of ideas.  If you have fact based, then people are going to, you know, when their stories  write about the legislation, and they're going to tell you what's in the legislation,  if it's more belief based, then it's, it's really a battle of good and evil.  And, you know, I personally might come down on the idea that like not being able to talk openly  with children about gender identity and LGBTQ issues is like, you know, discriminatory  and shouldn't be made into law.  But at the same time, like I'd like that debate to be or that policy to be represented  in a way in the media, especially to the people that we would count as allies in a way that  makes them sound smarter when they're talking about it, makes them sound more informed.  And it can lead to like, more constructive, potentially, you know, more constructive  policy making in the future that, you know, either eradicates this or undermines it in  some other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't know how long variety has been doing its charts on engagement on Twitter,  or the trending TV charts.  But I think it's interesting that the Academy Awards got more engagements than any TV show  since the charts began with 32.8 million engagements compared to the next the number  two on the charts for the week, Bridgerton, which was less than what's about 295,000.  I think that's information that's interesting.  I think that I have to say I was watching the Academy Awards with Twitter open and I  thought that was I almost wanted to close the lid because Twitter went crazy after  the slap heard around the world.  But I think it's also very that ended up being a really good, powerful discussion,  a valuable discussion.  Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought the discussion was all over the place.  It was.  Yeah, as it should be.  I couldn't figure out how people were going to come down on it.  I even was was texting with my dear old mom and she was like,  Well, you know, I always thought good about Will Smith, but if he's willing to do that  in public, imagine how he treats his family and staff.  I was like, well, that's that's not that's a nuanced point.  See, I hadn't thought about is that great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, more information.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I was just Yeah, I mean, I was I was astounded that it happens.  And then also just, you know, the way in which you saw it spun in different circles around  like red feed, blue feed, it was just, you know, you could really tell, like in some  instances, there was just blatant racism that were just like, I think there were jokes from  the right that was like about black on black crime.  And, you know, this is quote unquote thuggish behavior, which is code for the N word.  And so it was yeah.  And so it was like it was not good on in that sense of the word.  And then on top of it, on the left, you have this sort of mealy-moused approach of like,  you know, like, you know, the echoes of the should you punch a Nazi debate that played  out on Twitter.  And like people were saying, well, you know, sometimes people just need to get smacked.  And I'm just like, I just don't think that that's either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in though, in the final analysis, having had that national discussion was better than  each person going home alone to think about it.  Oh, good point.  All by themselves.  Yeah.  Because it brought out nuances.  It brought out all that nuance.  Yeah.  In fact, I loved what your mom said.  I think that's to me, that's the benefit of something of a centralized information place  like Twitter.  Go ahead.  Sorry, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's also about white Twitter and black Twitter.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you can do all the tribalism and all that too.  No, no, no, no, no.  And that's interesting information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let me give you an example.  So I can't find it now, but there was a chart today.  Somebody did an analysis of Twitter of which states were pro rock or pro Smith.  And a black Twitter expert came in and said, they don't understand the language of black  Twitter.  So they're counting some people here and some people there because they just don't  understand because it's done by the people who don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a great opportunity to learn the language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  But it's also a case where, you know, I've talked about Andre Brock Jr.  on this show before who wrote distributed blackness.  And he kind of says at some point, we don't need or want you in our Twitter.  You had you've had all the media.  Well, you got all of this stuff.  Let us have ours for God sakes and stay out.  Can I follow you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't look at I don't tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to get in any conversations on Twitter.  But I like to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I do, too.  I do that.  But there's times when, you know, I've seen people on black Twitter say that they really  don't want to be watched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so maybe I don't do it on Twitter then or, you know, do it on Trump social.  Nobody will be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nonetheless, my point is only that there were also racial nuances beyond the racism.  There were nuances about black women in hair, about black men, about lots of things that  people felt they could comment on.  And maybe they weren't the best to comment.  And maybe it was better to sit back and watch and learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fine, too.  I welcome reading that as well.  I feel like we're better off with all of that information flowing through our heads.  If and boy, you really that was perfect, Joan, you continually remind yourself of  why do I believe what I believe?  Why know this?  Yeah.  Why do I know this?  Where is this coming from?  And are open to additional information.  Then the opportunity is fantastic.  It's fantastic.  We've never had a better opportunity for understanding each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and you know, sometimes I think about it and I'm like, okay, here we have  this problem of social media.  And we also read this, you know, it starts to arise right at the same exact time that  a movement like Black Lives Matter starts to make a big difference in the world.  And it's in Black Lives Matter is using a lot of social apps and connectivity in order  to drive, you know, change about police policies, you know, and really is able to activate on  it on a, you know, within hours, major networks of people and and change public conversation  if there's some kind of crisis happening at the exact same time that that starts to happen.  You start to get all this worry about social media being probably bad for the world.  But then what you start to look at when you realize, okay, well, what are people saying  is bad about social media?  It's not Leo that people are saying, oh, my God, it's so great that we're all connected  and we can see so many more opinions and we can have so much more discussion.  That's not the problem.  For me, the problem is when Russia pretends to be Black Lives Matter and intentionally  inflames the conversation and uses the affordances of these tech platforms to do it, to impersonate  certain social movements and certain groups of people and not just Russia.  But now it's, you know, it's it's kind of like the imposterness of of these fake accounts that  represent people that they don't actually know or are willing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm willing to say that's a problem.  Yeah, I'm willing to say Twitter, there should be a law.  Twitter should ban inauthentic accounts or something.  I mean, I'm not against that idea.  Twitter can kill all the bots at once.  Bots do not add the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not just bots.  It's like, yeah, in the inauthentic accounts, when you go back and you look sort of historically  when people were first starting to toy around with the notion of impersonating a whole community.  So beyond just one or two accounts, we're talking hundreds of accounts at a time pretending to be  Black people online.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so that's why the stakes here, I think, are actually, for me and you, are so important  where we want to be able to preserve a lot of that conversation, a lot of that...  If it's genuine.  You know, genuine conversation where society is moving towards more pro-social goals,  more democratic goals.  Let's go there.  It's the bad actors or politicians, you know, like PR or political operatives disguised as  journalists.  These are the people that are really making a mess of these platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would submit that one of the most important skills you have, and certainly I have,  is to detect inauthenticity, to have a really good radar for BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Except for when it comes to Bitcoin.  I'll believe anything about those jerks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's something everybody should work on.  I mean, that's a great thing.  Whether it's spam coming in saying, click this link to win a prize, or a Russian saying,  let's kill Whitey.  You should really work on that.  That's a good thing to have, is that inauthenticity radar.  Let's take...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that can be taught, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so, and I think we should.  I think these are the things we should work on.  I'm not the one that says, oh, you got to teach critical thinking in school.  It's much more difficult than that.  But I think we should work on really improving...  To understand the opportunity that all this flood of information provides,  and improving our ways personally of dealing with it.  I mean, maybe that's because that's what I've embarked on for the last 20 years of my life.  In this job, I read a fantastic amount of news constantly.  As I'm sure you do, Joan, and I know you do, Jeff.  Constant inputs.  And then really trying to use it, to massage it so that it's of value to me.  That's my job.  And then I can spout it out to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you offer that to your audience as well.  That's what I do.  That's what I consider my job, yeah.  So you are acting as that institution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But also, I would absolutely think that if anybody does...  It always baffles me that people will send me notes saying,  you shouldn't say that.  Why do you think that?  It's like, all you do is turn it off.  There's a button.  Press the stop button and go to another podcast.  That's what I like.  There's an infinitude of choice.  And maybe open yourself up to hearing things you don't want to hear  or don't like or you disagree with just in case.  Anyway, I don't know.  I don't know how I got all Pollyanna on this because it's terrible.  It's a horrible world and we've got to fix it.  You know what I believe in?  I'll tell you what I do believe in.  Getting rid of single-use plastics.  Bad.  Bad.  Let's not fill the ocean with bottles that we only use once.  And let's not deplete the ocean by shipping water coast to coast  when a little tablet will do.  I'm talking about Blue Land.  I am a Blue Land fan.  Did you know that an estimated five billion with a B,  plastic, hand soap, and cleaning bottles are thrown away each year?  Almost all of them used once.  And if that's not bad enough, the liquids in these things are 90% water  being shipped around, being stored.  It just doesn't make sense.  It's bad for the planet.  It's bad for your pocketbook.  It's bad for you.  You can stop wasting water.  Stop throwing out plastic with Blue Land's revolutionary refill cleaning system instead.  I'm a Blue Land fan.  Around the house, we've got Blue Land hand soap dispensers.  I love it.  They're made of beautiful solid.  They call it Instagrammable.  They're really heavy glass, beautiful glass bottles with a pump on it.  And then when it runs low, there's these little tablets.  They send me.  I put them in, add warm water, my water, instead of shipping it across country,  and it makes a fantastic hand cleaner, which I have at every sink in the house.  And by the way, I probably got too many of them during Christmas.  I bought a bunch of Blue Land Christmas scents.  So I smell like gingerbread every night when I go to bed.  But I don't think that's a bad thing.  I really don't.  Powder dish soap.  It's a great dish soap.  It works really well.  It's got baking soda in it as well as detergents.  It cleans like crazy.  They've got cleaners for the bathroom, cleaners for the kitchen.  Incredible scents.  Not just gingerbread.  Iris, agave, parrhyme, lemon, lavender, eucalyptus.  And they have, I can go on and on.  The toilet, this actually, they sell out of these.  The Blue Land toilet tablet cleaner.  It's just a tablet, like a little fizzy.  You throw in the toilet and you walk away, go do some other chores.  Five minutes later, you scrub it out, you're done.  It is fantastic.  It works so well.  No waste.  No plastic at all.  It comes with a little paper packet.  They've got hand, get the hand soap duo or the clean essentials.  This is a great housewarming gift.  Great for yourself.  Plastic free.  We use their laundry and dishwasher tablets.  By the way, I did an experiment.  We had the Tide Pods.  We had the Calgon Pods.  We said, okay, today, this week, we're only going to use the Blue Land Pods.  This was some time ago.  Better, worked better.  Loved it, smelled great.  Everything was clean.  No more Calgon.  No more, or whatever those are called.  Is it Calgon?  What are those?  The dishwasher pods.  No more Tide Pods.  Cascade.  Calgon's the bath beads.  Cascade, that's it.  I love this stuff.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.  It's good for the environment.  It's good for you.  You buy the bottle once.  You refill it forever.  That's it on plastic waste.  Eco-friendly products do not work less well.  These work better.  So don't forget that notion that, oh, yeah, I'm going to get an eco-friendly detergent  and I'm going to walk around with dirty clothes.  No.  Less expensive, more effective.  What could possibly be wrong?  Look at it.  Blue Land's stunning, high quality forever bottle.  Started just $10.  I say buy the kit.  Get the whole kit and caboodle.  Just Blue Land your house.  I did that.  And now I'm giving it to everybody I know.  We're just giving them Blue Land because everybody should be using this.  Money saving refill tablets started $2.  And there's no plastics.  Once you buy that bottle, it lasts forever and they're beautiful.  By the way, they look actually better without all that advertising and stuff on it.  Try Blue Land today.  You'll love it.  The planet will thank you.  You'll thank you.  You'll be glad.  Get 20% off your first order.  So make it a big one.  BlueLand.com slash twig.  20% off your first order of any Blue Land products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We use all the Blue Land products.  All of them.  I'm sorry.  I get excited.  But I feel good about this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think this is fine.  Eric Schmidt apparently is basically endowing President Biden's science office.  Is this influence peddling or just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want more money out of the billionaires and he gives them some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Schmidt's foundation helped cover official salaries.  There's ethical flags raised.  I don't think there was a quid pro quo.  It's the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.  Many of the people in there come from Google or have worked with Schmidt.  It's a 140-person office according to Politico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If he had too much influence on who gets paid, that's an issue.  But paying is not-  It depends on how it was run in the administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's from Eric Schmidt's charity arms, Schmidt Futures.  They paid the salaries of two science office employees,  including for six weeks that of the current chief of staff,  who's now one of the most senior officials in the office.  It's appropriate to look into it, but I think-  God bless you, Eric Schmidt.  Thank you.  Science, nothing wrong with it.  We need more information in the White House and government.  Yes or am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So AI policy though, right?  We got to wonder where Schmidt's interests are and what parts of the  government he's going to fund and what kinds of things that he wants to see  greased as the saying goes.  There's an issue.  Beyond Schmidt, there's a revolving door between tech companies and governments.  Every time there's a turnover of president, we see people go into these companies and go  back into government.  There's nowhere else to watch that happen more closely than at the Kennedy School where  half the faculty disappear anytime a Democrat gets elected.  And you're just out here being like, we were supposed to have lunch.  They're like, I'm moving to DC.  You kind of get a mind for what's happening here.  With Schmidt, there's been a lot of debate about AI weapons and the future of AI weapons  and where that's all going to go.  We do know that one of his interests is in national security policy and artificial  intelligence.  While I don't think that this is enough pay to play to really make any kind of dent,  a couple of employees, you do have to ask yourself why this particular agency and not  another one and then also who was the one that approached him for the funding and under  what auspices.  I wish there was way more transparency and clarity in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a statement on the Schmidt Futures website which says the US government and the  Office of Science and Technology Policy have used pooled philanthropic funding to ensure  staffing across the agencies for 25 years.  So this is not new.  They said, hey, we're disappointed by the reporting.  We have great respect for the media and for the journalists who report stories, even those  with which we may disagree.  But we believe there's no, it's an unsubstantiated claim that we had any influence.  We don't.  We're just funding it.  The best way to fund all this stuff, to tax billionaires appropriately.  And then you can fund a lot more.  So it shouldn't be voluntary giving.  I'm with you in that regard and it should definitely not be used for lobbying.  It's a shame that we have to have a bake sale to keep the government's Office of Technology  and Science Policy alive.  So maybe just tax some of these guys a little bit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I should also mention that the current head of OSTP is a longtime mentor of mine,  Alondra Hansen, and someone who I deeply, deeply admire and respect and I've read all her books.  She's a sociologist, so she's one of my type of people, and very acutely aware of the role  that philanthropy, she was head of the Social Science Research Council prior to this appointment  so she's acutely aware of the influence of philanthropy on policy and on research.  As a buttress to that, I'm also very happy that Alondra is, or I should say Dr. Nelson,  is in the position that she is in because I do know that when she's involved in big projects and  getting the work done, it's always done with an eye towards the research and not influence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean if I had billions, I don't know what Eric's wealth is, is something like 20 billion.  If I had billions of dollars, I probably would want to donate a considerable amount of it towards  science policy. That's a good area.  But at the same time, maybe we just tax him instead and then he doesn't get any say in  where the money goes or in the policies that are generated. It's appropriate for Politico to raise  the questions. I don't feel like there's any evidence of, it's not an open lobbying effort,  which Schmidt also engaged in when he was CEO of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean billionaires get a billionaire, right? People with money are going to buy influence,  they're going to, but they're going to have, the thing about philanthropy that I've, and Jeff  knows this very well too, is that philanthropists have different motivations. Every one of them  is very unique and the best case scenario, and there's sometimes strings and sometimes they're  written down, which is nice. One of the big benefits of being at Harvard is it's really  hard for anybody to lean on me for a little extra work because I'm like, well, we have a contract.  So look at that. But when it comes to this kind of giving and when people are  making decisions between do I fund outside research, do I fund government research,  do I fund this, that there are concerns about them really trying to fund or supercharge things that  mean a lot to them. And as a result, yeah, you do see deficits that appear in other areas because  philanthropy, we get so used to philanthropy that we don't have mechanisms anymore for relying on  our own institutions to make up those gaps. And governments and academia are ones that  unfortunately have started to really lean on philanthropy for those, you know, the missing  resources. And that comes a lot of, it comes with a lot of conversations. And then you have other  funders that are like, I'm going to send you money and like you might never hear from me again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and that's fine too. And there's also, let's face it, government funding also carries strings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, but Jones is right, there's good funders. Craig, Craig, Craig Newmark is a great funder  because he really leaves, it's clear that you have freedom to do that. And there's other funders who  don't so much. I've been lucky. I haven't had that, but it can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's why we don't take money from corporations or we don't take money or data from  any of the big platform companies. Like I shouldn't say corporations because if Delta was over here  being like, Joan, we want to fund your research and be like, great, there's no conflict of interest  here. And if you know any air conditioner companies that want to fund disinfo research, I'm looking.  But when it comes to creating conflicts of interest with platforms or someone like Schmidt,  who was in the tech industry and has a lot of vested interests in the tech industry,  moving beyond this moment of AI scrutiny, that's when we have to be a little wary is,  like if he made his money and, but if he made his money, like, making ambulances and like,  he was just that guy that's like, well, that's the guy that made his money building ambulances.  And then you wouldn't question if he was funding OSTP or not, right? Because it just wouldn't,  it wouldn't really matter. So yeah, so that's why it raises my concern level a little bit,  but that's tempered by knowing who's at OSTP. But this can bear, you'd agree that there's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at places like yours in Columbia and Yale that have big endowments,  that's one way to look at the world. And then when you're a public university,  it's being starved by the day. It's another way to look at the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I don't get any money from any of these endowments. Those are building,  those are for building buildings and like making the, making the handles on the door,  the door shiny, right? Like the doorknobs are all gold at Harvard. And I'm just like,  how do they get so shiny? Right? I know, right? And that's where the poverty of research is  actually something that like I've been very interested in because you're right about  public universities even more, more so being in a position of starving the beast and,  and being unable to raise because there's just not a lot of infrastructural support for them to do  their work anyway. But I was a child of UC San Diego and UCLA. And so no stranger to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  problem as well. Waymo's going fully driverless. Somebody said, I just imagine there's a ghost  driving the car in San Francisco. They will, you will be able to hail a Waymo. This is the Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  self-driving. Can I cancel that? How do we get that to stop? I don't want to go to San Francisco.  Zombie cars. No, no, I don't know. I'm going to be like the first person that's taken out by a  zombie car. Cause I step out from behind a trash can or something. Zombie cars in San Francisco.  Leo, you remember Christine? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Steven King wrote about this. She was a mean car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Haunted haunted car. They don't, the good news is they don't let them drive downtown.  Nobody can drive. No, well, no, they, no, they just only can go out in the avenues where it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  very nice and orderly. So, uh, this sounds so dangerous. Why not pay like a 12 year old

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to drive a golf cart? Probably safer. Who goes from one place to another in the Richmond?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Waymo provided in November through January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a high volume business. Uh, 1503 rides in, uh, that six month or three months period,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  four months period. Doesn't it feel like being on a roller coaster? Can you imagine sitting in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  backseat? I think it's not that exciting. I think they're actually very slow and patient.  They wait a lot. Okay. Yeah. I think I just, I, it just, I wouldn't get in. I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not, it makes me nervous. Makes me nervous. How do I know that though? I know that because I  watched a Stephen King movie and read it. That's the first culture west at reference. I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, let's see, let's do the change log with John. Play those, uh, play those instruments  that you have next to you right there. The Google change log. Very nice. It's getting better at the  timpani. You like that? That role? That's good. John is so talented. So talented. Google docs,  getting more Markdown support. Woo. Woo. Uh, Google is, uh, gonna let you, I don't know,  do bullets with an asterisk and I like Markdown, but I don't know if this is going to be a huge,  huge, there's no admin control for this feature. The feature is off by default, but you can enable  it going to tools, preferences, turn on Markdown. Okay. You wanted the change log. You got the change  log. Create externally friendly booking pages with appointment scheduling. Google calendar.  Don't, isn't that externally friendly?  I don't, I don't, I, uh, okay. Look how pretty that looks. That's great.  Going in for Callendly. Yeah. Actually Lisa just signed up from Callendly. Everybody uses it.  Everybody. So I screw it up all the time. Do you, do you have an account or she's trying to say  she has to pay for an account or not? Yeah, no, I'm not doing that. No, I'm, I'm, I play hard to get  for meetings. Yeah, she has, she does a lot of meetings and what Callendly does and what this  will do, I guess, uh, is help you two parties or multiple parties figure out a mutual time  for a meeting or an event or a hangout or whatever. And I think that that's a  very much needed in business because people are busy. So look for that new feature in Google  calendar nest hub UI is getting redesigned. Um, be careful this. I have one of these.  You might note a boot loop on yours. Some displays are getting, uh, getting into us,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  into a boot loop stuck. Um, I don't know if let's see if there's a way to fix this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some nest hub owners today are waking up to a UI redesign. Although the update looks to have  boot looped the assistant smart display for others is nine to five Google. What do you  have the nest hub do anymore? Oh, I use it all the time. You really do. Oh yeah. Well, it's by my,  well, I have them in every room. So, uh, so I will say, uh, hey, you know who turn off the lights or  turn on the lights. Cause we have some nest hue lights or not nested by he likes it will announce  when there's somebody at the door, they're supposed to say, Jeff Jarvis is at the front door. So I  can pretend no one's home, but instead it just says someone's at the front door. So, but at least  I don't miss people at the front door. And then you get a picture on it of the person standing  there at the front door. Uh, what else does it do? I use it for alarms. I have it. Sometimes I have  it play me a particular song to wake me up, which is nice. Timers. Of course, everybody loves timers.  You know what I love about it? I can watch, uh, cause I am a YouTube TV subscriber when,  when like the hearings are going on, uh, for Katanji, I, uh, I was, I could say, hey, YouTube,  or I'd say, Hey, play CNN on YouTube TV. And then it would put the video in the audio.  It just did a little screen in the background. That's very handy. There's lots of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's lots of stuff. I like it. Line is a very expensive clock. Well, that's the thing. You've

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  got to kind of force yourself to, uh, to use it. There's a new magic wand button on the Google  Gboard keyboard that will let you emojify what you're typing.  So type the emoji, Fai key to add emojis within a sentence or replace all text with emojis. See the  magic sparkle wand. Oh God, I'm going to do that accidentally. Yeah. And then you send a completely  unintelligible emoji laden message. I think that's cool. It inserts emojis that are relevant to your  message. We'll see. We'll just see. I, you know, the kids are so good about just getting the emojis  in there. I bet you Jones real good. Do you use emojis? I invented an emoji. Did I tell you this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The beaver. I'm the beaver emoji. That's, that's me and a few other folks who are co-creators and  it was a very strange process, but here we are. I made an emoji and it's in everybody's telephone,  the beaver. So is this in your Wikipedia profile? It's in, funny enough, it's on my Twitter bio,  but I don't, I never like, you know, I don't know anybody that edits my Wikipedia. So it's like,  I need someone to go in there and add it, you know? So Jeff Jarvis, why don't you go in and get me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  get me some respect of the beaver emoji. And from now on, when I tell Gboard beaver, beaver, beaver,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's going to put your beaver in there. It is, it is. I'm excited. With all that implies. Okay.  You know, people don't know that I'm like, I'm like a crazy joker. Like I love, like I love a good  prank. I like, I love all the double things. You were well aware of the double entendre. Okay. Oh yeah.  I was here for this. Like I was like, this emoji is made for me. And so, yeah, so I just think it's  hilarious. I want to make like really fancy polos with it, with the little beaver emoji on the side,  you know, like the old, the alligator or polo shirts and, you know, and get people to wear them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think some PJs with it all around would be nice too. Yeah. Yeah. That would be it too. If I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like an entrepreneur, like if I really had my stuff together, you'd be making the buttons now.  Yeah, I know I'd be doing it. I'd be all over this stuff, but unfortunately I've got this like  job that just doesn't let me go to bed. And so, but if I were in the merch game,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the beaver emoji would be on everything. Google Chrome version 100 came out with a bunch of fixes,  fireworks. Yeah. For zero days and stuff. Also a new redesign for the launcher rolling out to  Chromebooks. Jeff, you should look for this floating pane at the left that doesn't take  up your entire screen so you have more space. So it's kind of more like these menus you see on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  windows and other operating systems. It's change? I don't know if I like change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I know. Voice dictation will support edit commands. That's really great. So you can say  delete, which will delete the last letter. You can say move to next character, which moves the  cursor along. You could say help. So play with some of those commands and let us know how you  like those. I added a few things in there. A return to the office. I have a feeling you added  this one. Is a pain in the ass. Google is eliminating the bidets in their bathrooms much  to the dismay of employees. They had those Toto toilets, but it turns out they're not in compliance  with California state code for commercial buildings. California is no fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's weird. One of the reasons evidently is they're going to go to  recycled water and you don't want that being shot up. Oh no no no no no no no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When an employee challenged the bidet removal decision citing environmental and hygienic  benefits of bidets facilities professional, Edgar Tovar responded Google's not going to  replace the bidet. The bidet seat removal has the added benefit of supporting Google's water

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sustainable commitments. Recycled water systems which don't work well in bidets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Once you get used to these heated seats and the little squirt of water to clean your beavers.  Yeah, you don't want to go back. You don't want to go back. Google Docs can write your meta  descriptions. You can, but this is kind of interesting. Well, I don't know how long you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  could use this for your papers to do the abstract. Oh, it would be if it was written at a, you know,  I like a sixth grade reading level. No, come on, Jeff. Come on. Come on. I'm least obscure.  Not mine. Of course. Of course. Oh, no, no, no. I'll tell you, I can imagine students using this  and it creating lots of hilarious mistakes. And so I bring this on with pleasure. Like,

Transcript:  let's get this done. Danny Goodwin writing in search engine land gave some examples. And actually,  these are pretty good. So Danny took this article, Facebook warns publishers to avoid  watch bait tactics. These tactics will result in fewer recommendations. He took it, ran it through  the Google synopsisr. And Google said this article is about how to avoid watch bait in your videos.  It's important to know what Facebook considers watch bait and what you should do to avoid it.  Little tautological, but circular. Yeah. Yeah. The second one was better. TikTok testing search ads.  And Google summer size synopsize that with this is a big deal. TikTok is testing search ads.

So it threw a napkin onto it with a plastic toy shovel sandbox shovel. Now  it's feeding him a bowl of soup, um, by opening a book, which is kind of interesting. And then  he's got a little rubber hand with a napkin on it and a hairdryer that's going to get that.  This is my favorite one. It blows salad into his mouth as it goes by, as it goes by. It's actually  quite well designed. Notice he's got these little structures that go up and down to let things come  in here. Uh, okay. Now, uh, I don't know what is, Oh, I don't know what that was. That a zucchini,  something got fired into his mouth. This is one of my favorite parts. Here comes corn in the cob.  He's got a little toy truck rolled in the butter, rolled in the butter and then it's feeding it to  spinning around. But the best is yet to come dessert dessert. He, by the way, he's got to chew  mighty fast because this conveyor belt, it's like working for a Ford in the 1920s. It moves fast.  Oh, slicing up. Uh, what is that? I don't, this is, I don't know what this is. It's got sliced up  and now he's little pieces of something.  This guy's going to die. This looks dangerous. The best is yet to come. Oh my God. More napkins.  At least he's keeping his mouth clean. What are you making me watch? And now Joan, this is what  the kids are doing. This is an eclair. This is a grown man. This is not a child. It's a grown ass  man getting the views on the entire eclair with a caboose. Now he puts his glasses on. How did he  even enjoy that? He didn't. And he's reading his newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's from the New Republic because oil drilling isn't destructive enough. ExxonMobil is getting  into Bitcoin mining to cryptocurrency climate and Russia's invasion of Ukraine starting to intersect  in strange ways. It's right outside the Bakken shale formation in North Dakota. I'm thinking they  have a lot of excess natural gas and then just instead of burning it, which is not a very good  thing to do, they're going to burn it and make Bitcoin, which is not much better. Nope. Come to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  think of it. So what you're telling me is this money, which is made out of computers, is like  worth something in this world? I can't wrap my head around it. I also can't wrap my head around  how a piece of paper that is green and has dead presidents on it is also- Well, that's the same  exact thing. Yeah. It's exactly the same thing. There's some kind of magic happening here,  but also like at least I can hold money in my hands. No, you go down to Times Square,  there's a guy who will sell you Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have tangibles. You need tangibles. Yeah, it's tangible. Our show today brought you- Actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is relevant by OurCrowd, which is a venture capital firm that decided to open the gates,  let you peek inside and get involved if you want to. All around the world, they're amazing tech  companies doing incredible things, driving returns for investors. But you might say,  well, but yeah, but you got to be a billionaire to do it. Nope. Nope. From personalized medicine to  cybersecurity to higher education, where students sacrifice $3.8 billion in earnings every year by  dropping out, OurCrowd is identifying innovators to want to make the world a better place and that  you can invest in. And you can invest in when the potential growth is the greatest, not after  everybody knows about them, not after the IPO, no before the exit when they're just getting started.  OurCrowd is the fastest growing venture capital investment community. You do have to be an  accredited investor to do this, and that's for your protection. They don't want you  betting the rent money. So what you should do right now is go to ourcrowd.com slash twig,  and you tell them what country you're in, and then you'll see what the requirements are in  that country. It's different in every country to be what they call an accredited investor.  OurCrowd's accredited investors have already invested over a billion dollars in growing  tech companies. 21 of their portfolio companies are unicorns, 40 IPOs or exit sales of portfolio  companies have met some nice returns for investors. Now you can do it a couple of different  ways. They have a fund. Actually, they have several funds. You could put in those for as  little as $50,000. You could participate in single company deals for $10,000. So that's the minimum  that you'll need to invest. This is all again, this shouldn't be your first thing that you do to grow  your wealth. This should be something after you've done all the other things and you want to just try  a little bit of venture investing. Investment terms will vary depending on where you invest. So  do go to the site, input the country you're investing from. But we were talking about education.  In fact, it's right at the top there, John, on the website, you can invest in something called  EduNav, whose patented technology uses machine learning and combinatorial algorithms to guide  students along the optimal path to graduation. EduNav is already in use by 20 colleges and  universities. In fact, one college doubled their graduation rate thanks to it. And you can invest  in it today, early stage at OurCrowd. It's just an example of the kinds of deals OurCrowd brings  their accredited investors. Now here's the beauty part, cost you nothing to join. Invest in EduNav  at ourcrowd.com slash twig. That's O-U-R-C-R-O-W-D ourcrowd.com slash twig. By the way,  you can join for free. Get all this information. It's fascinating. Invest if and when you're ready  at O-U-R-C-R-O-W-D.com slash twig. OurCrowd. Join the fastest growing venture capital investment  community, ourcrowd.com slash twig. Thank you, OurCrowd, for supporting this week in Google.  I like this because it democratizes deal flow, something that normally normal people just don't  get access to. You have to be in the know. You have to be on Sand Hill Road to know about these  early stage companies. Of course, there are risks involved. Absolutely read all about it at the  website. But I think it's a very interesting way to invest that extra that you might have.  ourcrowd.com slash twig. We thank you so much for supporting this week in Google.  So Joan, you were very generous. You gave away your pick of the week earlier. Do you have something  to replace it or do you want to recuse yourself? You can skip. You can skip. No, I want to just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to mention the correct title of the book, which is Off the Edge, Flat Earthers,  Conspiracy Culture, and Why People Will Believe Anything. And Kelly Wheel is a reporter at the  Daily Beast, has been someone that has been on the conspiracy beat, the internet beat, as well as the  white supremacy beat for many, many years. And so when she told me a while back that she was  going to write a book on Flat Earth, I just thought, this is going to be a wild ride.  This is for you.  It is. Yeah, it was like, I felt like she wrote a book for me. I was like, this is great. This is  stuff I want to know about, but I don't have time to look into. And it really is, she treats people  with respect, but she is very skeptical. She never shows up to these conferences with Flat  Earthers pretending to believe, which is good. And I think that people really enjoy the book.  So I just want to make sure I got the title right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Flat Earthers, Conspiracy Culture, and Why People Will Believe Anything, certainly worth knowing.  Kelly Weil, W-E-I-L-L, Off the Edge is the name of the book, Off the Edge. I have had it on my wish  list for some time on Audible, and I was kind of on the fence, so now I will buy it.  Get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely great.  Especially if you have a car trip, getting the copy.  It's engaging, that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, do you have a number?  I do. I'm going to save one of these. I'm going to try to test it out before next week's show,  so I'll give you this one instead. Netflix just did a little celebratory post that five years ago,  they came up with the skip intro button.  They invented that, huh?  They did. They found that 15% of the time, members were manually advancing the series  within the first five minutes. So that told them people didn't want the intro and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just the theme song and the who's in this and all that.  The credits and things mothers are proud of.  I always watch it, the first episode, and there's some I love. Severance has an amazing open.  And then the next time I skip it because I want to get right to the...  I also skipped the previously. I skipped that too. Go right to the meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in the net in five years, the button has been pressed 136 million times,  saving members an astonishing 195 years in cumulative time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See? It's a little thing.  Technology.  It makes a big difference.  Everybody does it now, right? In fact, I get mad when I don't have a skip intro button.  It makes me mad. I want to get right to the show.  Should I give you a book you want too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you remember when you had to wait till like Tuesday at nine o'clock?  Can you even imagine?  But the one thing I miss, all this net culture, all this instant access,  I don't browse nothing no more. And I really miss that.  I used to love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't even know how to browse.  Browsing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Magazines were a browsable medium, right? And then the internet came along,  filled browsing, and then everybody abandoned browsing and we're now left with...  And stores? I used to go to bookstores, record stores to browse.  That's all gone. Browsing is dead.  I guess...  Yeah.  I guess though...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The irony, of course, is they call them browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I go to like a Hacker News or something, that's in a way it's browsing.  It's a collection of links. It's kind of like browsing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Joan, I think at the beginning, we did browse.  The very, very beginning, we'd go through all these rat holes.  Look, I spent all time following links.  Yeah.  Which is exactly where your entire specialty started.  But nobody links out anymore.  That's where the trouble came.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It drives me crazy.  You'll see, you'll be reading The Verge or something and there's a link that says  Bitcoin. You click it, it's just another Verge article.  That's not browsing. That's staying at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll tell you though, people do record shop these days.  My friend runs a record store up in Gloucester, Massachusetts.  And they're doing better than ever.  In the pandemic, put a little dent in the business.  But people do want material now.  And I often wonder, how are you going to know?  You go to somebody's house and you're looking around at their place and they  got no DVDs, they got no records, they got no CDs.  How do you know that they're normal?  How do you know who they are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you look at to figure out?  What do you look at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vinyl record sales were at their highest last year in 30 years.  Huge comeback.  23% of all albums bought were on vinyl, not CD.  Do you want to know what the number one vinyl album was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was ABBA's comeback record.  Okay, there we go.  And there they are, ABBA.  They're back, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the other day I was listening to a CD that I had made into MP3s when I was way younger,  maybe 20 years ago at this point, and there was a skip in the CD and I hadn't listened to these  MP3s in forever.  And there's a skip in the MP3 and I couldn't believe it.  In my mind, I was like, and then I remembered.  How is that impossible?  I was one of those people that would throw the CDs around the car.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember when CDs first came out, I was working on a radio station.  Our program director said, these are indestructible and threw them across the table and they all  scratched.
