It's time for Twig This Week in Google, the show where we cover the latest news from the Googleverse  with Mr. Jeffrey T. Jarvis,  BuzzMachine.com. I added a T just because it seems like you need a middle initial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would the T stand for in your mind?  Terrible, rude person.  Jim Acosta. That's Jim Terrible Acosta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jim Terrible Acosta.  Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York at the Tionite Center and is a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So confused.  I have a piece of paper somewhere with all of that.  Anyway, great to have you. BuzzMachine.com at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.  We also have Stacey Higginbotham in the house.  She's at stacey on iot.com at Giga Stacey on the Twitter.  Did you get up this morning and watch the Samsung Developers Conference keynote, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did not get up this morning to watch that.  However, I did.  I did. I did see the news.  Are you? Do we want to go into that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I can. There's a foldable phone.  That's what I was watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it looked really cool in the demos, but then someone was tweeting how with the lights on you can clearly see the line of demarcation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The guy who was demonstrating it said this is not what it looks like.  This is it. We've hidden it inside a case.  This is normal practice with a new phone. Apple does it too.  They hide them inside of kind of industrial generic cases.  So you can't see the details.  But what he is showing is a phone that has a screen on the front looks kind of like a thick normal phone.  Again, we don't know how thick is the case.  And then he opens it up and it's got one screen that has unfolded without any perceptible, you know, line down the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, yeah, in the in the other video with the lights on, you see the line down the middle.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did. They demoed it in the dark.  Oh, that's a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a tweet from someone in the tech press who saw it the night before during the rehearsal run through.  But I did not like it.  So it's possible I will never see it again.  Yeah. So I was paying attention to some of the smart things stuff because, you know, IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's when I thought of you is during during the IOT presentation.  They didn't mention security at all.  Well, they mentioned interoperability.  That seemed to be a key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is a different interoperability than they had pitched.  So I've been watching Samsung do this for.  Let's see. 2014, 2014, maybe it was or 2013 when Samsung's Oh, who was it?  Who keynoted? And he just was like, la, la, la, Internet of Things, handholding.  Everything's going to be magic.  This was kind of a return to that.  And the problem is they're grafting this vision, which is actually still very Samsung centric, onto a platform that was designed for super nerds.  And the super nerds hate the platform.  And the normal people are looking at this and going, what the hell do I want my dishwasher to talk to my television?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the demo they used had a refrigerator with a screen bigger than this on it.  I mean, it was huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, you know, I could be doing twig from my my refrigerator can one day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not I'm not a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, so it's kind of a cool vision, but it's not as open as you would think.  I think it's not as it's not as transparent how we're going to get there to normal people.  You have to do a lot on the back end.  And I'm not sure if it's really worth it to people who aren't named Samsung.  So that's my quick 22nd take there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems like it's Samsung really pushed Bixby as well.  Their voice assistant said they're going to spend twenty two billion dollars on A.I. a higher a thousand A.I. developers.  They brought the former developer of Siri, who, of course, when Apple acquired Siri, left Apple and started Viv, which Samsung acquired.  He's still in Samsung and really promoted the idea that Bixby is going to be in everything.  And how do we think that's going to work?  I'm not I'm not having a Bixby couple of Bixby phones for last year.  The Note 9 and the S9 with the hardware dedicated hardware button never used it.  But that was from a different era.  That's when Bixby was just wasn't a competitor to Amazon's Echo or Siri.  It was just designed to open apps on the phone to do things with apps on the phone.  Now it's supposed to be a full fledged voice assistant, which they kept saying is smarter than any other voice assistant you've used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it could be with Viv.  So if they do this right and they create a voice assistant where you're like, hey, Bixby, let me let me think of a have my doorbell contact me when the postman gets here.  I can say something like that.  And that actually works in Viv actually makes that very easy to develop on the back end.  Theoretically, that's been a long time.  That's what they showed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They showed a really nice developer environment.  He booked a room on Mars at a hotel.  It was very expensive.  And that was the demo.  And he did a little bit of magic, turned a tape tie into a real tie, which distracted me.  But it's all wishing right now from Samsung.  But you know what?  This is a nascent technology.  Amazon has the lead right now.  Google's coming on strong.  Apple would like to be there as well.  Microsoft's given up with Cortana.  They've really said, I don't think we're going to they actually moved it to the Office 365 group this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that makes that makes sense, though, because Cortana clearly isn't going to be in your home life.  So it's only going to be your assistant for business.  I'll say for Bixby, here's where Bixby with the Viv could actually live with Viv could win or do well.  It's with creating those experiences in a way that's very seamless for the user and relatively easy for the developer,  because right now, if you want to do Amazon or Google, especially Google still a pain to develop for.  It's a little bit harder.  And with Viv, the theory is you would tell it.  You basically use this AI and I'm using that in big quotes here.  AI to understand what a user wants to do and automatically pull together the right APIs to make that happen.  So if that actually does work, that could get them into a lot of places.  Just because if I had one Samsung thing and I wanted to tie it to other things, it's possible that that might work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, it's all it's for every one of these companies.  It's an ecosystem play.  And this is the thing that's a little frustrating.  And it's one of the things that's held back.  IOT, in my opinion, is everybody's a silo.  So there's always this promise.  In fact, SmartThings started was a Kickstarter based on the premise that we're going to be universal.  We'll talk to Zigbee, we'll talk to Z-Wave.  Is it still that universal, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would like to be.  I mean, yes, it will talk to all those radios.  Yes, they have features that will tie into other APIs if a device has it.  The problem is people are not building things that tie into SmartThings.  Instead, everyone wants to lock down their own APIs and make it like, oh, you want to talk to the Whirlpool Washington.  I mean, Samsung says they'll talk to anybody, and I actually believe that they would.  But Whirlpool is not going to like bust its hump to be like, oh, yeah, let me have my appliances talk to Samsung.  That's the problem.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And make sure they work.  It's the historic problem with home automation going back 20 years is everybody wants to own it.  Everybody wants a silo.  And all I see is Samsung saying, our silo, our silo, not Amazon's, not Apple's, not Google's, our silo, our silo.  And nobody wants to be, maybe, it feels like nobody, no consumer wants to say, OK, I'm just going to buy all Apple stuff.  It'll all work better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, consumers do actually buy all Apple stuff just to make it work better.  They're the only one.  That's just craziness.  That's the only company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung, no, right?  Well, the challenging thing.  Are people loyal to Samsung and say, I'm only going to buy Samsung stuff?  So, some countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I'm sure some, yeah.  I bet in Korea, South Korea, they're really big there.  It's not just, I mean, one of the problems is we don't have, that's what OCF was trying to do.  We don't have the equivalent of a hypertext for the Internet of Things.  So, we don't have a data schema that everything uses that you can kind of build around.  You have to do custom for everything.  And that was the problem that we all saw back in 2013, even when Samsung was like, we'll be open.  It'll be amazing.  It's, that doesn't scale.  That doesn't scale beyond computing because the real world has so many more devices and things you have to care about.  And the computing guys are, I don't know if they're willfully blind to this or what, but yeah.  And it's not, and there still aren't great use cases for some of this stuff.  Like, you know, do I need my refrigerator to talk to my television?  I really don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is, Stacey, is there an unused standard in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's the OCF, which is long and storied and went through some efforts.  And that's got Intel, Samsung, Huawei, LG are all involved.  And that's basically a data schema for over a hundred different devices.  So, it says basically like, I'm a light bulb.  If you're a light bulb and you use OCF, it's going to say, this is how you recognize a light bulb.  This is how it turns on, off, goes through.  X number of colors, dims, et cetera.  You see Amazon took that and instead of using something like the data schema from OCF,  they created a voice related data schema with three different things, an on, off, a range and a mode setting.  So again, that's that's another way of doing it.  And they exist.  There's just a lot of them.  What would it take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm asking the two of you.  For you, I mean, Stacey is actually a bad person to ask because you do all of this.  You try it all.  You've got lines that won't open, but could if Andrew would just say the right words, that kind of thing.  But maybe I should ask Jeff, but I'll ask you, Stacey, put yourself in a normal person's mindset.  What would it take for home automation to take off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought we were there.  I thought way back in 2012 and 2013, I thought I saw the creation of those standards.  It was all join.  OCF was coming around the pike and things like smart things that really did want to try to work with everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll agree, though, we're not there.  We're not. We're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it takes a universal standard.  It takes cheaper devices.  Right.  So at the time you had devices that were very expensive.  It also takes a really good and coherent communication of the value to an end user, which the tech companies just blew right past.  Like you can remotely turn on your crockpot is a really crappy reason to spend one hundred and fifty dollars for like a connected crockpot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm talking the guy who got Bluetooth pots and pans.  I mean, it's dopey.  It's dopey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's why you see things like security systems.  Those do really well.  You saw the nest do well for a while because it had energy savings associated with it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why did the nest stop doing well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's a very big price ceiling of number of people who are going to spend that much.  And there you go.  Back to price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think also it's just like if you could, Jeff, if you could move into a home that it was all set up and everything worked with your voice and it worked reliably.  That would be OK. Right. It's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's it's like, you know, imagine when we had cat five through the whole house.  Oh, right. And but but Stacey says it's right.  It's about standards and it's not just about standards that exist today.  It's about standards. You have the faith they're going to exist in five, ten years.  Even more. My house used to have an intercom in it.  Yeah. And it was a standard.  But it's but but they were bad and they died.  And there's still people would wire speakers in their house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They spent a lot of money to put wired speakers in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're old enough to remember why are speakers.  I think I don't I think I have wired speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're not again in no way do you say you are the queen of IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are merely subjects in your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you guys are touching on some really like, yes, essential.  And I would say I'm about to hit this real time because we're putting the house on the market in a couple of months because we're going to move.  And I am sitting here thinking about us.  Well, so they're all like, you should definitely keep a lot of the smart things that are in there, not necessarily smart things.  But I'm like, how do I separate my devices from the brains, which is the value?  Yeah. Yeah. And so that's becoming kind of and do I.  He's like, maybe you could give them like an hour of consulting time so you could set it up for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, oh, that's the problem in a nutshell.  No one no one no one wants their right mind wants to do that.  It's just too much. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why voice is so interesting as an interface.  And I think that that is I think about your question.  I think it's computer. Yeah.  Yeah. Be me up to write.  You want that ability at some level, but you need a Scotty to set the whole damn thing up before you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, because like my I'm keeping I have an altar.  You guys, you've seen it. I have a madam a powered faucet.  But my echo isn't staying here because well, it could stay here, but I'd unaffiliated with my account, thus breaking that connection.  So I'm going to have to break that, tell someone else how to set it up.  So I'm thinking I could create an echo and then an email address for the house for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're being too nice.  You should do what every other seller does listed as a capability and leave and get out of town before they move in.  Seriously, no one.  You'll see when you move into your new house.  Oh, no, I mean, you won't even know how to turn on the fireplace.  You'll have to figure everything out. They don't leave.  Nobody leaves. Oh, here's our manual for how to run the house.  And that's what it's going to take is a manual.  I have started documentation. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're too nice. You're going to build a house from scratch.  What would you build into it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I we built this house.  We built it in 2012.  I built cat six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you've learned since cat six beats cat five.  Take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We were we were going to get gigabit ethernet or get gigabit connectivity.  Google was coming to Austin.  Yeah, Google was coming to Austin.  I'm so excited.  Silly.  I would build honestly for I would build ethernet to every room because I'm still a wired land kind of girl.  So that's one I would actually invest in extra deep switch boxes for my light plates, my light switches and my outlets.  If they weren't, I would actually if I were doing it, I just put in Lutron switches personally.  But you know, you know what you should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this will this will get you fifty thousand dollars more in your house.  It's been thirty five dollars and on a Raspberry Pi and maybe another twenty dollars on a screen and put it like in a closet.  So you have a wire closet already, right? You have a switch.  I do put it in there.  Put a wiki on it that's called the House Wiki and then over time just add to the wiki, add to the wiki until you have like that's your manual.  And and you will say, and by the way, welcome to our home.  It's fully documented here with our soup and you have maybe dress it up with a nice maybe get it.  I'll make it an informational mirror and put it in the bathroom or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, good God.  You go to the bathroom to read your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need I'm telling you a wiki is a solution.  You can put on a Raspberry Pi, put it on a little SD card.  You could dress it up with one of them informational mirrors types.  But I don't care where you put it out in the living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get a story in the paper about the most wired house in Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would get I'm telling you, fifteen thousand more easy.  OK, easy.  The cat six alone I would pay for.  And then if I knew it had a house wiki.  Well, well, Leo, as you tell Stacey, she's not normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate to break it to you.  You're not either.  But there's other people in Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Austin has it has a tech savvy buyer base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But for the most part, they're going to get I think it's a selling point.  They'll get the sink.  Oops, sorry. Yep.  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll just turn water on in five homes across the nation.  Right. That's how many have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They'll get the sink.  They'll get light switches.  They will get a doorbell.  They will get the micu garage thing and they'll get the thermostats.  But I think that's about it.  And I can leave them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spend one thousand dollars for fifty thousand dollars increase in price.  I'm telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, don't tell my husband that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are this whole thing up like crazy?  And then when you have open houses, have it greet, you know, have a little get one of those curry robots.  I think they're selling them cheap and get it.  Come to the door and say welcome.  Welcome to your new home.  Welcome buyer.  Have a canapé.  Let me show you around.  I'm telling you.  You get in the paper.  I do have a Raspberry Pi running like open hab.  But the statesman would publish a story about you.  You get in the New York Times.  It'd be a full spread.  It's selling.  It's a million dollars.  Jetsons house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jetsons house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jetsons house.  Get a conveyor belt outside with a fire hydrant on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're saying stop this crazy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Google must have known what Samsung was up to because in the Android developers blog, I didn't realize this right now.  The Android developers summit is going on.  And the very first thing they say is how to do a folding phone for Android.  It's a new category.  Get ready for foldables.  Two screen devices and one screen devices.  The Samsung device is a two screen.  It looks like a phone, but when unfolded, the defining feature is what we call screen continuity, says Google.  For example, oh, look at this.  Start a video with a folded smaller screen.  And later you could sit down and unfold the device and get a larger tablet size screen for a beautiful immersive experience.  We're optimizing Android for this new form factor.  So that's, you know, expect to see foldables from several Android manufacturers, including one Samsung preview today and plans to offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you imagine any lust for a foldable phone?  Oh, you got to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You knew what my next question was going to be.  You want it?  I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want it.  You can put your wiki on it.  I this phone doesn't fit.  So this phone's too big for me.  If I could get a slightly smaller like thing that folds and then unfold it to something bigger, that would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's like a pixel.  But shorter.  I need it to be shorter as well.  And then, yeah, the Samsung phone actually did look kind of small until you open it up.  Yeah, it didn't look like that big a screen, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then you know, how do you hold?  I imagine somebody opening the thing on the subway or.  I don't know.  I'm going to predict this is a flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is the.  And there's unknowns because.  What's the mechanical issue?  How well is that going to wear?  It's the first eight track phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's true.  OK, I can see with it being novel.  But I think.  I kind of like the idea of the form factor, I'll be honest.  But I mean, I like paperback books.  I've read newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think also the thinking is people want a bigger phone, but like Stacey, they don't want a bigger phone.  Right.  They want more screen real estate, but they want to.  So it's kind of a hybrid.  I have to say, though, that the history of hybrid devices and technology is uniformly terrible.  I can't think of Windows 8.  Windows itself is struggling between desktop and tablet environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm still I'll tell you later.  I went and saw a slate today and I still think that Chrome is not a good tablet.  Oh, yes. Perfect example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're not going to get a slate.  We ordered the time they're available now.  Actually, by the time we got to it, the top of the line models are all gone.  The top top. Yeah.  The top one.  One seven. Yes.  Seven. We had to get an M three based or I three based machine.  So but I don't you know, Jason, I said I said I don't want to Jason.  You get it. I still have my pixel.  He's using an old Chromebook.  I have my pixel book.  So Jason is going to get it as his new Chromebook.  And we went to the order.  I'm actually let me go to store dot Google dot com because you can preorder them now.  As of yesterday, I think you could preorder them.  But I think that they didn't they ran out.  Let me see what the status is.  Let's order. Shall we order one?  First of all, you don't want I was kind of surprised because the top of the line models are expensive.  Yeah. 1599 for the I seven out of stock.  Oh, all the top three.  Now the one we got the M three version is now out of stock.  So all you can get is a seller on version.  This is Connor counter intuitive.  I would have thought the cheap ones would have sold first.  But that just shows you when people buy a pixel from Google Pixel Book or a Chromebook from Google.  They don't mind spending more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's another possibility here, which is they didn't make any.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there this we ended up getting an eighth gen Intel core M three.  That's a pretty sluggish processor, but maybe not for Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kevin says Best Buy still has stock of the slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, thank you, Kevin.  Just go. Hi, Kevin.  So yeah, this. So which one did Kevin get?  OK, I'll ask him. Let's go see.  Let's let's find out what we can get here.  iPad Pro is on the front page, of course.  Good luck. You know why they still have them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't. I five. Oh, yeah, I knew this one.  I shouldn't have even had to ask. I five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the one we would probably want to get. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see. Plus the keyboard says Kevin.  So this is something Kevin and I have been talking a lot about because I am in the market.  Well, I'm in the market for a new laptop and with the new MacBooks in the butterfly keyboard, I'm like, ah, or the MacBook Airs.  So he's trying to convince me to buy a Surface laptop, but I'm still kind of like, OK, this is really confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Best Buy needs a little bit of explanation here.  They're trying to sell up. Sell me on Microsoft Office.  My Pixelbook. No, sorry.  It's it's Chrome OS.  Well, but actually, wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the online version? Then you actually might want to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see. You're stuck in an office.  No, it's three sixty five.  Person or it's just it's just so it's a subscription to the online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can use that. The online is free.  Not for the web based one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you mean this is going to be there's a yeah, I would not recommend.  So a release.  See, I don't know if the release date for this item has not been announced.  So I think you could order this and you may not.  It may not mean that you're going to get it.  God, it's expensive.  It is ridiculous because this is nine ninety nine for the I five version with one hundred twenty eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the equivalent of iPad Pro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to see you want to see a two thousand dollar tablet.  Take Feast Your Eyes and Feast Your Eyes.  Well, I'd not mind actually mine isn't I couldn't bring myself to get a terabyte of storage, but it's pretty expensive.  I don't remember exactly what this two hundred dollars for this keyboard, which is, by the way, what Google's charging for their keyboard.  This is the folio keyboard goes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this is just a way to like make laptops less durable and more irritating to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you. With a with an operating system that just doesn't do it.  Sucks. I want my Nexus seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want that was a great Android device.  That's a tablet.  This is a laptop making a laptop into a tablet.  It just doesn't make any sense.  Again, back to my contention, hybrid devices have a very poor history.  You know, the only, only, only time that I use my Pixelbook as a tablet, I guess.  Watching these shut down your large electronic devices.  You may use your tablet.  So I turn into a tablet and they don't bother me.  And then I turn it back into laptops as well.  So I bought the 12 inch iPad Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's nine ninety nine.  Oh, I can't even order. Oh, you have to choose the color.  OK, if you if you want a terabyte of storage, it's seventeen forty nine.  I didn't go that crazy. I only got 256 gigs of RAM.  I did get Wi-Fi and cellular.  So that's 1299.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can get cellular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm putting a Google fight and I'll let you know how that works.  The data chip and then I think it might work.  Yeah, no, I think it will work.  It might look like a T-Mobile SIM, but it'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought five only work in certain devices still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been able to use this data SIM.  I was using it in a Windows and HP and VX to hit it.  Yeah. Should I try it?  Sure.  I just pull out. I just I just happen to have a simple SIM puller on my.  No, I don't have my key chain.  John's going to go get it out of my door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was like, I keep a bottle opener on my key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do keep a simple keep a little plastic holder SIM cards, however, call me.  Call me nuts. But I happen to have.  Let's see. I think I'll use today.  I have T-Mobile AT&T.  I think I shall choose the Google five SIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you know it's the Google five?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says five.  But on some of them, like I have to T-Mobile after write the phone number on it and very tiny handwriting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Oh, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John's like your Fred Norton on me, Fred on on Howard Stern.  He just anticipates your need and goes and gets your puller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's better than any Fred.  He is he is the king.  Oh, and see the magnetic pencil.  Look at that.  Oh, I.  I got to one for Megan.  It says dream girl and mine says dream boy.  Because you can monogram them.  Or what does that cost?  I think it was free because the pencil is one hundred twenty nine dollars.  Two hundred dollar keyboard, one hundred twenty nine dollar pencil, twelve ninety nine for the iPad.  I think I did get close to.  Two thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Plus, plus you ever buy service for these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  Yeah, you get rid of.  Yeah, no, I don't.  I self insure.  All right. There's the SIM slot.  Let's just put a little Google five in there.  Are you bored?  Oh, sorry.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm I'm sleepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was up late last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why? What were you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was watching the election returns and then I was angsting and I like how she was watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, in California, we knew Beto lost before midnight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I knew he lost as of like 10 o'clock.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it still felt sad.  You know what? I was thinking and then they echoed it.  Now he's now he's wide open for presidential run.  Think of it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm assuming he'll run in 2020 for Senate in Texas, which would be smarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We all win.  I mean, yeah, I.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway.  Where do I find out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I go to cellular.  Let's see.  Cellular data on SIM card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ooh, maybe I'll have my family bring me a cup of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm waiting while we're waiting.  I think it worked.  I don't know.  We're going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can I get can I get advice on my laptop conundrum or should we do an ad?  You should probably do an ad.  Let's do your laptop conundrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then we'll do the ad.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I currently have a MacBook Air, you guys.  I use all of my USB ports.  I have a like I plug in audio.  La la la audio.  I do Skype for Twig.  I need a new laptop.  I don't love the keyboard on the MacBook Air, the butterfly keyboard.  I don't mind Windows.  I have had Windows computers in the past.  So the question is, what laptop should I go with?  I do want it to be light for travel.  John, would you bring me Fred?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bring me the Huawei Mate Pro X.  I'll show you my one of my favorites.  I like Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to test Skype might work on a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I also run Audacity.  I do some audio transcription, audio editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how do you feel about the Chinese government?  Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am a little nervous about the Chinese government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is a company called Huawei.  They're a Chinese company.  This is the Huawei Matebook.  It is OK.  Let me show you next to the brand new MacBook Air.  It's roughly the same size.  It has a fairly good keyboard.  Fingerprint reader.  Unlike the Air, the screen goes almost all the way to the edge.  The Air's screen does not.  On the other hand, the Air's camera is in a sensible spot,  which is at the top of the screen.  You can see where the bezels are.  But there's room for a camera.  The camera, and I don't know if you care about this,  the camera on the Huawei is hidden away in the function key.  Right there. There it is.  Whoop, it just popped up.  So it gets your nose hairs?  It's a nose cam.  OK.  If you really wanted to use it, you could probably just do it like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I have an external camera.  So how many ports does it have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Apple comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack.  The Huawei comes with a Type A USB 3.1 port,  dual Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack.  So you have a little more flexibility,  both charged with Type C, which I think you should get.  This has a fingerprint reader.  I think a much better keyboard than the Apple, a little more travel.  If you really care about keyboard though, as a writer,  you might look at a ThinkPad from Lenovo, which aren't...  The ThinkPad, I mean, look, the most beautiful laptop out there  is the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It's stunning.  It's light, it's thin, it's a little pricey.  This starts...  Well, I think the one you want is about $16.99 on the Huawei,  which is pretty good for this.  The Apple, comparable Apple, well, there is no comparable Apple  because they're using a much slower processor,  but it's about $100 more.  And I think that the ThinkPad X1 Carbon is probably in that price.  It's sub-$2,000.  The X1 Carbon is really nice.  I'll check it out.  I mean, if...  There are a couple of advantages to doing a ThinkPad.  The keyboard is unparalleled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, yeah.  Kevin was pushing me towards a Microsoft Surface...  No.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you don't like that.  That was decisive.  No, I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm still going to go...  I've got to go check everything out, but I'm really kind of hacked off.  So this is... Thank you, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The generation X1 Carbon, beautiful.  Starts at $11.39.  You can customize it to be a little bit more beefy.  If you want a two-in-one where you can flip it over,  they make a yoga, which does the same thing.  It's basically X1 yoga, so the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that, just like Jeff does,  where in the airplane you can tent it.  You can watch a movie that way, which is nice.  I really think ThinkPads are great.  Also a Chinese company, Lenovo,  but not one of those Chinese companies that people  in the commerce department are worried about, apparently.  And now I'm going to tell you what you could watch  on that new Tented Notebook.  How about that?  Are you familiar with CuriosityStream?  I know you're curious.  CuriosityStream is the world's first streaming service  that's addressed to your lifelong quest  to learn, to explore, to understand.  I want you to go to curiositystream.com slash twit.

Why are bees facing extinction?  This actually, you know what, you're laughing,  but it's, you've never seen photography of bees like this.  It's amazing.  Bees are fascinating.  Bees are great.  Bees are awesome.  Well, then you would want to watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was, no, I was laughing because I heard wire bees  and I thought wire, like, yeah.  My brain just was like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wire bees.  Then she said, I want them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  I'm like, I need some wire bees.  You could get it.  You can get bees in your new home in Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  So we helped you buy a laptop.  I should, you know, I haven't, I haven't tried this yet.  It's very nostalgic for me to see a MacBook Air  because I just loved this form factor.  I really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did. Yeah, I loved it too.  It was so great when it came out, but it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm having a problem with it now.  Keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got a very short travel keyboard.  I hate it.  I hate those.  I'm not a fan.  The second generation is a little better.  Not much, but a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the third generation butterfly keyboard, right?  Or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the most recent.  Because I have the MacBook Pro with the newest one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't they just announce one?  Is that the just announced new one?  Yeah, this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's in a lovely gold.  I was excited about rose gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was like, ooh, I'm going to get that.  It's not rose gold.  Oh, I wanted the rose gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think gold gold's pretty sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yes, you covet that computer there, Leo.  I have way too many computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that Huawei shows what Apple could have done, but there is an issue.  It's from a Chinese government related company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if I'd buy a Huawei laptop, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then look at the Lenovo.  Those Lenovo's.  The Thinkpads, though.  The Thinkpads.  And man, you could bang on them.  The keyboards are replaceable.  The screens are replaceable.  The trackpad is replaceable.  They are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at these bees.  Andrew has one.  He loves it.  Oh, Andrew knows.  Beautiful bees.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm reading a novel right now about the amazing life story of Madame Tussaud.  Of the waxworks fame?  Yes.  So speaking of wax, it's amazing how much wax people used to use.  All those bees needed to produce a lot of wax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that where wax?  Okay, I know there's beeswax, but is that where all wax comes from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not anymore.  Not anymore, but back then, didn't it?  That's all they had.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, that is all they had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had, or maybe a little ambergris, throw it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?  Oh, the whale throw up?  Oh, that's a little waxy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So last week, we didn't talk about it.  We talked a little bit about all the kerfuffle, but we didn't talk about the walkout because  it was on Thursday, I think.  On Monday of this week, a couple of days ago, the Google executive team met to say, what  are we going to do?  20,000 workers in Google offices across 50 cities walked out November 1st at 1110 a.m.  Here's the San Francisco walkout.  Some of them holding up signs, many of them holding up signs that say, don't be evil,  make Google do it.  I'm happy to quit for 90 million, says one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if I'd be advertising that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, really.  They're talking, of course, about how Android founder Andy Rubin got a $90 million payday  when he left, but it turns out he left also because of sexual harassment charges.  Or actually, it wasn't harassment, it was inappropriate sexual conduct.  Conduct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sexual misconduct, I believe is what they call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Misconduct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's misconduct these days.  We have the eyes of many companies looking at us at Google employee Tanuja Gupta in New  York.  We've always been a vanguard company.  If we don't lead the way, no one else will.  So I think that's how a lot of Googlers are seeing it, is not so much that there's something  wrong with Google, but we have to be even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, true.  We have to lead the way.  Did you understand the New York Times headline?  Google workers reject Silicon Valley individualism in walkout.  What?  Was there a headline?  For decades, Silicon Valley has been ground zero for a vaguely utopian form of individualism.  Oh, libertarianism.  With a, no, the idea that a single engineer with a laptop and an internet connection could  change the world or at least the long established industry.  Class consciousness was passe, unions were the enemy of innovation, and anchored to the  status quo.  What the heck is this report?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's somebody in New York's idea of what Silicon Valley is all about.  I don't think that's accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Commies.  Commies.  It's a bunch of commies.  They hate unions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that is true.  I think actually libertarianism probably sums that up really well.  Not needing it, but anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, according to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that was, individualism was not the real issue here in my view, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.  Yeah, I actually saw this and was kind of interested in the idea of what that meant  for collective action by workers in Silicon Valley.  You know, if you wanted to protest sexual harassment, do you also want to protest things  like contract labor?  I don't know.  So, you know, if you got a more politically aware class, what that might mean.  But that's just me being all crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have turned off Wi-Fi.  I have full LTE.  It identifies as Google Fi.  Wow.  And it's popping up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Why the heck didn't Google with Google Fi put that in the damn slate?  It just drives me nuts.  Maybe that's why they did it, Jeff.  Kevin, I know, to drive me nuts, it's true.  Google.  Kevin Toffle tweeted me that there was a...  I forget Kevin which one it was, but it was a...  Somebody added LTE to a Chromebook.  Jarvis is going to want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did.  Well, you can always hotspot and stuff, but I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The hotspot is...  Because I have a grandfathered AT&T unlimited.  And they won't let you do that, huh?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Kevin says Google Fi Sims work on any unlocked device, but stay on the T-Mobile network.  T-Mobile, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although in the past I've seen them identified as T-Mobile.  This is identifying as Google Fi anyway, which is a...  That's a good sign.  Actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like a medium channeling Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now Kevin is saying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Kevin's raising the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a Samsung.  If you're going to hell, ring a bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, you know, this is...  I have a table that could be raised.  And I could connect it to Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He could IOT it on you?  Uh-huh.  Kevin could raise your table?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, spirits, speak to me.  If there is going to be a new Google Pixelbook,  ring three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kevin says, does anyone want to speak to their great grandparents?  I have them here with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For those of you on audio, Leo is geeking out with his raiseable table.  My table went up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, did you not see my table go up too?  Or did you miss it because...  Well, my table was hiding your table.  It was hiding your screen.  There I'm going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going.  Oh.  Wow, we can all do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is, because her camera's on the table,  in Stacey's case, she's disappearing.  I'm just going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's way more effective.  It's like that stair climbing, miming thing that could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have colleagues here that get the stand up desks,  and then they sit down, they type like they have those motorcycles.  Right?  It's just ridiculous.  What? Do they really?  Those are choppers, Jeff.  Choppers.  They really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Choppers, thank you.  I never understand choppers.  So they sit like this and they type?  Yeah, no, it's way up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's literally up here.  They're looking up at the screen.  They're doing that to mess with you.  I say, you've defeated the purpose.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is odd.  I just want to sit down.  I just want to sit down.  We have a thing called a desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, so I guess we don't have anything.  We talked about this last week, the Google Walkout,  but it actually happened.  And I haven't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting to me that Sundar said before the Walkout,  I endorse the Walkout,  and I will make sure that nobody gets in trouble for walking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, which is the right thing to do, right?  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but it makes your Walkout like a non-protest.  Exactly.  My risk-free protest.  Go ahead, Leo, run away from home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See what I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's from high school.  In high school, we would leave school to protest the Vietnam War,  and the teachers would come with us.  It was like, no, that's no fun.  Well, they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they had that, although not in every school in Texas,  but if you wanted to protest,  like the day the students walked out for gun violence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was really cool.  They supported that, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which...  They should.  Yeah.  And it is nice that Sundar was, you know, solidarity in that way,  but is he in solidarity in the,  okay, maybe I won't give anybody else a golden...  What is it? Golden...  Not handcuffs.  Golden parachute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't...  Maybe I missed it.  Did that Monday meeting with the executive team and Sundar Pichai...  Did anything come out of that?  I haven't seen any announcements.  I haven't either.  Whether or not they're going to do a better job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They didn't fire a protest.  Yeah, what are they going to...  I mean, the test to this comes next.  I mean, they can't claw back the money from Andy Rubin.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we saw, and we talked about the article and the cut  and what they were asking for,  and while some of that I think isn't going to happen,  such as putting an employee representative on the board,  but they wanted to end forced arbitration  in cases of harassment and discrimination.  This is actually a big battle in California.  The California legislature approved a bill  making forced arbitration illegal.  Most employers, including, I should say in full disclosure,  that TWIT does this as well,  we have a clause in your employee contract  that says you will go to arbitration in cases of dispute.  And the whole idea there is to keep everybody out of court  and save us a huge expense.  Because it's very easy for employees  who have been terminated to hire a lawyer on contingency  and make our life expensive and miserable at no cost to them.  So we put this in.  I mean, I don't think we thought this up.  I think this is kind of just the normal employment contract.  But they say they want an end to that,  at least in cases of harassment and discrimination.  Governor Brown vetoed the bill when the legislature approved it.  The governor signed it, would not sign it.  Number two, a commitment.  But I think that this is something,  especially in the case of harassment and discrimination,  this is something that Google might agree to.  Their lawyers may not like it.  A commitment to end pay and opportunity inequity.  Well, of course they're going to say, yeah, absolutely.  We commit, we will know that we're going to do that.  We commit, we will no longer do that.  Lisa was reading me last night,  there was a UN report on pay inequality  that said it's going to take 231 years  before women get paid the same as men.  I said, why didn't they come up with that number?  And it's based on how much it's been going up,  like a penny a year closer.  At that rate, it'll be 231 years.  Number three, a publicly disclosed sexual harassment  transparency report.  I think that could be done.  A clear uniform globally inclusive process  for reporting sexual misconduct  and safely and anonymously.  Absolutely.  In fact, the fact that they don't have that  is kind of surprising.  And then they want to elevate the chief diversity officer  to answer directly to the CEO  and make recommendations directly to the board of directors.  I think that's actually reasonable.  All of that's reasonable.  I don't know about the employee representative on the board,  but maybe, maybe they'd do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you just make your HR,  like the head of your HR and people,  it doesn't even have to be chief diversity officer.  It just has to be someone who actually gives a hoot  about that sort of thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, frankly, that's what the HR person  should be given a hoot about.  Okay, well, that is not necessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what HR people are hired to do.  Sometimes they represent the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're there to protect the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a very good friend who is head of HR  at a variety of companies currently at Silicon Labs.  And she has got strong opinions on HR and the role of HR.  And I love her for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it to protect the company against exposure  or to protect the employees against the company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's to create a...  It's basically to create the type of environment  that the company wants to have and to push that.  That's fair.  You could have a really dickish HR person  if you have a company that doesn't really care  about their workers, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We care.  If you care.  We care.  So, did you run off to Best Buy to get a Pixel Slate?  No, you did not.  No, I did not.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do not want the Pixel Slate.  I do not want the Pixel Slate Semi-Am.  Semi-Am.  I was going to say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a contract Google has agreed to,  along with Facebook, Tim Berners-Lee's Contract for the Web.  This is such a bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bulls. Bulls. Bulls. Bull malarkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, tell us how you feel.  I'm trying to find it.  What is the Contract for the Web?  What is the Contract for the Web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I put that on there,  but I had no time to read the Contract for the Web yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really vague.  It's basically like, hold on, I'll get the actual words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Contract for the Web, core principles.  The Web first. Core principles.  This site uses cookies.  Okay, click that.  Every site now.  The Web was designed to bring people together  and make knowledge freely available.  Really? I guess so.  Yeah, I guess that's what Tim Berners-Lee was trying to do, right?  Maybe make knowledge freely available was number one,  and then bring people together.  Everyone has a role to play to ensure the Web serves humanity, okay?  By committing to the following principles,  governments, companies, and citizens around the world  can have protected open Web as a public good  and a basic right for everyone.  Can't disagree with that.  Governments will ensure everyone can connect to the Internet.  Unless it violates free speech.  I'm mocking the FCC commissioner who said,  oh, we can't have municipal Internet.  That would violate free speech.  Get out of the pie.  Keep all the Internet available all the time  so that no one is denied their right to full Internet access.  I like that.  Respect people's fundamental right to privacy  so everyone can use the Internet freely, safely, and without fear.  I'm waiting to see when Stacey's going to pop up.  Well, that's kind of a non-starter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No government's going to say, well, we're going to, you know, you all,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, privacy, unless you're a terrorist.  Right.  That's the safely.  So the government's part is kind of silly in the sense that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  hey, if you're Iran, you're going to keep shutting down the Web  when you want to.  Yeah.  So I'm like, eh.  But the companies, which is sort of Google and Facebook,  I mean, sure, Google and Facebook are like, yes, government,  but they're not going to be able to do that.  I mean, sure, Google and Facebook are like, yes, governments,  let's provide affordable access to the Internet  so people can consume our services.  But making the Internet affordable and accessible to everyone.  So they're actively trying to do that because, again,  for their own cynical reasons, get more users.  And so saying they respect consumers' privacy and personal data,  I'm sure that Google is, feels that they do that.  I'm sure that Facebook would tell us they do that,  and they have in the past and then lied through their teeth  and develop the technologies that support the best in humanity  and challenge the worst.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please, that's...  Yeah, that's kind of...  That's pretty amorphous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are sweet, but they're not anything that can be real.  I mean, it's like, don't be evil as your corporate slogan.  Right.  Google was going to get rid of that  because that was a ridiculous corporate slogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Well, there's a third part, us as users.  Right.  Citizens will be creators and collaborators in the Web  so the Web has a rich, relevant content for everyone.  I like that.  Everybody might have something to say on the Web.  Everybody should get to put something up on the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about citizens will not be a-holes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not in here.  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This kind of is.  What it is sort of, okay.  Build strong communities that respect civil discourse  and human dignity so everyone feels safe and welcome home.  All right, all right, all right.  Trolls aren't going to sign on to that.  Everybody agrees to that except trolls,  and they're not going to sign on to it.  Well, there's plenty of people who...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead.  So, you know, you might argue that white nationalists  won't feel free and available in some communities.  All right.  Fight for the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just had a discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do the last one.  Fight for the Web so the Web remains open  and a global public resource for everybody everywhere.  Yeah, this is very soft and not, you know, it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's nice.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so sweet.  Nice.  So here's a related question.  I was talking to an academic researcher I respect immensely,  and she's working with somebody else we all know  on trying to come up with the metrics of positive social impact  and positive society on the net.  And they're debating, as of the moment,  they want to exclude civility as a metric.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think of, like, as civility?  Does that preclude disagreement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think it does.  I think the problem is that they see is that everyone defines it differently.  And I had this discussion with Yasha Munk,  who's a brilliant Harvard professor who's written books  about the death of democracy.  And I said the problem with the word civility now I'm hearing  is that like fake news, it got co-opted.  And so the far right wing will say,  if you try to shut down Milo, then you're not being civil to him.  But Yasha said, no, no, no, no, no, don't give up on the word.  You can be civil and still call evil, evil.  It is not uncivil to call evil, evil.  So you can have that large carve out, but the civility is still a goal.  So we went back and forth a lot.  The problem they're trying to grapple with is that  how the hell would you ever come up with an algorithm to measure this?  And I said, you're not going to come up with a one-size-fits-all algorithm.  Because as the project that I announced last week,  we said in our long post about that,  the uses of certain words are going to be different.  If you're the root reporting on racism,  you're going to use charged words that elsewhere would be absolutely verboten.  And context and audience matter.  So there's not a one-size-fits-all.  I do think you need humans to create learning sets around this.  But I do think it's possible to start to imagine  flags of incivility or flags of civil behavior,  flags of peacekeeping behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's hard to, I mean, like, one of the challenges, I think,  with online debates or even telephone debates in all honesty,  is it's very hard to see that the other person is actually listening to you,  which is an important part of any civil debate,  is feeling like you've been heard.  True.  And that's very challenging online.  It's even challenging, like, when I'm talking to my mom on the phone  about her decision to vote for Ted Cruz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so...  I can see you rolling your eyes, Stacey.  I don't even have to look at you.  I can see you rolling your eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know you're rolling your eyes at me.  I wasn't, I actually deeply saddens me,  because I understand her point of view.  I don't agree with it, but I understand it.  And that's a hallmark of civility,  is the ability to, like, to convey that  the other person doesn't, like, feel that you're...  You are rolling your eyes at them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have I told you guys about Spaceship Media?  Have you heard about this company?  No.  A wonderful company started by two journalists in San Francisco  to convene communities...  This is answering your question, Stacey,  about how they have a methodology of this.  They convened communities in conflict and in conversation.  So their first was getting 25 women who voted for Trump,  25 women who voted for Clinton in San Francisco and Alabama.  And the journalist interviewed them all and put them in a Facebook room.  And at first, of course, they talked nicely,  and then it fell down quickly.  But two of my graduates in the social journalism program  were working full-time there,  and they have a methodology for...  Look at the seven steps of dialogue journalism.  They have a methodology of making sure that people are hearing each other  and reflecting what they hear,  and asking questions rather than making accusations,  and ending up with a civil conversation.  And it's really a neat, neat, neat company.  These people are great.  They're doing one now with 5,000 women, eventually.  They've done...  I forget the projects,  but they've done African-American students and teachers.  They did a huge national thing with advanced publications on guns.  I think we tend to presume that people go into these chat rooms,  and it's all negative and all awful.  And the worst of the worst, of course, is over there  with 20,000 people hired by Facebook to get rid of things  that don't meet their community standards.  But it's possible if you put some resource and some investment into it,  and that the people in the room care enough to have it,  you pick them, frankly,  that you can start to learn how to have civil conversations.  I think those are the beginnings of this online.  Beginnings.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm like, let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tim Berners-Lev...  Yeah, I mean, Leo, you have it.  I was thinking about this.  You have it in your chat room.  We do.  You do.  And it works.  And it works because people have reasons to be there  and reasons to protect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, it works because we have a dozen moderators with big sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but they want to protect the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Right?  And I think the vast majority of people in the chat room  have to share that goal.  But honestly, without enforcement, it doesn't matter.  And that's the problem with trolls is they're norm breakers.  And you can have the norm, you can have the standard,  everybody can agree, and then one troll can do whatever they want  because they're norm breakers.  Right.  They're not bound by norms.  So then, I hate to say it, that's when you break out the ban hammer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you do.  That's part of what you do.  You got to do it.  But that seems more important than norms, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The norms didn't accomplish anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is where I think Tim Berger's lead is trying to get something.  You start to say, do we have a shared goal?  And it does start, Stacey's absolutely right.  It starts up in the clouds, up, you know, out,  and it doesn't seem very tangible in any way.  But you have to start, I think, and agree to the path  before you can get down to the tactical levels.  Maybe.  Because otherwise, you're going to get in the weeds  right off the bat of defining civility.  Yeah, which is hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can know it when I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, indeed, Stacey, my argument is the Infowars thing,  the algorithm writers and the comms people and policy people at the platforms  and the regulators and media somehow want to have a preset list of rules  that they can write their algorithms to and write their regulations to.  What happened in the Infowars case is that a large chunk of society said,  I don't know what your rules are, but if this is on the right side of it,  your rules are wrong.  It's on the wrong side of whatever the heck the rules are.  Get rid of it and then figure out your rules.  And that's how society works.  That's the negotiation of norms and standards.  And it starts transactionally and anecdotally.  Infowars has to be wrong, so deal with it.  And all the at-jacks you see are, you know, Jack, how can this be okay?  It always starts not with the rule,  but it starts with the anecdote, the example.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a little break, come back, and we're going to talk about content ID,  YouTube, and why I'm mad as hell.  Oh, no. Oh, no.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans,  introducing rate shield approval.  If the time has come for you to buy a home, you probably aren't writing a check.  You're probably not bringing a bag of gold coins.  You're probably getting a home loan.  May I suggest you go to the number one lender in the country,  number one in customer satisfaction, eight years in a row, according to JD Power,  number one in volume two, thanks to that,  and you'll love this new three-step power buying process.  Rising interest rates make already anxious process a little more anxious.  There's always the chance that as you're shopping for a house,  interest rates will go up and it'll cost you thousands of dollars more.  Stacey, you'll know all about this soon.  Can't wait.  Yeah.  So wouldn't it be nice if when you get your loan,  it gets locked so that rates can't go up?  That's rate shield approval.  Step one, the power buying process.  You go right now to rocketmortgage.com slash twig, set up the account,  answer a few simple questions you already know the answer to,  your social, your birth date, your name, your address,  and they will check your credit and then say,  here's the loans you qualify for.  You choose the term, the rate, the down payment.  You'll love that, by the way, the rates are really good.  And boom, you got pre-qualified approval in less than 10 minutes  with no trips to the attic, no trips to the bank,  no need even to put on neckwear, no ties required.  Quicken Loans will verify your income and assets and credit  in the next 24 hours, most cases without you doing anything  because they have trusted relationships with all the financial institutions.  And then they give you something called verified approval.  That's step two, it gives you the strength of a cash buyer.  It means when you go to buy a house, there's no contingency.  You're good for the money.  You got the loan.  Step three, once you're verified, you'll qualify for the all new rate shield approval.  This is something exclusive to Rocket Mortgage and you're going to love it.  They lock your rate for up to three months while you shop.  It cannot go up.  If rates go down, unlikely, but if they did, your rate would go down.  More likely they're going to go up.  At least you know your rate stays the same.  You know how much that loan is going to cost.  And that takes some of the pressure.  You don't have to rush to buy that house.  You have three months to look to find exactly the right place.  This is why Quicken Loans is number one, honestly.  To get started, you go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions.  Additional exclusions or conditions may apply.  Based on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records,  Equal Housing Lender, licensed in all 50 states and MLSconsumerAccess.org  number 30-30.  It's rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support.  So Content ID is the tool, the automated tool that Google uses, YouTube uses,  to find copyright violations.  Google says, our anti-piracy efforts are doing very well.  They pay $3 billion to copyright owners through Content ID.  Now, the way it works in most cases, it's an automated system.  If you get a ding on a YouTube video, we've gotten them, you can appeal it.  Or you could say, yep, you got me.  And then the copyright holder has the right to pull you down if they want  or to monetize against you to put ads up there.  And that's so if you're like a recording company, one of your songs is being used,  you could pull a video down or you could have an ad for that song pop up,  which would be nice, or just credit.  You get your choice.  So it sounds like it's been very successful.  This is a paper titled How Google Fights Piracy that they put out in 2018.  The video platform's Content ID scans uploads against a database of files  submitted by content owners and creators.  And when it detects it, it gives you those choices.  There's also, though, this is the one that's making me angry, a little head up.  By the way, we have to say, I'd say we have been dinged from time to time by Content ID.  We always appeal it.  We say that's fair use.  We're doing, you know, we're a news operation.  And in every case, it's been lifted and we've gone ahead.  There's been one case, and I think this was actually legit.  We were showing off a TV and I had a BBC Planet Earth video playing,  which we identified.  But BBC said, no, you can't do that because it's not part of your you're not reviewing Planet Earth.  You're reviewing a TV and it's showing Planet Earth.  And I think that's actually legitimate.  So BBC was still being a bit of a we gave him a big plug.  We said, isn't this beautiful footage, blah, blah, blah.  And we weren't showing it full screen.  It wasn't like, oh, I don't have to buy the video now.  I could just watch the YouTube review of that TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it was like I mean, don't you have like a 30 second exemption?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or is there no there's no technically there's no time limit.  There's no the fair use rules are funny too, because they're not there.  They're a defense.  So they really don't come into effect unless somebody sues you and you go to court and then you say, well, your honor, this is fair use.  And then the judge gets to decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as Larry said, fair use is the is the right to hire a lawyer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But most cases, our experience with YouTube has been great.  And and that's all worked.  But last week, we had a little bit of a problem.  I don't know if I mentioned that I mentioned this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you did. I was going to ask how that worked out.  Still down.  And I have a letter from YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't YouTube that pulled us down.  It was an attorney hired by Apple.  What? Yeah.  And so we've appealed it.  Now, the way it works, it's different with YouTube Live.  I just described what happens with uploaded video with YouTube Live.  You only get one chance.  We've appealed it.  And now it goes to that.  Now, Google said or YouTube says to that attorney, the complainant, OK, you're going to pursue this or not.  And they have somewhere between two and three weeks to respond.  If they sue us, if they send us a cease and desist, then Google says, all right, that's a strike.  You're off YouTube Live for 45 days.  Just the slam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is so open to slam.  What's their motive not to say, yeah, we'll sue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good question.  I mean, I guess I could defend it.  In fact, as far as I'm concerned, I'm going to court.  But I hope they heard that.  But yeah, I mean, it's talk about a chilling effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Plus Apple, you're a Richard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems a little weird.  What we did, just so people who didn't know, I will tell them, we do what we always do.  We just did it with the Samsung event.  We will stream their keynote and comment on it, you know, add it, glossing it, annotating it, which I consider fair use for news purposes.  It doesn't diminish the value of their stream because they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It might if you say mean things about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they may not.  Yeah. So that may be in my opinion, Apple is taking a page from the Trump playbook, which is, you know, if you don't like what people say, go after them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is why I have a Chromebook, not an Apple.  I just don't like the company.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then probably the number one Apple podcast, the number two Apple podcast, iOS Today and Mac Break Weekly.  I buy every goddamn thing because Apple, I don't take loaners, so I buy everything and review it.  So Apple made, last week they made $10,000, $15,000 off of me.  So there's the irony.  I don't feel like I cannot do that.  I have to review it.  This is what we do.  This is our business, is to tell people what Apple's up to and what we think of Apple's products.  That's my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just like Jim Acosta, they're trying to pull the microphone away from you.  That's what bothers me because it doesn't, it's not a takedown of that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are not on YouTube Live now and we won't be on YouTube Live until either Apple doesn't do anything about it  and then YouTube will lift the strike and we'll be back on next week or for a month and a half.  And at that point, there's a massive chilling effect because another, I mean, after, I can't remember,  it was two or three strikes on YouTube Live.  They close the account and all associated accounts, Twitter would be gone.  So there's a huge chilling effect.  So there's a huge chilling effect.  Now I all of a sudden have to tiptoe around Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you decided, Uncle, I'll pull that video of the live thing tomorrow.  No, that's not it.  It doesn't even help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not related to that.  In fact, that's still up, right?  Is that up?  Yeah, that's up.  It's still up.  Oh, I shouldn't tell them that.  It was against the live stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the live stream then gets archived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The way this, the way, well, yeah, and it's by the way, I should check,  but I'm pretty sure we have it up on the Twitter TV specials.  It's a Twitter TV specials.  I shouldn't.  I'm giving the man you an issue.  I'm sure this guy's watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually was used to be on a board with the chief counsel, the new chief counsel of Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a third person.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, it's a third person.  So you can watch this now on download or on our site.  This was just YouTube live.  But it has the effect of knocking us off YouTube live.  You can't watch Twig right now on YouTube live.  Fortunately, we have other live streams, but you can't watch Twig on it.  You can't watch our floss coverage.  You can't watch anything on YouTube live from Twig.  It bothers me a little bit, but there's nothing I can do about it.  This life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It bothers me.  Yeah, it doesn't.  As a journalist, I'm like, oh, it seems so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, maybe the argument is, well, is that fair use?  You showed we did.  We do show it in its entirety.  So that's one of there's three tests with fair use.  One of them is the amount that was used.  And we do show in its entirety.  But it's a it's Mystery Science Theater 3000.  We're sitting in front of it talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Fiskeen, as we say in blogs.  Fiskeen.  Fiskeen.  You named after Robert Fisk, who bloggers didn't like early on.  And you would you would take the entire column someone wrote and paragraph by  paragraph respond to all the points.  So you ended up repeating the entire column.  But because you needed it, you respond to every point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what we'll have to do.  We'll have to Fisk it next time.  Or I'm going to use puppets.  Extremely unflattering puppets.  No, just kidding.  I mean, really, the funny thing is, when you say it's a third party, you mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you mean it's a it's an attorney hired by Apple outside outside counsel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But still Apple.  I oh, yeah.  I mean, he's working for Apple.  His but his office is in Cupertino there in San Francisco.  It's just I'm going to it's not going to affect my coverage of Apple, obviously.  I'm going to still do it.  And it's it's not going to bias me against Apple.  In some ways, it biases me against the YouTube process because it's way too easy for somebody to do that.  Yeah.  But see, all along from day one, I never said, well, we're going to and I see people who've done that.  I feel bad for them.  Oh, we're going to Facebook Live is the future of our content or YouTube is the future of our content.  They've always been ancillary to our own broadcast and our own streams and our own downloads.  Do we talk about white genocide?  I think we did.  I missed that.  I'm OK about missing it.  But I did miss that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So did you see the Intercept was able to buy ads on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Targeted at people who were interested in white genocide.  Is this the idea of what is people killing people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, the fear that we want the white people will be killed.  The white race is going to be destroyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Yeah, these are those people.  It's anti-Semitic.  Yeah, it's anti-immigrant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Facebook said we're not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Earlier this week, the Intercept Sam Biddle writing for the Intercept was able to select white genocide conspiracy theory as a predefined  detailed targeting criterion.  Facebook said there are 168,000 users you're going to get.  Here's the actual.  And by the way, your ad is approved.  Well, let me say two things to this, if I may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One is, yeah, if you listen to Data Boyd Data Society, Joe Donovan there,  People are making up new phrases like incel all the time.  And the systems are a step behind.  So white genocide was was was a key to a to a to an evil kingdom that the bad guys put out there and then they populate things online.  And it's a strategy.  I'm going to hold it be holding a meeting next month.  I'm going to hold it.  I'm going to hold it.  I'm going to hold it.  I'm going to hold it.  I'm going to be holding a meeting next month about what Dana calls information voids just around this issue.  But to play gotcha on that is naive.  Second point, I can give you a very good scenario where you want to target those people.  You are a good actor trying to bring sense and sensibility to people looking at this crap.  It's a technique that is used against terrorism.  The State Department uses it.  Others use it where they find people who are searching on bad stuff so you can show them things that will try to counter that.  So to act like, oh my God, Facebook enabled this is sensationalistic and naive.  Facebook took it down immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, full disclosure here, remember that I raised money for my school from Facebook to work on just such problems as this, among others.  I'm independent of Facebook and I received money personally from Facebook or any other platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say that this is of course auto-generated, as most of these, all these terms would be.  But doesn't Facebook have a little bit of responsibility to have some humans comb through these looking for nasty things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could probably target an ad tomorrow based on big toe bunions.  I'll find all the people who talked about big toe bunions.  But it could be a dog whistle.  How would people possibly anticipate?  Right.  And you don't know.  So part of what we need to do, we in media need to work with the platforms, with a common mission against these bad actors.  And it is naive to think that Facebook should just be all knowing and know all of these things that come out.  If you listen to Data and Society, which I do, respect them immensely and also Claire Wardle at First Draft, these are experts in this area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But honestly, Jeff, if you were a human editor going through categories and you saw white genocide, you would have said, yeah, let's not self-ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Leo, it's not as if you have a finite list of categories.  I can, I assume this.  I can go and look for anybody who uses a string of words.  So it's not as if there's a catalog.  You take the book off.  Oh, here's all of our categories.  Oh, under W, it says white genocide.  That's a point.  No, it's that you're searching the entirety of public discussion to find a phrase and to try to target ads against that phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's after the fact generated.  Yeah, it's the same as Al Franken saying to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it Facebook or Google?  Rubles.  You should have seen Rubles.  Right.  When in fact there were legitimate ads coming in from Rubles, they didn't know what was happening.  Once they knew, not at all hard to say, oh, let's look at those Rubles ads.  Once you know white genocide is there, you get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook's response was to take it down.  Oh, OK.  Yeah, you shouldn't be able to buy that category.  No, of course not.  But there's going to be more because there's always more because you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And because the bad guys are using this not just for ad buying, but for dissemination.  So how does China solve this problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because they have this problem and their censorship is still pretty tight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have thousands upon thousands upon thousands of humans.  And they have catalogs trying to go around and try to find out what people are saying.  And you don't have any freedom of speech.  And they also have a mechanism to punish every citizen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I still bet stuff like this gets through.  The difference is you don't have a free press trying it.  Finding it.  Right.  I still bet.  I mean, stuff gets through all the time.  It's inevitable.  You can't get this.  There's too much activity.  There's too many possibilities.  And use coding, coded language.  Yeah.  I am gratified, though, to see that a survey of more than 3,400 US Facebook users found  that 44% of users 18 to 29 have deleted the app from their...  They didn't kill their accounts.  They just deleted the app from their phone in the last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not a bad...  I mean, I would...  I feel like there's definitely a movement to manage notifications, handle crap on your  phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So...  That was my...  It's the gateway drug.  That was the first thing I did is I removed Facebook and Twitter and Instagram from my  phones.  Then I removed it from my life.  Yeah.  But it's interesting.  Would you be worried if you were Facebook?  Is this number scary?  Young people are your future.  I guess.  Not people like me.  They don't care if a 61-year-old man deletes his Facebook account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but the young people are on Instagram.  They're not deleting Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point.  That's a very good point.  This is from the usual Pew survey of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I will say that I encounter...  And it frustrates the heck out of me.  I encounter lots of places, even like hotel chains, where if I want to text someone in  the hotel chain, I have to use Facebook Messenger.  And I'm like, oh, heck.  No, that's not businessy.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not businessy.  That's not what I want.  Facebook has informed me, however, that even though I've deactivated my Facebook account,  I could continue to use Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Facebook lets me know every week about...  I could get back on Instagram or get back on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, when I deactivated my account, both of you guys were sad.  It said you guys were going to miss me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I haven't been on my Facebook account in forever.  OK, it didn't say anything about you.  I mean, I really do miss you.  I am sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did pick a random nine people and say, these people are going to miss you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's true.  I actually...  Facebook knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're right.  Every time I deactivate, I get a new set of people.  It's good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't miss you, Leo.  I see you every week.  Yeah, you'll never miss me.  Unless you're on your mini cruises.  And then I'm like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am very excited because you no longer can miss me because I will soon be getting my  Facebook portal at the Facebook pop-up store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, don't even give them publicity on this.  Just don't.  Just pretend it doesn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't exist.  There is no portal.  There is no pop-up.  What's wrong with it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Are you kidding me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's wrong with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Facebook portal?  OK, I know the pop-up store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The pop-up store.  Well, what are they selling at the pop-up store?  No, they're putting in brands there.  They're putting in cool brands there that do well on Instagram.  Oh, it's kind of like here's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If the most...  See your reflex.  The most loved brands on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hit the D and oh, let's kick Facebook.  Some of the brands...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have a product called the portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If the pop-up store is called the portal.  They will be selling the portal.  They will be selling the portal.  Oh, like Amazon sells its stuff.  Yeah, they'll also be selling stuff from Love Your Melon and Two Blind Brothers.  So there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Macy's actually had a phenomenal portal of neat gadgets.  I happened to go through there only because it was raining like crazy a few weeks ago.  And there was this great selection in New York Macy's, world's largest department store,  of really neat stuff, well displayed.  And I don't think it was a Macy's brand such...  But I think they're trying to do...  So this is the same idea.  ...to market space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of like boutique-y inside a big department store.  Wait, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This gets into my thing from this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also gets into my number for the week.  Zip it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon's giving everyone free shopping on everything.  Free shipping.  And the shopping will be free.  Free shipping on everything for the holidays.  Thank you, Amazon.  Just one more reason to pee in a jar if you're an Amazon employee.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We finally...  You know, because you're working hard delivering all those free things.  Oh, I thought it was about drug testing.  No, no.  They have to pee in a jar because they can't take breaks.  That story used the word wildst as opposed to wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that mean this is only in Britain or Australia?  I love wildst.  Or is it true here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a great word.  I'm going to use wildst from now on.  And I've never referred to myself.  It's always going to be one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that true in the US or not?  One does not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or my favorite is the New Yorker.  This author.  Do we care where Amazon's HQ is going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like they're going to do two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One in New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How nefarious do you think this was?  That's what I want to know from you all.  How many what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How nefarious do you think this was?  Do you think this was a big data grab?  Nefarious.  You mean going to those cities and saying...  Getting all this data and being like, hey, now they can use it to open their warehouses or do other things?  We might.  They were shopping the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they were shopping the best tax break.  No, they were shopping the best tax break.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really wanted to do Newark because Newark needs them.  Newark already has Audible.  No, it's going to be Long Island City.  Long Island City, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell us about Long Island City, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Long Island City is right across the river.  And it was never hip because Queens was never hip.  But then Brooklyn got too effing expensive.  So now Queens is hipper.  And Long Island City is the first entry point of hip into Queens.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  I had a friend when I lived out there in 2000 and she lived in LIC.  And holy cow, you just never saw her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because it's so far away.  No, it's not actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's closer than a lot of hell, a lot of Brooklyn.  It's right across the river.  And you get views of Manhattan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's on the East River.  So yeah, you get the view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's nothing there except, well, there's some good, like,  random cheap international foods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Long Island City.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see that. I've seen this across the river.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's those buildings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like Emeryville.  That's right.  That's exactly where you go if you want real estate for new HQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except I would have to go over a bridge and that would scare me.  So I wouldn't go to Emeryville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's do a quick changelog. What do you say?  Oh, I like that reaction.  What?  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is a file they're playing, obviously, right?  Because we're doing it.  And the name used to be like S13599 or something, right?  Something.  But Carson knew that name.  And then when Carson went on vacation, the new guy couldn't find it.  Remember.  So he renamed it to Google changelog.  Now, Carson can't find it.  Why would you call it that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, can we run it again?  Because I want to see how many of those logos are now outmoded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's all out of date.  The Google changelog.  Out of date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Out of date.  Google Plus.  Out of date.  I think there was inbox in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Yeah, that's fun.  Eight noteworthy features coming to Chromebooks this very month.  Hello, Kevin.  I read about these things with Kevin.  JRFAL writing in the computer world.  These hidden gems.  Number one, new multitasking gestures.  Swipe down.  I can't wait to try this.  When you're using a convertible Chromebook in tablet mode, or you're using maybe the slate,  swipe down from the top of the screen.  That will let you drag an active app or browser window into a new multitasking interface where you can see it alongside of other open items.  Ooh, that's kind of Windows-y.  You can let go and drop the app into the open slot on the multitasking grid or drag it to either edge of the screen and snap it to that side and start a split screen view.  So try dragging down from the edge and then just see what happens there.  It's kind of complicated.  There's quite a bit more.  An Android-esque floating keyboard.  This is as of Chrome OS 70.  You can tap the second icon within the top row.  You see that funny?  I don't know if you can see it.  There's a funny little icon.  Tap that and the keyboard will go whoosh and it will shrink down into a little floating keyboard that you can move around by moving it around.  That's kind of cool.  And you can even tap the little squiggly line.  Let me show you that.  See that little squiggly line right there?  Tap that and now you can use your pen to write howdy.  And?  And? No, there's just wait.  There's more. Tap the microphone and you can start dictating.  So that's pretty nice.  That's pretty sweet.  By the way, that's partly because system-wide dictation has been added.  It's in accessibility as usual.  They hide it.  But you can turn it on.  Go to the settings. Type accessibility.  Manage accessibility features.  Keyboard and input.  Enable dictation. Speak to type.  And then you'll see a microphone icon in the bar.  It's kind of down in the notification bar.  See there?  And you can tap that at any time.  And start dictating.  You can see the app shortcuts.  This is also from Android.  Long press or right click or two finger click any icon in your Chromebook shelf.  And see a list of available shortcuts.  That's nice.  I use this feature a lot on Android.  And Apple has a similar feature with a force touch.  Force touch sounds bad.  It's not a force touch.  What is it?  Long touch?  No, it's not long. It's a 3D press.  3D touch?  It's a meaningful touch.  There was actually force touch for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was force touch.  Is it force touch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The files app now has the ability to let you browse and manage your storage connected to both play files.  That's anything associated with the Android app you've got installed.  And Linux files if you've got Crostini turned on.  So I don't know if you've played with the files app.  But it sees everything.  You can add Dropbox to it.  It's really a nice little way to access cloud data as well as Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how I use it all the time is cloud data.  Yeah, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All I have.  Yeah, you don't want to store it on the computer.  You want to keep it in the cloud.  An updated app drawer with smart suggestions.  Have you seen that yet?  I don't know if you've seen that.  And a quick desktop mode for detachable devices.  If you get like the Slate, you'll get a more traditional desktop Chrome OS when you're using it.  You'll get a more traditional desktop Chrome OS when you connect the physical keyboard.  You'll go into tablet mode.  These are all very Windows-y kind of adaptations.  Just watch it fella.  Windows. New wallpaper picker.  The wallpapers, you know, initially on a Chromebook you picked one and only one.  Then they got kind of rotating wallpaper.  Now they're doing the Android style daily refresh.  And they have a lot more styles too.  Nice.  Thank you JR.  JR Raphael with some of the new features coming to Chromebooks with Chrome OS 7.  We did already mention photoable devices.  That would have been in the change log.  But I moved it up because I think it's interesting.  Newsworthy.  Yep.  Step into the sights of sound with Pixel 3.  Powered by YouTube Music.  I have no idea what this is.  But it's creepy.  It's the future.  It's the future.  Corpuscles.  Kind of crazy. I don't know.  To show you some of the new features on the Pixel 3 phone, we created sights of sound powered by YouTube Music.  An immersive pop-up experience coming to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Miami, and Hotlanta this fall.  Step inside rooms inspired by four musicians.  Use your Pixel 3 to navigate, capture, and share the experience.  And there will be a puzzle that you'll have to solve using your Google Lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my god. What if this is the future of entertainment?  So we're moving beyond the empty pop-up museums like the Museum of Ice Cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what this is. This is a pop-up museum.  But it's a Google one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it also has a puzzle.  It's like Mist meets the Instagram generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I expect your Instagram feed to be loaded with these, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have a Pixel 3.  What? You don't have a Pixel 2?  I have a Pixel 2.  I thought it was Pixel 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can use your lens.  Yeah, it has to be a Pixel 3.  I don't have a Pixel 3 either.  First time I haven't had a phone in me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't miss this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm okay without it. You know, I tried the Google emoji thingies and they suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the AR stuff where your Iron Man drops in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, where you decorate your whole little thing in the G-Port.  Yeah, that was terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was not worth getting a second of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It did not have any blue stripes.  You know what you're going to like then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Sephora tutorials on your Google Home Hub.  Oh, I love Sephora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Alright, here's Everyday Contour Tutorial on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here it comes.  Yeah.  There's also a Smokey Eyes video.  Ooh!  Foundation tips.  Sarah Sanders.  And bold lip colors.  And if you happen to live near one of the ten flagship Sephora stores,  which you do not,  you can stop in to check out the Dream Vanity Experience.  Use the in-store Google Home Hub to nail your favorite night on the town look,  get the perfect Smokey Eye,  and see many other things that the Hub can do.  Or just watch press conference.  Google Home Hub is now available for sale on Sephora.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did pull the YouTube, I mean this is YouTube content.  This isn't a Sephora person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's, it's kind of interesting, it's just a branding deal right with Sephora,  but it shows that Google, I mean this is,  they're going after women, right?  Or RuPaul, I don't know.  I could have made a terrible joke.  I know where you were going, I know.  Hey, I like, I like Agit Pai.  He says, it's time we stopped robocallers.  This is the best thing that the chairman of the FCC has done.  He says, you guys by next year have got to figure this out.  Robocalls are out of control.  He wants companies to adopt a call authentication system to identify these.  He wants answers by November 19th on the status of these efforts.  He called out Sprint in particular among others saying, you let too many through.  So I have to say I'm behind this one.  Canada has already set a 2019 deadline to kill robocalls,  and now the US says the same thing.  He wrote to the major telephone service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can they even get rid of them because because the robocalls are fooling.  No, no, well, they're also fooling the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the theory is they do some sort of caller ID on them, authentication,  so that you can answer your phone with confidence, Jeff.  By this time next year, says Agit Pai,  I expect consumers will begin to see this on their phones.  So it's going to take a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I apologize. I forgot that I set off everyone's thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's OK. Everybody's getting smoky eye tips right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I need smoky eye tips. That is what I'm going to look up.  Although I don't know how to converse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You keep ignoring my Sarah Huckabee Sanders jokes, but that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your what?  Smoky eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sarah Huckabee Sanders jokes.  Smoky eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And one terabyte of free storage and limit free users.  Oh, Smug Mug bought Flickr. I love Smug Mug.  We did an interview with the Christmas Caskell,  who's the CEO and founder of Smug Mug, about his intent.  That's on our triangulation show a couple of weeks ago.  Because we knew that, you know, Yahoo was not the best steward of Flickr,  which is a great photo sharing site, but Smug Mug should be and will be.  One of the first things they announced, though,  is that they're going to end the free terabyte of storage  and limit free users to 1,000 photos.  Smug Mug is a paid service,  and it sounds like they want people to sign up for Flickr Pro  if they're going to use it for more than 1,000 photos,  but they will add some other features as well.  If you have photos on Flickr after January 8th,  they will start deleting them.  Actually, February 5th, they'll start deleting them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will they send you an email and offer to have you pay for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, presumably they are going to do that.  Oh, OK. I was like, jeez.  No, this is it. This is your only notice.  If your email isn't your old Yahoo email.  Well, that's the problem. It might go to your Yahoo account.  Paid customers, $50 a year for Flickr Pro,  which I've always paid for and I will continue to pay for,  will be given unlimited storage for photos and videos at full resolution,  no ads, additional data on how their photos are performing  because there's a whole social aspect to it,  premier customer service, you can do videos up to 10 minutes long,  that used to be three,  and discounts from Adobe, Smug Mug, Peak Design, and more.  And if you sign up for Flickr Pro through November 30th, 30% off.  I know, yeah, no more free,  but free is not tenable in the long run,  and I'm glad to see Flickr under new management.  These guys are really good, so I already pay for Flickr Pro,  I'll continue to do that. I also pay for Smug Mug, I love Smug Mug.  So the cloud ain't free, kids.  And finally, oh, do we finish the changelog? I forgot.  Yes.  Blow the trumpet.  Pound the trumpet.  Blow the drum.  The changelog time has come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you were going to say that changelog is now done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's now done, thank you, I'm sorry.  You are a good editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do what I can to make you sound your best, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is Spaceship Media? Did you put this in here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, we already talked about them.  We talked about them already.  Was I here?  Yes, you were.  Don't tell Uncle Leo.  He's getting a little wiffy.  A little punchy here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got to leave in five minutes, so let me do the last ad of the show,  and your tips and numbers will be next.  Our show today brought to you by DigitalOcean.  I had a web designer call me on the radio show on Sunday and said,  I do a lot of web design, different projects have different versions of JavaScript  and other tools that I'm using, and I can't really maintain them all on my local computer.  Do you think signing up for an account at DigitalOcean would help?  Yes!  Unsolicited!  I really appreciate it because it's exactly what DigitalOcean is great with.  DigitalOcean offers you a cloud platform, it's cloud-based,  that lets you manage, deploy, scale applications easily, quickly,  provision them, spin them up, wind them down as needed for a very low cost.  It's a great way to have multiple development environments, for instance,  and then work in the one you want to, log in to another one.  It's a great way, for instance, on the iPad, I've already set this up,  I use Blink, which is a great iPad SSH shell to log in to my DigitalOcean accounts,  and then I can do programming, I can do Node.js, I can do my blog, I can do anything.  It's really awesome.  I'm going to log in to my DigitalOcean account very quickly here,  so I can show you how easy it is to spin up a DigitalOcean instance.  What's nice about it, it's very affordable.  You can have many of them, I do, at a very low cost.  They can be public sites.  In fact, if you create a DigitalOcean app as a minimum viable product,  and suddenly it takes off, no problem, continue to use it,  add CPUs, add memory, add volumes, it's very flexible.  DigitalOcean is really one of the ways that this world has changed from the old days,  when if you wanted to do a web app, if you wanted to create something with a cloud presence,  it cost you a lot of money, you had to set up servers, you had to do a lot of work,  and it was all kind of speculative, like you may never get that money back.  Now, I am jealous of you young people.  It's so easy to set up a DigitalOcean server.  I have a few running right now, but let me create a...  They call them droplets, like droplets in the ocean, so let's create a new droplet.  There are other things you can do, and I want to invite you to visit do.co.  You'll get $100 credit so you can play around with this.  You see I have different operating systems, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Fedora, Debian, CentOS,  but I can also do container distributions.  I can do CoreOS, Fedora, Atomic Rancher OS, and then add the containers that I choose.  There's even one-click apps.  This is going to provision a server.  Let's just set up a Docker server. What do you say?  I'm going to click Docker. I'm going to choose the level.  I'm cheap, so I'm going to start with the $5 a month, 0.007 cents per hour level.  That's a CPU, a gigabyte of memory, 25 gigs of storage, a terabyte of transfer.  Man, that used to cost a lot more. You want backups? I always enable backups.  That's a dollar a month. I'm not going to add block storage now,  but I can always do it after the fact. Choose your server anywhere in the world,  Bangalore, Toronto, San Francisco, New York, Amsterdam, and on and on and on.  I always use SSH logins. I can name it. I won't. I'll just say create.  Now watch, because I am actually provisioning a server right now with a public IP address,  a complete operating system, SSH with my keys, plus I get a 99.99% uptime SLA.  There's a cloud firewall, which I of course always turn on, monitoring and alerting,  full DNS management. There's data centers all over the world, enterprise-grade SSDs.  The API is easy too. Over 150,000 businesses, including some of the world's fastest-growing startups,  rely on DigitalOcean to remove infrastructure friction and deliver industry-leading price performance.  And as I'm speaking, my Docker instance is almost done.  By the way, notice the usage so far. This month, $4.52. It's cheap.  There it is. I got a Docker instance. It's provisioned. It's ready to go.  It's got a public IP. I could turn on a private IP, IPv6. I can resize it as needed.  Running Ubuntu and Docker 1806. Don't you love that?  do.co slash twit will give you a free $100 credit. That's going to go a long, long way.  Get your next project started. If for learners, for people who want to learn how to do this stuff,  it's such a great, if you script the server, you just delete the droplet start over.  It is just fantastic. I've got Node.js running here. I've always got Emacs.  I'm running a ghost server, some Django because I want to play with some Python frameworks.  I told Kevin about this. This is awesome. If you're on a Chromebook, you just SSH into your server  and you could do all of this stuff. They've got load balancing and a whole lot more.  do.co slash twit to get started with $100 credit.  DigitalOcean, designed for developers, built for business, and actually in my eyes,  the best little toy a guy could ever want. I love it.  DigitalOcean. Stacy, your pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just changed it. I was going to do Oprah's favorite things because that just came out today, but I didn't care for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Oprah apparently is President Trump's favorite thing.  Did you hear him talking about her?  He says she's been to Mar-a-Lago. We used to be good friends. I don't know what happened, he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so she put out her favorite things. If you're into that, her tech stuff is not very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think they really are her favorite things or is it just advertising, honestly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She did a deal clearly with Amazon because everything is available on Amazon, even the Apple stuff, which isn't actually.  So she definitely has an affiliate deal going with this.  Anyway, we're going to skip to that because I found something way cooler.  So you are going to have to give your email to download the actual presentation.  But I used to be a broadband reporter, so I used to have cable maps on my wall from Telegeography.  I love this company. They map internet cables like Subterranean, Submarine, Subterranean, well, that too, Submarine cables.  And this actually talks about dead cables or cables that are not in use anymore, that have extended past their economic life.  It's kind of cheesy and it was done in the spirit of Halloween.  But it gives you examples of what happens when the undersea cables that provide internet and connect the world become economically useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here is a 4250-kilometer cable linking American Samoa to Hawaii.  Nobody uses it. It's just sitting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so sometimes they pull them up because some governments require you to pull them up.  Sometimes they leave them there at the bottom of the ocean floor.  But I just thought that was interesting because a lot of people, it's kind of the invisible infrastructure of the internet.  If you go and download the full presentation that it links to, it's kind of a funny little presentation.  It talks about kind of why something, why this happens and when it may not happen.  So, yeah. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When cables age out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know it's really super nerdy, but I love thinking about this stuff.  Do you have these on your walls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder what the original undersea...  I used to.  Yeah, you can buy these. They're beautiful maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have in 2014 or maybe it was 2013, they had a beautiful old world hereby dragons style one.  Yes.  And I bought that one.  I have that somewhere. I loved that.  And I used to have a spectrum chart on my wall, the FCC spectrum chart.  Wow, that is nerdy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's geeky. That's very geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was really useful in my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still geeky.  I know.  That's why we like you.  That's why we love Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So read that if you're interested in that. I think it's, I don't know, I like making that stuff visible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. And Oprah's list will be here next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She put the Echo Spot on you guys. Okay, it's just lame.  I like the Echo Spot. It's in my closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know you do.  Yeah. It's not my bedroom though.  What? No. Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this will piss off Stacey.  So...  It's not Oprah's. It's not Oprah's list.  Is it Oprah's favorite thing?  No, it's kind of. It's kind of.  So for the sake of the show, I decided to take my lunch hour today and I went downtown and I went to the Google pop-up store and the Amazon four star store.  Oh.  Just to see what they were like.  The Google pop-up store is all trying to be too cool and all that.  That's where I saw the slate and saw that.  Oh, nice.  I don't think so.  And by the way, the trackpad wasn't working so I thought, oh man, you've got to use the screen all the time.  But somebody else had the same problem.  And the guy in the store said, yeah, the problem is it's got Chrome 71 on it and it's buggy.  Oops.  But so they had everything there is what it is. Little cute stuff. Not very exciting.  There's not much to do.  I think they're making the mistake not selling some Google swag or Google this or Google that, you know, something you can say, oh, it's the Google store.  But that's fine. So then I went to the Amazon four star.  And these things have been around, but I haven't I haven't seen them.  This is everything rated four stars and above.  Everything?  Not everything. Everything in it has been rated.  We have an Amazon store.  So it's not the Amazon store.  It's not the bookstore.  This is a different store and it is cluttered as can be.  It's kind of Wal-Marty.  Obviously, it has all the fire sticks you could ever want in life and all that.  But it has pet toys and kitchen gadgets, little kitchen gadgets, big and notebooks and books and like just two small racks of books and toys and all kinds of stuff.  It was kind of overwhelming in a way.  But these pictures look nutty.  Yeah, they are. I took a picture.  I should have said to Karsten, but it's pretty amazing.  So so they've popped up in a few cities and you can go to the four star store and actually as as as kind of claustrophobic as I found it, it is a decent browsing opportunity for gifts and things.  There were things like I didn't know that existed.  Of course, you're going to both have five of these, I'm sure.  The high speed super duper air fryers.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Megan just got one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our June ovens have air frying.  Exactly.  We have convection ovens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't need that.  Have you ever used it that way, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I have.  I've made chicken tenders.  They were delicious.  Really? All right.  I have to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And no fat, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's always fat in anything I make because fat makes things taste good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never tasted the worst chicken tender without fat.  There's nothing, nothing worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like in the park right nearby office.  They have ice skating in the winter and they have food stalls and Christmas stalls and all that kind of stuff.  So I went and they had empanadas.  I had a small one.  So I had one chicken empanada, which is fine.  Then I had a cheese empanada and and it's just this is feeling of wondrous joy that comes over you with good cheese.  You know, I agree.  The other thing they have there that I haven't gone to yet because it's not cold enough yet is the baked cheese house.  Oh, my God.  Reclet. Reclet.  Reclet.  I love it.  I love it.  Watch the thing bubble.  Yeah.  And then they take this wonderful baguette and they scrape the melted cheese onto the baguette.  I saw that last year when we were in New York.  A little bit of cheese.  Yeah.  A little mustard, few corny shaw.  No better sandwich in the world.  Cheese just gives you a sense of well-being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turns out there's reason behind our craving.  The cheese contains casein.  It also contains casein fragments called, get this, caseo morphins, a casein derived morphine like compound.  Basically, dairy protein has opiate molecules built in.  When consumed, these fragments attached to the brain receptors, the same ones that heroin and other narcotics attach to, you're stoned, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  I will, I will stone up on caseo with you, man.  It does explain a lot.  Oh, I should have told people about this.  I'm going to tell you really quick because it's almost the holidays.  If you do outdoor lighting, the iDevices, Madam A, and I think Google Home and maybe even HomeKit enabled outdoor outlet is $45 right now on Amazon.  That is a good price for that.  If you're looking for that, please do not buy the knockoff ones because those are not UL listed.  I feel that UL listing is really important in your plug.  Fairly for outside.  So, but this is $45.  The other ones, it doesn't require a hub.  If you like want to do outdoor lighting, I'm going to tell you this is amazing.  You set it up, then you can tell Madam A or Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it this one?  Yes.  I'm buying them because you know why?  We've never done this before, but we hired somebody to decorate the house.  Oh, good God.  Lisa says you're too old to get on the ladder.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah, but we're not too old to enjoy Christmas.  So how many of these do I need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How nerdy are you going to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many strands you need to plug in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to get five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have six.  Six?  Well, because I have a rooftop.  I have two front balconies.  I have a back.  I have the snow globe thing in the front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you say, echo, turn on the snow globe, and it does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you not seen my Vimeo video of Alexa turn on Christmas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have we?  I'm sure you guys have.  It's an annual tradition.  I should save it for next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll do it next time because you got to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should I really get these?  But wait a minute, what are you plugging them into?  Your Christmas lights.  Oh, and the other side is plugged into somewhere.  You have to have power.  But I guess I got to get it.  This isn't magic.  Extension cords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it plugs it.  So this basically turns, it voice activates, or remote control activates your outdoor lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a tip for my pick of the week.  Be careful what you buy on Amazon.  For instance, if you buy a butt head mask, let's just say, and then every time you go to Amazon, it says,  here's your recent order of a butt head mask.  It kind of takes the fun out of going to Amazon.  I'm just saying.  Don't, and if you do, don't buy it on Amazon.  That butt head mask is going to haunt my Amazon forever now.  And it's going to go everywhere, all around the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why did you buy this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why did you buy a butt head mask, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it'd be funny.  It is funny.  I'm enjoying it tremendously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have it.  You want to see it?  It was short.  I like Stacy.  Here's her video.  Go ahead.  Just say it for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I say turn on Christmas.  And it'll, it takes a 10.  It's on Vimeo.  Oh, there it goes.  Oh, play holiday music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, holiday classics on prime music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so festive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alexa, turn off downstairs lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh, so festive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope you get a million views on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I think I had that up forever.  We don't need a million views.  It's just.  It's on Vimeo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't get anything for that.
