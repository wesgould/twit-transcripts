Transcript:  It's time for twig this week in Google you're gonna need a nap for this one Stacey Higgum Botham's back at Pruitt's in the house  Jeff Jarvis, too. We will be talking about Amazon's purchase of Roomba Stacey's got it all figured out  I think she's absolutely right Elon Musk selling seven billion dollars in Tesla shares  But why and why were scientists?  Hiding an encryption key for the Wizard of Oz in a plastic molecule. It's all coming up next on twig

Hello everybody. I'm Leo Laporte your host joining us a  stranger in paradise Stacey Higgum Botham  Yay from Stacey on iot.com at gig a Stacey  She is also the host of the iot podcast with Kevin Toffle. Hello Stacey. We miss you when you're not here  Even though I had to be it gives us a chance to have other lovely people on  It ain't the same and I'm getting all excited about Clara and the Sun and Stacey's book club coming up in a couple of weeks  It's so exciting  Also here from hands-on photography the one the only aunt poet  also community manager of our discord and planner of great things like Stacey's book club I  Attempt anyway, you do you not only attempt you do  Alex Lindsay's asked me anything is a week from Thursday Stacey's book club two weeks from Thursday and I think other things are brewing  Yes, sir as we speak including hands-on Macintosh and hands-on window with windows with Micah Sargent and Paul Thuratt respectively  Although I think for April Fool's they should each do the other  Why not why not  Actually, they're both completely capable of doing that also with us. Mr. Jeff Jarvis. He is the town night professor  Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the  At the City University of New York, hello, mr. Jarvis  Hello boss. Hello Jarvis been watching a lot of TV lately a lot of those news channels  keeping busy  They've been keeping busy. Yeah. Yes  Yeah, right and stuff right and stuff over there. Let's see what you're writing  I'll show us what you're writing is the whiteboard full so one of those is the Gutenberg manuscript

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another one is the magazine book manuscript and next to that is to book proposal. Nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So you have a window seat just for manuscripts. That's really cool  Every author should honored place. Yes, if you find Truman Capote's long-lost novel there, just let us know would you I just hope the cat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't go and scratch it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Capote I should I was just watching a documentary he gave  His this this book answer prayers, which is all about New York socialites and and they're horrible  Secrets he gave a key to one of his dear friends  He said it and this is the key to the safety deposit box, but neglected to tell her where the safety deposit  I  Was reminded of this by our pre-show discussion of you know, where do you store your important documents?  Do people still choose do you why don't you do a safety deposit box instead of a something in your house?  I guess it's hard to get to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean we actually I think we have a safety deposit box. Oh, okay. Yeah, I always wanted one

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I felt like that's when you're a grown-up  Well, that's why I need my jewels. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My jewels my jewels

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Let's see, I guess we should mention this morning a poor Jason Howell and  Ron Ron Ron Reynolds had to get up Ron. What's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The end of Leo's week everyone's into my

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Things whining dad Ron Richards Jason how yesterday I called Jason Snell Jason how so it's all it all evens out

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Morning at 6 a.m. I was I was  Snoring but Jason and Ron came in and showed everybody the new galaxy z flip 4  I'm surprised they let the z stay they were rumors  They would get rid of the Z because that's the letter that the Russians use for their Ukrainian

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't yeah, no  The Russians own  We can't let the Russians kill the alphabet. So Stacy good news your z flip 3 is not so really out of date

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's only a few little I'm really excited. They're still investing in it because I actually really like the phone  It's a great and I'm I'm excited too. Okay, so Samsung's doing their bespoke z fold things with color  like custom colors and  Samsung actually introduced that in their kitchen appliances and they're doing it with their  Refrigerators and everything else and it's their whole bespoke. So it's it kind of if I'm thinking big picture  I'm like, it's like we're getting this aesthetic from  Like our homes and bringing it to our plot like our computers and that's kind of a nice feeling

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It lets our linoleum phone. It's not the first time anybody did this the moto z right when Google owned Motorola  That had was that a z also  What was the moto  Anyway, the X it was moto X not X. That's what Russians don't have that letter yet moto X  Had the whole exact same thing bespoke. You could get all the different colors and everything build your own  I think that's a cool idea apples done it with their Apple watches, you know match mix and match bands and  Embodies and so forth. So I like yeah, I like that 49 possible color combinations that has to be a record for the z flip  Three no, that's last year. Oh, wait a minute. So they did this last year  Never mind  The z flip for malls. So well, no, I thought this bespoke thing was brand new like Stacy, but it's not you know  They've done the Berks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mr. Burke stopped me this morning when I was in in the TD booth for floss weekly and he asked me about this event  And he's like, well, did you watch it?  And I was and I told him hey all love and respect to mr  Howell, but I was not interested in this Samsung event because phones just don't excite me anymore. It's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm kind of with you. I'm kind of with you on that  I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What it's nice me when we hear that Craig Craig Craig Newmark that excites me too, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  My heart starts pounding does do you think so I  Have had the fold I had two of them  I haven't been by the last year edition and as you know, I had the flip which I gave to you Stacy and you still  Use it, right? So do you think you believe her in photo foldables? I really like it. It's fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It reminds me of like you flipping your phone open and you're like, hello  It's compact in your pocket. I think it fits in my pocket

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's more sense to me than the fold. Have you had that angry hang up yet though? Have you oh, I'm so sick  You done that? Oh, I heard that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just like the phone breaking Wow, I don't actually talk in the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You can pre-order now for August 28th on the flip and the fold and there's a new galaxy watch  Five but I'm kind of with you. It's hard for me to get  Jazzed up, you know, we are gonna have an Apple event sometime in the next 30 days  Mm-hmm, or maybe a little bit longer. We're gonna have that pixel 7  Event and the pixel watch event  and in every case these are just kind of  You know incremental improvements on existing devices. It is hard to kind of get too excited about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd be more curious about the watch than the phone, you know, yeah. Well, this is now that's incremental

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's just better battery life. Yeah, although they did they say five day battery  Like 80 hour battery life because that was the rumor. I didn't are they using the new Qualcomm chips

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, they're actually design. Okay. Yeah, that's why they're getting better battery life. Yeah, they also mentioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's gonna be in a change like but I'll mention it now that where OS is gonna get a revamp placed or where OS has really been  revitalized by Samsung's participation  Where OS 3.5 ships on the galaxy watch 5 and the watch 5 Pro  They'll also have Google Maps for where OS  With support for offline navigation, which I think is kind of interesting. That's cool  Used to be you had to tether it to your smartphone  But now later this year Google says

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Offline from the phone or the or the phone offline from the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The watch just on the watch watch doesn't have to talk to the phone and coming soon find your way using Google Maps from your  wrist without a smartphone connection

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How how much storage is on these devices and how tiny are those files to do? Well, here's my prediction. Here's my prediction

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The this will only be on a watch that has GPS built-in not all do okay battery killer  And it will you'll have to save ahead of time  You'll have to save local maps which Google Maps lets you do if that Google Maps even caches maps  So I you may not have to  Proactively save a map, but those aren't those are a few hundred megabytes. So  I mean these watches now have four gigabytes and more so there's plenty of storage on these watches. Okay. Yeah  See, I didn't know that they're not that big. I  you know, but  There's some issues. Of course, if you leave a map going to navigate that's gonna kill battery life  This is all stuff that I think is in response to the bigger battery sizes in the new Qualcomm chip

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We can do more because well, it's sorry. Yeah, it's not bigger battery sizes. It's more capability

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, they actually beefed up the battery as well. I think in the watch 5 the galaxy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, but that's not Qualcomm. That's Samson, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So where OS is alive and well or it's at least it's alive  When does the the Google watch we have any date they so in the past they've done it both ways before and after Apple's event

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  a

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Few years ago they did it before we were thinking to you know, surprise everybody before Apple and then I think last year  Didn't they announce the pixel 6 after Apple? I think that's right. Yeah, so it's unknown  It's unknown  Apple has said that or at least  analysts say the Apple  New Apple iPhone 14 will not be impacted by supply chain shortages because Apple buys up all of DSM C's production ahead of time  Etc. Etc. They are on they're already producing the iPhone 14  But I have to think that is not necessarily good for Google and Samsung and others  Who makes the Qualcomm chips is it TSMC as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stacy they have T TSMC and they had just signed a deal this week with global foundries to their stuff as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, this is becoming a big issue  Actually, Ben Thompson's tritechary has a very good piece today. I think it's subscriber only talking about  the power  That these foundries have because there's so few of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's because it's freaking expensive to make choice and right  I mean this was  Global foundries was AMD getting out of making their own chips and teaming up with IV remember like way back in  2007 and like 7 AMD IBM they all got together and they were like  We've got to figure out the next generation of chip semiconductor manufacturing. They're like, it's so freaking expensive and then they're like, yeah screw it  Let's spin it all out in the global foundries and one of the side effects of this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Nvidia  Tumbling in having a terrible quarter  Because demand decreased on its GPUs  Mostly because the crypto market crashed but as a result  Nvidia was stuck between a rock and a hard place. They had contracts with TSMC and other foundries  They couldn't get out of so demand tumbles but they still have to buy the chips  So huge losses and that's that's Ben's take away from this is boy. It's a good time to be a foundry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean this is big and I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I was just gonna express for frustration. Like this is just economic cycles. This is just how it goes  You don't want to be in the foundry business making chips because most of the time it's a crappy place to be  You know, you can't necessarily anticipate demand you've got to put in huge capex expenses and hope like heck you get them, you know  amortized over time properly and  So yeah now it's a great time to be a factory  I guarantee you the next cycle is going to be a terrible time to be foundry and  Sorry, I'm just frustrated with what feels screamingly obvious getting  You go in I'm in a bad mood  No, I was just thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nvidia is not  There the only thing in the basket isn't you but aren't they big in AI space right now?  You're clicking in and out. I don't know why

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Uh-oh, sorry  Their chips are used in training and inference for machine learning cars AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, big time. Yeah, but  All of the up ramp up in the last year and several years has been crypto

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And now what's happening is all the all the cryptocurrency guys are dumping their GPUs  So there's a glut of used GPUs on the market prices have dropped for brand new GPUs  So there's a glut of used GPUs on the market prices have dropped for brand new GPUs  It's been very very bad for Nvidia  Very very bad for Nvidia

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, I mean it was nice to see the GPU price come down though that that's great for gamers

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Can't knock that  And actually this is he ties it in as well to the  The  imminent  Change in ethereum from proof of stake to from proof of work to proof of stake  which is a new way of mining coin that does not involve GPUs or  Hideous consumption of energy. This has you know been promised for a long time ethereum is planning this in september  A lot of miners are upset. In fact, there's a fork  Proposed now that does continue to use proof of work  It the they're calling they call this the merge  Clever the merge and it's going to be a little disruptive  so  continued  headwinds a continued cocktail of headwinds as the cfo of apple said  And  Anyway, it's interesting time I do recommend ben thompson's  Stratechery, I think it's a he he's we haven't talked about him in a long time, but he's really  Very good in this. Do you read him every day?  I you know, it's ironic. One of the reasons we haven't talked about about him in a long time is because I hadn't read him in a  while  But somebody I saw somebody on on the twitter  Say, oh wow ben's really really on firing on all cylinders today. This was yesterday as he does  Because of this kind of confluence of gpu and vidya ethereum  uh, you know tsmc  And he's done a good job. I think a very good job of kind of combining all of these economic forces  Whatever stacy says I think there is something going on. That's very interesting  Yeah, maybe it's just cycles  Let's see, let me see if I can find uh  Nvidia said put out a warning that second quarter sales would fall well short of forecast amid a drop in gaming revenue  the company expects  17 drop from what they'd forecast in may and a 33 drop in gaming revenue  So  Nvidia stock of course plummeted as a result  Preliminary results for gaming down 44 sequentially  And then this is this is the nvidia versus tmc section  East cap a protected account of a fantastic insight that's worth sharing broadly  The irony of a dedicated foundry tsmc enabling fabless to flourish  Is the moat on leading edge is so wide now the part of the capex burden is getting shifted back  To the fabless in the form of lta's. I don't know what that means, but yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So basically they're saying they have so much power. That's the long-term pricing agreements between the two of them  That's the problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You can you you take these agreements, but then if uh market the bottom falls out of the market

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Intel is getting hammered because forever they were not a foundry and they built their own fabs and I mean  That's why it's so that's why i'm so over it. I'm just like oh screw you wall street  You just don't understand what it takes to make things and you're just trying to financially optimize for stuff and i'm sick of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  He he ben even cops to this he's been he was one years ago urging I think in 2013 intel to become a  Foundry not just an integrated device manufacturer now that intel's done it  Problems problems problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, well, no, it's actually good that intel's done it because their their market share was plummeting in servers  And they couldn't make it they need it because they were gonna it's a better long-term strategy

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Even if it's a short-term problem, I think right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, so the issue is you build a fab  To make a fab make money because this is like a five ten sometimes fifteen billion dollar investment. This is not trivial  Oh, it's huge. Yes, you have to push  Silicon out  all day  24 7 and you have to sell that to people and it has to go into things and it has to do it very quickly  so  Intel wasn't they didn't have the demand anymore for just their chips  So they had to open it up to others because you can't not make chips if you have invested in a fab. Otherwise, it's  It's a money-losing asset

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And hand basically what does it take what does it take to reconfigure from one chip to another

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It depends on the chip and so the fabs are tied to a process, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So if you make if you build a five nanometer fab, that's a five meter millimeter fab  Unless you completely reconfigure it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so your fab is going to run at whatever process node or that particular line, but usually it's a whole fab  But you also then for every chip there's a mask that you make it's a it's the  It's like a it's the letter for like letterpress  So it's the mask. Oh speaking my language. Yes. Yeah, I'm like what do you call it? So what would you have to make a mask and  Those are millions of dollars. So qualcomm design something they get it put into a mask and then that goes to the fab  And then that's what they use to like etch out the chips. It's actually not a press

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's an etching but I guess it's probably a good idea at this point to define  Terms here where there's the fabrication plants that actually make the chips  There are the fabless foundries like invidia that design them but don't make them and then contract out to have them made  And there are the integrated companies which intel was for years it both designs and builds its own  processors  Intel's under pat under their new ceo pack elzinger has decided that they're going to in effect be two businesses that they will be  a fabless  Chip design company, but they will also build fabs  Uh, i'm not sure how that's different from integrated but everybody seems to think it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's just that they they designed to build their own chips though. Intel was like now they're gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Here's the difference they're gonna build chips for other companies. They want to take they right they never did  We want to build for apple now and so that all of this is relevant  To everybody listening right now. They may not this may seem like abstruse  But this is what the chip shortage is all about and this is well, it's not just about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there's also packaging so like these little chips come off the they come out on a wafer  You break the you break it up and then you package it into  A board with pins and everything like that. So  The what one of the challenges with the chip supply  Isn't just that these chips aren't being made fast enough and they're usually those made it like older fabs  It's that it might be made in taiwan and then it goes someplace else to get packaged and then it comes  Back to the vendor and it might go someplace else to get packaged later on a board  And then it goes back to like there's like a lot of steps there

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  so there's serious concerns for two reasons one of course because of the chip shortage, but also because  Uh tsmc is in taiwan a lot of these chips are made in in taiwan  And if taiwan is in geopolitical trouble with china  Nancy pelosi goes there. She meets with tsmc all of a sudden china is telling apple don't ship us anything from taiwan  We won't accept it. So there's this whole geopolitical issue  Going on and then there's the chips act which with the chips and science acts which were signed into law yesterday  Uh, which includes 52 billion dollars in funding to get companies to build  Semiconductor fabs in the u.s. TSMC has a very big fab  Uh that that they've broken ground on but won't be done for two more years intel is was waiting for this money  They were waiting. It's a 20 billion dollar fab  They were waiting for federal funds before they broke ground on their arizona fab  So that's cool. You can put money into it, but these fabs take years to build  It's going to be years before the chips enter the supply chain, but it's just like planting a tree  I've said it before it's the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best time is today  Uh, we're we wish we built these fabs a while ago because we are very dependent on taiwan silicon

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and the other thing to think about is these chip factories the fabs that we're building  Today to go into production in a couple years  Our  New process nodes. So a lot of these are the most advanced process nodes  But a lot of our chip shortages are actually on some of the older like yeah, yeah like 40 nanometers  Sometimes even 65. I mean these are like for for context  We're talking like the most advanced nodes are like three nanometers, which is insane  um  so  like  We're building all these like high-end fancy. It's like we're going to build all these like ferraris, but we still need  Like some kias for everybody else, but we're not actually building those here in the u.s  So we're still going to be reliant on  Chips from other places for quite some time  I mean there are still fabs in the u.s that are making things at like 140 nanometers and  You know even in mexico there's some but anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The tsmc fab in arizona is a five nanometer fab  Yeah, so that's very good that I mean there is a three nanometer process and I think that's still in taiwan  But at least the five nanometer  The five nanometer node is here and that's by the way what apple uses right now and it's iphones is five nanometers  um  Yeah, this is a complex subject is a lot of it's very capital intensive  There's some debate about whether the government should be putting 52 billion dollars into the  Domestic semiconductor manufacturing. I think it seems like something we need to do to be competitive  with china and to protect ourselves against taiwan being  Attacked there's a lot more in this by the way. It's a 280 billion dollar act. We've talked about this before  Money goes to the national science foundation to invent new processes  This is a fascinating story with tsmc because of apple pouring all this money into tsmc in taiwan  Tsmc was able to develop new processes for apple which they could then sell to other companies  And so they've really leapfrogged american companies in terms of processes. That's why they could do a three  three nanometer alike process and so  You know, I think a lot of american companies are saying well, you know apple's  You're you're you're you're supporting tsmc  Maybe you could you know bring it home  I don't think apple's showing any inclination to do that. Although  You know, they probably are worried about all their stuff being made in taiwan and china

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We did get a huge boost back when the u.s. Government invested in some tech back in like the  late 80s early 90s  and so I do think there's like  There's going to be advantages  In figuring out how to I mean because again, we're all like ah, where's law is over. What do we do now?  um  There's tons of opportunity for us to bring new manufacturing  Here and I would love to see some of that money going towards  research in not necessarily  Like just intel for building plants, right? So the stuff going to research we could see some like cool new tools develop  We could even see things not tied to like chips that we think of as chips, but like  Solar that's all chips, right?  So maybe we'll see some new materials research. There's like a lot of opportunity here that we just  But it'll be like 20 years out the benefits to us, right but we should be doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Okay, that's all it you know the politics of this are really interesting there was an article in the new republic  About Keynesian economic theory versus milton friedman and of course we've been  In and i'm sure jeff you have something to say about this, but we've been in a friedman  like a state  Well certainly since reagan but maybe even before that and some are saying look this is what you know in the past  Government has invested in things like chip factories and it built a strong middle class. It built a strong economy  but as soon as  Reagan and others came along  Embracing milton friedman's philosophy the government should not get involved that the free market should rule  It became income inequality went through the roof. It became dog eat dog. We killed the middle class  And we're seeing the blight that was created  by these uh  Friedman-esque, what do you call it? It's canesian canesianism or a cane  Canesianism, what is friedmanism? Is it friedmanism?  um  uh  but this this free  you know  canesian versus  friedmanium

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just says versus friedman when I search friedman. Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We should call it heartless economics heartless is a better word it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  uh, but it is you know, it's remember reagan saying, you know, uh  The scariest words in the words in the world are i'm i'm from the government. I'm here to help

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, that was the next the next scariest words are i'm here from corporate i'm here to help right

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So it's interesting because the democratic party with the build back better and the infrastructure bill is kind of nudging  a reluctant  country into this more canesian  Economic theory  We'll see if it sticks but this chips act is very much a canesian thing. Let's invest  To bring these plants home by the way  One of the one of the conditions of this is you may not then build plants in china intel was actually thinking about taking over a chinese  uh chip factory  Uh taiwan, i'm sorry a taiwan chip factory or maybe it was in china. No, it was in china  and one of the  Consequences of this bill is you can't do that if you're gonna take our money for that 20 billion dollar fab in arizona  You may not build fabs anywhere else, you know, especially in asia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I saw a story today that said that that we won't get the impact of the  tax breaks on electric cars  Because mansion's stuck in a clause on supply chain. Have you seen that? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, we will and we won't we will and we won't uh tesla's are made in the u.s  Uh, but their battery packs are not yeah  And I think the last thing you're gonna get half of your you're gonna get half of the potential right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  what's frustrating is they they  They phased it out over a year and granted  If you want to actually bring people to invest in factories and manufacturing here  Then you establish a tax credit that will last for 10 years which then  Makes the economics of investing here. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense and you're just like oh  That's just like a little nice to write headlines about but isn't actually helpful  so  That's sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is the article as referring to uh from the new republic. Yes, the inflation reduction act is a big effing deal  Michael tomasky  While the bill that just survived the senate is a whittled down version of the build back better act  It still puts the democratic party in a promising new path makes the argument  That we we've we've kind of gone down the road of uh, free manomics and perhaps it's time to uh,  Get the government back involved stimulating the economy in the right direction

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, we we desperately need that kind of stimulus for environment and energy  And haven't used it properly. I think you know if we're talking about no gene individuals  I think no gene the economy and no gene companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Makes perfect sense. I think we talked about bill gates new york times  Editorial in which he said we've got to we've got to pass this because a clean energy future  Is in the hands of congress we're on the verge of a remarkable moment for congress in the country gait says  The investment in clean energy that comes from this act  Is is huge. It's so important  It may be the most important bill in our lifetime  so uh  Gates thinks that and he this was a new deal for the earth. Yeah. Yeah  so anyway  interesting to watch, uh, it all comes back to things like um chip shortages and supply chain and  and uh  Nvidia collapsing in the market  Uh, let's see. I want to take a break before we talk about the story that's gonna get uh,  Stacey all riled up

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm ready for riley. Are you ready to rile? I saw a preview on twitter. I've already been riled

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Get a waffle. Uh, do whatever you need to get your blood sugar up and we will come back  And talk about amazon  Uh, but first a word from our sponsor compiler  The original podcast from red hat. We love red hat discussing tech topics big small and strange  uh, we've talked before about uh  Command line heroes another one of our sponsors love that podcast compiler. I think i've mentioned it before they've got a new season  Our compiler is hosted by angela andrews and brent simoneau  It's all about the kinds of things we've just been talking about technology  Complicated but compiler unravels industry topics trends and the things you've always wanted to know about tech by interviewing the people who know it  Best and what I love about compiler is you're going to hear a variety of perspectives  From diverse communities behind  The code you're hearing from red hatters  And they're talking about big questions in tech things like what is technical debt?  What are tech hiring managers actually looking for?  how to code  Do you have to know how to code to get started in open source things like that compiler?  Let me give you some examples episode two what can I love this what can video games teach us about edge computing?  I've been saying for a long time  Edge can you know, they're using video games as a test for edge computing, but it's going to be so much more  The internet is a patchwork of international agreements and varying infrastructure  But there's something coming to change the ways we connect in episode two of compiler  uh angela and brent explore what edge computing can mean for people who enjoy video games and what this form of  Entertainment could teach us about the technology episode nine  How are tech hubs?  Changing a lot of money by the way in that new bill the chips act  to build tech hubs  in new locations  Traditionally if you wanted a career in tech you had to move to a tech hub a city like san francisco or austin  Packed with startups and talent things are starting to change the hosts of compiler speak to a few of the change makers  We're thinking outside of the physical and social dimensions we've come to associate with innovation if you like stimulating conversations  About topics that make a big difference in tech  compiler compiler is the podcast red dot  ht slash twit  We'll also put a link in our show notes new shows new episodes a whole new season out now  You can download them anytime red dot ht slash twit or uh, look on your apple podcasts  Or anywhere you listen to podcasts to listen to compiler and or you can just go to this show page  For today's episode and we'll put a link there. Thank you compiler  For tackling these tough issues and making a great podcast all around it compiler from red hat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the government investment in podcasts  You need more podcasts, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is where I put my my free monomics hat on the last thing we want is government putting its thumb on the scales  in podcasting

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, thank you. That's interesting. We could use we could use a voice of america podcast. Sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm not against voice of america  Well here. Okay. Here's a question. We'll get to you. We'll get to amazon in a second  But here's a question there is an industry an industry I happen to be working in that is dying on the vine an american industry  Started at the turn of the last century. It's called broadcast radio. Oh  Puh  Wow, some call it oh puh, I don't know why uh, it's dying should the feds try to save it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, no, but but what's interesting to me leo is the different the attitude difference about radio here versus europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Right europe radio still they have government but that's because they have government  Germany england france the biggest stations are all government stations  We don't want a uh, I wouldn't listen to a radio free america

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, we have npr that's yeah funded but it's not directly actually they basically are down to virtually no

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's not directly funded by federal funds federal funds go to the local stations and then  You know, but it's yeah, it's kind of it's actually if you listen to npr. It's advertising funded now  Yeah  In fact, it's funny because we compete with them in for podcast advertising big time and they are very expensive  And they they get a lot of the biggest advertisers. It's very hard to get compete against npr  Which is incorrect response?  Very interesting. Uh, yeah, I mean all we do is direct response these days  But but same with the npr podcast. No because and I talk to the at least it talks these advertisers. It tells me  Uh, they don't buy npr for raw response numbers, you know, they care when they buy that on us  What's the roi how many new customers again for npr? It's prestige  And so they don't care. It's brand it's brand and uh, and that's a hard thing to compete against  To be yeah, you gotta get that sweet brand advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Many of my advertisers are going for brand in cache and I love them all for it. Yeah good for you. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Um send them our way. No, no, you should keep them  I don't I don't want to steal any of your advertisers. They're all i'm sure fine  Uh amazon has announced it's going to buy iRobot the makers of the Roomba vacuum cleaner  for 1.7 billion dollars  Uh, I don't you know if there's going to be any regulatory  Pushback on this it's going to have to be more about privacy and data because I don't think this means they'll own  The tiny little market for automated vacuums. Will they stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There are other companies  This is an antitrust  Let me rephrase this this under lena kahn's  views of antitrust and she is the current head of the ftc  this  could  I don't think it would be stopped on this on what grounds so on the grounds that  amazon is going to take a develop, uh, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There are a lot of companies that make shark not on the vacuums. So it's not on the physical devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's around iRobot's plans to do an os a cohesive os for the smart home  And they call it their robot os

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And so I didn't even know about this. This is why we love stacy  What so that's interesting. I did an article. Did you see my article? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did not oh you should go rushing to stacy on iot right now has an excellent headline if I do say so maps

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Mops and matter  Why amazon wants iRobot?  So tell us alliteration  We adore a little couldn't help it  So it's not going to be halted on the grounds that amazon's going to swoop up the robot vacuum market  Uh, no, there's enough competition that that's not the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is not robot vacuum  So the two biggest like moral panic as jeff would say things were like privacy and in my story  I actually include a map of my home so you can see what rumba knows about my house if you're so inclined

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It knows you have a couch in the living room

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It does and it knows all those weird hash marks or rugs. It knows where I have rugs. Oh, that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So you've got a carpeted master bedroom  Uh partial in the office  So you don't consider this an invasion of privacy. Obviously not you put it on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was gonna say I put it on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I am impressed by the size of your laundry room, which is actually bigger than your kitchen

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow, it's like a mud room  Laundry, it's everything that that door leads out to the garage. It's  It's it's like the catchall when you walk in and in seattle good lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  How did you get this out of your room rumba? You're able to download your map?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I oh I did a screenshot of the app and then I oh the app tells you this. Okay. Yeah, the app shows you anyway  um  What were you talking about? Oh robot os  So robot os is something that iRobot it's their next generation operating system and they started talking about it earlier this year  and  What it is  It's exactly what everybody's been talking about with the smart home for years. It's like once all the things are interoperable  How do we figure out how to not make robots in the smart home?  But turn the smart home into a robot which means giving them context about  What people are in the home what they're trying to do?  What other devices can share with other devices about what's happening in the home to actually add value?  and  That's what rumbo is trying to build with robot os amazon's also trying to build this  Uh, it's not like when they talk about ambient intelligence. That's what they're talking about  but  iRobot had a  has  Had a better chance because  Consumers can say I don't want anything you're selling iRobot. I'm not going to buy you because there's plenty of other options  So it was it was incentivized to work with privacy and data hopes that consumers wanted right?  same thing with other vendors that are going to like share their device data with  Robot os right if you're going to work with robot os and have your thermostat talk to  The their smart home os  You're incentivized to work with them because they're not this huge powerhouse  So if you say I don't want to share this data you don't have to oh iRobot is still going to try to build something with it  right  and  I think what we're losing here  is the chance to to  jointly develop the next level of integration and services for the smart home in a way  that  that is in line with  More consumer wants more participants in the ecosystem wants as opposed to amazon dictating what that looks like because it has such enormous  Market power do you think any trust law is sufficient?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  uh to cover this I mean that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what like the ftc  So I think I told y'all a while back how they asked a bunch of questions about  How market power affects salaries how market power affects innovation?  Yes, this is very clearly an issue of market power in a deal that could affect innovation  Proving it would be so hard, right?  But they're trying to build a model for this and this is a good deal to actually throw up against that model and see  What sticks? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You point out that they don't just have rumba vacuums. They also bought a aeris, which means they now have air purifiers  They have a handheld vacuum  But I think it's an excellent point by itself  I robot and it's mapping and all these devices don't present  Uh particular invasion of privacy and they would need to work. There were a lot of moral panic and media coverage of it  There was some concern. It was uploading those maps  But now there's a and the other part of this is there seems to be a pattern with amazon  What are amazon's acquisitions? They buy ring doorbell. They buy euro  Both of these can you know be used to map the house to see what's going on?  They put cameras and microphones in your house with amazon echo  I even had the amazon look camera in my closet to review the outfits I wore before I went out of the house

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and uh, you know, those are ways to perform services for you in your home, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  absolutely  but  amazon becomes more than just an e-commerce company  When it has all of these disparate forms of data about you. I don't know what it means

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, nobody really cares what color your pants are or where your coffee table. I disagree

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, no, I disagree. I think they do and I think they might be interested to know  That I buy this brand of pants. They might be interested to know that I have a coffee table  But I don't have a side table. I mean, I think there's things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where that's where I think that's the so pardon me, but that's the ego of this  Is thinking that the world wants to know that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will say there is a potential for a potential advantage  In this data for shopping if you think about running something like ar kit on some sort of  Mission like being able to pull data about the physical size and location of things in my home into like an ar program  We're not there yet, but you could see in Roomba's do have low level cameras that see the ceiling  And they have one that sees the floor so they have  I think they have lidar too. Um, I I just seems like one more piece of a larger puzzle  it does give them a puzzle of service everyone was like  Astro  And we're like astro isn't for sale yet astro was their little robot that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's like that was clearly about mapping the house because it did nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's also about brought you drinks. What are you talking about leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But and it also wanted to know the name of every room so you could say it does as the room it does  And what do you what is it now amazon has that very interesting? I understand in effect  I myself have been taking that tack which is well, what is the harm?  It's at worst it's going to be selling advertising, but I think we are increasingly  Learning that this data can be weaponized against us and we have a story coming up that shows you very  Dramatically how the data can be used to weaponize against you and so I think there's a legitimate concern  Even if I cannot put my finger on how this would be used nefariously  The fact that all that data is being collected. They just bought one medical  Which is uh, you know, uh, it's going to give them a huge amount of health information  They bought pill pack which you know, they have a pharmacy now  It seems to me this is not just a normal i'm walmart and i'm going to sell a lot of stuff kind of growth  That there is definitely interest in data. I'm trying to get in and trying to get into

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I I just think there's a there's a line that's been drawn and they've crossed that line  Yeah, you can buy one or two of these different companies that have various services  But after it's just continuing to grow and this this piece of pie is getting bigger and bigger and they're getting more and more  Information about us. Uh, I think it's warranted for people to be concerned  I mean, they're going to know every day i'm thinking and no i'm not  Vain enough to think they give a crap about how many orange t-shirts I have in my closet  But the fact that they could find that out. That's still a little bit interesting, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If brad stone actually did a great article. Hold on. Let's stay seagull. Yeah  Um, and he talks about back in 2014 and bradstone wrote a book about amazon and two two excellent books  I recommend them. Yeah, they're really good  Um, but he actually did a great article about this deal  He brought up the fact that back in 2014 jeff bezos and his shareholders letter said amazon is searching for the fourth pillar  Right for amazon. That was something that was good for consumers and would also become this huge business for it  And it didn't have to be it didn't have to do with selling anything online. It could be whatever  It's the fourth pillar they wanted and  Brad makes the case. Yes that amazon is still looking for that. It's looking at health  He doesn't know if the rumba deal is in smart home really makes sense. Is this the fourth pillar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The three pillars are amazon marketplace their third-party sales amazon prime  Which is of course many things and amazon web services, which is the number one cloud  Seller in the world. What's the fourth? You're he's saying and jesse hasn't stopped looking either. I mean just because jeff is gone  Doesn't mean andy jesse's not well just still around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, let me ask you the question this way  Well for let me just say one thing to add  I I think um fine to ask the question about what they do  But I think that one has to look at an regulatory framework of saying you have to start with the harm the potential harm  To know what you're guarding against  So now let me switch it to stacey  If you were lina con and you were being expansive  And this deal we're going to go through what conditions would you want to put on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would want to put conditions on how amazon interacts with partners that try to integrate with whatever  Future smart home os that amazon develops. So that's a really interesting different take for what we saw in coverage. I like that  I mean  I also think that we should probably have hardcore real rules about data privacy  Which could cover some things that people are worried about like I know you want to think about harms with like  Amazon mapping your home and maybe they're not as easy to figure out right now  But if you think about the sensors that are at the rumba and you think about a cohesive vision of where people are in the home  And what they're doing?  Giving that information out to law enforcement for example is really dicey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so there again, what are the what are the conditions that you want to put on?  Uh, you have to think about potential harm so you can do that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Those aren't anti-trust. That's true. To me. Those aren't anti-trust harms. Those are harms that we need to solve  At a macro level across our society  Related to tech and data like technology companies  Grabbing and storing and selling data like that's a data marketplace issue  But from an anti-trust issue  The f like what I said basically how will this deal affect innovation in this space given that?  We're at such a nascent level and you could say like when zuckerberg bought when facebook bought instagram  That was a that was a kill innovation type deal. It wasn't directly competitive. I think this is that kind of deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you can make a strong case and I hope they do  That iRobot is better for innovation by its standalone than if it's in a giant company  Like amazon bradstone wrote an article a couple of days ago in bloomberg what amazon's rumba and one medical deals have in common  This came out. Yeah, august 8th data. Well, but there's an interesting quote in here that actually comes  Uh from collin angle who's the founder of iRobot in 2019?  At the remars conference amazon's remars conference  Uh bloomberg, i'm sorry, um bradstone writes  Uh wearing a very amazonian powered by optimism t-shirt angle talked about making autonomous robots  Not just vacuum cleaners, but autonomous robots that implicitly understand their environment  And can respond to queries and anticipate the needs of their owners  The goal is to turn the house into a robot  He said yes giving it sensors giving it actuators  Giving it the ability to take care of the people who live in the house and with an appropriate combination of ai voice understanding  And spatial understanding this gives amazon the the third part of that we create a home where you live your life  And it just does the right thing  It's a very interesting idea of home automation instead of a robot standing at the sink doing your dishes  The home is itself the robot with different ways of actuating  And and it's all tied together. And so brad's making the case that there are there are two possibilities for this fourth  Pillar one is health care, but he says that's complicated. There's a lot of regulation. The other is home automation  in particular this vision of  a  Smart home that's that really is smart doesn't just but how about another one leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, when I saw this deal my first thought was  And I had put the terms of the pillar  But that this was inside and outside the home  business to consumer and business to business robots  That that amazon could become could in its in its factories in its drones in its delivery trucks  that  a physical robot service structure  As opposed to a data structure, which is google or a social structure, which is facebook and twitter  Uh, is there a larger robotics industry?  Piece here who else is big besides boston dynamics  Who else out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Uh is big in robotics. It's it's it's a it's a philosophical thing because in the early days of computing we thought well  The computers would get bigger and bigger and bigger and smarter and smarter smarter  And what turned out it was computing at the edge  Which is smaller computers everywhere in everything and I think robotics may turn out to be that instead of a smarter smarter bigger bigger robot  there's little things doing little bits like a  I robot and all over inside and outside your home

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you go to the story that I wrote back in when astro came out  I  Create I wrote a story all about how the smart home is a robot like the whole home is a robot  And again like collin angle was saying  um  the idea there  And it makes a ton of sense because i've seen so many demonstrations of robots  When you deal with general purpose  or every there's no such thing as a good general purpose robot. We're not going to have a rosie because  Robots aren't smart enough. They don't have the physical dexterity we need for all that  So what we will have yeah, if you scroll, yeah, there it is. Oh, hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Um smart home doesn't need a robot figures on the pulse of everything should be a robot. Whoops. Yeah, I grabbed the wrong one and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so so that's it in  I love this. That's exactly what we're just saying. Yeah, that's really interesting  And so and it's cheaper because you're going to assemble the robot you need and you need it to talk to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, so it's robot at the end. That's why the os matters so much to your point stacy. That's why the os  Otherwise, you can't have interoperability. Otherwise, you're going to get stuck in

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Living in somebody's wall garden. Yeah, best explanation yet of what amazon's up to yeah, and and and bradstone goes on to say  Uh, both the iRobot and one medical acquisition share a final attribute an almost breathtaking disregard for the trustbusters  particularly head of the u.s federal trade commission lena con  uh, he says  jesse probably feels confident that  The law's on their side. And so the quest for this fourth pillar justifies  the risk  It is going to be I mean it would be a you know  It's interesting because she overruled just recently overruled the staff at the ftc to go after meta  over its acquisition of within which is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vr health thing and if that's she's going after then this is a much bigger deal. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The lawsuit stone rights shows her willingness to break recent tradition and block mergers that don't necessarily lead to anti-competitive dominance now  But which could hypothetically do so in the future. That's a very proactive attitude towards antitrust. That's very interesting  But can she do it and will she be allowed to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. That's the question. I mean jesse any or will she look at it this way to avoid this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, I think she is looking at it this way. I mean that that's the  Evidence that she she went after within even though staff said nah, there's nothing here  So maybe what i'm saying is is do you see but she's got to get the courts to back her  She can't do it by herself. I think stacey's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Regulatory view is a really smart and insightful view, but i'm not sure that's the way that's not the political view  The political view is oh my god, they have data  And by the way, one other thing about that is you can have too much data. It can become so meaningless  Uh, and I remember the early days of the net when the times new york times had 28 data points and it used one of them  Right about a reuser  um, and and so  You know, I think these companies just don't think amazon meta google

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think are sophisticated enough to have lots of data points

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but i'm just saying there's not the girl is oh my god, we're gonna map every room  I don't see them sitting in a room with a whiteboard saying that's  Our goal. I think stacey's view and your view about the the home as robot the home as full service is much more interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Strategically maybe but you have to have that data to do that  You have to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And there may be they may be acting on faith a little bit like well  You know, we've seen in the past we get enough data together  Synergies happen. Uh, they may not know exactly what they're gonna do with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And remember how bad they may not know what they're going to do with it. Yeah, but they just know it's good to have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I was gonna say would this all be okay had amazon said at the press release  We're interested in this because we plan on doing  abcd that's going to help us with basically making your your home even smarter might have been smart to do that much, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Would all of this not even be a big discussion instead of letting us connect the dots in in ways that are unfair to them  I think you're right probably would have been better stacey. Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting part of this too, though, is that okay? So so let's go with the home as robot  and  Amazon as a primary but not the only player and let's imagine that they play nice even that the amazon brand the trust needed  There becomes pretty tremendous and that would drive  The privacy issues look what happened when they announced sidewalk

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Uh, and they said oh by the way you ring doorbells and your echo devices. They're all building this uh, low ran low raw network  Uh all over the world  And I think there was a bit of pushback, although I suspect that that kind of you know  Our short attention span allowed that to blow over and they they continue to build a sidewalk. Yes, and stacey didn't object

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we're looking I actually don't object to sidewalk, but that's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But I mean when you put it all together, they have a mesh of what's going on inside the home  They haven't mentioned what's going outside the home. They have a lot of data. I mean, I I agree  I don't I don't know what nefarious use they're going to put it to but I just worry that's a lot of data

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you're that worried then you need to think about a macro data policy because we're not going to  Because we insist on connecting things to the internet  We're generating data and that data then becomes useful to someone and someone's going to try to use it  So we have to set rules around how we want that used and that's what's frustrating  We cannot do it on a case-by-case basis  This is not a lena conch and stop this because of the data kind of issue. It's hey  We should have a bipartisan effort to create a privacy policy and legislation that deals with the fact that everything we own  Is collecting data and we can't  We don't have parameters around what they can do with it  So like IEEE spectrum just did a thing about what your tesla knows about you  I don't know if you saw those three stories last week. They were excellent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they don't want elon to know anything about me

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It talks about you know that tesla's picking up gps data about where you go and think about like what facebook just  given over law enforcement data on someone who  Had a potential abortion think about if the feds in texas or the texas  uh  Attorney general goes after elon for data on people who've been  You know driving over state lines and at a certain abortion clinic. I mean, yeah. Yeah, so that is like  We are beyond the point where we need to look at this and set regulatory rules, but this deal isn't scary because of that  This deal is just another  Example of one big player gathering more data  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Tesla may be an example of having too much data to do anything with it  You know, I think tesla just collects it  Just in case you know, there's a lawsuit or something we can we can we can say. Oh, no. No, it was turned off  And so forth. Uh, I don't know. I do want to talk about the  I think appalling  uh story  Facebook facebook story, uh, because I think  Appalling frightening the more we hear government using this data against its citizens the more I get concerned about the collection of this data regardless of what the  you know the the  Interest is of amazon or any other company the fact that this data is being collected could be potentially hazardous to your health  But before we do that, let's take a little break  So fun to have stacy back. You see what the show we need stacy to explain all this stuff to us

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's all i'm saying this cranky person to rail against wall street and yell at y'all i'm sorry by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Thanks to bill gates. I now know that pickleball was invented on bainbridge island

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Why was it a fateful weekend fateful weekend? That was my question. Yeah. Oh my god beginning of pickleball the world changed in 1965

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a spontaneous  Convention  sounds like  Kids were sent up to play on a uh bannin  Babbins and cork with ping pong paddles  And what you would call a whiffle ball. This was because they were  Stuff and go out there and I'm taking exactly that get out of the house  and  Porch kids  Delta went up there and saw what they were doing and  No, ping pong paddles and whiffle balls that's how it started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else what that's number 50 what are one through 49? Oh, there's a lot of history you're right  I don't even think about bainbridge island. I might have to go back there. Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's a big island. I didn't realize how big it was till we sailed by it on our cruise ship  It was a big I remember when the 7-eleven came in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so you know about because that doesn't fit here

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In all seriousness one of the best things to go to for anyone on bainbridge island is the japanese internment memorial  Oh, yes  because oh yes, washington state I think has actually done a really good job and we as an entire country could take  Take a note in terms of acknowledging how she how poorly we treated people because of their race  and  acknowledge it  Incorporated into our own teachings. I mean like everybody here knows about that and it's part of like  The fabric of who washingtonians think they are there were a lot of both good or ill a lot of japanese americans in washington state  And uh in bainbridge the first ones left from bainbridge island because they had a huge japanese  Like our elementary school is called sakai huge japanese population  And actually, it's really nice like yes, there were obviously  It's a terrible thing to happen  But like people on the island actually like farmed  Land for their people for the japanese immigrants who were citizens actually  Who were interned and then gave it back to them when they came home  Like it's a very moving and it's a it's a wonderful exhibit. Sorry  I'm like, so I know there's something in there about that  But I really think we should have that all over like for slavery and things like I agree. This is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  A dark spot on our nation's history  A friend of the family jeannie houston wrote a book about her internment farewell to manzana which is  A must read highly recommend it. It's the story of her and her family  Uh in uh in manzana the internment camp  um  With her husband james houston was very well known novelist very well written fascinating story  Yeah, you know what? That's a very good point. Uh stacy. Um  That's a that is an important part of history  Oh, yeah. Yeah  And how do they know where those japanese people were? They were all on facebook  No  There was you know, there's a famous story. Uh, I think it was in the netherlands  where uh  And this is to me the cautionary tale about being too free with information  Where the census would record everybody's religion?  Right  And at the time no big deal till the nazis took over and then those  documents  were  Potentially what they would use to round up jewish citizens the mayors of at least one town burned those  records  Before the nazis could get a hold of them, but that just shows you a book called mercury pictures presents right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is which is kind of interesting fun novel  and uh this italian  Emigre is is the central character and the italian newspaper in los angeles  Burned all its copies  So that it wouldn't be used to round up  And the enemy aliens of world war two. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  so we got to remember, uh, you know, it might seem completely innocuous to  record somebody's religion in the census  but uh, there is potential risk and that brings us  Uh to the motherboard story that just got my ire up. Yeah  Motherboard has obtained court documents to show facebook gave police. Of course. It was a subpoena. It was a lawful  subpoena  Uh a teenager's private chats about her abortion. These were  Private facebook messenger with her mother chats with her mother  17 year old girl has now been charged uh with felonies three felonies  Including performing an abortion at more than 20 weeks performing abortion by non-licensed doctor  Uh and removing concealing a dead human body. You might argue that that fetus is not a dead human body  But that's not what the law says  She's being tried as an adult  In lincoln nebraska  Because she used a medical medication to abort a fetus in nebraska  Um, she was 28 weeks pregnant which is of course illegal in many states at that late term of an abortion, but  nonetheless  Those those messages and motherboard got the messages  um  and uh, it was a court approved search warrant facebook complied with it as they are  Required to do although I know facebook google app and leathers talk about how they fight these twitter how they fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so there's a story I put in below leo  I haven't even read it yet. I just found it facebook parent meta defends itself after turning over private messages claimed  It never was told the investigation was related to an abortion  so  Is that man is one told in a subpoena what it's related to and and should these companies henceforth say  We're gonna whatever it is. We're gonna fight you just to push out  The issue we're not gonna hand over anything now until we until we have we want that information right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, when you get a subpoena you're offered a case number, but you're not necessarily told I mean right presumably  You call a lawyer and the lawyer looks up the case number so that you know what you're being like why but  it's also an abdication of facebook's duty and any like this is not a  Protector of your data like if you received a subpoena you would be like, holy cow a subpoena  I shall call my lawyer and my lawyer will act in my best interest looking up the case facebook doesn't do any of that  They're just like oh a subpoena. Okay here. So it's a little disingenuous for them to be like, oh we didn't know what it was about  Of course, they don't they don't care

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that's all once but are they wrong in turning it over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's their job. Maybe yeah here. Here's the here's the the facebook the warrants did not mention abortion at all  But get hit this court documents indicate the police were at the time investigating the alleged illegal burning and burial of a stillborn  Infant, yeah, the warrants were accompanied by non-disclosure orders which prevented us from sharing information about them  The orders have now been lifted  When you have horrible laws in the country  Then you know, I always say the government is not the protector of privacy. It is the worst threat to privacy. This is a case  Uh, and what do we expect?  The platform is to do this case where a mother and daughter are using it for a discussion  it's also the case where  we need privacy legislation and I will agree and we're having written the  um  Right to privacy and communication to a technology known as the letter was limiting it should have been

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They could not have communication. They could have offered a warrant to search that  From to the postal service, right? They couldn't couldn't grab that letter. They could do a warrant. They could do a warrant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's the problem with this. Yeah, okay, you can you can but but  but then what's the  That's the point it's it's it's warranted not warrant less  Uh, and that's the protection you get to to to mail but that's the problem here. You have a really bad law a really bad government  um, and and no protection of privacy, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Facebook dms obtained by law enforcement were then used as the main basis for a second search warrant  In which 13 laptops and smartphones were seized from the Burgess's 24 gigabytes of data  Including images messages and web histories from their phone were extracted for the case  So that has a lot of laptops. That's a lot of life. What is it?  So well, it might have been who knows how broad the net was they might have gotten everybody every relative

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know every old laptop. Yeah, I got I got old laptops out here

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The moral of this is and this really relates to privacy concerns  If you're going to do something you shouldn't send a message on facebook  Uh, or any or any mechanism you shouldn't put on a laptop. You shouldn't do a google search  Uh shouldn't text shouldn't text  Um, because all of that is available and all of it's collected and all of it, uh can be subpoenaed  By court order sucks. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or you could just say hey encrypt everything and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No one can well and this is exactly why every government  In the in the developed world is fighting encryption including our own  Because they don't like it that not everything is available to them all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't one presume by the way?  that the texts that were exchanged in the  secret service and dod and whoever the third one was  phones  Were on an encrypted method or just open?  texting

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So you can encrypt, uh  Can you encrypt in facebook and facebook messenger and I guess not what's app you can what's app you can and it's strong encryption  Um, you'd be better off using signal if you ask me  Uh, that's really the only solution I know of that, you know, or make a phone call  Well, is it?  Wiretaps too, right, but they'd have to have microphones in your home. Yeah  I think you have to do what steve gibson always says which is you go out in the middle of a field naked  And you you make sure that there's no one within a thousand feet  No mosquitoes around and then you whisper in the person's ear and they whisper in your ear and you just you know  That's the best you can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you now but you've now told someone else and so you have lost control of it to that extent that person  That's what's driving trump crazy right now because the latest reports are that it was someone inside mar-a-lago who said  There's more stuff in the safe  Wow, and so now he's paranoid about everyone around him  And there's a new ad out today that's trying to make him even more paranoid. We're just kind of fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Isn't that what he didn't say that you only plead the fifth if you've done something wrong  And and isn't it the case often that uh, you know criminals will often say, oh, yeah, it's overreach  Uh, oh, yeah government overreach. Oh, they planted evidence in my plan. Right, right, right  Anyway messenger does have secret conversations end to end encryption built in  so, uh the mother and daughter probably not thinking that what they were doing needed to be  Hidden that well, although they were clearly aware of guilt which is gonna  I think if you know be impactful in their trial, um, you know, they were definitely don't tell anybody that kind of thing. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, well, it's not the sort of thing you I mean if you're gonna do a late-term abortion  You know, that's kind of already know your wall. I know you're in trouble. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, this is a harbinger of awful things to come. That's my that's I think the main thing that's the issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is what's interesting is this is a prosecution against the actual person and most of the abortion?  Laws are actually like that we're worried about in the wake of dogs doctor here. That's why it was a medical, right?  But yeah is against doctors or other people not the actual mother. So actually, uh, the mother is charged

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  the daughter is charged and  Uh, a 22 year old a man is charged with attempting to conceal the death of another person because he helped them dispose of the fetus  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would this have been illegal because of the the the term because of 28 weeks. Yes, we

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think yes, and you can't actually  bury a  Body  So the term would have been a problem here in the u.s  But also I think how the feels disposing of a fetus. So let's just do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A thought experiment if if we read this story two months ago before dod

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It which it and it would still have been a crime it still would have been a crime

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It had to bury probably would have had a somewhat muted but similar reaction of uh-oh other things could happen  But this is this is under the law a crime and the warrant was well because in many states now

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Uh, it's a crime after 20 weeks  Yeah, so or six or six weeks depending on whether you're in texas  uh as a result  The same exact process could be used against you for you know taking plan b after six weeks  And that's they also said that they had a miscarriage

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so one of the challenges is you can't medically a stillbirth or a abortion  Can look the same as a miscarriage, right? You're technically so what what law enforcement will do is they're going to start looking  They're going to start looking when you have a miscarriage  They're going to look for things that indicate that it wasn't actually a natural miscarriage, right?  So in this case, they found it by going to facebook, right?  It's just sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, but and again a cautionary tale now that we live in an age where even six weeks is too soon  And most people don't know they're pregnant

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That quickly because you're not actually pregnant at six weeks, right you've got a zygote you've missed your  Well, you don't even have that. I mean the first two weeks they  They track a pregnancy the first four weeks of a pregnancy are from your last missed period  So you haven't even had a for two of those weeks. There actually isn't anything happening. Nothing happened, right? Right, right  The sperm has not yet met the egg. So it doesn't even exist. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Uh, and you know, however you feel about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a while  Oh, that was an angry that was not you were okay. Never mind. It was a roar  I was trying to I am woman hear me roar, right? Okay. No, it's I am woman. I am filled with rage

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree idiocy and  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  but even if you are  Pro life or if you're against abortion of any kind  Uh, there is cause for concern that governments could then use these kinds of subpoenas to look through your messages for all kinds of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you see it with immigration roundups all the time  They've had contracts and they get information from facebook before serving their warrants and trying to track people who they wanted to port

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well s ac2 because the laws in some states say that anybody can sue anybody over this  Evidence  Then somebody's going to hack your phone for the purposes  You know if you're suspicious of you and say I got the evidence and i'm going to sue you for having done this and make money  Try you with bounty hunters  Yeah, amen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it joe in our?  Discourse at facebook should enable whatsapp style in an encryption and messenger now in all caps. Why wouldn't they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Uh, that's an interesting question. Um, it is a good question. Yeah by by default

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, why wouldn't yeah, they have the power. Yeah, and we don't want to be stuck in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't want to get we don't want to get any of this on us. We don't want to be in a position  So that's more it's like facebook saying enough with news enough with subpoenas  To what are what people were presuming our private conversations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I don't know if he did this on purpose or not, but there was a  Indiana lawmaker  Do you remember you saw this story who uh  When the indiana assembly considered, uh the law against uh abortion  Said well, you also should outlaw  ed drugs  Yeah, because yep, some may think this is a joke where it starts  It takes two for a pregnancy to come about and to put all the onus on a woman. I think it's unfair  So let's make uh needless to say  The law against uh, viagra did not pass  Did not pass but the abortion ban did  John bartlett of uh, indiana of indianapolis  Uh, all right  Where else do we go google is set up right somewhere. Well, this is lightish  Uh google, uh apparently according to bloomberg is the doj is preparing to sue google  Uh as soon as next month over uh ad markets the prosecutor  Prosecutors are now conducting fresh rounds of interviews with  Who would be harmed by google?  And their ads or publishers publishers publishers and their lobbyists. Yeah. Yeah, there we go. So, um  According to people familiar with the matter the u.s justice department is su google  Capping years of work to build a case  That the alphabet unit illegally dominates the digital  advertising market  That'll be an interesting trial  Does it is it is it too powerful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have always said that google's  Achilles heel here has always been its dominance in advertising always it's not it's not search  It's not anything else  And and once they bought double click  they were  Pretty darn powerful now. They didn't have complete pricing control, but they took pieces of  Transactions they knew what was going along along the way now. Meanwhile, I find it interesting that apple which failed at advertising  And then made that bug into a feature saying we're the privacy company because we don't care about advertising  Apple there's a story in the rundown in the lower part that they're now hiring people  It looks like to create google like ad networks because they probably smell the weakness here. They've been beefing up in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  ads they've added ads to other areas of  apple  Properties like the app store and so forth and they're looking now according to digiday for a senior manager  For a dsp and its ads platforms businesses. I'm not sure what dsp  Says stands for digital something  To whoever gets a job will be asked to quote drive the design of the most privacy forward  Oh, here's what dsp stands for of the most privacy forward sophisticated demand side platform possible  So we want to show you ads, but we want to make sure no one else knows what we know  A dsp is a statement of intent for any ads business  Let alone one like apple which has grown exponentially on the back of its decision to make it harder for companies to grow their own  Within the apple ecosystem  Apple has all that first party data  Shame you don't oh  And did you see this okay, this is this is crazy so google I think this is gonna backfire on them google has created a web page  Get the message. It's time for apple to fix  Texting  It's not about the color of the bubbles  It's the blurry videos broken group chats missing read receipts and typing indicators. No texting over wi-fi and more  These problems exist because apple refuses to adopt modern texting standards when people with iphones and android phones  text each other  Uh, and then it's not apple's fault. No, well  Google said I mean they didn't adopt an industry standard. They didn't adopt rcs, which I think a lot of people realize is kind of crappy  Uh, it took a long time to get the phone companies to adopt it  and um  So they're hashtag get the message. They're trying to get people to pressure apple  I don't every single apple every iphone user is going to just laugh and say no, that's fine. I don't want right they don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the users are totally happy with the i'm very happy with messages elitism side of it  Huh, you're not in the group. I can text you too bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I can text you just because you know, your cult bubber color is different doesn't mean anything. I can text you

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is a great tweet. I can't see their videos though

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you can you can't see the videos. They're crappy. They're like these tiny sad videos  They're anytime my friend sends me a video over text. Oh, that's because it's doing it over sms and mms

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Right, and that's really more limit bandwidth limitations and band carriers are imposed. Yes. Well, but if they had a standard they could do it differently

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they could they could

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zach swears tweets. Yeah google colon you need to finally standardize your messaging app apple. Sorry. I missed that message  Did you send it on alo google voice text cheat  Horns hangouts google wallet google pay google pay or google wallet to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, oops oops

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So, uh, what do you think is this uh ants is going to convince, uh apple apple gonna go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, apple is just gonna keep on rolling on to the bank and and their users gonna continue to be happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Being we in the top group, you know all three of you are android users, right? Not apple  I'm gonna yeah, love you. Yeah  I have both I have a pixel six in a course you do in front of me but uh,  I actually go to great lengths and it's a pain in the butt to allow  Me to get apple messages on my pixel phone. I have to run a server  At home called air messages  That runs on a mac at home and then I have an air messages client on my iphone on my pixel phone  So that I can get these messages and I have to say the messaging platform  On android is very confusing. Should I use android messages? Should I use samsung messages? Yeah, whose messages should I use?  It's not a clear choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As long as the sms  Is getting to me. I'm happy, you know, sometimes it does annoy me to see the whole um, so and so liked

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Whatever message I sent to them, you know, I get that so I get the thumbs up now  I didn't google actually now gives it to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From both tech guy. It's not a fun thing on either platform guy that the average consumer is not doing any of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, and the average consumer doesn't know what rcs is either. I hope to say  Okay  And if they did they might not be so sanguine about the idea of replacing apple's messages with rcs  Uh, I can't wait to have this conversation on mac break weekly. I'm having a feeling i'm  That we're just gonna get one big gaffa from the apple users  the snobs

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  um, it was mentioned here in the discord that we should also  mention that

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Google was on all about android yesterday. Yes, they talked about this page yesterday and all about android  Uh, I haven't yet watched that yet, but i'm sure they had lots of  High and mighty righteous proclamations to make

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Yeah  Uh, whatever. What is it called? Is it called hangouts or what? I don't know what it's called. We don't even know anymore hangouts is gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's called android messages  Um  Honestly  I agree. It would be a much better world if we could all just agree on one platform and since apple's is apple only  Okay, maybe make it telegram or signal signal would be a good choice. Let's just everybody use signal  Uh, in fact all the only thing apple really has to do is allow you to change the default messaging  Program you have to use apple's messages on an iphone  If they did let as android does let you choose a third party messaging platform as your official SMS  Receiver that would solve it then we'd all use signal  And maybe done

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Freedom of choice is awesome. But boy, it's it's a bit of a mess. Right? Yeah apple doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and it's it's not what apple sells apple sells easy to use. That's right. That's a good point  Figuring out which messaging program that's not easy to use. That's a good point. Excellent point

Transcript:  We're coming out in two lawsuits filed monday in the u.s district court in california google alleges sonas his latest voice assistant  You go. Hey sonos  And then and I love it giancarlo esposito responds  He is from breaking bad the chicken man  Uh, he uh, he uh apparently google alleges sonos's voice assistant violates seven count them patents related to google assistant  Google spokesperson jose castaneda says sonos has started an aggressive and misleading campaign against our products at the expense of our shared customers  It's funny because my sonos speakers also do amazon echo and google voice as well as hey sonos  Sonos launched its own voice assistant in june  um  Google said in lawsuits it has made its technologies available to users across the globe even providing its school assistant software to sonos for many years. Yeah  The suits says so google's worked for years with sonos engineers on how to how to do it  I don't know  Last year the itc ruled google infringed on five patents owned by sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's a little bit of a surprise  But it's a little bit of a surprise  I mean, it's a little bit of a surprise

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But it's a little bit of a surprise  Yeah, this basically what will happen here is if google can win any of these it has a better  A better leverage at any settlements that it's going to have to do right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's all google had to take features out of the google system because of that  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Elon musk speaking of bringing it on challenges  Parag agrawal the ceo of twitter to a public debate  Oh, yeah, parag is going to fall for that. I think the next thing elon's going to do is go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just like eighth grade everything about elon is eighth grade

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I hear by challenge a parag to a public debate about the twitter bot percentage  Let him prove to the public that twitter has less than five percent faker dailies behind the cafeteria after recess  You're too chicken parag you're too chicken aren't you trump behavior to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's just elon is a troll all trolls then he polled his followers on whether they believe twitter  Uh, the two options are yes with three robot emojis  Uh, or lmao no  Guess guess which one won  67 picked the lmao. No that proves it  But how many of those were bots elon? That's the question  Meanwhile elon just sold  Seven billion dollars in tesla shares  7.9 million shares

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  6.9 billion 6.9 round up. Well, but he just he also sold 8.5 billion in april

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So now I don't know money  Uh, you know, there's some question about why he's selling these shares. Maybe he's afraid some people say  his fear is  that uh  He will be forced by the chancery court of delaware to  Buy twitter and then forced to sell these shares at a distressed price. So he's selling them now  While he while he while the price is still going it's good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one one theory remember we talked about was that the whole twitter thing was a gambit to give him the excuse to sell  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's what uh, what's his name? That's that 40 chess idea. Yeah 40 chess  Musk tweeted in the hopefully unlikely event that twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don't come through  It's important to avoid an emergency sale of tesla stock. So he actually  kind of  agreed  Uh, we'll see what happens. I mean obviously this is going to be complicated over the last 10 months  He sold 32 billion dollars worth of tesla stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But how much of his stock was used as collateral for loans that he can't get rid of easily?  Right. How much how much does he have left in tesla that's not collateralized?  Right, you're right stan. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The other issue is that tesla's shareholders last week approved a three to one stock split  So he may just be dumping these shares  Waiting for the stock split and then buy them back on the cheap

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know increase the split should make them go up

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. Why would you wouldn't get them on? Yeah. No  Yeah, because he you'd have to have the same ownership stake. He'd have to spend the same amount of money  Unless and usually when your stock when you split your stock, it usually ends up going up because people okay like your overall  Ownership percentage would go up like the  The cost to buy back the same percentage that you owed would go but or that you used to own would go up

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm just googling stock split effect on price

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, it goes down but it's because you've taken like if you yeah, but one share and you split it in half  Then yeah, the price of that share goes down but the percentage company retain that percentage of the company. Yeah, it stays the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, I understand that the question is does the share price go down by more than one third  That's its previous price and i'm trying to figure that out  No, like what's the history the history of this the history is generally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you own a thousand shares and it's 10 for one and you know now own 10 000 shares  You're still gonna your the history is your price is gonna go up  You're  Your value is gonna go up that's why they do it  Because more people are gonna buy the shares because it's a retail price now  Even though that still is in two separate studies in 1996 and 2003

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  David eikenberry chairman of the finance department of the university of illinois at urbana champaign  Found price performance of split stocks outperformed  The market by eight percent during the year following the split and by 12 percent over the ensuing three years  So elon you should have read  This uh, you know, so it does the value of the stock does go up thanks to a split  Yeah, that's why you do it. That's why you do it. Well, is that why you do it or just because it's the the  Share price is so high. You do it to make it more

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you do it to lower the overall share price and that brings in more shareholders more purchasers

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, so if it's stock if apple stock 700 bucks  Somebody's got to spend 700 bucks to get a share. Maybe if you made it 100 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With a seven-way split which apple has done kind of doesn't make a lot of sense because how many people buy in one share?  You're just you're buying some people buy one share. Mr. Richie rich. Yeah, right  What's butcher hathaway these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  but in that ink  A mixture of commercially available  oligo peptides  Containing containing the secret key  They've done this before with dna  Uh, in fact, which could store more data. So dna is even more useful, but you know, you know dna  It's kind of a mess. So this way you could do it with polymers. I don't know  It's a good story. I just like that kind of story because I can talk like that  NASA is nothing to do with the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely no question about it brian. Oh, yeah brian as you brought this analogy because like a cb  It won't be very useful in its present form, which is just talking to yourself and to your computer  But like a cb when it starts talking to other computers throughout the whole country when we have several million  Interconnects I was pressing people can talk to each other and can exchange views and can do can transact can buy and sell information  Can buy and sell informational services labor.

That's right. The trouble is you have to have an idea  Okay, and people forget that and similarly to write good and interesting programs on a computer one has to have an idea  Ideas are hard to come by.
