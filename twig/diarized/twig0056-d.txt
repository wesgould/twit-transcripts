I got an ant from the other room.  Thank you for watching and...  I'm just on automatic.  I don't know what the hell I'm doing.  It's time for Twig This Week in Google, the Google, the cloud, the Googleverse.  We cover it all right here with our good friends Gina Trapani of SmarterWear.org.  Hello Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.  How's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's going great.  Where's your bike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  This is the newly lit and studioized Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I got some softbox lights.  I feel like a French fry on the shelf right now.  The griddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good to have you also with us, of course, from Seattle.  He's speaking.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.  Jake in the background.  Jeff, when Jake...  We're on Twig This Week, which was a lot of fun, haven't you?  Jake's ready to go home.  You can tell.  There's Jake.  He says, get me out of here.  There he is.  Jake's waiting.  Get me out of here.  Enough with the hotel rooms, Dad.  You guys had fun though.  You went to Google.  You went to Facebook.  You interviewed Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We met with Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook with Ed Williams and interviewed him at Twitter  and with Philip Pudd Kaplan at Brizly.  What do you call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Blippi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Blippi.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, this is for your book, Public Parts, which you're working on right now.  I understand Pudd said that I sold a lot of scales on Blippi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, he said you were a little late in...  Matt Cutts was the first guy who went up on the scale.  There was then the kind of viral buying.  He said, no, Leo wasn't actually at the top of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what I loved?  Matt Cutts, who has lost so much weight and he hasn't talked about it.  He's been quiet about it.  He's only recently gone public, but he just looks fantastic.  So it's perfectly reasonable that Matt should sell so many scales.  Also with us...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Matt just climbed...  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Matt just climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.  He made it to the summit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Holy moly.  Also with us there is Kevin Marks, Ribbit.com.  It's good to see you once again from BT.  And on the whiteboard, if you look very closely, is the plan for global domination...  No, no.  Global distribution.  Global distribution.  There it is.  I just want to point out something, Kevin.  I don't know if you know it, but your microphone is actually behind your head on your headsets.  That's because I'm using this one.  Oh, look at that!  He tricked us.  You can move that one back into the camera range.  It's a good mic.  That's the Yeti mic, isn't it?  It's the Yeti Blank, yeah.  I was just moving it off my keyboard.  You sound good.  No wonder you sound so good.  How could he sound so good with a microphone behind him?  Tricky.  Magic.  You're a tricky fellow.  So we actually kind of voted you on the island last week.  Jeff, Gina and I were talking about the Google Verizon proposal, which they hope to make  law.  And, you know, Jeff really kind of made the most salient comment, why Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what we were curious about having as a former Googler, Kevin, is what your insight  might be into the internal divisions over this.  Google's a big company.  They don't act.  They may speak with a single voice, but they don't act, you know, or they don't internally  maybe have that same point of view.  Do you think there's some dissension among the ranks over this net neutrality move?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure there is.  Yeah.  I mean, this is a complicated problem.  The challenge is always how do you keep the net open and how do you make it useful for  everyone?  And, you know, broadly Google wants that.  And it looks like they've decided this is the best thing they're going to get for the  moment.  That was my read on what they were saying publicly.  And some of the stuff I've seen Vint Cerf and Richard Witt and the others say about  around the around the topic.  I think for me, the bit that was weirdest was this split between wireline and wireless  because that's far too broad in my head.  I'd say there's difference between cellular and wireless.  We don't want them saying, oh, and Wi-Fi and white spaces and everything else should be  non-neutral too.  That's the bit that makes me a little nervous.  If they say cellular Internet, then you can argue you can make the arguments that you  and Stacey and Kerr were saying last week about this.  This thing is different.  But I'm very careful.  As this passes through Congress and gets mutilated by other telecoms lobbyists, it doesn't end  up saying, oh, we can do what we like to Wi-Fi as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think it's fair for Google?  I mean, it's a reasonable thing for them to say this is the best we're going to get.  And we wanted the protections for landline.  I mean, isn't the future in mobile and aren't they aren't they selling us out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sure. I'm not sure.  I think I don't think they're selling us out.  It feels like that a little bit, but I think they're just trying to come up with something  that gives them some protection.  I mean, the other bit for me is that there's a certain amount of a storm in the teacup for  this. If you know, if we actually believe that the Internet is better and these cellular  things will be worse, then we shouldn't be that worried.  They're just going to be less useful and we'll end up using Wi-Fi more like we are at the  moment. That's my sort of long term view on this is if they want to make crappy networks  that are less useful, well, and charges money for that, then that doesn't seem like a great  business model to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the market will protect us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think over time, we'll realize that there are better things, better ways of getting  Internet connectivity than paying a cell phone carrier 100 bucks a month for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I agree.  But if that's all if that's your choice, the problem is that there's never been a free  market and cell carriers.  It seems like they've all colluded.  Yeah.  Let me play a little bit. This is just to show you that there is some talk about this,  even in the in the in the mainstream world.  John Stewart on The Daily Show last night, you sent me this clip.  He's got a new segment called John Stewart, Internet Predator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On one side, those who want the Internet to remain a wide open marketplace of ideas.  On the other side, a larger group who have no idea what net neutrality means.  But it is an important issue.  A few years ago, a Google vice president and one of the inventors of the Internet put it  best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The biggest concern I have at this point is that in the absence of some form of protection,  that the broadband service providers will be able to discriminate against the consumers  as to which products and services they're able to reach.  We must preserve neutrality in this system.  This is Vint Cerf talking.  To allow new Googles of the world, new Yahoo's, new Amazons to form.  Thank you, Obi-Wan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Makes sense. Google's unofficial motto is don't be evil.  So they would naturally oppose big corporations getting together to secretly decide what you  can and cannot see on the web. Am I correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What Google is proposing with its partner, Verizon, is essentially a toll road system,  a separate Internet for wireless devices only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love his...  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  So in four years, Google, the don't be evil empire, has gone from net neutrality will  allow new Googles and Amazons to form to net neutrality will allow new Googles and Amazons

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  to form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's Jon Stewart.  He's a comic.  But I have to say, we've already seen surveys say that most Americans under 25 get their  news from Jon Stewart.  So he speaks for a large constituency.  Is that an unfair characterization of what's going on?  It seems pretty much what we were saying last week, wasn't it, Gina?  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it was kind of funny.  I love how he said there was this large group of people who have no idea what neutrality  means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  But I was gratified that he talked about it on The Daily Show, right?  I mean, that shows that there's some interest in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Definitely, definitely.  I love that he covered it on The Daily Show.  I mean, you know, it was oversimplified and he laughed about it.  I mean, he pretty much hit the nail on the head.  What about Google's response, PR response, which published on Thursday, which was the  day after we did the show?  Someone on Twitter said, someone in Google PR is listening to Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't think it was just us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't certainly just us.  Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they said what Kevin said, which is this is the best we could get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right.  And did that make you feel better?  Why are they the ones getting it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Why is it their deal to make this decision?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kevin, I saw somebody on Twitter or somewhere complained that we're so American centric  on Twig because, hey, we're American, sorry.  But can you add some international perspective here because you're both familiar with what's  going on in the British political scene and work for a British company?  Where does this stand there?  What's the comparison?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Weren't you in Britain when this all went down, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, yeah.  I've been holding out the last two and a half weeks mostly off net, so I missed a big  chunks of this debate.  So the idea of net neutrality is one thing, but there's this sort of deeper legal idea  of common carriage.  In the UK, EU, we call that mere conduit, which is the idea that everyone should have  access to the service and they shouldn't be, as long as they pay for it in the same way  as everyone else and you don't discriminate based on who they are.  And this is a sort of deep legal principle that goes back a long way to the males and  stuff like that.  And that's the thing that carries through.  And so part of the problem in the US is that the FCC moved the regulation of internet from  a type that had common carriage requirements, that's title two, to something that didn't,  back in 1996, I think it was a while ago.  Stacey probably gave you more details on this last time around.  Other places in the world, they do have common carriage requirements like this and mere conduit  requirements.  The other thing that is done is what we call structural separation, where you have different  companies running different layers of the network.  And that's something we have in the UK.  So there's a BT subsidiary called Openreach, whose job is to just to run the cables, to  run fiber, to run copper, to light it up, to get stuff running, and then to sell that  to anyone at the same price.  So the rest of BT buys it from them at the same price as anyone else can, which stops  us doing the virtually integrated thing that otherwise the telco seems to be the natural  thing you want to do.  I think that's a good legislative structure and something that was partially there in  the US and then got sort of eroded away over time.  And I don't know exactly the timeline, the details of that.  I'm sure you could find someone like Gordon Cook who could give you chapter and verse  on that.  But that is something that is different in the UK than in the US.  And the other thing that's different in Europe and the UK is that pretty much every carrier  is on the cellular spectrum is using the same standard.  They're all using GSM.  You can buy a phone in the UK for £20.  Well, it's a pay-as-you-go phone and you just put a SIM into it and then you load that up  for another £20 worth of calling and you use that and then when it expires, you can  refill it again or not.  And you can buy, I did this last week with a colleague, you can buy a little bag of SIMs  for a pound each that belongs to all the different mobile networks and then load them up.  So you can plug them in and out of the phones as much as you'd like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How does that change this issue of kind of a gated, well actually really pay service  on the mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, obviously you get a different contract with those than you would with a monthly pay.  You're not watching television on it.  No.  So I bought a pay-as-you-go SIM from Orange in the UK and what I got for that was I get  so many texts, it's like 10p a minute for calling, so many texts, like 300 texts a month  and 20 megs of internet a month.  So that's not much, but you can actually use it like that, which means I can take an Android  over there and plug it in and make it work.  Whereas there is more interoperability there because there's some standardisation at the  lower levels and then there's competition at the upper levels.  My take on this is that overall I think we're moving beyond special networks for special  purposes and that's the cellular networks are sort of gradually going that way.  They were very voice focused networks and they're becoming data networks, but they're  having trouble hitting that and they're now saying please use Wi-Fi.  Five years ago the carriers wouldn't let you buy a phone that had Wi-Fi on it.  Now suddenly they're pleading with you to use Wi-Fi instead of their networks for the  higher bandwidth stuff because their modelling wasn't assuming that you'd be using Spotify  or audio streaming or listening to Twitter or anything like that on your phone over the  network.  They assumed you were making calls or doing small email-like transactions over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fools that they are.  Well, you're kind of in this, BT is in this business, right?  Oh yeah.  In fact, I think if you wanted to pick a poster child for net neutrality, it'd be companies  like Ribbit or Skype, companies like, you know, that do kind of traffic that might compete  with a carrier.  You don't want Ribbit to be discriminated against.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I mean that's the thing.  When I was in the UK I took my droid with me.  Now my droid is a CDMA phone, doesn't work in the UK, but on Wi-Fi I can use it as a  web device, but also I've got it set up with Ribbit and with VoIP on it so that if someone  rings my phone in the US, after three rings it roots into Ribbit and Ribbit then calls  me back over Wi-Fi on the same phone and it rings as a VoIP phone.  This is exactly what carriers hate.  To some extent it's what carriers hate, but Verizon doesn't have an option to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, were you to do that on a 3G network they would really hate it because then you'd  be using a wholesale bits instead of retail phone service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting because I got the Skype client for this, for the droid, which  Verizon promotes.  Verizon sent me a postcard saying get the Skype client, you'll love it.  And if you launch the Skype client on the droid it says I'm not running until you turn  Wi-Fi off because I want to bill you for the minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and then they bill you for the...  Now they don't bill you for cell minutes, but they bill you for the bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They bill you something.  I don't know exactly what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, how interesting.  I just got a story that Verizon is putting Skype even on feature phones now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I launch it, it'll say turn off Wi-Fi or else.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My droidX does the same thing.  That's very interesting.  So there's another way around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't work on Wi-Fi?  No.  At all?  Like you have to be on...  Yeah.  That's insane.  Yeah.  So they can bill you basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can't measure Wi-Fi.  You're not using their network, but as soon as you use the 3G network they can measure  it and bill you.  That's what we're talking about.  Aren't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, then the other one is that I just got the...  Yeah, there we go.  I'm going to read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Skype does not work on Wi-Fi.  It requires switching to a Verizon wireless data network connection.  And so what it does is it actually turns your Wi-Fi off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to explicitly turn off Wi-Fi or it will just quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's not really Skype is really what it is.  It's something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  The problem with Skype, you know, Skype is great and it's head up as an example of this,  but Skype is a proprietary protocol run by one company and they've got a biz dev deal  with Verizon.  That's what's happened.  Right.  Whereas the voiceover IP stuff, the stuff that we do with SIPDroid and the rivet routing  and that is some standardized stuff.  You've got a SIP protocol stack that says how you connect.  Then you've got a bunch of codecs that are commonly agreed of how you move the audio  and video back and forth.  That's the protocol stack that we can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What we're seeing as consumers is Google, Skype and other companies are reigning against  our interests in favor of their own financial interests, in favor of their own bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm not, you know, again, I'm not quite sure whether Google has a direct financial  interest in this or not.  I don't see, I don't see, you know, that, that maybe that shoe hasn't dropped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only thing we can hypothesize is that because Google now sells so many Android phones,  Verizon, it just makes sense that they're going, that they like Skype and these other  companies are going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but that may have been their ability to have a basis for talking to Verizon about  stuff.  But, you know, Android is, Android is properly open source.  It's not, it's not fully under Google's control, which is a good thing.  You know, one of the fascinating things that I've seen doing, you know, looking at this  Android development is how many Android devices are showing up.  I wish I had them here.  My colleague has, we put a menagerie of these together.  There's literally dozens.  More, there's hundreds.  Hundreds?  There are all these little Chinese devices that are, that are Androids that are, you  know, some are this big and some are this big and that their tablets and their phone-like  things and that they're cheap.  You know, you can buy them for 50 bucks retail from China and they're not beautiful bits  of hardware.  You know, they've got resistive screens, not capacitive, but they work.  They run Android, they run your apps.  And that for me is a massive sea change.  Google's sort of to get the powered by Google thing on the back with Google, you have to  sort of do a business deal with Google and sign up with Gmail and that.  But just to run the Android builds yourself, you don't have to do that.  You just need to download the code, compile it and write some drivers.  And we're starting to see this sort of all the consumer electronics companies are doing  this rather than write their own firmware.  And so, you know, I predict within six months or so all the little photo frame things and  all those devices like that that are, you know, that are all over the place and turned  out by the consumer electronics industry will start to run Android just by default because  it would be cheaper than building their own stuff for everything.  And that's going to start getting really interesting.  I'm not completely sure that Google is ready for that.  If you read the what you must have to be an Android device spec, it says you must have  a camera and you must have a whole bunch of different bits and pieces that need to be  there before they will approve it as an official Android device.  Whereas actually what these guys are doing is saying, OK, forget the camera.  We're building tablets or we're building something that looks like an iPod but happens  to be running Android instead.  And that's for me, that's really interesting.  That gives us this sort of huge pre-cambrian explosion of interesting devices to work on.  The thing about Android is that it's the first open source consumer operating system.  And it is something we haven't seen before.  We've had open source operating systems, but they never had actually that much adoption.  Because I'm sure you've been waving the charts around where Android is like a third of all  phones in the US and that kind of thing.  But I'm seeing this other sort of groundswell of gadgets that aren't phones, they're not  showing in those activation figures.  The Kmart device.  Have you guys seen that yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't played with it.  We've talked about it.  I haven't played with it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think there's one somewhere in the offices.  Again, it's not a great device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's just waving his hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not raising my hand because of the latency I have.  There was one bit of news in the feed is that the report that on Black Friday, Google and  Verizon will announce a Chrome based tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one way to respond, isn't it?  Is to do a standard with Verizon, of all people, that challenges things like the Augen.  That's what they did with the Nexus One.  They said this is the platform.  This is what it should look like.  You can buy other ones.  But this is the definitive Google experience.  Is that the idea of doing your own Chrome?  By the way, I don't know if it's Android.  It might be Chrome OS.  Yeah, they announced Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Chrome OS is what they're saying.  Did they announce it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was that a rumor?  It's a rumor still.  A name source at Thonload Squad says an HTC tablet running Chrome OS will be sold in Verizon  stores November 26th, day after Thanksgiving, Black Friday.  HTC and Verizon have not commented on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's Chrome OS.  I wonder why Google even, and we've asked this before on the show, why Google even bothers  with Chrome OS at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have several things going on at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me play this off for a second.  Kevin, if you don't have Android on the device, and you only have Chrome, does that, I'm just  thinking out loud here, which is dangerous, but does that then take away some of the functionality  that we might want, gives more control to Verizon, or does it give less control to them  because it's purely the browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I think Chrome is purely a browser, and that means you can only do browser-y things with  it.  So it's not completely clear what you would need to do to do device access, to do things  like telephony with it.  I haven't run a Chrome build, and I've only seen the running, so I haven't actually done  in-depth comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that would mean that Verizon isn't chargeable as a phone.  What you just said, I think, is that others couldn't cut in on its phone and communications  capabilities, and Verizon has the lock on that by not having Android, by just having  Chrome, so we can use it as a browser, that's fine, but that's all we can do.  Browser HTML, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the challenge there is bringing those functionalities to the browser, and they're not fully there  yet with, you know, there's ongoing discussion in HTML5 about how to bring more audio-video  capabilities to browser stuff, but that's not really agreed yet, so there isn't a  spec for that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you wouldn't have Skype there, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, not unless they specifically, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very convenient.  You completely control what apps are on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  So you wouldn't have, you know, there isn't an HTML5 way of saying capture voice yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it couldn't be a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, if they put Flash on it, then you could use the Flash stuff.  We've got, we built phones over Flash that run in browsers, so if they've got Flash  in the Chrome thing, which they probably have, you can build stuff that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there anything in HTML5 for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not yet, no.  That's one of the things that we need to work on.  Yeah.  I need to spend some time with the standards groups on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because Ribbit, without...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The irony is that it becomes less of a phone and the phone company likes it more because  it has more control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure that, I mean, they will see it as an additional device.  You know, that's the, if you look at the iPad analogy, the iPad is not designed to be a  phone device and you can buy it with or without the telephony contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina, I bet you agree.  I'd have to say I'm much less interested in a Chrome OS tablet than I would be in an Android  OS tablet.  Yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  I'm just thinking about, you know, the Kindle app and, I mean, there are just certain apps  that I would definitely want.  Although this Download Squad piece suggests that possibly this tablet could be free with  a Verizon contract.  That's kind of interesting.  I mean, yeah, I mean, I imagine so, I mean, we've established that the tablet is mostly  a consumption device and so you could browse and read, but I'm still, there's still certain  apps that I would want.  And I think, yeah, I think I'm more excited about the idea of an Android tablet versus  a Chrome OS.  Although I haven't really seen any Chrome OS, you know, running.  Like I haven't, you know, I ran a kind of an early build just to check it out, but I  haven't really given it a fair shake yet.  So I want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've done the Hexa build, right?  That's what I did.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We haven't done anything but the Hexa builds.  Yep.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's a browser.  It's the browser.  It's just a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a browser and your favorite web apps.  And that's great.  I love the web.  And it's, it's alive and well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  According, not according to Wired magazine.  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One more note.  Teacher, one more note is that we have a story in the feed that Google said in Germany they're  launching the Chrome app store in October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So really you're a great person to have on for this, Kevin, because you know probably  better than most what HTML5 can and can't do.  And really everything that you're going to see on a Chrome OS has to be an HTML5 app,  right?  It has to have JavaScript, CSS, HTML5.  If it can't be done by that, it can't be done by Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, though I think they do have Flash in there as well.  So you have the ability to do the stuff that Flash can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish they wouldn't put Flash in it, I have to say.  Because it adds a lot of capability.  Also has security issues.  It makes it slower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sort of anti-Flash.  It provides capabilities we haven't sounded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like capturing audio and video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've got an audio and video capture tool built into the system, then having Flash to  do that is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm breaking up a bit.  Yep, that's all right.  Welcome.  Verizon probably just noticed that we were doing this show.  All the bits will suddenly get jammed somewhere down the road.  All right, well let's take a break and come back.  We're going to talk some more about this subject and there is more Google News this  week.  I don't know how they keep coming up with more stuff.  Germany is getting some privacy in Street View.  Google TV maybe is stalling.  I'm very intrigued by what Apple is going to do.  September 8th they're going to announce, well we know something, probably new iPods.  I think they're going to announce an Apple TV to compete with Google TV.  We'll talk about that.  And Marissa Meyer and why she should be careful on what she clicks.  Whoopsies.  Before we do that, I would like to mention my friends at GoToMeeting, that's the Citrix  folks that do such great stuff.  And boy, I tell you, GoToMeeting on the iPad, and I think GoToMeeting on a Chrome OS would  be just spectacular.  On the iPad it's amazing.  You could take your iPad, I could sit outside as long as I'm within Wi-Fi range.  Actually, I bet it would work on 3G.  I haven't tried it.  I get audio, I get video, I get your desktop on my iPad.  I can see what the meeting is all about.  It is a great way to get more done, bringing people together for either sales, training,  collaboration, any kind of meeting.  You know, a meeting on the phone without the visuals just starts to really, I don't know,  it's hard to keep people focused, hard to keep them engaged.  But as soon as they've got something to look at, it's a great web conference.  Now, I've tried a lot of web conferencing tools.  There is none better than GoToMeeting.  VoIP is included.  You can call via the phone or via your computer.  128-bit SSL, 24-7 customer support, easiest to use, easiest to install, and very affordable.  $49 a month for unlimited meetings, all the meetings you want as long as you want, as  often as you want.  But I'm going to give it to you free for the first month so you can see for yourself.  I love it when companies offer free trials.  I think it's the only way.  We were talking about this yesterday, how advertising for so many years was tricking  you.  Girls won't like you if you don't use GoToMeeting.  Instead, we're back to features and benefits.  This is the product.  This is what it does.  Try it.  You make the decision.  I think that's in the internet age, that's called trusting the customer.  And I really applaud Citrix for doing it.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig, T-W-I-G.  Try it free for 30 days.  You be the judge.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support.  This week in Google.  Actually, Anil Dash also clicked the Twi-efficiency button.  And Marissa Meyer did.  She apparently has a Twi-efficiency of zero.  Anil Dash apparently has a Twi-efficiency of out of bounds error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Knowing Anil, that may have been just a really well-crafted joke.  It could have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it could have been, couldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he was joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't even think of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although you never know with him.  But I'm pretty sure he was joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's his dry wit.  They've changed the Twi-efficiency site now.  There's a checkbox.  So you can calculate your Twi-efficiency, whatever the hell that is.  It's another one of those sites.  I like Clout, K-L-O-U-T.  I think that's actually fairly, at least it has lots of pretty graphs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clout is great.  Twi-efficiency was just an OAuth app that the 17-year-old was playing around with.  You're kidding.  The Twitter API.  Yeah.  And said Twitter is turning off their basic authentication, so everything has to go to  OAuth in the next two weeks.  Good.  So you'll see a lot of, which is great, you'll see a lot of people saying, hey, I have to  retool my Twitter app because I have to use OAuth.  So he wanted to teach himself OAuth.  So he made this app, which I believe is just kind of for fun.  I don't even think the algorithm is anything, the calculation is very sophisticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So because it's OAuth, James Cunningham is requesting a token from Twitter.  I'm going to allow it because I'm logged into Twitter.  Now this is the problem.  Marissa Meyer did it and it automatically tweeted her efficiency.  I think I might've just done it too.  Whoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You did because if you do it, you allow the app to act up, it will tweet for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you make fun of Marissa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, but he's changed it.  There was a checkbox, but I think I forgot to uncheck it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not your fault, Marissa.  We'll forgive you because I'm the same idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is the problem.  So basically OAuth gives you the ability to selectively give different preferences to  different applications, but Twitter doesn't give you a UI for that.  So if the app says, I want to tweet on your behalf, you don't have a checkbox saying,  no, you don't get to tweet on my behalf.  Right.  So if it asks for that, you've either got to say, no, I don't get to use this app or  yes, and then it will tweet on your behalf.  And this is a spammy mechanism that lots of these apps have done.  And to efficiency, I don't think he was trying to be spammy.  He just built a simple thing.  But because it was, you know, here's my thing, what's yours?  And you think, what is that?  And you click on it, it doesn't tell you any information until you sign up.  And then you've gone around the loop.  He's built like the smallest self-propagating stupid web thing.  You know, there was this thing, personal hype quotient, which somebody did at South by two  years ago to parody this movement.  And so when I saw this, it was exactly this.  It says, my personal hype quotient is right there.  My personal hype quotient is rising because I'm whatever.  And it's this on your on your behalf.  But this is like the purest, simplest form of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, at least mine is one percent.  Marissa's is zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The key is when you create an app, you can say, give it read, access or read, write.  So whenever you allow an app to access your Twitter stream, just check to see if it's  read or read, write, because if it's read, write, it's very possible that it will send  messages on your behalf just in case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is the problem.  The problem is you don't get an option to say, no, you only get read only.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is that same issue that we have when we install apps on our Android phones and  it says, I'm going to do this.  I can do this, this, this and this.  You can't uncheck one of those boxes.  It's all or nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  That's right. And there's a great post that Randy Farmer wrote based on some of the  discussions we've had.  I can't find it.  About about this, these problems.  The problem is that how do you decide when to authenticate an application and when not?  And the answer is, well, you try and you see what your friends have done.  But if your friends have been fooled by it, then they'll go there, too.  So so so what Randy, Randy, Randy had a great debate at IW before last.  And we said what you want is to be is for your friends to be able to say this thing  cheated me. I'm disallowing it.  And when you go to the sign up screen, it says Leo says this thing cheated me.  Kevin says this thing cheated me.  You go, oh, never mind.  So he called this the cake is a lie.  He named it after the portal thing is that you want to be able to write the cake is a  lie on the wall of the app.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, by the way, my personal hype quotient is a whopping eight out of ten.  Oh, you're doing well there.  Yeah. It says I'm currently on book tour or I wouldn't be engaging in this crap.  I defy you. I defy you all to check your personal hype quotient.  That's really funny. Thank you for that link, Kevin.  I appreciate it.  Kind of fun to play with.  Let's see. Moving on to other stories.  We did mention this briefly, but let's let's say apparently, according to Chris  Anderson in Wired magazine, the Web is dead.  That other forms of traffic have outpaced the Web.  We're not going to surf. W.W.W.  Forget it. We kind of talked a little bit about this app thing.  It's kind of like that is apps have replaced the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But didn't Gina didn't Gina just go to his go to his point a little bit?  I hate to say this by saying, oh, I don't want something that's just a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to have we did, didn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We said that, didn't we?  A little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, it's you know what?  We want both.  That's it for the browser to be capable enough to do.  And that's what I was saying. We want choice.  It's not quite there.  I would like the browser, the HTML5 to give me as many facilities  to build any app I want.  And is getting there with the HTML5 stuff.  We can do huge amounts of things that you couldn't do before.  But it's not quite there with device drivers and audio, video input  and a few other bits and pieces.  And it's not fully distributed across a bunch of different things.  So but we were getting closer.  And there's the same sort of trade off of is this thing standardised enough  that I can write the code in one place to have it run in lots of lots of places,  not worry about what it's running on.  The Web is the best example of that we've ever had.  And Android is sort of somewhere along that line.  You know, we've got a bunch of different devices and it kind of runs on them.  But you have to do a little bit of debugging here and there.  This is better than we've had, you know, with, say, running Java apps in the browser.  But it's not it's not completely smooth.  And the Web isn't pretty smooth either, but it's getting a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think it didn't just kill the Web.  Then we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In my defense and in the Web's defense, most of my favorite apps  are add ons to existing Web services.  There are only a few things, like a few apps that I use that don't have a Web component.  Pandora, Mint, you know, my tracks, the Twitter app, Gmail, calendar.  All these things have Web based components.  They're add ons.  The Kindle app is one app that I really like on my phone  and would really like on my tablet.  And I can't read my Kindle books.  Not that I can't, but there isn't a Web interface for that.  But that's a very that's a rare exception.  And what other apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it really matter if it uses HTTP or TCP or UDP or FTP?  I mean, what do we care?  Oh, let's preserve HTTP like that's some magic thing.  What is this?  There's a couple of things going on there.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just part of the part of the wire story was arguing was calling Facebook an app.  Well, in the broader sense, yes, it is, but it works on HTML.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a Web app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so really, that that is that right there kind of undercuts their argument pretty well.  Oh, you mean a Web page is undercutting the Web?  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Well, that's I mean, also, there's, you know, there's a certain amount of like,  are we comparing similar things here?  Because the left hand set of that graph is all protocols.  FTP, Telnet, whatever, you know, you see for newsgroups.  And it says Web.  And does that mean HTTP?  Because if it means HTTP, then that video chunk should be mostly HTTP.  Oh, that's right.  Web as well.  That's right.  Because most video is HTTP.  Right.  So what is the Web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is the Web?  Is it another question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Web is growing and expanding and being what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It lives.  It breathes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Look, as long as it's all on the Internet, I don't really care.  I mean, look, this show, most people who are watching the show are watching it on a Web page.  The transport that we're using in many cases is Flash.  In some cases is H.264.  In some cases, it's HTTP.  Some cases, it's UDP.  Doesn't I mean, who cares?  The content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I find it ironic that both Wired magazine and Rupert Murdoch are declaring dead the  thing that's killing them.  Surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What a surprise.  Oh, Condé Nast doesn't like the Web.  By the way, we called up today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My comment is like, why declares the Web dead?  The Web is surprised that Wired is still alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We called up today.  Frederic, my assistant, came to me and said, I can't do it.  I said, what?  She said, you wanted me to cancel the paper Wall Street Journal because I get the Wall  Street Journal on my iPad and on the Web.  So I said, why am I getting the paper journal?  It costs me 10 bucks more to not get the paper journal.  If I want to cancel the paper,  I have to pay more.  Rupert Murdoch has set it up for some reason.  I don't quite understand that it's cheaper to get the paper and the Web than to just  get the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Simple, Leo.  Simple because he's charging all those paper advertisers as if you stare at every ad on  those pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the thing that's lining our birdcage is making him money.  He is a tree killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's ripping off the advertisers.  Which is not just him.  It's always been the case.  It's the big lie of print that you bought the entire audience in publication as if  that entire audience paid attention to it all.  But of course, we didn't.  Not being a real man, I always threw out the sports section.  But the advertiser was paying for my attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to say as a podcaster, that's a discussion we don't like to get into because  advertisers frequently say, well, you're counting downloads, but who's to say they  listened?  And of course, there's no answer to that any more than they bought the magazines.  Who's to say they saw your ad or they bought the newspaper?  Who's to say they saw your ad?  We don't know.  And there was one move for a while to distribute special modified iPods that actually watch  what you listen to.  Fortunately, thank goodness that's gone by the wayside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there's Last FM.  That feeds back what you've listened to.  iTunes knows what you've played and it propagates it back from the iPod, or at least it used  to.  I might have stopped working for mine a while back.  So you can actually run little scripts on iTunes in the menus and say, give me a playlist  of things I haven't already played and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't show you you've listened to the whole thing or does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's there's a threshold.  I think it shows you what you can find out what fraction you've listened to.  I think there is an API in there, but it only is, you know, only if you've listened to it  on an iPod or iTunes.  You know, if I copy it to my Android and listen to it, it has no idea.  And that's the problem I've had with iTunes.  Once I started listening to podcasts on Android, it said, oh, you haven't listened to this.  I'm going to stop downloading it for you.  It's like, no, I haven't listened to it.  It's just not on your starting device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now we know that Rupert Murdoch, Condi Nast, Prince, and the latest John Cougar Mellencamp  hate the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mellencamp says, I think the internet's the most dangerous thing invented since the atomic  bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  And I thought McGuinness was back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Prince says it's full of numbers and that can't be good.  I swear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bruno says we should be like the Chinese government.  That was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is good.  It just blocked the things we don't like.  It's not good for you.  We know what's good for you.  Moving right along.  So I think we've concluded the web is not dead.  That's good.  The web's alive.  Still.  The web's alive.  Now, Gina, you have an article.  Are you talking a little bit about this Google Me?  I think we're getting closer and closer to a Google Me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so too.  You know, a former Google employee, I was asking him about what he knew about Google  Me and the answer was nothing.  But he said that a user experience designer at Google had done, Paul Adams had done a  presentation and the slides are up on SlideShare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a really nice presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  He said, if you read this, if you look at this presentation, you'll get a good idea  of what Google Me is going to be.  And it's an excellent presentation.  And I linked it on the friend feed.  But we had talked about how we really hope that Google Me just doesn't aim to clone  Facebook and kind of catch up.  We're hoping that it's going to do something different and new and kind of solve some of  the problems that people have on Facebook.  And if this presentation is any indication, it's going to do that.  Adams basically talks about how we all have these different groups of people in our lives  and different levels of relationship.  He talks about this woman, Debbie, who lives in San Diego and has some friends in LA.  Work at a gay bar and they post kind of pictures from the wild nights at the bar on Facebook.  And she comments on those.  But she also coaches a 10 year old girl swimming team.  And so she's friends with some of the some of her swimmers on Facebook as well.  And during the sort of user research, you know, interviewing that they did with her,  she was horrified to realize that her swimmers could see her comments on the gay bar pictures  and how that in real life just doesn't happen.  Right. Because you go to your mom's house for Thanksgiving and you behave one way in front of  Uncle Bill and Aunt Marge.  Right. But when you're with your friends at Hooters, you react, you act a totally different way.  But on the Internet, it's one friend's list and a status update goes out to everyone regardless of  context. So it sounds to me like Google's really going to attempt to make it easy to  differentiate between strong ties and weak ties and also differentiate between different  social contexts.  Now, to me, this sounds like a user interface nightmare.  Nightmare. Yeah.  A challenge.  I suppose it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is the hard problem.  The hard problem is specifying groups.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  And, you know, Buzz does a pretty good job of this.  Right. I mean, well, they have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if does anybody use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is the question.  Does anybody use it?  You know, are we going to take the time to garden our various contexts and groups?  You know, am I going to take the time to post status updates to my family group versus my,  you know, my kids group and my swim team?  You know, I don't know.  But this presentation also talks about how important profiles are, which I think is  interesting because I do think Google profiles is going to be central to Google me and how  our, you know, the way that we create our identity online.  I mean, we all want we all care very deeply about how other people see us.  Actually, there's a photo of a woman who is in high heels on crutches.  And he makes the point like, you know, people care about what the perception is and what  they look like to others.  And how do we do that online to various to various groups?  But it's a really good presentation.  I recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if if Google smarterware.org is right on the front page of Gina's site, you can get

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to it. That's the easiest way.  If Google can pull this off, Google me sounds really neat.  I just hope that it's not just a sea of toggles and drop downs and checkbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what the user interface is going to look like.  And I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you've got a bit of this in bars, but it's slightly buried.  If you've seen this in bars.  If you go in bars, you can.  And when you create a new bars, you can decide which group it goes to.  Right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But does anyone do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Never done it.  I've never even set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's a little drop down at the bottom that says public on the web.  And if you choose that, oops, I've got crap in front of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when I create a new one, I could choose whether I want this public or private.  And if you click private, it lets you choose which groups.  And then I.  And then I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is also where this is where Zuckerberg goes by saying we have one identity where people  pisses off people with this idea that you can completely fence off one world from another  world and they will never cross.  As she says, yes, the presentation shows there are new ways for them to cross,  but they've always been able to cross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually and you know, it's nice.  And this is where Google really has an advantage.  If you've been using Google Contacts or Android, you already have set up groups.  You see, because I was using Google Voice, I have different messages for my family and  different messages for my friends.  And I have started Android, so I can use those groups are already here.  I could use those.  I could say this goes to my family only that you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they are.  And in this presentation, he talks about how most people have maybe two to four or maybe  six strong ties, those people who you actually are going to call on your phone a couple times  a week.  And Google has that information, especially using an Android phone.  They know who you're emailing, who you're calling, who your strong ties are, who your  weaker ties are more temporary ties are.  So they can use that data to, you know, to help you.  Talk about how people self-censor when they post to Facebook because they don't want to  say things.  Or they wish they had.  Or they wish they had.  Right.  But they're not going to post a tweet about or whatever about what a jerk their boss is  if they're aware that they're bosses.  Oh, my employees do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My employees are the only ones who actually have bosses who are on Buzz, Facebook, Twitter,  Google, all of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I just hope that Google Meet doesn't make you work too hard.  And if you're using Gmail and if you're especially if you have an Android phone, Google knows  a lot about who Google's eyes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one of the things that just changed this week.  Buzz, they're making recommendations now based on who you email and stuff.  Right.  You get a recommendation recommend to follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Which is which is nice to just order following you, which is what they did before with it.  Yeah, it's a big improvement.  We've decided you should follow this person.  Wait, what?  They've had that they've had that in Google Talk for ages.  It will be able to arbitrarily add people email them enough.  I hate that.  Slightly irritating.  Yeah.  But the other thing that they've got, which is in Gmail somewhere and is a bit subtle,  is the have you seen the Did You Forget Bob or Is That the Right Bob plugins in  what do you call it in labs?  I think it's in labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Gmail labs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's there's a group in Israel that don't forget Bob it is and what the other one is  got the wrong Bob.  What those do is they look at who you email together as groups and they say, wait a minute,  you just emailed you just emailed Leo and Jeff and you left out Gina.  Do you want to add Gina in or you said you just sent that to the wrong Jeff.  You sure you normally you include Jeff in that group and you've just included these  other Jeff.  You got the right one.  So it's looking at the patterns you use and trying to construct groups for you.  So that's that's a that's an interesting, again, it's traffic analysis kind of thing.  Google's fairly good at and the challenge with all these things is coming up with UX  for people so they actually understand what's being asked of them.  And that's the bit that's going to take them a lot of time to work through all this is to say,  actually, I don't want you automatically adding people to that group.  But if you if you help me construct a group from the set of people I email frequently,  that will be useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what this really is, is a great kind of a public works project for social scientists.  Suddenly, if you're a social scientist or a UX or a UX expert, you suddenly are a hot commodity  because this isn't a computer science problem.  The computer science is done.  This is a UI problem.  This is a how do we how do we teach people how to use this problem?  Go ahead.  I see Jeff's hand up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying to get my my my my penalty box here.  When we met when Jake and I met with Mark Zuckerberg, he said something at the end  that I love, which is that Facebook is a technology and sociology company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's really trying to find the ways that people are behaving and help them do what they want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does Google Kevin?  We have the right guy here because Kevin Marx was in charge of profiles for a while.  I know Rick Clow is now in charge of profiles, but you've been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw Rick, by the way, at Google.  Oh, yeah.  And he does promise to come on the show when he has something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And did he give it like a time frame like September?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anything that they've got to give you a time frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be done when it's done.  It's like Michael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's that's Google rules.  It's like when it's ready, we'll ship it.  Yeah.  So or the case, right.  There's a bunch of bits and there's a bunch of bits and pieces that are built up that you need to do this.  And the profiles is part of it.  The contact stuff is part of it.  The groups is the other piece of this is coming up with standards so that we can move stuff between  sides, which is part of the stuff I've been working on inside Google and outside as well.  We've got the portable contact stuff, but the activity streams for sending flows of events back  and forth.  I mean, if you look at the stuff they're building up in bars, they're very much building on that  work and doing that now.  And I suspect they will continue along that line.  So there's open social as well.  Open social incorporates a bunch of that stuff and standardizes it.  And that's still going on, you know, not as loudly as we were talking about it two years ago,  but that's because the loud bits done.  It's now infrastructure.  It's now running on lots of sites.  And a lot of this is making sure that we can do this in ways that you can move between places.  And it isn't one giant monolith that belongs to one company.  And my experience with Google has been that they've done this well in terms of working on  the standard stuff, but they've been they perhaps have been less good at integrating into product  and getting the UX and the sociology right.  That would probably be something that even they'd accept.  Are they hiring social scientists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are they working on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I know.  I haven't spoken to them.  They have.  They had a definite deficit in that area.  They had Yuri as their accidental sociologist because they hired him and he was doing a lot  of that stuff.  Yeah.  And I'm not sure they really replaced him.  They did just buy all the guys from slide.  So there's a lot of experience of practically doing that there.  And that makes that things I suspect that will be a good fit.  Because if you look, there was this big sort of slide is social gaming.  Buzz in the papers, but it isn't slide has always been about social interaction,  about self-presentation and things like that.  If you look at their portfolio, it's mostly photo sharing, top friends, stuff like that.  That is about structuring your relationships and presenting stuff to different groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you think of somebody who does this well right now, Kevin?  This UI stuff, the ability to parse this and make sense of it.  One of the reasons Twitter succeeded is because there was so little to make sense of.  It was very straightforward.  One of the reasons Facebook, I think, has faced real challenges is,  and it shows up in their settings for privacy, it's hideously complex and it really goes over  people's heads.  Is there somebody who's figured out, has a complex system that they figured out an easy way to  demonstrate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not that I've seen.  I think this is a hard problem.  I think the problem is there's this sort of tension declaring this stuff and not declaring it.  Probably the one that I think has been reasonably good has been Flickr with their very, very simple  friends checkbox, family checkbox.  Default public, but you can pick those two as the constraint.  Then they're not alternatives, they're additives.  You can decide friends and family or just friends, just family.  That was a fairly early design.  I think they've got reasonably good uptake of that.  Most of their stuff is public, but they've got a good uptake of shared stuff like that as well.  I'm seeing startups and people working about that.  Greg Narain, he's got a startup called Little Grams, which is about helping you share your  baby's first moments and stuff like that.  A big chunk of the stuff that he's talking about there is saying you have a set of different  groups of people that some of them are the grandparents and want to see every damn thing,  and some of them are your friends and they just want to see something every now and then,  and you want to help people construct those subgroups easily and connect the stuff across  systems.  So there's a bunch of people looking at this stuff, but it is difficult to get exactly right.  The hard part is trying to do it all in one system.  If you actually look at behavior at the moment, we tend to use different sites for different  aspects of ourselves.  That presentation that you showed talks about that explicitly.  It says we have these different subgroups.  The way we model that at the moment is we have a bunch of people on LinkedIn and a bunch of  people on Twitter and a bunch of people in email and a bunch of people somewhere else  and in some NING site somewhere that we use for the soccer club or whatever, and they're all  separate groups that we've built and we sort of police them by having them in different spaces  that we use for those different tasks.  And the challenge is combining those together in a useful way without accidentally making it too  easy for people to bridge them so that they can suddenly reveal your suicide girls membership to  your LinkedIn friends or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't look at me.  Maybe one of the ways you can decipher what Google's up to is through API changes.  And there were two new, actually three new Buzz API features as a garden hose, but I think  there's two that I think are telling.  There's an API.  This came out this week to return the people associated with a particular activity query.  The example they give is if you want to see people associated with Red Sox near Fenway Park,  you could then aggregate buzzes, I presume it's buzzes or searches around that,  which I think is very interesting.  And then you can now discover and explore content related to a particular post.  So you can access, developers can access and deliver Google search results related to the  topic of that post.  So you could be looking at a Gina blog post, smart aware, and you could have a  button on it that said what related things that Google would generate the related things out of  that.  And this is a buzz.  This is buzz API.  So I guess it's buzz results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, we visited with Ed Williams this week too, and where they're kind of heading with  Twitter is much the same thing.  As they get to locations, people follow and gather around locations.  They follow and gather around times and topics as well as people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's the kind of search you want to do.  Unfortunately, this search URL is giving us the raw XML here.  But I mean, really kind of cool.  And that makes all the data that they've got embedded in Twitter or Buzz much more useful if  you can search it with these proper parameters.  In some ways, API reflects this UI problem.  It is a way of exposing something that people might want in a way that a developer can  make real.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure that Kevin would come up with some apt phrase, but the API is intention kind of  written into code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's definitely intention in API.  There are definitely times when you want to do something and the API just doesn't support  it.  Right.  But absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's very much it.  You're encoding worldview whenever you're building an API.  You're saying this is the way the world works.  Call it my way and it will work this way.  The challenge of the standardization part of that is getting those different worldviews to  go here and to say, well, yeah, you have this model of people behaving this way and you have  this model of people behaving this way.  Can we actually combine them?  We'll add an optional location field so that the places that have it can put it in the ones  that don't.  You can do stuff like that.  The activity stream stuff in most of the mailing list is people argue about should this be  called this or this?  And is this thing like that?  And is a location a point or an address or a sort of general geographic name?  And how do you say which it is?  Sort of slightly fuzzy stuff like that.  But that's how you actually get these things to move between sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are we past baby steps on this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, we're starting to see actual activity on this.  Pardon the pun.  The interesting stuff about Bars is that they are trying really hard to build this stuff on  the open standards.  And the open standards guys are sort of keeping them to that and saying, actually, you've  hardcoded something that's Twitter specific here or whatever.  But that's their, definitely the vibe I get from that team is that they care about doing  it that way and doing it well.  And they're more focused on that side of it than on hitting shipping deadlines for a  particular thing, which I think is encouraging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to wrap it up.  I mean, gosh, there's so many things to talk about.  And I'm looking at our rundown.  We have hundreds of items still in there.  Is there anything, I'll give you all a chance, is there anything that you think we've missed  or something that you would like to bring up, Gina, that is going on right now that  we should talk about Google TV we really didn't talk about?  Wall Street Journal says it's going to be a tough sell to partners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a particular Android app that launched that may be your tool.  So I don't want to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Go ahead.  I don't have a tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is your tool an Android app this week?  No, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't actually have a tool yet.  I have to think of it while you're doing your tip.  What is it?  What is the app you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Voice Actions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, isn't that, did we not talk about that?  We didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So last week, it was the day before the mobile announcement, right?  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We speculated on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we speculated that it would be music, but we were completely off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love these mobile actions.  Unfortunately, my DroidX is 2.1, so I had to go to the Nexus One, but it works very nicely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It works really well, like surprisingly well, right?  I mean, given Google Voice, I had my doubts, but it's done really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it's my voice or maybe I know how to do it, but I get really 90%  or more accuracy when I dictate to it.  I'm very careful.  I enunciate and so forth, but I said test, text messages.  I almost said sext message.  Test, text messages.  I sent test emails.  You could say note to self and it'll send you an email with the note.  I just think this is really slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a great app and it's in the market, Google Voice Actions.  It's really cool.  And I like how you dictate what you want and then it gives you the prompt and says,  hey, is this what you want?  And you say, yes, depending on whatever the action is.  But that's a good way to handle it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is really taking advantage of Android's voice control, which is something that  iPhone doesn't have.  The last big mobile event was navigation, which is also something iPhone doesn't have.  So I feel like they're obviously really trying to make a point of the things like  voice actions to differentiate themselves from other platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was kind of a logical move because that was already an advantage that Android had,  which is you could dictate a lot of things and now it's just dictation everywhere.  There is an application on the iPhone that Apple owns called Siri that does this and more.  You could say book me a table at Post Trio and it will do it.  So Apple has a technology in an app.  I would love to see them incorporated into the OS.  I think this may be a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, what's it under in the marketplace?  I'm sorry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's it under in the marketplace?  Google Voice Actions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they also went public with Chrome to phone, which anybody who listens to this  show knows all about already because it was your pick many, many, many weeks ago and I've been  using it for a while.  That requires also 2.2.  So it's interesting.  That's another thing I found interesting as long as we're reading tea leaves that Google  is starting to push technologies that require Froyo, even though most handsets still are not Froyo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we're getting there, right?  I mean, so the old droid has Froyo.  I upgraded my droid to 2.2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My mind came up.  I got a two out of three here.  So yeah, the Droid X does and I really wanted to.  Actually, that was another thing.  There was a little conversation about, I think Google and others are saying,  let's just stop doing these manufacturer corruptions of Android and just put it out straight, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to apologize.  My tip last week about hanging up a call using the power button, I got a couple of upset email  from folks who have a build of Android where that setting is not available in the accessibility  setting.  So my apologies.  I'm working with the pure, clean, pristine Nexus one where all the options are available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm very tempted to go back to the Nexus one.  I love the big screen on Droid X, but the plain Google experience is still far superior to  everything else out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it depends.  It depends what they do with it.  The sprint one is really annoying because they've got a bunch of apps baked into it  that you can't delete that I don't want.  That's just nasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You mean you're not a NASCAR fan, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say NASCAR fan, Kevin.  I mean, aren't we all NASCAR fans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Also, I haven't got a sprint sim in this.  It's just a gadget for me.  So it just sits there and sulks at me because it's trying to contact sprint specific things  that aren't there.  The Galaxy S, I'm mostly like what they did to it here, except for they changed the checkboxes  to their own look of checkboxes that are gray with a big checkmark in them.  And then you get a green checkmark and they're checked.  And it throws me every time.  I think I've seen something that happened.  But the thing they let you do on here, which I hadn't seen on any others,  they let you change the system typeface, which is kind of nice.  So you can switch it over to something else.  So I don't mind there being some variation on what they can do.  I wish they'd standardize where they put the power socket  because I've been carrying three of these around.  I never know where to switch them off and plug them in.  But I also wish they'd standardize the bottom buttons

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because I keep hitting on the wrong button on the Nexus One and the Droid.  They've flipped the menu in the back button.  By the way, what's an edge case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what is time for a phone off a phone off you to and how many phones you have.  Okay.  It's a phone off time.  How many phones have you used in the last month?  The Kevin's got me beat.  You use the last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin's got me beat.  He's got every phone I would wager if he's got a hog in tablet in the office.  He's got everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've got three or four.  They're actually phone phones.  Do you have the Dell Streak yet?  My colleague had one of those in the UK.  Yeah.  So I tried to try that out briefly.  What do you think?  It's interesting.  Again, none of the bigger ones yet I've seen have as good touch control as the iPad  or this generation of phones.  Now that I've been a little disappointed with that.  But it seemed an interesting device.  I didn't have a chance to play with it for long enough to rave about.  The Kmart one does feel fairly nasty and does some slightly odd things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Android does.  So when Apple advocates are comparing the iPhone to the Android phones,  that's one thing they'll always say is,  see it's just slightly sluggish when you try to slide the screen.  And that may be an Android thing.  I don't know.  But I always say, but where's your back button?  That always gets them.  Where's your back button?  What do you do when you want to back out of something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I show people swipe and they go, oh.  Swipe is awesome.  Swipe rocks.  But I can't download it.  You can't buy it.  Why can't I buy swipe for the phones that haven't got it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Swipe comes on the Droid X.  I know.  We had this whole argument.  In fact, Gina told everybody to get swipe.  Then swipe got mad.  Then they came back and said, OK, you win.  And there's a beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just put it in the store for five bucks.  They make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They'd make tons of money because it is really a huge room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Once you know, because I got switched over.  Which one of these?  I switched over to one of these and didn't have it.  And it was like, I can't type like this anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is this pecking?  What is this tapping every character?  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The HTC has its own damn keyboard, which is worse than either the standard Android or swipe.  So you sit there poking at it and it's making stuff up for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, if you do want to get an Android phone and you've been eyeing the Samsung Galaxy S  today only, as we record this August 18th, T-Mobile is offering the Vibrant,  which is their version of the Galaxy S for 99 bucks.  So that's a pretty good deal.  So you like that phone.  I think it's got the AMOLED screen, which is gorgeous.  It's a smaller screen.  I do like it.  It's nice.  Some people have complained about what Samsung has done with Android, but  if it's only checkboxes, I can live with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's only the checkboxes, really.  I think nothing else is really bugging.  It doesn't have a search button, which is slightly weird.  What?  It hasn't got a silkscreen search button.  You have to use the menu to find it.  Oh no, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it.  Right out.  Because the voice actions, you press and hold the search button.  Search button, right.  And the voice actions work.  You got it.  Why?  Huh?  All right, Jeff, you have any stories that we've missed that you want to cover?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stories?  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anything else you would like to say before we go to our tip, tool, and number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nope.  I think I've said my piece.  Talked about everything I want to talk about.  Let's get Gina Tripani's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Picasa, which never gets as much credit for being a Google product as it should.  Fantastic Photo Manager.  There's a new version out, 3.8.  You won't get the update automatically if you're running Picasa.  You have to go re-download it.  But one of Picasa's coolest features, which it's had for a while, is face recognition.  Right?  So it'll scan through all your photos and it'll group all the pictures that I have of Leo.  It'll group together in a Leo pile.  And that's awesome.  Throw them right out.  3.8 has this new, awkwardly named face movie feature.  So I can click on the stack of photos of my sister and I can choose create face movie.  And it makes this really nice slideshow of just the face kind of centered and the pictures show  up around it.  And it's really neat.  You can watch kids grow up and you can see hairstyles throughout the ages.  Oh, nice.  It centers the face in a fixed position.  So it's a really neat visual effect.  I love it.  It's super cool.  I'm going to make a bunch of these for my mom of my nephews.  I think she's going to love it.  It's just a tiny little thing.  But the facial recognition plus this new face movie in 3.8 is super cool.  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I wanted that.  Because when you do the facial recognition, it shows you all those little faces and you  can slide through it.  And it was like, oh, there's almost something there.  And they had that merged them together into one thing before.  They never quite worked.  But that's nice.  I have to play with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, face movie is really neat.  Definitely check it out and play with it.  There's a video.  There's a YouTube video on the link on the front feed that will give you with a little demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Jeff's number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'll do two sets.  The first is tomorrow is the sixth anniversary of the Google IPO.  Wow.  And even though Google stock is down 20% this year, it's up 3.89% in the six years since the IPO.  The other number I'll give you is 45 or 43.  When Jake and I were at Facebook outside of the conference room where we met with Zuckerberg,  there was a very big screen with a very big countdown on it, counting down from 45 days.  And so we asked Mark, well, what's happening in 45 days?  And he said, what?  No, the number of Jake says, I don't think I can say that.  It was visible to any visitor who was there.  We didn't learn anything about it.  They're counting down to something happening soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's just a teaser.  That's a good number.  We don't know what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The secret number.  No idea what it means whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be a new lunch in the lunchroom.  It could be anything.  You know, when we talked with Ev and company at Twitter, and they have every employee tweeting  there, the interesting thing was that they said that, you know, what are their rules?  Their rules are, don't be stupid.  Obviously, don't talk about any secrets.  But the one I loved was this.  If you talk about something you're doing in your work, people will read into it.  Like, oh, we're so excited.  We've been up all night.  We're working on this new thing.  Then the whole world thinks, aha, here is Tris' world acquisition strategy.  And it may just be some little upgrade and something you never, ever see.  So you never know what happens with a side of company.  The funny thing is, I felt as if Jake were going around, it was the new Hollywood stars homes tour.  Because you go to these places and we watch them as if they're stars.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So 45.  Tonight, supposedly Facebook releases its location stuff.  I think I can say this now.  When I was at food camp, there were some Facebook people there with RFID tags that you would wear  a little pin and you would check in with your little pin.  So I don't know if Facebook is going to have a hardware check-in feature.  I think everybody's doing geographic.  They have that F8, I think.  Yeah.  So it's not a secret.  Maybe it's just a demo of something.  Yeah.  But we expect that tonight.  Also in the calendar, the incredible, according to, I think Mashable, the incredible is supposed  to get 2.2 today.  So if you're using a Droid incredible, that would be a nice phone to upgrade to Froyo, I think.  My pick of the week is Zagat.  The Zagat guides are just great.  I think they're a little expensive.  They do have them on iPhone as well as Android.  It is $10, but I use it all the time because you could just say if you're in a Zagat area  or Zagat, whatever they call it.  I think it's Zagat.  You can find restaurants.  You can find shopping and hotels.  And they are now, it's interesting, they are now adding four-square integration.  Everybody's got check-in.  Everybody.  Yelp now has check-in.  I am the Duke of many locations that I was the mayor of just a few days ago.  I'm both mayor and Duke of some places.  So Zagat is now the-  King, though.  King.  I want King.  Maybe they'll do that.  You're the king of the cottage.  They also have something called Food Spotting, which is a social platform and mobile app  that allows you to share pictures of the foods in your neighborhood.  So you might want to check out Zagat.  $10, a little pricey, but that covers a year's worth of reviews.  They call it Zagat to go.  And now with four-square and food spotting, and it is a great tool to have.  Oh, wait a minute.  The latest from Android Central, the Froyo update is not going to come out today on Incredible.  That was just a bad rumor.  So there's the details.  I'm still waiting for that DroidX.  I was told by the Verizon folks when I bought the DroidX that it would come out in August.  So I'm hoping.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  Kevin Marks is at Ribbit.  Ribbit.com, I guess a division of British Telecom, and a great guy to have on anytime  we talk about, well, pretty much anything, an expert in so much.  Ribbit.com, his blog is, Apeus.  Just search for Kevin Marks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a lot easier.  It's an easier spell than my blog name.  Although.  Seemed like a good idea in 2001.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was such a good idea.  Now no one knows what the hell it means.  E-P-E-U-S dot blogspot dot com.  But it really is actually a great, wait a minute, you haven't posted in a couple of  months.  What are you up to, Kevin?  I'm up on a holiday.  I should write something.  Get to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get to work.  I should write something about the web not being dead.  So not dead yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Be good.  Gina Trapani is at SmarterWear.org, a great site for anybody who's interested in, well,  everything.  I mean, she's great on productivity, education, government.  Great site.  Love it.  SmarterWear.org.  And of course, as a developer, a great resource on This Week in Google.  Thank you for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks.  Great show today.
