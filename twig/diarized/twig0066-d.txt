Hello, hello.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Good to be here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm at martyreware.org and fastcompany.com.  And it's good to have you as always.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Great to be here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  He's a professor of journalism, a journalist himself and an expert on new media.  His blog is Google Sleut.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The G baby, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For many years, I called my fans Leportians and we had the sign of the Leportian, which  is an L on your forehead until I found out.  You're lesbians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Losers.  And Glee fans now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Gleeks.  I'll say lesbian.  Glee.  So maybe I'm all three.  I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  L for Glee, that makes no sense.  Why is that?  Yeah, the L and Glee is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, because they're losers.  Because Glee, because anybody in the Glee club is losers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's right.  Oh, I see.  And Mitch Wagner is also here, formerly of Computer World and now a freelancer and he's  a G as well.  You can find him on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that the right salute?  We don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's hard to do the.  What is G in ASL?  Anybody know?  Oh, that would be useful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The ASL version would be useful.  So Mitch, welcome to the team.  I understand that you are on a San Diegan as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I am a San Diegoite in whatever we call ourselves, dude.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What was it they said on Anchorman?  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stay classy.  Stay classy San Diego.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I was about to not.  So, yeah, I do have a Google TV and I'm ashamed to say I did not look out for the purposes  of this show and I did not install it last night.  Partly because, though, I have to say I've been reading people's reviews and I've got  some trepidation.  I maybe want to keep it in the box so I can return it.  I bought the Logitech review.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's the essence of the problem with them in the reviews?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, one thing we knew it would be, which is complexity.  Danny Sullivan talks about it, Search Engine Watch, or is it Search Engine Land?  I can never remember what the new name of it is.  And he had a long post walking through the install, 45 minutes just to watch TV.  And I think that that's part, you know, we knew that that would be an issue.  This is Google TV is, you know, I guess it seems to me that the point of all of these  devices is to put internet content on your big screen, right?  In an easy way.  Google TV added the idea of being able to search for content anywhere, put a browser  on it.  But it's still the same idea, which is basically an ethernet jack for your TV.  The problem is that that means complexity as well.  You're essentially plugging a computer into your TV.  In some cases, like the Apple TV, it's very simple but not very powerful.  Roku is kind of in the middle there.  We're more powerful but a little more complex.  Not much more.  I think Roku is kind of the sweet spot.  Then there's media extenders like the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3.  The real problem that geek, what's called a geek TV, Google TV's got is that ABC, NBC  and CBS are now blocking their content.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know.  I mean, the whole point of having a browser on the box is that you could go to those networks,  right, that air the last five episodes of whatever show, Lost or whatever, and watch  them on your TV and now they're blocking it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now explain this to me.  This becomes then a whole new issue of net neutrality that I never had to see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it started with Hulu, right?  When you went on Google TV to Hulu Plus, it would say, I'm sorry, I'm using Google TV.  Even though you can use a browser on a computer, and I'm not sure exactly why this is different.  Right.  It's a browser.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So they're discriminating against a manufacturer's device.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and I think it was Mark Cuban who said, well, of course they're doing this because  you're trying to get network television programming with internet economics.  And you just can't, those two don't go together.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, welcome to the new world, folks.  Same thing with Cablevision cutting off, or Fox rather, trying to cut off Cablevision  customers in the fight that they're having now.  I was starting to write a post that it didn't do, but you almost wonder if Fox and Cablevision  never came to a deal.  Is it the end of the world?  They still haven't, by the way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They still have not.  Ten days, you still can't watch Fox 5 in New Jersey.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the Yankees didn't win, so it's less of an issue.  But what if they never reach a deal?  All right.  Would I, if I'm a Cablevision customer in Long Island and I'm happy with Cablevision  otherwise, would I cancel it because I can't get Fox?  I don't know.  If I'm a baseball fan, maybe.  If I'm a Glee fan, well, one way or the other, I can watch it online.  They failed at trying to block it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Glee is an interesting example because Glee makes itself available in every possible way.  You can buy it, as I do, on Amazon, 99 cents an episode.  You can rent it on Apple TV, as many do.  You can watch it on Hulu Plus for free.  Can you watch it on Fox's website as well?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know.  The odd thing is you can't watch it online on demand on Verizon Files.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  It's not on demand.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Fox doesn't have it there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And another interesting thing, and I'm not sure if this is true, but it strikes, I keep  trying to DVR it and I think there's a flag on it that says, do not DVR.  And last night I was watching it, DVRing it while I was watching it and I couldn't fast  forward through the commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Weird.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I think they're telling the Comcast cable box what to do.  This is so fucked up.  But this is what's confusing because on the one hand they're saying, let's put it online,  and then on the other hand they're saying, but don't tear tape, record it.  It's confusing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, then I wonder whether they're going to start blocking, go to the desktop, go to  the box.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hold on, Chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, Mitch.  I was just wondering when they're going to start going to the desktop to block.  Maybe they'll stop blocking Firefox tomorrow or start blocking Dell PCs tomorrow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well it's completely arbitrary.  Why not?  You're saying, well, you're going to watch a Logitech review, we're going to block it.  And by the way, for a while people have been able to change their user agent.  That doesn't work anymore.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What?  There's going to be an app for Google TV any minute now that changes the user agent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can change the user agent, but they're looking at something else now because they  still block.  You can say, I'm not Chrome on a Logitech review, I'm on a Google TV.  I'm Firefox on a Mac and it still blocks you.  It's seeing something else.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And by the way, these are shows that are shown on broadcast TV, which is free, different  economics, on airwaves that we give to these networks.  And you know, any business today that's built on how to screw your end user isn't going  to work.  At some point, somebody's going to make a great show for the internet and they're going  to go around all of this structure and make a fortune and not share it with a studio  and not share it with a network and not share it with a cable company.  And that's when the economics going to change.  And I think what's happening here is that we're going to see that, well, we don't need  these channels.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what Mark Cuban says?  That the networks are handing a win to Netflix.  That essentially the winner here, Netflix, which we mentioned last week, consumes 20%  of all prime time bandwidth in America for its streaming TV is the one that's got deals  with everybody, including Google TV, Roku, Apple, and they're going to win because everybody  else is blocked.  But that means you won't get to watch Glee till next year when it comes out on DVD.  Right.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So long as they keep underusing Sue Sylvester, then that's not really that good of a problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think she was underused this week.  She was evil.  Last week maybe.  I loved the Rocky Horror.  Oh, it was so good.  So you know what?  Immediately I do.  So we watch it, watch it kind of live.  And it's so funny because we're watching it live and we're going, what are these commercials?  How do you get out of these?  And then so we went, we rewound, this is 15 minutes into the beginning.  So my son could watch, because he's never seen Rocky Horror.  So I thought, oh, come here, come here.  So he's watching it.  And then we try to fast forward through the commercials and I can't.  And we go, what?  But then immediately after, what do I do?  I fire up the Roku and I put Rocky Horror Picture Show on so we can watch the real thing.  Yep.  This is a great use case for internet plus.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It absolutely is.  And then links to the other one.  One grows the other.  It's the network.  The other thing I saw last night, by the way, I don't know if it was on Glee or not.  I don't know what it was because I was noting that I was watching Glee on another network  was a killer commercial, a new version of one with what's her name?  Leah?  Who's the great singer?  Leah Michelle.  Yeah, thank you.  And doing Sound of Music intercut with the movie.  Oh.  So you see Julie Andrews and Leah doing a distributed duet.  What was that for?  Was that for next week?  For Dove, Dove, Dove Bodywash.  Yeah.  And it was really great.  And it's not online yet that I can find.  There's an original version of Leah singing from the Sound of Music, but not my favorite

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The hills are alive with the smell of Dove Bodywash.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's happened to Twig?  Glee is corrupting the entire culture.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff has wanted to do a media show with Emily.  Is it Emily Bell?  Emily Bell, yes.  For a long time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The force you're doing.  So you move the Glee talk off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's very relevant because what it's about is this move that this transition that we're  TV is a big part of this from a broadcast economy to an internet economy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Glee's did so well to promote the show online.  And Glee's the one show that I do watch live because I just love it.  I want to see it.  And Glee's the show that I would want to watch the Twitter stream, you know, the tag, people  saying as it goes.  That's my live sports event.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No?  Isn't that interesting?  So the internet is encouraging you to watch it live with commercials.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Didn't they say that was why so many people watched like the Grammys and the Emmys, these  big event TV was being helped by Twitter?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, because you can follow along live and have a conversation while you're watching.  Yeah, Mad Men is kind of similar, although Mad Men's commercials are actually good.  So I enjoy watching those.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See A&E is learning.  So what's really interesting here is there's some people who see this as the end of the  world and we've got a hold on for dear life and we've got to block those sons of bitches  at Google.  And some people say this is an opportunity.  Let's use Twitter.  Let's use the internet.  Let's make this.  Let's make it work.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, if you go to the economics, father, if, if, if who, I don't know who produces  Glee, it's probably Fox, but let's imagine that it's somebody else.  And if they own the show and if they can monetize it, if they can have an ad sales structure,  it's in their interest to go around the networks and the cable companies pretty soon.  Right now it's not because you don't get the mass.  You don't get the size.  It's really hard to do that.  But somebody's going to break that.  Someone is going to get a critical mass hit and they need less audience to make as much  money because if you're not sharing it with so many people and that's going to start to  break away the hegemony of, of cable and channels.  I think.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are there always going to be gatekeepers?  And isn't there, aren't we always going to see a tendency for media to get big?  Just look at the way bloggers have become more and more popular.  But okay, let's say, let's.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo's the case of that.  So Leo, how do you, how do you answer that?  Just from, from twit inc.  Are you the gatekeeper now?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but we build our, okay, here's what's different, Mitch.  It's it's a, I understand as, as now as a small businessman, once you write a business  plan, it's really hard to change your, your model.  You know, our business, I created a business plan that's based on selling advertisements  to 18 million eyeballs every week.  It's very hard to say, well, that's not going to work.  Now what do we do?  And a lot of companies can never make that transition.  Your business plan is your business plan and, and your business lives and dies by it.  Our business plan is completely internet modeled, right?  We make more money by eyeballs.  We want everybody to see it.  We don't want to block it.  In fact, we want it to be on every platform possible.  Maybe that's because we're, you know, alternative to, to mainstream media.  And so we have to compete that way.  But I think that that's how our plan is written.  Now I can imagine a time some years hence where it changes again.  And I'll be sitting here with an old business model that doesn't work anymore.  And I can see how you get hidebound and it's very difficult to change that.  But we're, I don't think we'll be gatekeepers in that sense.  This is all, I mean, our model is around community building and growing community, involving  community.  In fact, where I want to go is more interactivity, more chat rooms, more textual stuff, more,  you know, more of that kind of stuff.  And so I think in that respect, art, we're built around being open.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think in any established company though, you're going to have people, you're going  to have a company that's thriving on an existing business model and you're going to have people  whose careers depend on that business model succeeding.  So if somebody else comes in with a new business model, you know, they can't, they can never  get their foot in unless you have a company with a really dynamic leader like a Steve  Jobs or going back 50 years like blanked on the guy's name from CBS.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Edward Armorrow, no.  Sarnoff?  Yeah, David Sarnoff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the guy who said, you know, we got, we're in the broadcast business.  We're not in the radio business.  We have to pioneer television.  Yeah, he was brilliant.  He was brilliant.  But in most cases you have big companies government.  I'm sorry.  No, you can count the companies that have done that successfully on the fingers of one

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  hand.  Apple might have done it.  Microsoft tried and I think Microsoft has not.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Polaroid.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They succeeded in 95.  Polaroid tried, but yeah, they succeeded in their era, their business model worked.  Now Ray Ozzie leaving Microsoft is a perfect example of this.  It's an acknowledgement that we're not going to make the transition and we're going to  try but it's a pretty clear acknowledgement.  We're not going to make that transition into this new cloud based system.  They're a software company.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, you are the disruptor.  That's, I mean, that's right.  I finally realized we got a big grant to open up Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism as  I'm working the curriculum.  I realized that what I have to teach is disruption.  Yeah.  And so you're right, Mitch, that somebody comes along and their instinct is to protect  their model.  But the innovation in media is going to come from Leo's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  No question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now it is a good point somebody's making in the chat room that, you know, it's not  like radio killed newspapers and television killed radio.  I mean, these old, but I don't think we're talking about that.  I think it's a more significant change.  Well, newspapers have died.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're going to die.  You know, at some point CBS News will die.  Will all of it die?  No, it never does.  But that's really beside the point.  The point is where's the opportunity here?  Well, here's an example.  When you left a network, you didn't go to get a job at another network.  You started.  I made my own network.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Here's a good example is the record industry.  It's completely been disintermediated.  The way music is made and sold will not be the same in 10 years as it was 10 years ago.  I mean, that's just obvious.  And so I think that it's going to be something new is going to have to emerge even in.  Well, here's the question, though.  And this is getting back to Mark Cuban.  This stuff we do is cheap.  The twit does is cheap.  It has to be really, really, really cheap.  Valuable but cheap.  Right.  We couldn't do Glee.  We couldn't.  I mean, not the economics for Glee are very different.  And so that's what Mark's saying is saying you can't you there's a web there's a web  economic model and there's a broadcast economic model.  You can't support broadcast shows or can you with the web economic model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, then maybe you don't have broadcast shows.  Well, that's a question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are we going to say goodbye to blockbuster movies and and the odds of making the blockbuster

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  is much higher.  The risk is much, much higher.  That's why we have reality TV.  Now could you make, you know, pick your reality TV show on the web?  Sure.  Sure, you absolutely could.  In fact, the web would be better at reality TV.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And so, you know, all that we're waiting for is somebody to go do it and prove it.  And you're right, Leo.  It's not only the cost of the production is lower because it has to be, but also you're  sharing revenue with far fewer middlemen.  That's true.  That's the real key to the economics.  That's true.  Is that you have your own ad sales and you're sharing nothing with nobody.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the cost, the capital costs are lower now.  Exactly.  What isn't lower is personnel.  Staff costs are not lower.  They're higher.  They go higher all the time.  Right.  Right.  But you don't need.  What about something like the Guild?  The people in the chat room are saying.  What about the Guild?  The Guild is a fairly high production value.  It is.  I don't think they may.  I don't think Valesha makes any money on it though, do they?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, she has that distribution deal with Microsoft.  So I think she pays everyone.  It didn't start out that way.  She wasn't paying everyone initially, but I think she pays everyone now.  I don't think she's rich.  She's not rich.  She won't say that she's getting rich, but she's supporting herself and she's got the  comic book and all the other off-street stuff.  I also pay for HBO so I can watch things like The Wire and Treatment and shows like that.  I'd pay to watch Mad Men.  I'd pay to watch Glee.  I would too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you know what we're going to have to do?  It's going to have to be all on a card.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So there's different revenue streams there.  And I supposedly am always against paid TV, but you're right.  I would pay for those shows.  Well, I'm not Mad Men, but that's another story.  Myself...  You don't like Mad Men?  I've never gotten into it.  What's wrong with you?  Because you know, when I started watching it, I'm going to get in trouble now.  The chat room is going to...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We got to do this show with Emily.  I know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just said on Twitter that Twig is turning into This Week in Glee.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not a bad idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the same.  Actually, when I was going to start a video company, Leo, I started a show that was all  about this American Idol, American Idol the next day.  Great idea.  It was a great idea.  It worked well.  I just couldn't get the idea to come to you for ad sales.  Oh, Mad Men.  So the problem just seems so blunt and obvious to me.  So 60s cliched, but that's something I get in trouble.  So I'll stop there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mad Men is about feeling.  It's about gestalt.  It's about the look.  It's not about plot.  Is it, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I feel like I understand my parents a lot more watching Mad Men, just culturally.  Not the bad behavior going on in the characters.  I just feel like culturally, I have a deep understanding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff and I grew up in that era, but we're the age of the kids in that show.  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the show because it's so understated.  The climax of the show is some guy looks at another guy.  Oh my God.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You love that.  It's subtle.  It's too subtle for Jeff.  He wants knife fights.  No, no.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it was the opposite.  I think it was too blunt.  In the earliest shows when they had the racism, it was too blunt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know what you're saying.  When they mention the Beatles, it's almost as if they go, the Beatles are playing Shea  Stadium.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the first couple of episodes, it was like, I'm going to smoke an unfiltered cigarette  now.  Oh, look at me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm drinking the Fordoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've dialed that back a lot.  They have.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If we start talking Dancing with the Stars, I'm leaving.  I'm going to pull a whoopee.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, we're going to change the subject.  Wait, wait, wait.  You watch Dancing with the Stars?  I don't.  I only watched it when Woz was on.  Oh, that's perfect.  Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't.  I mean, you know, if it's on, I might glance at it, but I don't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mitch, are you the only one here?  Mitch watches it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I do not.  Okay.  All right, we're safe now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But, you know, most reality television I find kind of offensive, but it's kind of funny  because if I think about it, I've been pitching reality TV to people, to networks since 1992.  Oh.  So it's your fault.  No, I just knew that TV was going to have to be cheap.  And unscripted TV.  And you know what's interesting is I think Americans are getting a taste for unscripted  in general, even in our movies.  This movies of Judd Apatow and Will Ferrell, which are much of them are ad lib now, have  generated I think a taste for the spontaneous and the unexpected.  And when I see scripted comedies now, I feel like it's kind of flat.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, although I really enjoy making fun of people mauling the English language and cliches  in reality TV.  It's just if you miss it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you watch it to mock Snooki or whatever.  Yeah, sometimes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Even just regular folks.  Just, you know, and we do.  I do it on the show, too.  I'm not blaming.  But there are times that I really miss the writers during reality.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  I will stay on this for a second because one of the items on the list is that Google is  giving away 10,000 Google TVs to developers, which is the way that Google thinks, right?  Yeah, that's wrong.  If you're going to make Google TV work, it's apps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's about content.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But yeah, they should be giving away something to 10,000 producers of content.  They should be giving away millions to a star.  They should foster.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They should foster online production.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  And when they do that, then they can fend their nose at the networks that are now blocking  them.  I've always thought that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, arguably, that's what that's what YouTube does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So if you got a Leo, if you got a million dollars investment from Google to make the  TV that's going to make Google TV work, what would it be?  I would give me a number and a Twitter length elevator pitch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would I would absolutely do reality.  I would do something.  I would probably do.  What would I do with a million dollars?  We've built everything around being like a buck an hour.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you now just said you can't make some stuff.  You can't make some stuff.  Well, I wouldn't do Glee.  I wouldn't do Glee.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that I mean, you could spend a million dollars isn't enough.  I'm sure Glee is more than a million bucks an episode easily.  Oh, yeah.  I know most big budget, I'm an admin and most big budget dramatic shows are more than a  million dollars.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What would you do with comedy?  Something that's funny.  And by the way, I do the guild.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think the guild is the guild.  You want to do Dr. Harbel sing along blog, which is one early attempt at bypassing the  networks completely.  I mean, Josh's shows just keep getting canceled.  So he does Dr. Harbel, which is a huge success on the Internet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was a success both Internet and mainstream.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what would you do to make that work as a business?  What would you do to get that to critical?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what I would do is I would bring I would bring in a bunch of very interesting  creative types in this building.  I would wire this entire building for sound and video.  And I would broadcast a stream with nine or 10 individual streams that the viewer could  it's almost deconstructing television that the viewer it's in fact, it is deconstructing  television.  It's going completely backwards.  The viewer could switch from any feed they want and see where the heat is.  Yeah.  See what's going on.  Content involved because all the people would be in the building working on content of some  kind, maybe maybe music, maybe, you know, not necessarily tech news, the kind of stuff  we do.  But I think that the voyeur it would satisfy the voyeuristic impulse was what obviously  powers reality TV.  But I think people want content.  This is why I think reality TV is kind of ultimately hollow is that people still want  to learn something or or or come away with something.  And reality TV is just, you know, it's very surface.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So well, Gina is absolutely right.  It's it's the original appeal of game shows, which you could make fun of your fellow man  hidden.  Right.  I can't believe they didn't answer.  No, that that was right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's why Murph Griffin designed Wheel of Fortune intentionally so that the game  design was done in such a way so that you knew the puzzle before it was announced even  and because the contestants knew it.  But you don't realize that they know it because they're trying to make it.  Prolong it to make more money.  So then if they've solved the puzzle, but they keep playing, you're sitting there going,  I'm smarter than them because I've solved it already.  It was this brilliant insight that he had into our low, low behavior.  We live in public. That's right.  You know, this is what Josh.  What's his name? Did Harris did?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Josh Harris. I interviewed him for the book.  He did that 10 years ago.  Yeah. Yeah. It's fascinating because it kind of devolved.  But he argues that we are having kind of a shift in our DNA into truly living in public  and changing the way we operate as a society.  I agree. Well, you say that, don't you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Your book, Public Parts, I'm sure is very much about that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What Gutenberg did to the world now you're going to do.  You're the new Gutenberg, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Boy, I would love it if we're actually that important.  I somehow don't think it is.  And on that note, let's take a break for a commercial.  We're going to come back.  There's actually a lot more Google news.  Eric Schmidt getting creepier by the moment.  We've got a montage of Eric's creepy moments I'm going to play for you.  And a lot more still to come.  Gina Tripani is here, Jeff Jarvis, and a newbie joining us is wondering what the hell he's doing here right now.  Mitch Wagner, thank you for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm afraid. Oh, be afraid. It's crazy. It's insane.  So creepy in there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, really. He's so creepy.  I do want to talk about our friends at Citrix who do a great product called Go To Meeting.  If you do business travel, you don't have to.  If you are spending a lot of time on conference calls, you can make them better with a simple little program,  very inexpensive, called Go To Meeting.  In fact, you can try it free for 30 days.  So you don't have to believe me when I tell you this is going to transform your business.  It has ours. We use it all the time.  Go to meeting.com slash twig.  You can sign up for 30 days.  It's great for, well, you know, the obvious, the presentations, sales presentations.  You've got your PowerPoint. You've got a client on the other end.  And by the way, you know, people make clients jump through hoops to see their sales presentations.  I never understood that. Go to Meeting is so easy.  You send them an invitation. Go to Meeting integrates with Outlook.  So you just send an invitation. It's got a link in it.  Three o'clock. I got a meeting with Leo. They click the link.  The software installs in 30 seconds. They don't even, it's very transparent to them.  And suddenly you say, hey, how you doing?  Here's our PowerPoint presentation. This is what we could do for you.  It's very easy for them and it's actually kind of fun for them and engaging.  It's also great for product reviews, demos.  I've used it to rehearse speeches with other people.  You know, we're going to do a two person speech at a conference.  We rehearse over Go to Meeting.  That's great for training.  I just fast, easy to use, 128 bit SSL, completely secure and free for 30 days right now.  By the way, they include in the price, which I think is $49 a month.  It's so reasonable. We have three or four accounts because we often have multiple meetings going on.  It includes phone and voice over IP teleconferencing for free in that.  Go to meeting.com slash TWIG. Try it today.  It really will transform the way you do business.  All right. Let me see if I can find.  Why is there white? Why?  What was the thing Eric Schmidt just said yesterday?  He said, if you don't want us to be watching you move,  he said you don't want your home to be in the middle of the speech.  I don't want to be the defender of Eric Schmidt.  Well, it's creepy, but shut him up.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Why would he do that?  I think he didn't mean move houses.  He meant if you see this ridiculous car coming your way with this big hunk and huge thing on top, turn around.  I think that's what he meant.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He said it comes once.  That's what he meant, that it takes one photo in a moment in time and you just can leave, right?  But it sounded so weird.  Like, why does he come out with this stuff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When I interviewed him for the book, he called it death by Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, because it's the short sound bites.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One line and then it gets spread all over.  The line, you know, he's now confirmed that when he said we should all change our names at age 21, he was joking.  I've sat in audiences, people laughed.  He got over interpreted.  Yeah, I was joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody needs to start a Twitter account.  That's what Bleep Eric Schmidt says.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good idea.  OK, so Gawker, so should I start at the beginning of this?  Yeah, I'll start at the beginning of this.  Gawker put together a compilation of clips of Eric Schmidt's greatest moments.  Just watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google can do street views.  You can see where I live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Street view, we drive exactly once.  So you can just move, right?  If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.  Just remember when you post something that the computers remember forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know where you are.  We know where you've been.  We can more or less know what you're thinking about.  I'm sorry.  I hate to say this, but that really creeps me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You famously said that someday young people, instead of having privacy,  that one day they'll just erase their histories and change their names.  It was a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just wasn't very good.  So you can just move, right?  I can move?  Yes, or alternatively.  That's a lot of trouble.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh dear, Eric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can do street views.  You can see where I live.  So does he know?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I sat with him across the table and he tries to joke.  He just says that it's misinterpreted or he kind of comes out of his mouth and he knows it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How long before the board starts saying, Eric, you can't go in public anymore?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who's going to go in public then?  Larry and Sergey?  They're going to be worse.  Are they?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  But at least with Larry and Sergey, they don't look like businessmen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They look like nerds.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so people just say, oh, they're going to be more scary to people then.  They're going to think, oh my God, these geeks are really taking over the world.  We're going to hear big brother crap, all that stuff.  No, I think that as somebody said to me yesterday,  Eric has at least taken the heat for the geek philosophy of Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  John Patschkowski has coined a new term.  Schmitztorm.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Schmit my CEO says,  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We got a title.  I think that was from TNT.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So Tech News Today.  That's from Tech News Today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank you, Tom Merritt.  Schmit my CEO says,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I mean, I think that you're right, Jeff,  that he did mean that you can just step out of the way of the Google Street View car if you see it.  But the interviewer said, you know where I live.  And then he said, well, but you could just move.  So, I mean, it kind of makes sense that people kind of misinterpreted it.  And the apology that Google issued was,  we didn't mean that you could just move houses.  If you want your home taken off Street View, just let us know and we'll do so.  So, I mean, that's sort of an admission that the misunderstanding was understandable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that your number?  Jeff, don't give away your number.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I didn't.  Well, I could have been.  But 244,000 people have asked Google to pixelate their homes.  Or as they say in Germany, they exercise their pixel unsrekt.  Pixel unsrekt?  That sounds scary.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, anything in German sounds like that.  Or like the kind of sauce in Jordan.  Do we have pixel unsrekt here in the United States?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hey, what we do here is we get out in front of the camera and want to do things on it to be on camera.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We want to be on Street View.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, isn't over in Italy, doesn't Google need to publish the route of the Street View car beforehand?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The funny thing, Gina, was they also, Italy decreed that they had to clearly label the car like it can hide.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I want to see all the nutty Italians are going to come out like dressed up in costume and doing all kinds of crazy stuff.  You'll think it's a continuous party over there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's completely appropriate and probably exactly what Google should do everywhere.  Our Street View car is coming to your town.  Watch for it and wave.  Or hide or move.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Like opt in or opt out.  Get notification.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, really, Eric, if Eric's saying move, you better give us some advance warning because, I mean, the car will sneak up on you.  Yep.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just got this, sorry, but Twitter.  Somebody just sent us, just started a brand new account.  Schmidt Eric says.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, we want to see stuff on there.  Now, ironically, while Eric is saying all this creepy stuff, people like the Federal Trade Commission announced today that it's going to cease.  Just now.  It's going to cease its inquiry into Google's collection of data on open Wi-Fi access points.  Google said on its website that it was creating a stronger privacy control.  Alan Eustace, Senior Vice President for Engineering and Research, wrote an apology.  In a letter issued on Monday, the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection cited the steps the company had taken in response to concerns that it collected payload data.  And the FTC says we don't think they did anything wrong.  We don't think there's a problem.  We're dropping the investigation.  So that's Britain did the same thing a few months ago.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's good news.  Others in Germany and Canada are still screaming.  Well, actually, Canada dropped.  Well, they've got Facebook.  But Germany and France and places are still screaming bloody murder.  You know, Google screwed up.  They hurt themselves terribly.  They hurt their defenders like me.  Yeah.  And I'm pissed.  But there was no business value to what they stupidly gathered.  None.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, they admitted that some of the payload data, there were some email URLs and passwords.  That was kind of at the end of their apology post.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  Let me look at that.  I didn't see that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it was in there.  They said, you know, we actually never went through the data, but other regulatory agencies did.  And they found that we had picked up passwords and usernames and passwords for email and that kind of thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you would if they're being sent in the clear.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, we think they're being sent in the clear and we should talk about Fire Sheep, actually.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you watch the Fire Sheep show we just did with Security Now?  Very interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You did a whole show.  OK, that's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to watch the show because I'm sure that was really good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is a Firefox plugin, not an approved Firefox plugin, but anybody can install it on Windows or Mac on their Firefox.  Then you go to a coffee shop or anywhere with an open access point.  It opens a sidebar.  It lists all the people by name and with a picture who are on this open access point and what accounts they have open right now.  Facebook, Twitter, Flickr.  And you can click on those accounts and due to the way that password authentication works, I mean, in a thumbnail, if you really want to know the technical details, you should probably listen to the show.  But in a thumbnail, when you log into Facebook, Facebook returns you a token, a cookie, which is then stored on your system.  That's why you don't have to log into Facebook every page.  It says, oh, no, we know we're in a session with you.  And so this cookie is retrieved at each page on Facebook.  And they say, yeah, yeah, it's him.  Well, this cookie is passed in the clear.  So this program, Fire Sheep, not only sees you but catches the cookie and then says, I'm him.  Let's continue that session that I opened with my password a minute ago so they can see your Twitter, they can Twitter for you.  They can read your Facebook stuff, post stuff there, change stuff there.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is an exploit that web developers have kind of known about for a long time.  This is the reason why Gmail went to complete HTTPS.  So even the cookie information is sent over SSL.  And Fire Sheep just illuminates the problem that's been kind of around for a long time.  And I saw somebody say, hey, if you can do this easily on an open Wi-Fi spot,  Google could have collected this cookie, this session data, these cookies in their Street View cars as well.  Sure.  Hi there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what's the solution, guys?  Is it HTTPS?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's one solution.  The other solution that, and anybody who's listening who has an open access spot,  maybe you're in a coffee shop or a bar or a restaurant or here at the Twit Cottage,  the solution is very simple.  Turn on WPA, which is the encryption that we recommend for closed access spots.  In other words, make it a closed access spot.  But you can give everybody the password.  You know, Steve said Starbucks should just put WPA on all its open access points  and post right above the barista, the password is Starbucks.  And by virtue of turning on WPA, you make each session.  Encrypted.  And encrypted.  Even though you're on the same network with the bad guy, he can't see those cookies anymore.  It's a simple fix, but you know what?  It's not going to happen.  And now over a quarter of a million people have downloaded in the last two days,  have downloaded Fire Sheep.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So pretty much...  The major players have to change the way that they have to change...  Everybody has to turn it on.  ...except cookie information, right, over HTTPS, the way that Gmail does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is that the browser, Gina, or is that the...  No, the service has to do it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So Facebook has to say, we're going to transmit cookie information over HTTPS,  Flickr, Twitter, all the major players.  See, this is good.  I mean, it's bad, but it's good.  Because of the fact that this extension got so popular,  I think the big players are going to listen and change.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Steve was jumping up and down.  I said, Steve, you're supposed to be protecting our security.  What the hell?  He said, no, but this is good because now everybody can do it,  so you've really got to fix it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is there a cost to...  Is there a transactional cost here in terms of bandwidth or anything?  No, insignificant.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's insignificant, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Modern HTTPS does not bog anything down.  In fact, and we've been talking about this on security now for a long time,  you could really have all sites be HTTPS.  They probably should be,  but certainly anywhere where there's a login and some privacy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Amazon too, they're catching stuff?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, because it's HTTPS.  It is for every page?  Yeah, I believe so.  Am I right, Gene?  I don't know.  I believe so.  Sure, I'm checking right now.  He lists...  If you go to GitHub, this guy's on Code Butler,  github.com slash codebutler.  He announces at a security event, I think in your neck of the woods.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Torcon, wasn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're right.  As soon as I go to my account on Amazon...  It stays secure, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Everybody could do that.  There's no reason why not.  I mean, everybody should do that, really.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And there was a time when HTTPS cost a little more  and the configurations may be a little more expensive.  There's a very high need...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have to buy a certificate.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to get a certificate.  There's authentication that goes on.  So it's a little more of a pain in the ass for big players to do.  A little bit more.  These days, though, it's not that...  And it should be the standard.  And Google did it with Gmail and a few other things.  You can even encrypt your searches as well.  That's right.  That's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They don't mention that they can do this to Google  anywhere in the blog post, Eric's blog post.  It's fascinating.  Moving along.  There's quite a lot of other things to talk about.  It looks like Hulu Plus is going to go half price, $4.95.  Maybe that's a response to...  I don't know what.  Why do you block Google TV but then only...  I mean, I can only watch it on my iPad and my computer.  I'm paying you five bucks.  I'm getting commercials and I still can't watch it on my big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think what's going on here is they just see an opportunity  to hit up Google for a toll.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, they want Google to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like those Belgian publishers a while ago  that blocked Google News.  Right, Mitch.  Yeah.  They want the traffic from Google,  but they want Google to pay for it too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  As Woody Allen would say, they want the eggs.  Yeah.  A joke we've used on this show before.  It's a classic.  Right.  So part of this is that a major owner of Hulu is News Corp.  And News Corp makes Google the enemy whenever possible.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Interesting.  Let's talk about Search.  Google set an Internet traffic record this week.  Their biggest...  According to...  Now, this is from Arbor Networks, which monitors traffic.  Their biggest Internet traffic of all time.  Google now represents an average 6.4% of all Internet traffic worldwide.  The number grows even larger, as much as 8 to 12%,  if you include estimates of traffic offloaded by Google global cache deployments.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I wonder what percentage of that is YouTube.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's an interesting question.  Yeah.  Good point.  When you see that Netflix is using 20% of peak Internet access,  you've got to figure YouTube's got to be a big chunk in there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Got to be a big chunk of that, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Arbor says, while it's not news that Google is big,  what is amazing is how much bigger Google continues to get.  A quick analysis of the data also shows that Google now has direct peering  with more than 70% of all providers around the world.  That's 5 to 10% up from last year.  And he says, in fact, the only remaining major group of Internet service providers  without direct Google peering are the big tier ones and national telecom companies.  People like, I guess, Level 3 and NT DoCoMo, people like that.  Peering means that you have a direct connect.  Comcast, for instance, is your ISP.  When you go to Google on Comcast, it doesn't go over the Internet backbones.  There's a wire that comes out of the Google office and goes into the Comcast office.  It's direct connect.  And that saves everybody money and saves the backbone traffic.  But that's a lot of traffic.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I imagine that when they launch something like Google Instant,  which pushes down 20 sets of search results in one search,  I'm surprised I don't see a big spike on this chart here right around when...  Yeah.  ...Google Instant launched, which was like, what, September?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's interesting.  So it went up September 2009.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's pretty light.  I mean, it's light data.  It's taxed.  Yeah, I mean, it's taxed, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As compared to...  You can see, I mean, the biggest peak is right around September.  I mean, I think that there is something to be said for that.  He says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a little trough there, I wonder.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. It went down a little bit in June and January.  That was the Eric Schmidt trough.  That's what people said.  Oh, my God.  That's the creepy line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the creepy line.  That's when he was out there peering in people's windows.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, he fell below the creepy line.  It looks like that's January of...  Yeah, you know, it really is right about when...  ...when Google...  ...when Eric said all that stuff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The irony, by the way, of him using the word creepy,  is that when I talked to him, he was really pissed about the Times Square R2.  Oh, interesting.  Which portrays him as...  As creepy.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If Google were an Internet Service Provider,  according to... This is Craig Labowitz writing at Arbor Networks.  If Google were an Internet Service Provider,  it would rank as the second largest carrier on the planet.  The only global Tier 1 provider that carries more traffic than Google...  Only one global Tier 1 provider carries more traffic than Google.  And he doesn't say who it is. I'm curious.  That's how big Google is.  It's pretty impressive.  Amazing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So, how does this fit in their gigabit network?  Well, you can see why they want everybody to have more bandwidth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And, of course, the peering arrangements  get the Internet Service Providers off their back, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's also because when At Home started, may it rest in peace,  long ago, their original deal was that they were going to peer  and then charge you for the privilege of peering.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah. I sat in meetings with them,  so they were going to say to NBC,  this is net neutrality.  If you want your content to go at high speed to your users,  you may peer and you're going to pay us for it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This was the original cable modems from At Home.  It was from Comcast, right? At Home.  No, At Home was the same company.  It was a company that Comcast used for its...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, At Home was supposed to be this kind of...  I can't even remember what you'd call it now.  It wasn't a portal, but it was going to be this...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Will Hurst started it, I remember.  And actually, I remember he was quite bitter  because eventually it was the cable companies that put him out of business.  Yes.  They wanted this for themselves.  They weren't going to use At Home.  They went through a huge amount of money. Yeah.  Google has announced that it's going to support microformats in place searching,  and they've added a new place search.  This kind of goes along with Marissa Meyer being sent to mobile and local.  This is clearly the most important part of Google's business.  So supporting microformats is interesting because it's basically encouraging  anybody who writes about a location, including bloggers,  to use an H card for that location, which Google can see and scrape  and add to its database.  So you have all this rich information about a place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is brilliant.  I agree with John Battelle, what he wrote a couple of weeks ago  that local is the next big thing after there was search  and then there was social, which Google kind of took a beating on,  and now they're local, which Google is really already in the lead on.  I mean, I've seen some analysis that say the opposite,  that look at something like Foursquare and Facebook Places  and say that Google is behind, but in fact, the only thing I can assume  is these people who say that aren't aware of Google's activity in local  the way you're not aware of the air you breathe.  Right.  Everybody just goes onto Google every day to look up stores or whatever.  So Google's really in great shape here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Mitch, the other thing is the revenue they have is that local advertisers  are going to Google, not to newspapers, not to the yellow pages,  may they rest in peace, but to Google and finding that it works.  People searching for pizza will find pizza through a Google ad.  That's wildly powerful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm trying to understand place search.  This is from the official Google blog.  I love to discover new places from sandwich shops.  Sounds like Dr. Seuss.  From sandwich shops in my neighborhood to great museums around the globe.  So when I start looking for something new in an area,  like a barbecue restaurant in Austin, I usually do quite a few searches.  It gets a list.  So today we're introducing place search, a new kind of local search.  So it's a different result page. Is that what I'm getting?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The differences are not that big.  Yeah, the result page is just a little different, right?  So it shows a map on the right side, right on the results page,  and there's a places item in the left sidebar.  It's not that different.  I think Mitch's point about the fact that Google just is so good at local,  but we don't even notice it.  They already do it.  That's how good it is. They already do it.  It's, I think, an excellent one.  It's like when you search for a barbecue in Austin,  you just kind of expect that Google is going to give you good results.  A map and dots.  You expect to see a Google map,  and you expect to be able to get directions and see reviews and stars.  And yeah, these place results look very good.  This is what it used to look like.  It's not that different.  It's not that different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I couldn't see a difference. I don't even know if it rolled out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see. They moved this over to the left.  So that's what it used to look like. This is the new one.  That's a very Marissa change, isn't it?  It is very Marissa change.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know what? That's Marissa, isn't it?  Very incremental.  Don't mess it up. Test it out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Still got the map. Still got the ads.  But now it's clearly when you get these results,  these are much more place results because they have the little red marker,  and that corresponds to the map.  Yeah, it's useful.  And it's also kind of a response to Bing, isn't it?  I mean, isn't this the kind of thing that Bing does?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A little bit, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I wonder too what habits we get into when we use mobile  or we're on the mobile device, right?  And we speak to it and say,  pizza, Morristown, what are we,  they're going for how we're going to use it there,  and that will affect the web in return, I think.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're talking about Google, the cloud, the cloud-iverse,  and whatever that is.  Mitch Wagner is here, formerly from Computer World,  now on his own, twitter.com slash Mitch Wagner,  if you'd like to follow him, he's a freelancer.  Gina Trapani, actually we're all freelancers.  I'm the only guy with a real job.  You're the boss, so that doesn't count.  Actually, Jeff has a job, he's a professor.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have a government job, I have tenure.  Oh, are you tenured? Are you tenured?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow, they can't fire you.  I'm the public trough.  What do you have to do to get fired?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rape a student?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I don't think so. I think you're pretty safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it, a live boy or a dead girl?  I ain't going there, Mitch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, let's move right along to our ad.  They're so glad they're here.  Squarespace.com, my friends.  We talk about blogging and we talk about the web.  I'd like to give you a suggestion,  if you want to have your own website  that fills all the SEO niches,  it's got the Google site map and all of that,  but a whole lot more.  It's called Squarespace.com.  It is both hosting and software,  the best darn website software you've ever seen.  It's so easy to create a site.  In fact, I'm going to go right now to InsideTwit.tv,  which is our Squarespace site.  It's our in-house blog.  We decided to use Squarespace  because it makes it so easy for all of us to post.  And here's Gina right there on the front page,  the Facebook condom from last week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's Paul Throtts stabbing me in the head with scissors.  You see?  Here's, oh man, who's posting?  Eileen, are you posting all this stuff?  This is great.  We've got our tweets there.  You see how it ties into Twitter very easily.  It's got Flickr.  It's got great social integration.  Beautiful templates.  And the thing, let me go to Squarespace.com.  The thing about Squarespace is you can try it absolutely free  for two weeks.  You don't need a credit card.  You just click the try it free button at Squarespace.com.  Create a site name, a password, an email address.  So if you forget the password, you can get it again.  And the capture there so the robots can't do this.  And you've got a site for two weeks free.  And the first thing you should do is import the data from your old site.  It does almost all the major blog and website platforms just seamlessly.  So you get your content, even your comments over there, your images.  Then play with the templates.  You know, the templates are stunning.  You start with 60 plus professionally designed styles  from big name designers.  And then you're completely customizable.  And you don't have to know anything, you know, any special coding or anything.  You just drag and drop this click point and all of that.  Now, if you do know CSS and JavaScript, of course, it completely supports that as well.  So you could do anything you want.  Very powerful.  And that's one of the reasons if you go to the Squarespace example, Squarespace.com,  and look at the example sites, you'll see each one of them looks different.  Here's a core sellers.  This is a winery.  Oh, man, that looks that's beautiful.  Here is Jody Arnold.  They're selling, I guess it looks like jewelry.  They've got their own podcasts here.  Every Squarespace site looks different.  But I can tell you one thing that they all have in common.  They never run out of bandwidth.  They're always reliable.  And you never have security issues because Squarespace keeps that software up to date.  Start at $12 a month, but you're going to get 10% off for the life of your site.  If you use the Squarespace promo code TWIG, T-W-I-G when you sign up, try it free for two weeks.  Then if you decide to sign up, remember to use the promo code TWIG.  You'll get two months.  I'm sorry.  You'll get to 10% off for the life of your site.  Squarespace.com.  It's where exceptional websites begin.  And take a look at our Squarespace site, inside.twit.tv for an idea of what you can do with Squarespace.  Let's see. Continuing on.  We mentioned Microphone.  Oh, did you see that?  This is an Android story, I guess.  And I almost don't even believe this.  But did you see Engadget says that this awful looking PlayStation phone is real?  Did you see that, guys?  It is obviously Android, not customized.  It's a Sony Ericsson.  And Gadget's been talking about this since August.  Is it April 1st?  I thought so.  You know what?  It's funny.  I had the same reaction, but it's Josh Topolsky who is very credible.  And he wrote this yesterday.  But he says this is absolutely factual.  It's probably going to run gingerbread.  Android 3.0.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Get this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A custom Sony marketplace.  What?  Yeah.  Maybe just for games.  This is weird.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That screenshot looks kind of weird.  I mean, I trust Josh too, but even text is kind of overlapping.  I don't know.  It looks kind of suspicious.  And his battery is dying too.  His battery is dying and that no-SIM card is kind of overlaid on emergency calls only.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, he says it's a Qualcomm gigahertz chip like the one in the G2.  It's 512 megs of RAM, a gig of ROM.  Screen is 3.7 to 4.1 inches.  You know, if you think about it though, if Sony were going to make a...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's no excuse for it.  They just basically glued GamePad onto an Android phone.  There have been rumors that Apple will buy Sony.  That would be the first thing they would kill if they did.  I can tell you that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that's pretty absurd, but with Disney?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now, Disney is interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We talked actually yesterday about the idea on the MacBreak Weekly of Apple.  You know, they got $51 billion cash burning a hole in their pocket.  They implied on their earnings call last week that they were keeping their powder dry for something.  They did say there were some good acquisitions out there.  And then we talked about, and I'd be curious what you guys think,  we talked about the idea of acquiring a content player.  Now, Sony is a content company.  Sony is a content company.  I mean, one of the big music companies, big movie company.  Movies, TV.  So Sony, if you maybe divested the consumer electronics,  because Apple definitely doesn't want that crap,  but you kept the content, maybe that's why you'd buy a Sony.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, and they turn around all the time.  They've got a retail chain, they've got other things.  But here's the risk.  I want to ask you.  Mitch and Gina, well, especially Gina here,  have you ever actually seen a Walkman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course.  I bought a cassette Walkman in 19...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's dead now.  Yes, I bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, I'm flattered that you include me among the people who are too young.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I thought twice about it, but okay, you can stay in there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I bought one for $400 when they first came out.  I bought it at Macy's and charged it, of course,  like I did my first Mac as well, because I couldn't afford either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, there was a story floating around on the internet a couple of days ago,  so it must be true,  that Steve Jobs and Wozniak were actually just totally inspired by the Walkman.  I believe that.  When it first came out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I believe Jobs more than Woz.  I'll ask Woz next time, because we talked to him from time to time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was really inspired by the Discman,  because you could skip to the next song,  instead of having to hit the fast forward button.  Yeah, that was a pain in the butt.  And stop. That was always a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought eight tracks were superior to cassette tapes,  so no one should take me seriously on that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  For you, were you a Betamax guy, Mitch?  No, I never was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the time I got into video cassettes, I was already up to the VCRs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's what Sony's response was.  This is from Slash Gear.  They were asked by a website called NowGamer for official comment.  Initially, Sony said the leak was definitely fake.  Then they called back, and they said, can you take that quote down?  And our response is, we do not comment on rumor and speculation.  That's a non-confirmation confirmation in my book.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a lawyer, too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But they don't want to deny it.  I would deny it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whoever did that is just laughing at the head games now.  Check out what we did.  We're messing with you now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're messing with you.  So, but, you know, I was kind of surprised, Gingerbread,  but apparently Gingerbread is finished.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They're just pumping out Android versions.  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So when are we going to see it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's a video.  This is from the Android Developers YouTube page.  Is this the Google campus?  I think it is.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's a big truck pulling up.  Now, you got to know that on the Google campus, they have these statues.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What is that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What could be in there?  Oh, they're gathering around the truck.  They're pulling something out of the truck.  Oh, it's a Gingerbread man.  They have these statues for each version of Android.  They've got a Froyo.  Jake and I took pictures of ourselves with them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And a Claire.  Nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this is, this is, they've got a Gingerbread statue,  and they're adding it to the garden.  The garden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The giant Gingerbread man makes me afraid.  I'm going to be having nightmares about this for weeks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's scarier than Eric Schmidt.  Just to the line of creepy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It doesn't cross it.  Help me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Mr. Ball.  It's like, like candy buttons.  Ball, what is that?  They stuck a stand on me.  I have to hang out here for the rest of my life.  Where's Eric?  Hey, Eric.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's so frustrating that there's that video and nothing else.  Like we don't have a release date.  You know, there's rumors, speculation, but there's just the video.  It's like, OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now there's speculation about a Android, I mean, a Nexus 2 in Europe.  Nexus 2, yes.  Nexus 1, who knows?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Android Marketplace.  I don't know if this is your number, Jeff.  Stop me.  I give up on my number.  I did your number.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's all right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll find another one.  Damn, I suck.  Android Marketplace.  100,000 apps.  They're really ramping up fast.  It looks to me like they're growing faster now than the Apple Marketplace.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Good growth, right?  But still not as easy for developers as it could be.  The Times did an article, which the headline was that the Android market is attracting more developers.  But the content of the article was saying that things could be a little easier for developers and for users.  We're getting there.  We're getting there.  Is it true there's no Netflix app for Android yet?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, that's a good point.  Oh, man.  There's for the iPhone and iPad and there, of course, the desktop.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a killer.  Does that have something to do with Google TV or?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's just, you know, I just think it's a developer.  It just takes time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it just takes time.  It just takes time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  At this point, everybody who wants to be on a portable platform is looking at writing an Android version, I have to think.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  According to the Times, this is a gathering of Android programmers in downtown Manhattan.  According to the Times, one software developer, James Engelert, had just released his first app for Android.  This could be your number.  When asked, he tossed out an estimate of his take from sales of the app.  A simple program that shows train schedules.  He says, I'm making a buck or two a day.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not very motivating.  Not very motivating.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why do you think that is?  In fact, far more apps are free on Android than they are on the iPhone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot more developers opting for ads, right?  AdMob ads versus having them pay for.  I think parts of it are cultural.  Parts of it is that it's just hard.  It's harder to buy an app.  The Google checkout experience isn't as simple, easy as it could be, but it's getting better.  But part of it definitely is cultural.  Google is a service that runs on ads.  It's an open source culture, so its sense of things should be free.  But I don't agree with that, though.  I mean, if you write a great Android app, I'll pay for it.  People are used to buying apps on their phone.  And I think developers should maybe be a little more aggressive about pricing their apps.  But Google has to make it easier to buy those apps as an impulse buy.  It should be just a really easy single tap.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When people say, why do you like Android better than iPhone, one of the things I...  They always are bad-mouthing the Android marketplace, but there's one thing you can do on Android you cannot do on the iPhone,  and that is return an item.  There's no way to test an app on the iOS platform.  You bought it. It's yours. You can hate it. It doesn't matter.  But you have 24 hours to delete any app and get your money back on Android.  I think that's huge.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other difference in Apple's benefit is that they do more foreign currencies, I believe, by a long shot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, and that's been a problem, hasn't it?  A lot of international developers say, we can't sell.  Now Google at least now translates the euros into dollars.  That's helpful.  And vice versa.  I figure, how much could 15 euro be?  Or whatever.  I don't know how much it is, but how much could it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not going to end well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's a thousand euro here or there?  I always like actually paying in euros because it seems like everything's less expensive.  New Android device, it's the Nook in color.  Barnes and Noble, its successor to the original Nook.  Of course, they're in a dogfight with Amazon over the Kindle, this e-book reader.  Their Nook is a 7-inch Android 2.1 powered tablet available for preorder at bn.com for 250 bucks.  It's expected to ship November 19th.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then they hamper it.  It's not really Android.  Yeah, there's no Android market.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's no market.  There's no market, so you can't run other apps.  They do have Wi-Fi, no 3G support.  That is too bad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So for instance, I couldn't also put Kindle on it.  Right.  You know what?  That might actually make it valuable.  If I could get the best of both worlds and get a little tablet for a cheap price, that'd be fine.  Wi-Fi, I'd do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google, you were saying Google is giving 10,000 Google TVs to developers.  Wrong direction.  But they are doing, actually I'm not going to say what they're doing for journalists, Jeff.  It's a number.  I wouldn't do that.  No, I'm just saying.  I'll mention it if you're done.  I'll mention it later.  You guys want to talk about WikiLeaks because the stories are now out.  The 400,000 new secret Iraq docs.  And it does seem as if a lot of people are saying, well, we already knew most of this stuff, yes?  Meanwhile, Julius Assange is acting like he's America's most wanted, which he might be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, but you know, I'm waiting for Sorkin to do the Assange movie.  Wouldn't that be a great movie?  It actually would be interesting.  But people who start audacious things are generally assets.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Isn't that the kind of message?  It does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It takes a certain type of person who's got such a strong sense of self and such a strong belief in what he or she is doing  that they're willing to become pariahs.  And he's absolutely a pariah in some circles and probably has a price on his head with at least US intelligence, I would imagine.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One of the most fascinating things for me just as a journalist, besides the idea of, you know, they say the internet is all opinion, opinion, opinion.  Well, this is fact, fact, fact.  And the display of this data across various media sites was fascinating.  I think it's data visualization journalism really came into its own with the story.  Der Spiegel in Germany did a superb job of allowing you to navigate by kinds of deaths, kinds of accidents, kinds of events across geography, across time.  Now, OVNI, O-W-N-I dot F-R, did for WikiLeaks the crowdsourced application where people can come in and go through the documents and flag the ones that are interesting or that might need more attention.  The Guardian always does a good job with these kinds of graphics.  The Times did some.  So it was really interesting that you had a story that was fully based on data and facts and documents and source data, not on stories and narratives.  And it really changed, I think, the way that we can start to look at journalism.  These are original sources. These aren't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, the bigger question for, for, you know, what I'm working on with the book is it fascinates me that that really does more and more kill off the idea that you can do anything, even a war in secret.  There's a damn good chance that you're going to get exposed.  And so what does that mean?  Well, it means that we're watching you.  And I'm hoping that's better.  Uh oh.  It's even worse than doing this week in Glee is this week in journalism.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I gotta say, Jeff, you cover the range, though.  That's the amazing thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm just pitching for the new show, Leo.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just wonder, considering secrecy is a necessary component of war.  Or maybe just wars have to be fought.  I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is to some extent.  And certainly while you're doing it, absolutely.  But at some point, is it possible to wage war without the ugly stuff?  Without secrets?  Secrets, I don't know.  I don't think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's maybe.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If WikiLeaks had existed during World War II.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We would have lost.  We would have won.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a lot of disclosure during World War II.  The press corps was more, for better or for worse, more willing to cooperate in keeping certain things secret.  That's true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, think about, you know, I mean, I think we were able to deny Nazi anti-Semitism for a lot longer than we should have been able to deny.  And kept the United States out of the war for a lot longer.  Yes.  So perhaps that could have, you could have brought the US into the war sooner.  I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I read an essay recently that argued that with WikiLeaks, we might have prevented 9-11.  A bit specious, but it said that...  Yeah, I saw that.  That's hard to believe.  Yeah, it was.  But if the guy who wrote the famous memo saying, watch out there, registering for aviation  classes had gotten frustrated and had a place that he could have dropped that memo, that  would have done.  True.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  True.  I mean, George Tenet was telling President Bush, they're coming, they're coming.  And he was going, eh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do think that atrocities are an inevitable byproduct of war.  They're committed by all sides.  And therefore, something like WikiLeaks is beneficial for pointing that out so people  will take it more seriously before going into war.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point, Mitch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not a bad idea not to have illusions about what you're entering into.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Though when Leo and I grew up, we watched the Vietnam War on television over dinner.  It was the first TV war.  Did that affect us?  Did that...  It did, you know, it affected a generation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it really did.  I think it truly did.  I think that there was a lot of reluctance after Vietnam for our generation to get involved  in that again.  It took another generation to come along that didn't remember, didn't grow up with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you had the first Gulf War where everything was clamped down very nicely and  all the TV pictures you saw looked exactly like the video games.  Right.  Kind of 8-bit graphics and the cruise missiles would come into the house and go right down  the chimney and only kill bad people.  Perfect.  By the way, I'm not saying these roars were wrong.  I have my own personal opinion on them.  But I do think that many, many Americans failed to take it seriously enough going in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One more story that we'll get to our picks of the week.  And that is the...  There's not much to say.  We talked about it on Twitter.  The Dutch sandwich and the Irish...  What is it?  The Irish surprise?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That was a great conversation.  I think I saw that on Tia...  Oh, wait.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sorry.  It does.  It's called the double Irish and the Dutch sandwich.  It's a technique that frankly all US multinational corporations use.  It's estimated that the US loses $60 billion a year in taxes to these techniques which  basically funnel money offshore.  Ireland doesn't have a corporate tax.  So Google lowered its tax...  This is kind of actually offensive.  The nominal corporate tax rate in the US is 35%.  Google pays 2.4% in taxes.  And they did it by selling the intellectual property rights to Ireland, to a subsidiary  in Ireland.  That's the double Irish.  And then so a lot of the income ends up in Ireland where it's not taxed.  And then they send it through a Dutch subsidiary to Bermuda.  And no one knows where it goes from there.  But that's a lot of taxes.  That's billions of dollars in taxes lost to the US.  I don't know what the answer is to this.  It's completely legal.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, here's the further question I was wondering about this.  If they didn't do that, would they have issues of fiduciary responsibility to shareholders?  Would they get sued by shareholders?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If there's a legal way to legally avoid or lower your taxes and you don't do it,  of course you're not doing your job.  The CFO would be fired.  I'm just mad that I didn't think of it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Twit Cottage Bermuda.  It's opening soon.  This is as long as we're not in shorts, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, we're going to take a break and get our...  There's nothing to say about this, I think.  You can't say it's immoral because it's how the game is played.  It seems reprehensible that corporations are paying 2% taxes when we as individuals are paying far more than that.  We just don't have the available...  We don't have the Dutch double Irish sandwich.  If only.  I'm getting hungry.  I know.  We're going to get to our tip and tool.  And number of the week, if Jeff comes up with one, I left you one in the rundown.  There's a number left in there.  Somewhere hiding away.  Well, it's for you.  Oh, you got one.  Okay.  I don't have to leave you one then.  Five million.  Five million, two billion.  Don't say.  Don't say.  Just checking.  This show brought to you by our friends at Hover.com.  It's domain registration done right.  Hover makes managing domains easy.  Easy to set up email addresses, forward email addresses, redirecting emails.  Redirect your domains to other website addresses all with automated tools.  You can create URL extensions, set privacy controls, all with fewer clicks.  And best of all, as far as I'm concerned, without Hover trying to sell you something you don't want.  If you try to buy a domain from those other guys, 80 clicks later and you're still going, when do I get the domain?  Try Hover's domain management service out.  It's easy to transfer your existing domains to Hover.  I wish I'd done that.  I did it by hand and I got them locked and I'm having all sorts of trouble.  Not because of Hover, because of the other guys that I'm with who will take every opportunity to keep you from moving.  I could have paid Hover $25 to move all of our domains.  No matter, from one to $5,000.  $25, I should have done it.  Hover is domain registration done right.  Simple, easy.  And I want you to try it right now.  You'll even save money if you use our special domain name, twig.hover.com.  twig.hover.com.  Hover doesn't sell a lot of services.

No hold policy for all calls Monday through Friday, 9 to 8 p.m. Eastern during business hours.  Simple to transfer.  In fact, this is a special offer for you.  I think.  Do I have it right here in front of me?  10% off your new domain when you go to twig.hover.com.  Hover gives who is privacy free.  Other guys charge for it.  You're going to spend less with Hover because you don't have to pay for privacy.  I always buy domain privacy.  It's free.  It comes along with the deal at Hover.  Hover.com.  Use twig.hover.com and the show offer, show code twig for saving 10% for your new domain.  I like Hover.  All right.  Time for Gina Trapani's tip of the week.  Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I got two today.  The first one's a really quick one.  It's really cool.  It's new to me.  I'm not sure how long it's been around.  It's when you're watching YouTube videos, when you hit the play button, you can skip to 10%  into the video, 20% into the video, 30% in the video by tapping the one, two, three or  four buttons.  Just the numbers.  Yeah.  It's like the 30 second skip button on TiVo, but for YouTube.  So it works anywhere, whether the video is embedded somewhere or if it's on actual YouTube.  That is cool.  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  So you can skip through a video pretty quickly to get to the part that you want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wish I'd known about that.  We're always trying to jump ahead in videos and boy, that would have been saving me a  lot of time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  One, two, three, four.  Yeah.  Just skip ahead in a 10% in the video.  The only thing is the seek bar has to have focus, right?  So you should have just, you click play and then you hit the one and it'll skip.  But if anything else on the page has focus, it doesn't work.  Right.  That makes sense.  The second tip is this really cool Google Suggest mashup.  It's a Venn diagram, right?  So the people at Technomancy made this.  So it's really cool.  So you create this, you write this base query.  And then you add something like, how do I get my ex, like the letter X to, and then you  fill in a few different options.  So you can say, how do I get my ex to, and you fill in cat, dog, husband.  And you click update and it creates a Venn diagram of all of Google suggests auto completions  for those three queries.  So the Venn diagram for this query that I ran, how do I get my ex to, you know, cat,  dog, husband.  And it's like lose weight is in the middle of Venn diagram for everybody.  Love me, drink more water, stop biting, clean the house, cheat, fall in love with me again.  I mean, it's really kind of fun.  This is great.  Yeah.  It's a really kind of clever, cool mashup and people kind of put in all kinds of values  for men.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So if we did ex is and you put in each of our names.  So why is Twig so, and then I put in.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, you have to have an ex.  So you have to have an ex that fills in.  So yeah, you can say like ex is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why is, let's see, ex is weird.  I don't know.  What would I put in here?  And then I do.  You could just say ex is and then put.  Okay.  Then Gina, Jeff and Leo.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see what we get.  I don't know what we're going to get.  So we press update.  This is, this is just going to be weird.  I don't know.  Or is it done?  So you can see.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm a late rower apparently.  I don't know.  Gina's a punk rocker.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  AAC awesome.  I have.  I don't know.  Rail is like the intersection of Gina and Jeff is rail.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I have an idiot between, between Jeff and Leo and.  Oh, that's good.  I like that.  Yeah, that's good.  So you have to kind of play around with it.  It doesn't, it doesn't give you instant.  You have to, you have to have a little bit of a sense of it.  You have to, you have to come up with some good queries.  In fact, the link in the friend feed gives some good examples.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They did on hacker news.  They did.  They have, they came up with a bunch of good stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Why is America, Canada?  You're so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Star Trek, Star Wars and Avatar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, this is good.  Leo and Jeff combined are an idiot.  That's good.  That's good.  And then Gina, you're completely blank.  So.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it sort of reveals these generalizations that we make about.  So you can get some, some really kind of racist stuff, but also some kind of funny stuff.  It works really, really well for sort of larger queries about religions and people.  And, and it reveals the most common searches because it suggests.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So a hacker news reader said, why is America so, and then you put in actually, I could actually go to that search, I think.  And so why is America so?  And then you use Canada, America and Europe and then Canada bad at soccer, boring, cold, lame, multicultural, peaceful, sparsely populated America,  conservative, fat, obese, religious, stupid, violent.  And then, and then when you combine America with Canada, you get awesome.  Great. But you combine America with Europe, you get racist and rich.  And this is really bizarre.  I don't even know what it means, Gina, but it's, it's, it's kind of fascinating.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a kind of fascinating demonstrate like a charting of group think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess it is because it's using the search results.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I had, I had to share that one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I had a scientist who, who a week ago, you know, predicted stock market performance based on Twitter's mood.  Yeah.  There's something in there, but you just don't know what it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They could tell something.  No.  Your number of the week, Mr. J.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Five million, two billion.  The two billion is that Google reportedly is going to buy its gigantic New York building, which is a complete city block.  The former Port Authority building where they have all this wonderful open space and the slide and all kinds of stuff.  Are people working there?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  That's where they are.  They have all the, you know, the fiber into there and the redundant power and all the stuff they need.  So they're just going to buy it.  Not a big deal.  And then the five million is that Google just gave five million dollars to the Knight Foundation, two million of which will be used to fund the US journalism efforts.  Three million will be used for foreign efforts for a partner to be named.  And this means that Google can give to Knight as a kind of a Switzerland that will deal with this rather than giving to, oh, I don't know, directly to schools like mine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Seems like that's not a lot of money.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, but so little is spent on innovation and journalism that actually is something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's something. It's better than nothing.  Yeah.  My tool of the week is, I don't know who, do I credit you, Eileen, for MapCrunch?  Did you find this one?  Or did Gina find this one?  Gina and you both marked it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, we both put it in there.  It's kind of cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  MapCrunch.com.  It's kind of chat roulette for Street View.  So you could choose a location and click go.  You could say, I want a slideshow.  You can be random or you can pick places.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was afraid we were going to see naked Germans standing on street corners in front of pixelated buildings.  You could.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, look, we, I don't know, where are we now?  We're in Antarctica or somewhere.  So it's amazing, really.  I mean, Street View has so many images that you could just basically go in and there's Georgia, a road, a country road.  So if you don't get to travel much, but you'd like to see what's out there, just go to MapCrunch.com and you can get to County Road 104.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm waiting for some travel blogger to kind of come up with this random itinerary using this app and then go and take the picture again or something.  Wouldn't that be cool?  With like a no minute or something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Where is that?  That's Santa Fe.  That's near Santa Fe.  We're in New Mexico.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think they may have picked some of the nicer photos.  You think they did?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They kind of do.  And yeah, because there's lots of.  Well, think about it, though.  There's a lot of countryside in the world.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's poor Google Street Views got to drive all over the place.  I think that's Kentucky.  This is kind of neat.  MapCrunch.com.  What am I producing shows for?  I could just turn this on.  Let it go.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Watch the world go by.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Have you ever played with the Flickr?  Not awesomeness.  What's it called?  Interestingness.  Interestingness?  Yes, I love that.  It's an old trick now, but boy, it is mesmerizing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  It is.  So many good photographers out there.  Well, that's it for the show.  Hey, I really want to thank our poor guest, Mitch Wagner, for joining us.  It was great.  Thank you.  Hope you enjoyed it.  We thank you for being here.  Follow him on Twitter, Mitch Wagner at Twitter.com.  Always unusual when you join Gina and Jeff and me, because you never know what we're going to be talking about.  We should have warned you we would talk about Glee and Mad Men.  I didn't know myself.  Two of my favorite subjects.  There you go.  You can't go wrong with that.  Gina Turpani is at SmarterWear.org.  You can also follow her on Fast Company, Fast Company.com, slash Work Smart for her new series.  That's pretty cool.  And Jeff Jarvis is tenured.  So you can't do anything to him.  He's at the City University of New York where he teaches journalism to youngsters who are entering a brave new world.  He's also a blogger at BuzzMachine.com and his book is What Would Google Do?  New book soon to emerge.  Public parts.  Do we know when that's going to come out yet?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do we know when it's going to be finished?  No, we don't.  We do not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, we don't.  I'm working away.  You'll probably get that call once in a while from your publisher.  It's logging away.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All I see here is that Best Buy is going to offer free Google TV install service.  Good. I need it.  Yeah.  I can't figure it out.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  45 minutes until TV is not good.  Is that ridiculous?  It's not good.  Geek Squad.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, I looked at the box last night and I thought, I don't want it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You just didn't have it in you.  You're like, I'd rather just watch TV.  I just wanted to watch Glee.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I knew where to find it.  I didn't need a Google search.  I just wanted to watch Glee.  I just wanted to watch her.  And I think this is part of the problem is the reason people watch TV is because they're tired.  Nobody watches.  They don't want to work to watch TV.  And well, I'll set it up and I'll let you know next week.  How about that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't wait to hear.  I can't wait to hear what it's like.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, you know, I bought I got chocolate on my nose.  What is that?  Somebody brought me ice cream and I, oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good look.  It works.  Thank you for being here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
