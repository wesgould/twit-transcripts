Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess people just assume that you're kind of a certain average and then when they meet you in person then you if you deviate  What's really bad is and I've had this for years since I've been in radio since 1976  When people don't ever see you but they hear your voice and they meet you there they can't help it their face always falls  I  Thought you were tall and blonde oh  No, I'm so dark

Transcript:  Really later ladies could squash me with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One sneaker they could snake and smash me you know who's tall and I hate I hate doing this  I think I said I suppressed my reaction when I met you for the first time Jeff  But you know who's really tall and I couldn't suppress my reaction. Do you know who's odd ideas is she's a podcaster?  And she is very tall so much so that I could not suppress my reaction was like  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Knew she was tall on because because of the podcast that I watched she would get off and move around in her chair  Yeah, you get some sense of her. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah  Just shocked you know and I've been watching her for years  I was just like whoa, and it was epic food probably is when you were watching this great podcast. Yeah, but yeah  She's extremely tall  And I feel bad because you know when I go oh you're tall the poor woman's getting that in her whole life, right?  So I feel bad, but what can you do?  People's you know they meet me they go. Oh my god. You're gorgeous, and you know it's kind of embarrassing but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Statistically tall people are more successful, so you don't you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right. It's almost like saying you're better than me Wow Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My sister for a long time dated a her college boyfriend was it was a short guy who was very sensitive about it and for a  While thank God they didn't happen before while they were engaged and I had my reaction was oh good. I've always wanted a little brother  Oh dear  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those are embarrassing things you can never take back no  Nothing you can do  Hey, you know what I don't want to miss the change log last week the entire episode was a change log because of course we found  The heels of Google's amazing morning announcement with the new Kindle 4.3  And of course the chromecast so let's just launch right into it at Brian Burnett. Do you have the trumpets?  Would you play the change log trumpets right now?  Ladies and gentlemen what's new at Google Gina Trapani has everything  Google has relaunched is that gets or sorry Zagat I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zagat's website and mobile apps there's no payment or registration required  Yeah, so this is the first time all of the Gats ratings reviews are available for free. You don't even have to register  Right now the website only covers nine cities San Francisco, Austin Boston, Chicago, London  Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia and DC, but that's going to expand Google's sales  It's a little deceptive because for instance you can search for restaurants with Zagat ratings in Petaluma and it will show them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you choose a location and the website lets you choose but you can still it apparently still has access to the full database  I'm not sure it's unclear but Petaluma's restaurants are still in there  Interesting. Yeah, I just installed the Android app and it made me choose a you have to choose a city from that small selection

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah from that small selection, but now it's a little bit more complicated  Yeah, yeah from that small selection but now it's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's your default  That's your default, but you can still search by location as you could before you could say what's near me right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zagat is fabulous. I love Zagat. Yeah. Yeah, this is this is really nice  It's it's cool to see them putting resources into into this relaunch and and it's gonna expand to beyond just  Just restaurants as well, which is where Zagat was headed. It's also pretty. I mean, it's more editorial looking right? Mm-hmm  Lots of big images and media really nice. I actually haven't looked at on a tablet yet  But it looks it looks like it will be tablet optimized there goes a paywall

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yay  Yeah, cuz what was this was I paid like 40 bucks a year or something. It wasn't cheap  Yeah, and then they had the books that you'd have to buy the books too  Mm-hmm. Oh integrated. Is it with Google?  Well, it's always been in the maps, right?  If you are in a map and you tap a restaurant you can it's hard to find  But you could get the Zagat ratings  If you worked around cuz Lisa and I have a game where we go to a restaurant and she will say what the rating should be  And she's very good. I will always over rate a restaurant. She's very conservative and she's a very good  Yeah, it's fun yeah, that is fun and they're generally trustworthy I find it  You know if you go to the best restaurant in an area on Zagat, you're generally are going to the best restaurant in an area

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Calvin Trillin used to have a great Calvin Trilling the great New Yorker writer used to have a great routine about about how  When you went out of New York  People thought they were taking you to the best restaurant and all it served was stuffed heavy with heavy. Yeah, he's right, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was talking about we had a visitor from Greenville, South Carolina  And I remember this was a while ago. He says we've gotten better now  But I remember going to the best restaurant in Greenville and everything was fried and had hush puppies for every course

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's that's what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not that there's anything wrong with it user ratings, all right, so that's one Zagat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah on the heels of this this relaunch of the Zagat Google plus the local iOS app will be retired on August 7th  You can kind of kind of make sense why there's a lot of overlap between the two properties  And another retirement going on Google shopper will be retired on August 30th

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What will Microsoft do it's scruge lads about yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man there you go. There you go  What else do we have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Works it works back to back to the gap for a second if I may yes  So I was looking at my New York app and and going back to a topic from two weeks ago  If you look at my Google plus feed you'll see the first thing in there is that the cronut king has a new invention

So he's you know, it's interesting he's he's pretty open about how he does it  You can't read you can't duplicate this they even the cronuts  Looks about ready to me. Although it's funny to hear the word reverse words reverse engineering applied to pastries  But that's what they talked about this woman in Manila  She sent somebody to the bakery in New York and had him fly cronuts back to Manila  So she could reverse engineer the cronut  Makes his own marshmallow. That's not as hard as it looks  It's actually fun to make marshmallows if you ever want to do that, look at that man handmade marshmallows are good. They're so good

Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Love the gap. This is good Google. Good job  So there really is more editorial on this. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when we say Google doesn't know the content

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Boy, they're big in a cut  And well, we'll talk about this when we when we okay, we could stop this now  It's making me hungry we can talk about this when we come back but they're obviously getting into hardware too in a big way  But go ahead. Let's continue with the change. Sorry for that little

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we talked about last week how Android 4.3 the photosphere feature got a lot better  Yeah, Google just rolled out a new site called views. It's a it's a maps site. If you go to google.com slash maps slash views  It's it's a kind of a featured collection of user submitted photos fears  So you can go and you can see some really cool photos fears of places like the Grand Canyon and beautiful islands  Queenstown Tunisia all around the world. So kind of kind of fun to see what kind of stuff people are submitting  Find them via the maps now too, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this is just kind of a special sort of this is a gallery  Yeah, it's a gallery kind of featuring  Apparently the ugliest place in the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alright there's the Grand Canyon though. So is this built into this photosphere app?  You'll have to tell us because I don't have a Google experience fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can submit to maps you can submit a photosphere to maps pretty easily. I'll tell you the honest truth  I haven't done it  But it definitely it always kind of felt like photos fears was was Google's way of equipping everybody with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  360 camera just in there credit to Microsoft because they have for a long time had this  Capability and did have the way to submit it and add it to Bing Maps and stuff  It was more than just this photosphere was really quite an amazing  Way to put pictures together. I can't remember the name of it, but these are these are gorgeous

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stitch the photos together. Yeah that brilliant guy did that demo? Yeah, it was really an impressive technology photos since that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is kind of a poor man's photosynth. Thank you my pee or Winster

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yes, this is a poor man's photos and exactly exactly and  Let's see. What else we got. Oh last thing Google  Released an official Google AdSense Android app  So you can go to play store you can find the AdSense app if you're running AdSense and version 1 which is this initial version  It provides earnings information custom URL channels ad units and site reports and payment alerts  So you get your AdSense updates right there right there on your phone. You can search for that in Google Play  I haven't done much of that sense in a while  So I haven't actually had a chance to test it out  But you're running a site with AdSense or running AdSense ads check that out and that's all I got and that play the drums

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is our  Change log  Thank you very very much. We're gonna take a break when we come back. Let's talk about  There's so much to talk about  Chromecast now that was been out for a while people have had at Kindle 7 and my my  NSA stuff as you talk and it more NSA stuff as there always always more NSA stuff seems like  and I want to talk to you about this idea that Google is now becoming a hardware company because I have to say they have  some pretty damn good hardware and  And tomorrow we're gonna add one more piece to that puzzle, but we'll talk about that, too  First a word from our sponsor Squarespace dot-com. I'm not giving Dan Benjamin's code this time  Dan and I both love Squarespace Dan's a web developer  so it's kind of neat that he actually into you know embraces Squarespace because  This really puts web developers in some ways out of business  You can be your own web developer  even if you don't know CSS or JavaScript or HD even HTML because with Squarespace you have  Point-and-click access to the most amazing templates each of them can be totally customized  So I'm just gonna pick one at random here. This is called Avenue one of the  beautiful new Squarespace templates and then you can scroll down and look at a variety of  websites using this not just  You know you can you can say how are portfolios using Avenue how are stores using Avenue for  E-commerce here's a website crane and Johnson that they use Avenue to sell women's clothing online  It's just and everyone looks unique. Everyone looks great stylish modern  And you can try it yourself for free. All you have to do is visit Squarespace comm click the try it free button  Pick a template and by the way, the beauty of this is as with all good  content hosting services and what Squarespace is both webs hosting and  Content management the content is completely separate from the presentation  So if tomorrow you want to use a different template, no problem  Just press a button and suddenly you look completely different, but your content remains there the SEO remains the same  They've even got importers which makes it very simple to move from an existing site and notice they've got a I love it  They've got a Nexus 7 here  They're showing that your site looks great not only on a 27 inch screen  But on an iPhone on an Android phone on a tablet every Squarespace template is mobile  Enhanced so that it looks great at all sizes completely responsive design now if you are a developer  There's plenty for you, too. They've got a complete development  platform that includes a color coded syntax color coding in the editor  Support CSS and JavaScript you've got plugins for all of the social networks  Complete import and export capability. You're never trapped at Squarespace  Although I don't know why you'd ever want to leave  It's completely SEO optimized your site can be totally crawled with site map and everything for Google Yahoo Bing and all the other search engines  It's the hosting the best hosting in the world plus the content management system that makes Squarespace unique  Do it for two weeks free. You don't need to give them a credit card  You don't need to give them anything  But your email address so they can send you the password when you forget it  That's it and after two weeks if you decide to buy I think you're gonna be blown away by the price  As little as eight dollars a month with the basic annual plan. I would recommend the unlimited plan  That's $16 a month when you pay annually and it gives you something  I know of no other host that does this unlimited bandwidth  You'll never get a bandwidth bill even if you become the most popular site on the internet  It's gonna cost you $16 a month  unlimited storage pages galleries blogs contributors  You even when you buy the annual plan get a custom domain name free and they'll hook it all up for you  of course the best customer support in the world and  Workshops to free workshops seminars so that you can learn the ins and outs you can really perfect what you're doing if you decide you want  To do ecommerce that's 24 bucks a month  And it includes everything unlimited physical and digital products a store  That's good on mobile as well as on desktops inventory tracking yes, they support that tax calculations  That's a big deal now, and they do it all for you shipping and coupon controls  Squarespace calm you got to try it out very very good stuff the best frankly for your next website  Bring it bring your site over if you've got one and try it out today Squarespace calm if you decide you want to buy  We're gonna get you 10% off  Your first purchase on a new account and that could be a lot of savings if you buy the annual plan  But you got to use our offer code for the month of July. It's twig seven  seventh month twig seven at Squarespace  calm I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wish there was square space button for life. I could just hit it look entirely different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would that be good? Yeah, the contents the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, presentation is a different separate the content layer from  Presentation layer we ought to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in humans  Humans  so  Let's talk about hardware because yes last week of course with Sundar  Pachai we saw a new Nexus tablet that is  arguably the best small tablet made as

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You said on twit this week. Well. I think you have no reason to buy an iPad mini

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know though I can give you one reason. It's for three the aspect ratio  But the and the only other reason is if you're trapped in the ecosystem if you are trapped in iTunes  and you you know you've spent so much money on iTunes content or  But even you know even the music now is unprotected in iTunes. It would have to be TV or movies  I guess but it's not like you're gonna throw away that capability. You just can't do it on the tablet  It is the screen is gorgeous. It's very fast. I've been playing games on it the  Open GL support is superb  It's just great hardware, and then they do the chromecast which admittedly right now isn't  You know is isn't much. It's not much to pay for either is 35 bucks, but  I think if it looks like it's sold out do we do we have any thoughts about what that means how many of the units?  They might have sold  There a couple of data points one Netflix the Netflix deal is over  Right like the first day  And that you can there's at least what three or four weeks now to get one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think best buys were getting a couple dozen of them. They sold out quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ten thousand fifty thousand a hundred thousand a million how many did they sell I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think they were obviously surprised because they had to pull back the Netflix deal  I think that took off even more than they knew yeah, how are they surprised though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean these things are so cheap they must they they should have made I mean gazillions of them  I don't know it surprised me. They sold out so quickly or that or they let they sold out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that there's a delay so quickly there's a magic price point if you are at a certain price point  We know that it's 99 bucks for tablets right because even Microsoft's surface RT sells  And the playbook the blackberry playbook 99 bucks is sold out, so there's a magic price point  I think $35 is so low that it's an impulse purchase

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know the other thing is so I got one before I got the two others if it just reversed the order  And and so I put it in that night and the next day  I was driving myself nuts because I was sitting in my office  And I wanted to just cast stuff to the TV there, and I couldn't do it  Interesting it's it's really addictive though  However, that's the good news the bad news is when I got the other two I went to the bedroom put it in there the Wi-Fi  Is not superb there doesn't work so well. Yeah, you need to have good Wi-Fi  But and I know some other bugs if I accidentally close the window on the laptop. There's no way to control. It's on the TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really even if you open the window you can't get back get the control. I didn't think so I tried

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I maybe I just got it wrong. I don't know  You know if I just go to YouTube. I don't know what I'm getting open  So this is you know it's not perfect, but it really changes how I think of TV and and it changes  very importantly for Google the notion of discovering TV and I  Frankly didn't use YouTube all that much now  I'm driving to things to find more stuff because it's just so easy and wonderful to put it across watching twit on  This way is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think about you the YouTube thing you said is very interesting because isn't this one of I mean Google's put  500 million dollars or something into the idea of making you to be more like a real TV network not the crotch shot channel  But like real content and this is a big piece of the puzzle and it's on your big screen easily

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yes, it makes all the difference and even the stuff you ought to put up  You know without having the it's not chromecast capable yet works fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the other very innovative thing is that you're not controlling it with a remote  Oh, you're not controlling the remote is you you're just it's you look it up on your phone, and you send it and  It's just a natural way to do it  If you of course you have to have a smartphone an iOS or Android smartphone  But I have to think so the reason I asked the number is  Let's say they sold a quarter of a million. I think that's not unreasonable  That is enough. I think for companies to sit up and say oh  There would be in our interest to add a chromecast button well and now the rumor at least is that HBO go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said it they admitted it. It's not that loud. Yeah good. Yeah, they said they're gonna do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're gonna support it. Yep, that's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plex is gonna do it now. That's interesting because that means all your media will be playable through the chromecast  if you use Plex

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Vimeo so in in the Plex player yeah, okay?  So in the Plex media player on your desktop you can then send you'd have to have Plex you have to have a Plex

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to Plex media server somewhere, but you can then control it through chromecast  So you'll have the Plex app. This is how I would imagine you'd have the Plex app on your device  you'd have a Plex server somewhere a desktop computer or a network attached storage and  You would then fire up Plex on your iPhone or your Android phone  Press the chromecast button choose your content from your media server put it on your screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google is gonna approve that there still is an approval process right I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't know it's I don't think so they have to give you a certificate or something they do right yeah, okay?  Well, that's right. That's why the hell wouldn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, right. Why wouldn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless they get pressure from their partners  Right, but I  Even if it just does what it does right now. It's a very good by the way Netflix on it looks gorgeous  Here's the one button they've if they do this. It's a it's done is Amazon  Yes, that would be the fact that Amazon sold them  Tells me there's a dolly ounce there yeah cuz Amazon knows how many they sold oh yeah  So here's from Dan McDermott on Google plus a supervisor at Amazon told me I  Ordered the last chromecast and they had sold Amazon says half a million to seven hundred thousand until they ran out on day two  That's Amazon alone now Amazon's knows that number right you now  Admittedly Amazon it's a little bit against Amazon's business  I don't know is it against their business model to put it on Chromecast and I'm talking about Amazon streaming video  No, how is that I guess no they put it on my smart TV Panasonic does it everybody does it  I know yeah, I mean they're giving it will should be a happy customer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you know if the kindle app runs anywhere right why wouldn't they want people to be able to watch their?  Streaming I  Bought a bunch of stuff on Amazon instant streaming. I want to actually be able to watch it wherever I want  I mean why you know why not and that's only gonna make me buy more stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From Amazon if I know I can watch it anywhere well if Amazon sold half a million. Let's take the lower number  Yeah, if they sold half a Google must have sold that many at least

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least but you would think that they would probably have double what they're gonna give Amazon right now remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're talking about this in a universe  where  13 million Apple TVs have been sold total  about 5 million Roku's total if you sold a million on the first week of anything that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your a player that is something that is something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and as always you don't know how much it could have sold because they run out of  Stock it's just it's just such a lost opportunity, but this is somebody pointed out. This is this is the this now we understand  I don't think we said this last week now. We understand everybody made fun of when Eric Schmidt said by the summer of  2012 a little off there the majority of televisions you see in stores will have Google TV embedded in it  now we're making fun of that because  We did laugh we should have laughed at it, but you know what  In the end we didn't understand how yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another measure of its success is the fact that they're selling on Craigslist for 75 to 90 or eBay for 75 to 90 dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's up. It was when I when I blogged that it was 50 bucks  Yeah, plus I hear and and eBay UK people are trying to spend like 90 pounds

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would work in the UK you can't buy it from the UK, but I see no reason why it wouldn't work  Oh, yeah people from other countries are trying to buy it. I see that Netflix you'd have to have a you know a special account  Special account but YouTube should work the the tab thing should work. I don't I doubt that it would I don't know would it check I  Don't think it's where are you are you in England stop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh and people are selling them for more on eBay if you have the Netflix code

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's worth 88 bucks if you get that because that takes that takes 24 bucks off of the yes, yeah  By the way, I got the email I get a code for each Chromecast  You can't apply them all at once but it sounds to me as if you could wait the three months and then apply the next  one  Unless they expire them  Because what I do I applied one and I have an existing account great next three months are free of Netflix  Then I tried to play the next one. I said you can only have one applied at a time  But that did not apply it implied that I could then apply it later

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many family members can use a Netflix account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know quite a few I we have separate separate logins for all my all my family members  Well for the for the same account. Yeah, oh  Yeah that way  Yeah, you don't get the same recommendations exactly. I don't want their recommendations. Oh, I didn't know you can do that. Oh  The codes expire end of 2013 so I'll get at least six months  So that's pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, I count down to the people who are now gonna go on and start asking you for the extra codes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I should give those away shouldn't I because I bought five  You know you want one reason why you sold I bet a lot of people bought multiple ones you what to buy accident, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I would I bought I bought two and then saw you buying more and I went back and bought a third  Because this is this is what men do  If Leo has three I'm gonna get three each other well, I wanted one for every TV in my house

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's three and then I wanted and then I got two for Lisa cuz she's got two  Cuz you know what happens and this is what you experienced at work. You get used to it. You know, it's great and  an unexpected you the Google music works with it and I and and and and as  Sundar whoever was talking said  I do have my best stereo equipped in my TVs have are with the good stereo, right so I can listen to my music  It's been great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool. I haven't tried that yet and up and or to come

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but even it's even I like, you know, I really like the Google music radio

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? Yeah, great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it just plays yes great and it and on because it's on your TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They put nice big album art up at first with all the information and then it shrinks down and there's a screensaver  You you get a nice it's even nicer than Pandora. It's beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a cheapskate and when they charged me the 799 where when the trial ended I was kind of like, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll keep it. I can't what it is. I cancels I canceled Spotify. So I saved a couple of bucks. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so do you see this post on GTV hacker that  That the Chromecast is more Android. Yeah promo s under the hood  Yeah, it's a modified Google TV release. Yeah, isn't that interesting? It is. Yeah. Yes  We were talking the last night on all about Android  You know why they chose to go with the chrome brand versus the Android or Nexus brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz they really said this is chrome OS, didn't they? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next to the chrome devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably semantic right because  Chrome OS is very similar to Android from you know, the bottom up. It's only the top layers that are different, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I guess it makes sense. I mean, I oh, I don't know a look  I don't know what the with the internals of Chrome OS  I'm not sure what the with the real low level code is like and how close Linux right? It's a Linux kernel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's Linux right and so going up to that going up  So it's you know the Linux kernel and then there's Dalvik on top of that. That's the job the Java  Engine right is Dalvik on the chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OS or is it just Android? No, well Dalvik is there to run the Java bytecode, right? Right?  So this is these are the Java run time. Yeah, that's a Java runtime. They're not running Android apps here  This is just Chrome. So it doesn't so if it doesn't have Dalvik, it's not Android. Well, yeah, I mean that's right  That's a that's a good argument  I mean for me it is a less of a technical discussion and more of a marketing brand discussion  How come they didn't decide to go with that, you know, the the Nexus dongle or the Nexus  I don't know whatever versus the chrome brand and a lot of people here's well the Google TV brand has been terrible  You know, they want to sell it cross-platform. They want iOS users to understand that they also can use it  Chrome is cross-platform and Android is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was just an interesting branding choice. Isn't this isn't it this simple? It's an add-on to Chrome. It's a chrome extension  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also  Communicates what you do with it more easily right?  This from Chrome. This is Chrome to crime. That's I think that's what it is. I think it's  Chrome it's casting your chrome. Yeah, it's another it's a remote tab. It's a remote chrome tab

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Essentially, you're right. I guess what I'm using Netflix. That's not the case what I'm using  YouTube player is not the case, but otherwise it wants me to say this is just an extension of your laptop folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. This is right. This is a tab on it doesn't and I'm reading the GTV hacker post

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't have Dalvik or bionic on it. So it really is  I mean, I think I think that's semantics to say that it's more Android or more Google TV than it is Chrome OS  If you have to just see the Linux Linux, that's could be called Chrome OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, did you see the Easter eggs on the device the hardware Easter eggs? It's on the run down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw this in the rundown. I didn't get a chance to look at them  Look at what is it? There's a Konami code some oh, I did the Konami code. Yeah, I did that one, but that's on the app

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's two others just looking up on the on the thing. Okay, because it's it's visual we got it

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean every bit of harbor they shipped have had has had some sort of Easter egg, right?  So there's this in the chrome the pixel had the Konami code  Even the cr-48 had the that had that that hidden developer switch kind of to unlock it, you know inside the bottom  I guess that wasn't really an Easter egg, but it was still kind of a neat little developer switch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even their bids for the 700 megahertz spectrum had Easter eggs in it, right?  They're bid was pie. Well, that's right. That's right  3.14 159 billion dollars  So there it is. Yeah, it's kind of hard to see but H 2 g 2 I verify that  And the IC and the FCC ID and the model number all are in there it's in the FCC ID  That's hysterical right now you said that on the on the power adapter there's something here. Yeah, the power adapters a model number  Mstk3 oh my god mystery science theater 3000  Okay, okay you win  You win resistance is futile

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This might be the one of the best devices Google's shipped  I can't decide the next of seven or this is the best device that Google's ever shipped both

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Last week and I have to say it puts them in a position Gina Gina Gina. I know  Not even close I  Like the pixel I like it a pixel but the best taking price into  Well do note that Google does much better with products of similar capabilities when they price it amazingly low  Because they didn't do too well with the queue remember  But the chrome casts at one tenth the price seems to have done quite well a pixel at $1,500  Not such a big seller, but you do it at 200 bucks 250 bucks is chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know back to your point about being a hardware company who would think that?  Google as a company would put out the best iterations isn't that interesting right and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  standby because tomorrow at  Starting in the morning and throughout the morning in New York City  Google is going to finally take the wraps off of the moto X and I say Google because Google owns Motorola

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is the first Motorola phone if the people who are going to that thing are get walking away with them  And I'm not invited in it can't get one on yes. I know we got to get both you and Gina one because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I can't tell you why  But what we're gonna do is the embargo is I have my tongue will be untied at noon  Pacific 3 p.m.. Eastern tomorrow, so we're gonna do a special  I'm hoping we're gonna get one between now and then we we have been begging and pleading the whole time  For all this suffering that this should be the price they put let me say this about that  While there are many questions that I still have because I you know I played with it for an hour  But I did not yet  I didn't have a chance to use it as a real phone for a week or two  So there's lots of things I mean it could have terrible phone reception. I don't know the speakers could be money  I don't know that stuff  There's some questions in my mind about battery life  I wasn't able to use it long enough to verify, but I do have some initial impressions  Which I'll talk about tomorrow on battery life. I have some I have some knowledge about that  It seems it looks to me that this will be  Very likely to be one of the best phones if not the best phone out there  Wow for a number of reasons some of which have not been fully revealed yet  But this is a good price not that impressive  Okay, let's talk about PC magazine Sasha  Segan  Who is Sasha? I I don't know if he's a boy or a girl  But he does or she does very good mobile stories. Let me see if I can find this story here  and it acts  He says this as if why am I getting a pop-up go away go away  He says this as if he is revealing something that he's been  Told it says the title is Motorola reveals more x8 chip  Details I cannot I'm told that I cannot confirm  Leaks until tomorrow or deny leaks until tomorrow's gosh Leo  What does that nice fella say but let me tell you what Sasha and now that I see the picture  I'm pretty sure it's a guy or could be a really ugly girl, but  That's a dude right okay, you never know  so so the x8 is in the droid ultra mini and max and  He says it's anticipated to be under the hood of the new moto X can't confirm or deny that  But listen to what he says  And I think it might be germane the x8 isn't the processor and it's not an SOC a system on a chip  It appears to be shorthand for combining a customized snapdragon s4 Pro  System on a chip that's a quad core top of the line by the way that is not middle of the line  Snapdragon with two with two additional  custom DSPs  One of which can function essentially is a low-power CPU

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just how can listen to you all the time if it could do that hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He quotes our shot who's an engineer at Motorola senior VP of engineering if you look at the x8 mobile computing system  It Paul says it has a cluster of processors and then some separate elements of the system  The goal was to move away from a primarily CPU based architecture to save power and do quote intelligent  probabilistic computing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh  Not just listening to you, but anticipating certain things at certain times. I don't know not that you would know actually know what he means  Ballistic computing well this guy I'm going too far. I'm sure cuz but but I like you like wave  What that means to me is that Google's intent is always to  Intuit your intent yeah, and so if it's constantly computing about you  Well remember what time it is you know it can do things remember what I said to Brad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fitzpatrick was it past Patrick or no it was it was  Horowitz Bradley Horowitz when we were leaving Google I oh boy. You know it would be so cool if Google did a Google now  Google plus phone face become  Yeah, hmm that would be cool  So I and he came winked and nudged and said yeah, just wait  But I would guess that this that what what the what a the next generation  Google slash Motorola phones and that now that Google has a handset manufacturer  It behooves them to put the nexus line on that manufacturer  I understand that they don't want to piss off anybody  But Samsung's eating their lunch at this point and Samsung's really making more and more noise about kind of going their own way  They're having a developers conference in the fall  And I have to say I'm more and more dissatisfied the more I use the GS for the more  It's crudded up and and every once in a while it overheats the battery just drains in a minute because there's something running on it  That goo that Samsung put on there the camera has never worked right from day one  I just on Samsung  I think has gone down a very bad road  And it would be it would be smart of Google and if I'm Google I'm looking geez you know we don't want this to represent  But it does to half of all smartphone manufacturers. They've got our buyers. They've got it Samsung's  This is now becoming the face of Android synonymous with Android  What are we gonna do about that and I think this is Motorola is the opportunity for them to at least say  Here is what another way to go with Android would be this is the premium  Free Oh perfect way to describe it mm-hmm boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the phrase they should be used the funny thing is premium equals pure not messed up with the things you add that you call  Premium other companies yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was not a fan of a pure Google experience for a long time  But but but but four point two point two and later. It's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it is I'm afraid my god got a Samsung phone  And I was trying to help him with it as he couldn't figure out he's only true of the rear  Horrible, it was give me a headache trying to get Microsoft horrible so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know I talked to the guy who invented moto blur. I said why'd you do that to people?  Yeah, and he said  He said I understand he said but it at that time with with gingerbread  Android wasn't there yet. We really had to we felt we had to customize heavily to give consumers something they could use  He said it's not that way anymore, and I agree with him  So I think that I would expect. I'm not I would just expect the moto X to be  Exactly what you said Google's kind of underscoring  I don't know if they'll call it an excess they probably won't but but this is the premium Android experience  This is how it should be done, and what better way to show that than Google's premier mobile product Google now  Here's a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So will they sell it on the Play Store?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely why wouldn't they?  They definitely so but this seems to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're kind of saying nothing there if you go to the if you go to the Motorola site is all  Motorola site is all motor X

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean I can't imagine  Leo's got something about this he's got something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Would you say hmm? I was just having a long drink of water

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We speculated a while ago that the reason why the HTC one and the GS four and the Play Store with like the Google  Edition is the kind of their way to make nice nice preemptively make nice nice with these other manufacturers  Because now they're gonna hit with the Moto X and it's gonna be the Android phone to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want it tomorrow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they'll announce it tomorrow. I don't think it's available right away  I'm not sure but I think that you're gonna have to wait a little bit there  There is a leak from was that Best Buy or one of the retailers that said August 23rd. Oh  So you're gonna you might have to wait a few weeks  I  Have to say if Sasha Segan is right this x8 chip  Means you can't compare head-to-head with other phones  You know you can't say well, that's a middle-of-the-line chip or it's a middle-of-the-line Ram or because it's something different  And I think they'd be smart to say look Apple says this all the time don't look at specs look at what we can do  You know don't that's fair that's fair right we expect you should look at his battery life and  And how it integrates into my life does it work for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm so it's gonna be running for three right  So the leak say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For three or four to well, they'd be crazy to ship it with four to two, but I don't right there would be that  I can tell you this I could tell you this the phones we looked at had four to two on it  But they hadn't announced for three yet. So yeah, okay  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay  So if it were the Google now version of Facebook home  which is kind of what it sounds like it is the thing that sort of anticipates and listens and  Yeah, I wonder if that they're gonna if they're gonna ship it with a with a special launcher  Is it gonna be a special not I don't want to say skin because that sounds  Too much like what we're complaining about. Yeah, I don't think I mean I think Facebook home was a huge flop, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  So I think that they were they wouldn't do that  You know, I can't Google Plus  Launcher, I think it's pretty clear people want access to the functionality of the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, now is pretty accessible but but will Google now have new capabilities  Based on this phones new capabilities of being more aware always listening, etc  I mean am I gonna say something to my wife and get a Google now card with like news results

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no  I don't know for a fact, but if they did that that would be crazy  What what I'm pretty sure is the case is that it's not listening online  it's listening locally until it hears the key phrase and  Then it then opens up a channel to that was that was they were very clear without yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not keeping track of what I'm saying gonna freak. Oh nobody would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kind of joking but you know, I had this Google now experience this past week  So my terrible embarrassing shameful guilty pleasure right now on TV is happened to me, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know exactly what you're about to say. What's your get? What's your guilty pleasure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's I'm really sorry ahead of time saying is the bachelorette. Okay. Oh, that's really sad watching the bachelorette

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And guess who knows what she's watching yes, because I of course search

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there's a blogger who like basically spoils the whole season by saying who she chooses and I hate Google  The spoilers like a couple of days ago or I mean a couple weeks ago  I haven't done in a while and then a new story about about the bachelorette came out and my Google I picked up my phone  I knew it and Google now said there's a new news story about the bachelorette spoilers  We thought you'd be interested in here. It is and don't you know that I tap that card it worked

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And did you say at the time? Thank you Google. Oh  Thank you for spying on me. How did it know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was based on my searchers searches like I searched for so here's what I thought you were gonna say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So last night on my Google now pops up it says oh, I see you have a TV online  Would you like to?  Whoa, whoa on the Google now, it's not here anymore because I swiped it away  But on the Google now it says you have your Panasonic Vera is online  because they're both on the same Wi-Fi network and  And then press this button to see so we can see what you're listening to and  I did it said no, sorry, you could it'll well you can only identify live TV  I was watching the soprano so they said we can only identify live TV, but had I been watching the bachelorette

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have given you yeah, it would have to do it done like actors or whatever  They're not actors on that show. But but yeah, oh, yes, they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina do not deceive yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And professional wrestling is not real Gina

Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't hurt each other but but but but what's yeah, it would be funny if it said really Gina is that what you're watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From any hall and and you're standing in the movie line and some jerk is talking about Marshall McLuhan and the phone comes up  And says no, he's wrong. He doesn't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Love that  Would love it  Yeah  They so what this would have done is listen to the audio  Said and I did press the button and it listened to the audio and said I don't know what this is  But you have to be watching live TV and I said, oh, that's why it's the sopranos. It's a it's a 13 year old TV show  It doesn't know from that. I was wondering I thought what this interesting would they have audio clips from you know audio  From every TV show ever broadcast. Would that be cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't understand so we listen to the audio and then so we know what you're watching and then what well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I presume a card would pop up with information  Information about yeah and forevermore because now it goes. Oh, yeah, you watch The Bachelor  Why don't we pop up a notification on your calendar?  Now one of the nice things about now is you can always swipe it away and say I don't want to see that anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So hey, there's a new season starting. Oh, hey, there's a yeah, there's a special another show going on. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's great. I  Don't mind giving them that information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This despite the shame that I felt happening on the car now, it's great  It's great and Google knows that people surf the web while they watch TV, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So does that happen look up so now here's a question if I watch something on Chromecast  Is it gonna start showing up in Google now? Of course it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google knows right Google knows this is a question. I mean, I assume that Google knows it has something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the whole point of this unified privacy policy. They implemented back, you know  A year or two ago, by the way, just in case you didn't know it all of our services are sharing information  Yeah, what difference does it make because the NSA knows anyway, I'm not worried about the about the Google when you got the NSA to work  Oh, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm from a technical standpoint though  I mean you're on the same Wi-Fi network and it's all happening locally Google doesn't have to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but don't you think it's interesting that Google now knew that my TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was I mean it saw my TV it knew it saw your TV on your local Wi-Fi network and it told it  So yeah and Google now pushed down from the cloud, right? Yeah, they're watching they know what's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now don't say it that way because it implies there is a human watching the algorithm  It's algorithmically noting what we're doing and providing us with information based on that  And I don't have the same problem with that and you know, what's interesting  I don't even have the problem if we're judgmental because I wouldn't mind if this phone kind of had a personality  Yeah, and I kind of could kind of interact with it could be my new friend I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could tell Google now scold me when I'm watching The Bachelorette wouldn't that be funny  All the other things that I could be doing during the Bachelorette  Right if it did it in a fun way, yeah, well if you cool could get down  Yeah, like a fun editorial voice and and you could tell it  Hey stop me from doing this or encourage me, you know to do this if I'm at the gym, you know  Give me kudos

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like kick me in the butt how far is that for putting a reference to Mystery Science Theater?  3000 on the serial number on the power supply. It's not far Google already is starting to sneak editorial voice into everything  And probably with an eye towards yeah be kind of fun. That's a personality. You could choose the personality  Yeah, yeah, I would do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Funified self certainly follows right? I mean, you know the latitude all the data the latitude  Collected on you right and that you knew I spend this much time at work this much time at home, right?  I mean that's that seems like being that data useful to to the user and saying hey  Here's what you should do with this. Stop watching The Bachelorette

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You take that to the extreme  This will freak people out but at some level there are predictors about things like depression  Right could cheer you up  Cuz you're lonely or could warn you it could make you aware of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, well, I mean why do you think I have my scale tweet my weight it's humiliating  but the reason I do it is because I want support from my network of friends who will and and  Acquaintances and people I've never met will say hey Leo.

Transcript:  I I'm feeling  Maybe I have been brainwashed at this point  Brainwashed at this point  and you know as a journalist I really I  Really want to maintain my objectivity and my integrity  But I I can't help but be very and I hate to admit it very excited about what I see coming out of Google  Right now. Yeah. Yeah same here. I don't want to like it. I  Want to find something wrong with it?  Well, and something else you get mad about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that? Well, though they responded  Their terms of service for Google Fiber and net neutrality. Yeah, this bugs the hell out of me  They had an answer and said no, it's just standard stop, but they shouldn't be standard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you have Google five, you're lucky enough to have Google gigabit fiber in and of course that would be in Kansas City  Soon Provo, Utah and Austin, Texas  Dan Benjamin by the way was glowing about that  When he was in here on Sunday, yeah, we're gonna get that actually would be a competitive advantage for him  Stop laughing whose side are you on?  But in the terms of service, thank God he's not allowed to create a server  Now it is true. Google says well everybody does that Comcast won't let me run a server a mail server or web server  But you know, there's all kinds of servers if you're running a Minecraft server or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instead it came back and said no, we don't non-commercial games home monitoring a lot of stuff is fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but who's to make though, you know, it's up to a Google employee to decide I run a drop cam  We're running drop cams here. Those are servers so I can see my camera  Lots of stuff is servers. What it will what is Google saying? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're trying to get me to actually give you information

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just I think that what there's you gotta it's I hate this where well we got the rule  But don't worry. We're not gonna enforce it pisses the hell out of me because that's not how it works  He says Google he Google whoever says  We're not violating net neutrality  Well, yes you I guess you are. I mean look any commercial service  And any web I certainly don't complain that Comcast does this any anybody who offers internet service  Can I think quite reasonably say look we don't want you running a mail server because you could be a spammer or running a web  Server because there's security issues from your house. We're not you're not we're selling this for non-commercial use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I don't think that's unreasonable, but security issue of running a web server from your house

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there are all sorts of issues with you know, since you're running a server you're letting people into your home network  So it's a security issue for you  It's a security issue for them because they're in effect  hosting  Server and if you're serving malware there was they're serving malware. Okay, if you're sending spam, they're sending spam, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but Leo if I'm  Comcast or Google whichever one  On the exact same network on the exact same service if I have a business  I'm sure I'm allowed to run a server. Well, that's what Google says. We do offer a business class  And what yeah, okay, but that's that's where that's where it's quizzing of them. What's the actual?  Technology difference then if I'm Joe's bagel shop. Well, you're paying more for that. You're paying more for the business class  That's that's the quizzing party is oh for something that actually doesn't cost us anything more  We're gonna charge you more because we can that's what cable companies do that's not what Google should do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the essence of net neutrality. Well, that's and that's that's why it bothered me  I understand when Comcast does that there's even technical reasons why they might want to do that  But Google's supposed to be a little you know stand up for now  This is their response to ours technicals article Google is a strong supporter of the open internet and our stance there here hasn't changed  This is a standard practice of network  Management and as we said in our filing the policy does not prevent legal and non-commercial use of applications  Such as multiplayer gaming video conferencing and home security  You know, there's lots of service sling boxes of server. There's lots of servers people run in their home. Yeah, there's this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's such a cop-out they need to stand up and define what they're talking about here. Everything is a server  Everything should be a server, right? I mean  Refrigerator becomes a server, right? Right?  Everything should be a server I run a server on my I do develop a web development because the Chromecast is a server  I mean, you know to some I mean, it's at least it's a peer. It's a node  I don't know. This is this is BS. We should call them out on this  They should rewrite what exactly they mean by server they should define what they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gets in trouble, right? Yeah things that I haven't liked the Google's done  Number one was China number two was the net neutrality  Quizzling act with the devil's deal the horizon and number three is this kind of stuff  When they when they think they're operating at an industry level they act like a company when they're operating person to person they try to be  Decent. Sorry, that's my lights. They're run by Comcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well and you understand though that  Even if it becomes an even more an issue when you're selling a lot of date bandwidth  Especially a lot of symmetric bandwidth, you know, we're giving you a gigabit the temptation to run a server  I pay a lot of money for a gigabit from soft layer. The temptation is high a  Gigabit I could for instance have a radio station

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in the long run  What you should I wrote about this and what would Google do?  You should look at your  Google e-cable company I said actually I should go back to this now and compare and contrast a  Google e-cable company would be an enabler of your creations  Yes, and and it would be a good thing for everybody exactly  Now maybe what they should offer is and say listen, we've got a more secure better solution  we have Google's versions of AWS which we're gonna make ready for primetime and ready for  plain old people at home and  We're not gonna charge you more we'd like you to use that and create stuff and the more content you create better is for Google  hallelujah, you know, but we don't want to go and have to invest in the in the  Last mile of our network, right? Okay, but but from a from a service perspective  They should be trying to encourage people to make stuff and to do more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And certainly is there right is a commercial entity not to do that but we would we would ask more from of them I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they say something like we'd  You know if you have a publicly accessible server that has more than 10,000 concurrent connections  Please contact us about a business, you know or more than a thousand connections, you know, God I was about a business  Plan if it just seems like that they could be a little more  Specific about what it is that they don't want because everything is a server at this point so that that's crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you could be you could certainly write language that would protect them against the stuff they don't want without being so blanket  So there were and I just be pure and I suspect what they'll do is though  You know every company does this the default is yeah  You can't do that and then and then if push comes to shove  All right. All right, we can write this in such a way that everybody's gonna be happy that that will protect our  our network from crazy people and  Crazy people and but still give you because you're right. There's a real advantage to  Fostering the idea of everybody putting stuff out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Google will learn more about the process. Yeah, they say we'll learn more about the process. We're all happy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, well they can rewrite their terms of service we ask you to do that, please Google. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we asked you to do that. I want to phone as soon as possible  I want to know when the heck the Nexus 7 is coming out with the LTE  And then finally my friend Dan Gilmore email me today and said ooh, they're offering  Further invitations to get one on Google glass and he wanted my invitation and I don't have one Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they said that they're gonna give some explorers  Invitations like for a second person either. Yeah, but I think that that hasn't happened, but they're coming to that point  So get Gilmore actually said give me one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like he actually asked for yeah, he asked for one of your your invitations. He's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I give Dan a pass because he wrote a very very  Strong commentary on the Guardian that I really supported yesterday  About why the Bradley Manning verdict is still bad news for the press  It is awful news and he was very outspoken and I think made a very strong case Dan used to work at the San Jose Mercury  News decided to foster citizen journalism and has really been a good voice out there  He called the Obama administration the most secretive  Administration of our time and I think I'd agree with that  And they're really where he's he quoted Jeremy Scahill saying we're in a moment when journalism is being criminalized  Yes, and I agree with that and is it is something to really pay attention to  Why why does our federal government believe that it needs to crack down on?  Investigative journalism. This is the government that is serving us that is elected by us to serve us  This is our government. It is our right to know what they're doing. They're working more and more in secrecy and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still charged under the Espionage Act. They call sharing information wanton publishing  They call taking the government's own information, which is the information of the people stealing it  These are these are all very dangerous things and at a time when we now know thanks to Edward Snowden  The depth of the overreach the government is making the need for having watchdogs and whistleblowers being so great  For the government to crack down to this level is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tyrannical he says and this is I agree with this 100% the Obama administration's war on leaks and by extension the work of investigative  Reporters who dare to challenge the most secretive government in our lifetimes has been unrelenting  Obama has charged more reporters and more people with violations of the Espionage Act  Than any president that all the presidents all combined combined

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I may Leo to do a little plug here on some folks tweeted me and I saw this and it's a last-minute thing  But if you go to 1984 day comm you'll find that there is a  series across the country of  Protests against the NSA this Sunday good you'll find the times now the Germans beat us to this  Under the hashtag stop watching us. They had demonstrations in 39 German cities the other day  And it's shocking that we have  Not the reaction here that they have there, but at least these folks are organizing this and I think it's important  I did I think did on on security now. Did you go through the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guardians revelations today that we did point yeah, why don't you why don't you talk a little bit about this well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's a it's called a number for the new one X  X know what what's it called? I can't remember let me look at there. It's there. It's there. It's on the it's on the rundown  I'm ex key score X key score and the and so the Guardian revealed Glenn Greenwald from Snowden  Revealed the PowerPoint that trained people in this and what this shows pretty clearly is how right Steve was  Well what was happening because this is not about direct connections to servers. This is about them having everything we do  this is about them having a  cash of three to four days of every HTTB request there is and  and that then becomes searchable by any bozo working for booze Allen and  The standard of saying oh, we think it's a foreigner. Okay. Go ahead  is is minor and  But what's shocking is the amount of information they have about us and it's stored in servers around the world  Which I wonder if that's not a violation of  various laws and within there in the language of it. There's just all kinds of  Scary stuff about what they know and what they can do  And and again this can't come from just saying it's not like they just have access to  One thing that the direct connection to the servers issue is not here at all  This is about this is the fruit of them having a direct link into the raw feed of the internet and there and there and they've  Got the metadata there and so you can do a search and find me  Things that are written in German in coming out of Iran  Spreadsheets that have Mac numbers in them that da da da da da  Anomalies of  VPN connections that are opened are these circumstances and they were concerned that so much activity on the internet was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically anonymous anonymous. So they said well, alright  Then we don't really have to have an email account or anything attached to the activity. We'll just collect it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So you know who you are. We don't need to know that we're gonna we're gonna find out  Anyway, then we can go back if we know that then that's what they say. Ah, ha we know enough  We know what's happening to this IP address. Let's go to Google and and and with a warrant and get that out of  But it's it's really sobering stuff. I think it's a bombshell  And you know the government's not gonna be happy about it  And by the way, I should say in full disclosure that I'm now back advising the Guardian good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kudos to the guy, you know when you look at these these are these slides are training slides  For it might as well be a video at McDonald's  Yes for oh flip the burger by the way  Just remember that the X key score parses out everything it thinks is an email address. So don't be fooled by mishits you my  it's like  Any idiot can be trained to use this and apparently they are training idiots to use it  And as Snowden said that means they can in real time monitor anybody from the president of the United States on down and man  if I'm a member of Congress and I read this I should I would be quaking in my boots because if  You're a member of the so-called loyal opposition  How long before they start looking at what you're up to? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, if you passed this bill  you gave them permission to look at all your emails all your phone calls everything you're doing and  And how long do you think before?  Administration decides that a that congressman is not on our side

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We better keep an eye on him or that journalist or the connection or somebody trying to call the journalist  There's the number of ways you can talk to a journalist now are greatly reduced  They hold a rolling buffer of approximately three days of all unfiltered data all  store fraud taken from the collection side the collection sites  We now know are places where they tap right into the net Facebook Microsoft  Google Yahoo massive distributed Linux cluster over 500 servers distributed around the world  The system can scale linearly simply by adding a new server to the cluster  My favorite part was they have a map of where the servers are and there's a whole line of them across Antarctica  I said what the hell's that and somebody in Twitter speculated that those are servers in classified locations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's our Internet Explorer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's probably secure it's probably ie6

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is for 2012 so they have each but they're saying they explain why should you be interested in HTTP?  Because most people do most of what they do with HTTP. You should know what they do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So X key score connects unique data beyond user activity from front-end full-take feeds front-end  Full take feeds in other words we scoop it all up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do I tell a terrorist that has no connection to known strong selectors answer look for anomalous events?  EG someone whose language is out of place for the region  They are in someone who's using encryption someone searching the web for suspicious stuff now what this means all of us  When they went back to the earliest  NSA warrantless wiretapping, you know, I argued the time and this is still born out now  But what they were really looking for was a baseline so they could look for anomalies, right?  And the anomalies are the things that you thought might make you safe like oh, let me get a let me get a burner phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anomaly now they do say in this article that they claim they've caught 300 terrorists using this technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but at the same time Leo at the same time today before I before I hear it in Congress  Clapper from the the DCI  released or  unclassified some documents about the the phone record collection and  And the stories about that they were first they know we caught lots of terrorists and then basically they got down to essentially like  One case where it was at all directly related to this what they're saying constantly is no no  It's the whole picture all this stuff together. We're catching lots of terrorists. We're stopping lots of plots  But there's no accountability here at all. It says well show me that go. Well, we can't we can't even tell you who the enemy is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and and you combine that with the unprecedented attacks on journalists by the Obama administration  I think we know who the enemy could very well be very soon  and out of  That's chilling

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now there's one other thing to mention and I forget who was said  By the way, there are some blacked out slides here. You really want to know those are I think those are about you know  What they caught there's reference to tau here  Fingerprints from tau are loaded in X key scores application fingerprint ID engine and tau has been something that's been very secretive  Involving the Chinese and watching servers and that kind of stuff  But they talk about show me all the exploitable machines and country acts like explain that to me Leo  What does an exploitable machine does that mean one that we have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, almost all machines are exploitable  Because it means take you can we can take control of that machine using a variety of malware attacks or other systems

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that says that we have a lot of machines that we have put the stuff on it doesn't say exploited. It says exploitable. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I don't know I would say most machines are exploitable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well operating systems with known exploits that could get them as far as they go, right?  Right. So probing just what what versions how how patched it is and then is this exploitable or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good. You have those ready just in case you need them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really interesting I had a future slide this again was this this presentation was in 2012  High speeds better presentation they need that entity extraction  So that you know, it's gonna get us the system is gonna get smarter. It's gonna know entities  It's gonna know places and people and things VoIP  Yeah, so they're bragging that they're gonna be able to do all this with a VoIP and so on so I you know enough on the on  The dystopian view of the world today  But I but I just wanted to I'm glad we talked about this to bring it up because it's it's scary and important stuff  Well, and we know a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know a number of programmers have been approached by the federal government to design systems  Like this really? Oh, yeah  And you know technology is really taking huge leaps and strides  And if you're if your goal is to get better at sifting through vast amounts of data  To find things then you're in your boy  You're right on the curve because big data is huge right now and a lot of people are experts in this  and  I got a I got a figure that the NSA and others in the federal government have access to some of the best programmers in the  world and that doesn't surprise me that they'd have these capabilities and expect them to get better and better rapidly  In my field, you know, we have constant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ridiculous circle jerk discussions about about ethics and what's right and wrong, but it's it's a good thing. We should do that  I'm not don't work people. I'm a journalism professor. It's okay. I like doing that  But but we have a lot of talk about the codes that we have in this field and we're constantly adjusting them and figuring them out  Is there that kind of discussion in your world of developers?  Is it is it mature enough yet to say hold on folks we need a field of developer ethics. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely think that that we could have that and we should have that and I don't think that the conversation happens very much  In fact, my my co-founder Anil dash a food camp a couple of years ago did a session  Where he's basically like, okay the software that we hate, you know Facebook or whatever  You know bring up some examples of things gone gone wrong  We have to take responsibility for that  If you you know, if you build something that's being misused for whatever reason like that's that's on you and we have to take responsibility  For the way that we decide to spend our time even if a big company is paying us in order to do that  And and it's funny. We had this this talk and there were a couple like stricken faces in the room  This talk and there were a couple like stricken faces in the room  You know, it's easy for nerds who get paid very well very very smart and who are very taken with the challenge  You know as particularly a very complex challenge like like big data  You know that that big data presents to sort of separate yourself from how you know the morality and the ethics of it, right?  So I think it's discussion that needs to happen more. I don't think it happens very much  I'm an eel and I talk about it a lot and I think more developers and more product designers in general should talk about it  I mean, you know, there's just been the conversation going on about you know, Silicon Valley startup startups making products that are targeted toward  young rich Silicon Valley  Startup people right and like, you know should should people be spending their time and talent resources  in particular in the venture capital community as well funding things that that are meaningful and ethical and makes sense and try to make the  world a better place versus  Making another uber or yet another dry cleaning delivery service or whatever  So I'm happy when I start to see those discussions happen a little bit more  But I think I think it could happen more and I think it would be useful for it  Certainly not the level that journalists have these discussions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, but issues these days too, so we have you know native advertising and and sponsored content and all this stuff and  You know the issues of publications  trying to fool readers by presenting things  Advertiser content paid content as if it's as if it's their content and affecting their brands and then the separate  Discussion that we have about individual journalists because a lot of journalists now probably we graduate from here and need work  They're taking media skills with them and those are skills that they could use  To the end of journalism or to the end of PR or advertising when I was it when I was in young pup  In the industry basically if you left to go to PR, it's like you married a boy and you were dead to us  Yeah, you still feel that way by the way you were you were you you had shown yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you've gone over to the dark side to modernize the reference  Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's not true now in the field and I had a discussion with my students about about ethics of native advertising and all that  And and I realized when I had that discussion I did it way too late in the term and I should have done it earlier  in fact, I was being I  was being observed that week because I I was going through the process of getting promoted to full professor and  That was the week so was in there and I'm thinking oh my god  We're they gonna think I turn out all these students who don't have the you know  The core ethics that we have that we supposedly instill and it required  It's a more difficult thing now because the lines are fuzzier. So if I'm seeing that in a very mature  field like mine  It strikes me that there's and Tim Berners-Lee talks about the need for web studies as a field of  Academic pursuit a good idea. Yeah, I think it is but I think part of that is  Technology ethics ethics. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you you know, I hate to leave people with a bad taste and a feeling of helplessness  So please there is a way you can do something about this as Jeff mentioned  Protests are going to be occurring August 4th  Sunday the rally against unconstitutional surveillance you could find out more at 1984 day comm  I think the more people who peacefully  Protest this the more members of Congress will sit up and take notice  The other thing you can do and you can do right now is go to EFF org  Contribute email they have information on how you can write to call and otherwise contact your member of Congress  I think that's a good place to focus and certainly support EFF. I do financially every single  Month and I'm a sustaining subscriber. It really is a great organization. They do a lot of good for all of us  EFF org and 1984 day comm  Gosh I hate to  Anything else before we go to our tips and tools and numbers are so much so much news  But I think that was a very important topic. So I'm glad you brought it up Jeff  Oh, I was bringing bring it down. All right. That's why well, you know, it's a good it's a really good  It's a really good topic. Oh, how about this one? Hey, this is nice. Samsung apparently has been caught  fudging the numbers  This is an old long-term  This is an old long-standing trick. I can remember back to the days of zD labs  Companies would do this all the time  once you've designed a synthetic benchmark to test the speed of devices the very first thing companies start doing is looking for the benchmark and  Then my then changing behavior in this case  Overclocking the processor when the benchmark is running an antek discovered this they were going through the data on  some benchmarks of the  Octa core the Exynos that's the international version of the galaxy s4 happens to be the one I have and  They discovered multiple benchmarks that run those devices at higher CPU and GPU clock speeds than they normally run  Samsung apparently said ah you're running the benchmark  Let me just turn up the speed Samsung's response says no  that's what the GS for does it runs at a higher clock speed on full-screen apps and  Benchmarking apps just fall into that category  Of course the code was called or the program was called benchmark booster. That's kind of a giveaway  Benchmark booster, maybe they should have named it something a little different. I don't know  They say that benchmark apps may in fact run at higher clock speeds in some games, but that's  It's just how it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just how they operate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a shame if Samsung is doing that there, but it's something it's a long-standing tradition. I can remember for many years  Companies doing that in the PC market  And you know you get caught it's very hard to do that and not get caught and thanks to the smart  Super smart guys at a non-tech they are the best. Yeah, it's a great site. They caught it right away, so  Stop that  But you know bench there's lies damn lies and there's benchmarks. There's no reason to believe benchmarks  It's really how it feels in your hand. That's what really matters, right?  on the list I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am you I'm interested in UPS is going to test 3d printing in stores the  United parcel service  United parcel service yeah, so your UPS store will have 3d printing there. How is that interesting teleportation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is really interesting. Oh, yeah, you could send somebody a 3d model you could send somebody a thing yeah Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really is that the point? I mean right that's got that's that's gotta be it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's that part you need a part is a part you needed exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean as much as I love you. I love the maker bot. I just it's still it's like three grand or whatever  I just you know for everyone to have a 3d printer is  You know we're not there yet, so it makes sense that UPS or a UPS store would do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm great. It's the last store in the other wheel that is so funny beginning in the San Diego area

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm gonna send you something. I'm gonna send you something gene as soon as they're open  You don't mind wearing a plastic hat do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want something something to the twit logo something that would be really fun. You never see the phrase beginning in the San Diego area

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody for UPS wants to take some good business trips web 6825 wants Jeff to 3d you a cronut

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now what they need is a scanner in the other UPS store, so you could put a cronut in there  It scans it sends it to San Diego and then makes it yeah, yeah teleportation  We're getting close the futures almost here  How exciting  Let's see  You tried whip yet. You know boy Brett got a lot of attention  That just shows you how much love and respect in the community there is for Brett Taylor  He was the worked at Google on Maps then left and did Fred feed which is awesome  Went to Facebook, right? Yep, we're sitting. Oh, I was CTO of Facebook retired and  His new startup is quip which seems to me completely dumb, but that's just me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice things about him. Yep all the rug out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I do think nice of him and I think one of the reasons they're getting so much press is cuz everybody loves Brett Taylor  So the idea of this is it is a mobile first word processor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's interesting that we're seeing this Renaissance and like writing tools, right?  There's like medium and quip and you see some you're seeing some new blogging tools ghost and Octopress  I think I think the point is like that writing is still too hard and in a mobile first world  I actually haven't tried quip so I'm not I'm not sure but this morning on on in beta which was shown five by five  I interviewed the founder of of draft draft in dot-com of draft really cool  Markdown based word pro, you know WordPress. I shouldn't call it a word processing habits. It's it's it's a it's a really beautiful compose  Experience a really easy way to write and it gives you github like pull requests so you can collaborate  So if I write a draft I can send it to you Leo and say hey  What do you think and you can make some changes and send a pull request to me and then I could accept changes one by one  It's way better than Microsoft words  Track changes and it exports to Dropbox and it you know  Supports markdown just a really modern web app and it made me realize like yeah, you know this whole writing thing hasn't been solved yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

I know I  Know I don't really know what it's for, you know occasionally we'll work on press releases, right?  There's some collaboration involved, but the collaboration tools that exist now are pretty good on desktop  You can write it up in Microsoft Office for instance and then have the revisions back and forth  There's excellent like really good sub-etha edit for instance on the Mac which allows us to work simultaneously  Google Docs does that now?  So on the desktop this this is well solved old time old school  And you're he's right. It's not on mobile, but there's a reason who wants to create documents on mobile
