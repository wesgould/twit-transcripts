What a typical excuse for Jeff  Traveling  Whatever, but as you hear Stacy Higginbotham is joining us today. Welcome Stacy  Hello, it's good to talk with you again. Good to see you. I saw you in person not too long ago  That was that was awesome  It's always kind of an interesting experience to kind of break the internet wall and  Finally meet face to face with people that you've been talking to you for so long. So and my first words were oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're so tall

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a pretty standard first word that I hear from people  That I meet after after doing all of these shows, but it was great to talk with you. Also Matthew Ingram  Now with the Columbia Journalism Review, how's it going Matthew? Yes. Good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's brand new so I'm still getting used to it got my Columbia student card

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I get to use the library and stuff now you get to shop at the bookstore. Yeah, and yeah get some sweaters maybe  But ease good. That's that's obviously the biggest perk. That's that's the reason that you took the job is so that you can shop at the  gift shop  Well right on so what exactly what would you say explain your your beat a little bit as far as Columbia Journalism Review is concerned

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I guess my focus is I'm the chief digital writer  So but my focus is mostly on  The power of the platforms as it turns out of which Google is one. Yeah Google Facebook Twitter Instagram Snapchat  Just the the disruption that they're causing for journalism and the media both  economically and sort of  socially if you will or politically  And how that how media companies should be thinking about that and and how they should be dealing with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right on. Well, congratulations on that. I know that was pretty pretty recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Last couple of months. Yeah, November 1 actually my first day  I took the train to Washington and sat through eight hours of congressional hearings. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fantastic. Welcome  Welcome to your new digs  No, it's awesome big big congratulations to you  And obviously for this show, I mean that's a lot of what what we talked about on this week in Google  and I was looking through the Google News this week as we were kind of putting things together Carson  I have a list of things and I feel like this is maybe a light Google Newsweek  But I think we've got enough in here  We've got plenty of other other topics that we can dive into starting with probably the most important news of the week  No doubt people are very excited about the fact that the hamburger emoji is now  Correct. We're at the right way around the cheese is no longer on the bun. It's now on the burger. We can all sleep at night

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's not let's not deny. This is a crucial  even global issue like  I for one I'm glad that this has been dealt with because it's been hanging over us for low these many days

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many hamburger emojis have you been putting out there they've been or is it just that they've been being sent to you because I  Don't know if I haven't used a hamburger emoji. I actually had neither

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like to eat them but the emoji I don't feel that strongly about but I have to admit I got into the  Discussion over what is the appropriate order for?  The lettuce the tomato the cheese etc. People feel very passionately about this topic. They really do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean it looks fine either way  No  From off the microphone, I mean it's still cheese in this in a hamburger, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we rehashing this now? We don't need to rehash it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, we don't really need to  Sorry, I didn't mean to take it there. Although I do want to point out  Another part of this emoji gate if you if it does qualify as a gate is this whole beer thing  Which I hadn't noticed but once I noticed the correction that they made to the beer emoji  I realized like what were they thinking?  How do you have foam on the top of a beer Stein a beer mug with no beer up to the top of the air point?  I mean, how do you do that? It looks like a hat like a like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, a raccoon hat or something really worth what this says to me is that Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe doesn't invest a lot in its emojis. Yeah, like maybe they've got better things to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe of their many messaging platforms. They still are kind of like yeah, let's work on those instead

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's fix things that are broken instead of fix little pictures that were drawn by somebody  Although if I remember correctly Sundar Pichai did say when all this was kind of hitting the fan  This was gonna be high priority that he was gonna make a change any any held to it. They were gonna get on it  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so well just imagine if it was beer and  burgers imagine all the other emojis that that  I seem to be frozen for some reason  I'm actually moving my lips, but the beer and  What else what other emojis are they ignoring? That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, what have we not discovered yet and their gift emojis are on point  Okay, so I'm pro those, you know, I have never used an eggplant emoji, but that seems to be a popular one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What about the dumpling emoji? Has anybody looked at the dumpling emoji? So that's brand new  So Jenny Lee who's a friend who used to work at the New York Times wrote about emojis and actually  pursued a personal quest to get the International Emoji Federation or whatever it is to add the dumpling and  and succeeded so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good for her man. Apple's dumpling emoji looks just like a photograph or something that they are  Microsoft's is terrible. Of course  Wow, that's a lot of I didn't realize there was so much variation in how you could do a dumpling

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then I also didn't realize the same about a hamburger. So were you not aware that there was a dumpling emoji because I wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't no, you know  Honestly, I'm super well this about emoji  I rarely ever use it unless it's like placed in front of me and super obvious like I never go hunting like I see  People's emoji language, you know filled  Posts on Twitter or whatever and I'm kind of amazed that they took the time to do that  I just want to like, you know, I don't go I know it's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You go ahead Steve. Oh, I was gonna say Google will auto suggest things as  Emojis when you're typing so I get a lot of emoji exposure that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  maybe it's just because I have teenagers and 20 somethings, but I  mean emojis are are funny, but there are  there are people I know and  related to who they conduct entire conversations in emojis or the emojis are a  Significant part of the conversation. Yeah, and it's it's interesting to me as a as a sort of student of language  How how much you can convey?  with teeny tiny little cartoon  Figures and I know when we used to use slack  Stacey and I at way back in the gig home days, which I think was a hundred years ago  It was amazing how much you could convey was just as a single emoji where it would take you  You know sentences to kind of get across what you were  It's it's just interesting to me that they're very emotionally  Laden but but so simple and obviously dumplings don't actually mean that much they just mean dumplings but  You know, you can get across if you ever looked at shares tweets  Sometimes I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to understand what she's saying because it's literally all emojis

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I don't know if it's only emojis. I mean share shares lived a hard life. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  True and she conveys emotion in lots of ways obviously  But I just find it fascinating that I thought they were dumb and I wished I thought they were a sign of the  Dumbing down of society in general and my kids in particular, but I think they they actually do convey  Things that are hard to convey in words. So yeah, they also soften things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use emojis a lot of times as a as  Yeah to add emotion and I think you know people mock it as being a preteen girl thing and I have a preteen girl  And she definitely uses emojis and stickers. Oh my god the stickers. Yes, but I  Actually think it's it's useful and fun  And so and who doesn't like getting like the little sparkly champagne plus the fireworks plus everything when they like it something  That's way that's way better than like yay. Good job

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know the burger fixing the burger is great, but what I wish as an old person  Someone would do is is figure out a way to incorporate a magnifying glass  To figure out because sometimes I will see emojis and I literally have no idea what they are  Like I so there there's so much going on in the emoji like a burger. I can figure out obviously but  Some of them I'm squinting at them. I don't know what it is. Am I supposed to be happy about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like you're creating a language with different like with some cover some of my emojis mean something and with other people my emojis mean totally different thing  So it's kind of like whoa as a student translate

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like you needed two times magnification button exactly two times. Yeah, and then you need a click to translate. Oh, yeah  That shouldn't be that hard right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That should be really easy actually doesn't each like emoji like I know I've seen texts where they strip out the emoji  But they replace it with a description of what the emoji actually is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can translate well, you know, they can probably translate emojis I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would say no because not everything correlates exactly to what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  True. Yeah, but in a couple of hundred years when emoji is an official language  That people live and exist there, you know in their lives  100% of the time this is gonna be a you know, do the research now  We need to figure this out now because it's important for the future generations for society. Absolutely  These are not these are these are not, you know petty topics here. I'm like I'm so old school  I still do the the emoticons. I  It's habit. It's total habit to do the colon  parentheses

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Question the smile smiley face  Yeah, do you do a do you do a colon and then a period and then the bracket or just a colon and the bracket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I thought you were gonna ask do you do the bracket and then the colon which is the like opposite way?  But no, I do the I do the colon and then the bracket. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As my daughter told me that I'm she made fun of me because I make the smiley face with a nose  That's like it's like I'm from the the 16th century or something it's like you use the Oxford comma in a text  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, I probably so now I just use a debugger. I probably do that too. Actually. Dang it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dang it. I need to get with the times

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I have good news, but it's not on the emoji front cool take it away  All right, as you guys know, I have a pixel little little pixel  I want to call it the pixel mini but I won't  And I had clicking and I updated it and lo and behold the update came through yesterday  The clicking has stopped  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was clicking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry. I missed that. Yeah. No, no there was clicking and I had heard some reports of this  So explain the clicking issue because I have not experienced this with my to excel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it was a so it's only it was only the small one  The is that the pixel to buzzing it's so  So it was clicking and it was a radio issue was the NFC radio so the solution Google gave me  Originally was well turning the NFC off and wait for your update. It's a great and I was like  Can you just push me the update now and they were like no  No, we cannot do so. I did get the update. I've now turned the NFC back on so I can use payments  It's very exciting  But sweet  So that was it a lot of people had this issue  Some people actually got new phones, but most people just are waiting for the update

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right before Google knew what to do with it. They were probably now. I guess so we got to give you a replacement  Then they realized hey, we can probably fix that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was really irritating because it was on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Burnin did you get any birds? That's the to excel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because there's the two different sizes by two different manufacturers, even though they're both released by with Google's name  It's two different problems two different entire sets of problems on both sides. Yeah  Yeah, and then we also have the story of  Random reboots that are apparently happening some pixel 2 devices in this case  Apparently the issue might have something to do with the LTE modem  Some users on reddit were pointing that this seemed to happen when they were connected to a low signal  LTE connection and that the modem might be causing a kernel panic of some sort when it's an LTE modem  Those are the best kernel panics are the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your kernel panics

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds dangerous I have kernel panics existential kernel panic that is true that's that's a that's a given in today's day and age

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  thought of you Stacey, I  was watching  mr. Robot and  they hacked into someone's house and  Turned the heat down and made the lights flash and made the alarm go off and I forget what else they did and I thought of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that that has happened in my house. They made a blender go off a door unlock. That's what they that's when they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is when they hacked my house the best part, but the best part was they you had to  Weaken your password deliberately so they could hack your house because they actually couldn't hack it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the best part. That was the best part TV journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's pretend we hacked your house in a magical world where your house actually gets hacked by somebody. Yeah  I mean so Matthew do you have the the pixel 2 or the 2xl? Are you on the picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am embarrassed to say that I do not you know the first generation or what phone do you have? I  Have a Samsung Galaxy s7  with a cracked screen Oh  Yeah, so I'm I'm kind of a hobo when it comes to phones as compared to you guys  I don't have the latest every time I come on, you know  Leo has bought five of whatever the new phone is and and I'm and he's like, how's your phone? I'm like, I'm fine  I'm still with them  So I feel like I'm you know in a different century, but I would love the pixel  I just haven't been able to convince my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chief financial officer to let me buy one. I would say there's no shame whatsoever in holding onto your phone  Sometimes I wish that my life was a little simpler when it comes to homes because yeah, because you're right  We're constantly getting new phones is kind of part of what we do here play play with phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, so do I amen or I go swimming which is my other favorite thing to do and  So I think my wife is pretty much just wants me to have whatever phone was popular five years ago  Because then when I drop it, it's not as big a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't remember yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The real question for you Matthew is are you on mastodon because as a social media reporter  I would expire a platformer. I am on mastodon

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is a great name, which is a great name for a bunch of reasons. It's the name of a heavy metal band  Yes, it is. I think it's where it came from but it's also just a great name mastodon. It's  If there was social media, you know in the ice age, I think mastodon would have been a great a great name  I am on there, but I don't  Do a lot. I am interested in it though. It's I mean, I've tried them all I remember to remember app net  Yeah, oh, yes that one I actually thought had some potential  But it just never never really took off mastodon is interesting because it's distributed  You can run your own mastodon server if you want or you can join one that someone else is already running  So it's it's sort of federated in a way, which I think is interesting but  You know, the biggest problem is the same one with every service the network effects that keep you on Twitter are  Almost impossible. They create a  Emote that's almost impossible to cross so one or two people, you know might go on mastodon  But even they're probably still spending most of their time on Twitter because that's where everyone is  That's where everyone moans about how much they hate Twitter so it's  But everybody stays there. Yeah, it's a totally dysfunctional  Environment and yet it's the people there are what make it useful  And that's that was reinforced for me when Twitter first started having problems way back when  We kept going down all the time and everybody would jump back on Twitter as soon as it was up and bitch about how it went down  They never left right? You know the Twitter community  Twitter could have been put together with you know, bungee cords and gum and and twine and whatever and probably was for all I know  But people just kept using it  Even while they were moaning about it and that that was a sign of how strongly they felt about it and how strongly they were tied to it  I don't know how something like mastodon. How do you get?  Get beyond that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Had not heard a mess around before this is interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wondered I wondered when I saw you go straight to the computer. You're like what I was like, I know mastodon the band

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know the band but I've never heard of a social network

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's sort of Loki  It's a and it's it's it's almost a straight not a clone but  You know, it's very if you're familiar with Twitter looks easy to figure out how it works. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting with these social networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know that have been around but it really does feel like you're talking about that moat is so  Uncrossable at this point when you're talking about Facebook you're talking about Twitter  it really makes very little room for anyone to come in and  Expect that they can command enough and yeah enough crossover from anyone that anyone's going to pull all of their contacts  Over there. I mean there will be outlying cases  But by and large as a social network you need to continue growing and that's just hard to do in this day and age  We kind of have the means the work now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  And the barriers to entry are like you said you have to find all the people who you followed on Twitter and follow them on  Mastodon I'm frozen again. I  Blame my network provider, but then lots of people are just not gonna do that. Yeah, it's so  So you might get the odd nerdy friend who will go and use something new but you can't reproduce that social graph  That that brings all the power to that network and so no matter how bad  Facebook and Twitter are you're gonna keep using them and Instagram probably because you've built up this huge  It actually reminds me of a friend who used to play  World of Warcraft I think still does and he got married and had a few kids and he thought I should probably stop  playing World of Warcraft for three hours every night and  Then he told me I found that he was back on World of Warcraft and he said I couldn't stop  I spent literally tens of thousands of hours creating my character and building this network of  Friends and you know other players. I he said I couldn't quit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  Can't quit you Facebook. I can't quit you World of Warcraft  So I feel about Facebook. I'm now what am I what is it?  I'm almost a year off of Facebook  Although I did I did go on there a couple of weeks ago first login in almost a year  But that was just to post one thing and then get right out. I didn't read any comments  I didn't want to get sucked into the Facebook universe  I don't know if my life has improved  But did you quit?  Well this time last year  I think we were starting to hear a lot about kind of how Facebook was was being you know  Potentially used to influence a lot of people, you know  Their thought the stories that were being presented to them how Facebook was, you know  Its algorithms were kind of architecting what you see and I started to really kind of consider Wow  You know in a world is very uncertain right now  This is like the the best propaganda platform that there is  Because because of the way it's set up and I just I didn't want to be  Facing that that the kind of weird aspect of that though is that I stayed on Twitter and it's not like Twitter's any better  But I felt really weirded out by Zuckerberg's  Response about the election and being like well, I think that's really crazy  I can't remember is his direct quote when I heard him say that  It was a crazy idea when I heard that I just thought that was so  So wrong for someone with that much influence and control over that company to say something so irresponsible  That was so obviously not true  And I thought if you're thinking and saying that in the public then you really don't care about the influence  I think history has kind of shown at least over the past  Many months that Zuckerberg is at least to some degree come around and started to really take it seriously  But then at that moment I thought wow, that's really irresponsible. I don't want to be a part of it. I think definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Congressional hearings will get your attention in that way  So I think that's helped kind of convince him that it's an important problem. Yeah, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I don't know if I end up I don't know it's it's hard because I've been away for a year now  And I'm like, okay  So it was difficult in the beginning because that's where all my friends and my fan  You know if I have any family extended family that's online and involved in anything, they're probably involved in Facebook  So it's a good way to really kind of keep people in the know of my life and follow them  But I also just you feel left it  Not at this point. I did in the beginning

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did in the beginning my daughter my my 19 year old daughter quit  Deleted her account and she went I think almost a year  and then she got back on and I said why and she said I I  Was missing things like I didn't know what was happening with people  Yeah, you know family members like who was getting married or who had a baby or and then the baby photos show up there and then  People say oh, did you see the baby photos and you're like what baby?  Exactly hey congratulations. Yeah  So you miss like she was definitely philosophically opposed  But but she just got pulled back in because everybody kept saying did you see this or did you hear from so-and-so or did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I just confess that I have not and then I move on but I'm also kind of a misanthropic individual  So I'm like, yeah, who cares? It's just a baby  It's just a baby  No, well I say it I said it when I had a baby I'm like, yeah, it's just a baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just a baby. They just haven't been having baby for thousands of years exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know when they do something interesting. Yes. I care about my baby a lot more than you probably do. I'm very excited

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't expect that you are equally excited. Hey babies are like opinions. Everybody thinks theirs is the best. It's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so true  Yeah, I don't know I I did kind of recently get back into the Instagram thing because everybody was telling me well  If you don't like Facebook, but you still want to see what people are up to  Instagram is great because then it kind of removes true like another part of Facebook that I never really cared about was that it seems  Like such an open inviting place to share your opinions and people do it all the time  But then when you do the way it amplifies that message across the network  Suddenly you're getting into these heated conversations with people you don't know and that doesn't make me feel good  So then it makes me not want to share my opinions at all because it's just the headache and sorrow is not worth it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yet I'm on Twitter. I don't even know which is a hundred times worse for that  But I can you get dragged into someone's I was just talking to someone yesterday and they said yeah  I finally gave up I found I was in a heated debate with someone named. I think it was jalapeno poop  She said I thought to myself  What am I doing? What am I doing with my life?  I was gonna say time to reevaluate your life

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His name is jalapeno poop and they spilled jalapeno rot so you know what I do feel like there's a little bit of a difference  Though on Twitter, I feel like I can be a little bit more passive in that regard now  I don't really share a whole lot of very  Divisive, you know opinions on on modern modern topics  Things that are really bubbling up to the surface right now  Because I know the reaction that it could get and it's just don't I don't have that room in my life for it  But Twitter feels a little bit like I can just be an observer and not get involved in it and still kind of learn things  From it and use it for what I want to whereas Facebook feels way more personal to me  Like because I'm on a network filled with friends and family  I feel like I can say these things without judgment  But then when I do people outside of that network still get pulled in somehow and then that enrages my friend is in family  Who then they go to battle, you know with each other and they all line up and it's a war of words  And I just don't like being exposed to all of that. It just doesn't feel good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Social networks and ways and that is anathema to  Zuckerberger was for so long

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually there's a whole sociological sort of area of research that that looks at what's called the collapse of context  so you  you have these different networks whether it's family and work friends and personal friends and  People your friends with who are you know?  Trans or gay and then you have other friends who?  they would never those two groups would never mix and you'd speak in different ways with different people and you talk about different things and and  and  Social media often tends to just remove any sense of context. Yes, so  It's the thing you  You might say to someone in a bar after a couple of years as a joke or you know a sarcastic remark gets amplified  And distributed to like millions of people  It's just  It creates a whole different phenomenon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and not at all what you may have expected would happen when you dropped that seemingly  you know in  innocent comments at one point and now suddenly now suddenly it's a meme or so  Suddenly it's making you know  It's making the news for whatever reason because it ties into some greater sentiment or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well in social like Facebook is this to and Instagram a lot of it is is almost performance social performance  Yes, so you're performing for  your friends or people you a tribe that you want to belong to or group you want to impress and so you  in some cases people  Exaggerate their reaction because they want to  They're signaling to a group that they are part of that by attacking someone else

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely, I never do that obviously other people never I think we've all probably done that once or twice  with whether we realize it or not and  Yeah, I don't know the answers and I don't even know if Facebook is is necessarily the you know  The air quotes evil that I thought that it was a year ago when I stepped away  I just I just know that for my own quality of life  I needed to step away and honestly in retrospect. It was a really good thing  I became incredibly productive as a result of it and I can die can totally point to that switch as being the time  When I started to focus on things that I've been putting off for a long time  The alternative to that was me sitting on the couch for hours at the end of my day  I've got a couple of hours I could watch something I could read something instead  I'm gonna scroll and this Lee eyes wide open at this Facebook feed and just get angry or get like just feel bad and  That didn't seem like a good use of my time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So are you gonna get rid of your Netflix subscription next in your quest for productivity? Well, no, probably not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some really good stuff on Netflix Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not advocating it. I'm like, how far are you gonna take this? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know how far I take it. Sometimes I told somebody yesterday that Twitter for me is like television like a lot of people watch  garbage TV shows because they're funny, you know, they watch the biggest loser  I don't want to name shows because people probably love them  But everyone has some and or they watch Dancing with the Stars or you know  America's got weirdos or whatever show they love and and for me it's you know, Twitter is that and  The only problem is the show seems to be  Going to a dark place a lot  and so I've actually started questioning whether that's good for my kind of sanity to just  continually be subjected to the worst of  Humanity and in many cases that's coming from the president of the United States  So that's an that's also disturbing in a whole different way, but it's I am trying to limit it  You know, I try to stop but it pulls you back in it does every time you think you're out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter pulls me back in you need to follow more puppy and  Face and I do is in things and real scientists other accounts where you're like we're scrolling actually like oh delightful

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So true. I have a bunch actually that I followed just for that like they're like a palate cleanser, you know partway through

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My daughter will grab them because I'll show her the best ones and she's like  How come you haven't liked this more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With my daughter we I said are you following this one and they were all  you know humor accounts or just weird accounts or  Funny pictures and and we actually exchanged lists  So I found a whole bunch of new ones that and it isn't it's a it's a nice feeling you're starting to feel bad about  Your life in the world and then you see something funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah someone in chat who was it was a robot robot says my Twitter is nice your feed  Is what you make it and I know this I know that like if I really wanted to I could eliminate a lot of the  Stuff that like makes me upset or makes me not feel super happy about you know  About a life at this very moment in my Twitter feel but I but I refuse to remove people that I'm following  That post things like that because I also feel the need to be informed about what's going on  Not to be completely clueless and disconnected and that's a really difficult job

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I kind of have to be on there because it's a great source of news and I'm connected to all kinds of really smart people  Who share things that I would never find otherwise and that's a massive massive  benefit it just comes along with you know an ocean of of  self or and and it's it's hard sometimes to  to kind of push aside the  depressing or enraging stuff and and find the the jewels in their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep  Agreed well, that's a delightful. I'm happy we lifted lifted your spirits everyone  You're gonna take a nap after that discussion, and I'm gonna help you out  We're gonna thank the sponsor of today's episode and then get back to talking about Google this episode of this week  And Google is brought to you by Casper  Casper is a sleep brand that I'm sure you've heard of Casper. They continue to revolutionize  With all sorts of I mean their mattresses are amazing  We have Casper mattress in two of our three bedrooms  Keep meaning to swap out the third one and no kidding our daughter whose room has the non  Casper mattress never wants to sleep in a room. She always wants to sleep in the other two rooms  Partially because kids do that they want to sleep with their parents  But also because the other mattresses are way more comfortable and I know this because I've experienced her mattress  And it's not that comfortable by comparison as the online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost  Casper is revolutionizing the mattress industry by cutting the cost of dealing with  Resellers and showrooms and then they're passing that savings directly on to the consumer  Casper's mattress is an obsessively engineered mattress at a fair price Casper actually combines multiple  Supportive memory foams for sleep surface with just the right sink just the right bounce you're gonna notice it immediately  Also has a breathable design that sleeps cool to help you regulate your temperature throughout the night  Casper mattress provides long-lasting comfort and support and you can buy it super easy like anything else that you buy online  You just go online order it. It's completely risk-free  You know, like I said, I've had a Casper mattress now for a couple of years now love going to bed on the Casper mattress and  Yeah, we're gonna we're gonna be upgrading our third room as well to the Casper very soon Casper understands  probably the most important part of this is that  When you're trying out a mattress in like a sterile, you know mattress  Mattress store environment. You're not really getting the full picture you lay down on the mattress. Oh, yeah, this is great  That's what we did with our first daughters  Our oldest daughter's mattress when we bought it initially went in there laid down and all this feels really nice  But really, you know, you spend so much of your time on that mattress  You're only really gonna get a good idea of how that mattress actually is when you bring it into the home  You sleep on it you test it out over time and they don't really let you do that with this the mattresses that you purchase from  The store quite so easily Casper actually offers free delivery and painless returns within a 100 day period  So you don't have to lie down in the showroom  You can just bring in that mattress put it where it's going to exist and you know  Where's gonna be for forever because you're not gonna end up sending it back by it by the way  And you can sleep on it  You can test it out over time and see what you think and if you really have to return it  You got a hundred days, but you're not gonna do that  Casper mattress upholds the highest environmental product production standards made in the USA  Free shipping and returns to the US Canada and the UK and Casper recently introduced the Casper wave mattress  Which features a natural geometry support system and a new top layer for added comfort  Get a Casper mattress today.

There's got to be more Google stuff here  We kind of started to talk about it with the emoji  But I don't even think of that. I even mentioned that 8.1 on Android the beta anyways is rolling out  I think it's the final beta before the official release of 8.1 and one interesting feature of 8.1 that's coming  With that update now with this new update. Well, there's a few things the neural networks API is on there  And that's going to allow for better on-device  machine learning frameworks  Operations we've heard of tensorflow light on Android devices  so this is going to kind of take stuff that Google's been doing a lot in the cloud and  Power that on the device and you can think of some really interesting things that that opens the doors for one of those  I'll talk about in a second. But then another thing which is the pixel visual core, which is Google's very first  Processor that they developed that exists within the new pixel devices. So this is  Finally getting the chance to be activated and essentially what it's gonna when it's gonna allow for at least in the short term is for third-party developers  Who you know, let's say Instagram for example  I think I've heard of like Instagram and snapchat that the pictures that you take through those in-app cameras  Aren't as good as the pictures that you could take if you did it on your device in the standard camera app on a pixel  That's because they don't have the same access to the camera API that Google has  Granting to its own camera  Well, thanks to pixel visual core processing that Android camera API is now being shared to third parties  So basically, you know as long as developers do a little bit of work to provide that compatibility  All the pictures that you take depending on what app you're using are gonna look really nice  And who knows what else they're gonna use that dedicated chip for down the line  But I think it's I think it's cool that that Google's thinking about this kind of stuff moving moving some of that extra power  dedicated devoted to a certain thing onto the phone and  Maybe it you know  Maybe it provides a hint of of what their you know, what their direction is as they go forward with it with their devices  Certainly helps them to stand out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they kind of have to do this so I am I am a huge as you guys probably know and are sick of by now  I am a huge fan of  Semiconductors and this is a trend that Apple probably started way back in the day with their motion co-processor  I don't know if y'all remember that but the idea of offloading more dedicated tasks to a dedicated chip makes sense  and  Then for Google's perspective  Your hardware is becoming your differentiator on consumer devices once you achieve enough scale and everyone's following this Apple  vertically integrated model and  That makes a lot of sense it'll help this particular one doesn't help  But if Google can continue making its own silicon for things it could help with you know  ensuring security over a longer time period of ownership of the device for example, because they don't  They don't have to work so much around the device maker schedule  and  It also allows them to build really awesome features that are  Software but need certain kinds of hardware into the phone and give you something that another vendor can't provide so it makes a ton of sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree and it seems obvious. That's the way Google's going, you know  They want to control more of the hardware and it makes sense. I mean, I think that's smart for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I mean not only the the pixel visual core which has  Kind of a dedicated camera focus right now  I guess it's entirely possible that they tap into that for other reasons down the line  but I also am very intrigued maybe even a little more intrigued with the idea of  Bringing this this tensorflow light this artificial intelligence processing on to the device to pull it out of the cloud  I have been so excited about this Jason. Yeah, I mean this is like I we're talking about this a little bit on all about Android  But I'm curious to see what this results in over the course of the next couple of years because I feel like by and large  Phones at this point, you know, we've seen what we've seen and there've been little kind of eye-opening moments  We're like, oh wow, I didn't know a phone could do that  But it's really hard to surprise us nowadays where a lot of the really interesting stuff has been happening has been in artificial intelligence  But much as that has had to happen in the cloud a couple of years ago  You know the changes to Google Photos to process Auto Awesomes and stay, you know  Sequenced together photos to make a video and do do all these things that all happened in the cloud now  It's happening on the device. You don't have to send, you know, all of your stuff into the cloud  So maybe there's a security or privacy benefit there  But it results in things like like this story  Apparently some Google researchers plan to show off a new kind of new piece of research around  protection built  the option to  Use the front-facing camera to see if I can explain this properly use the front-facing camera to detect whether there are two sets  of eyes looking at the phone at once so say you're on the train and  You're checking your your phone your text messages or whatever. You don't want someone looking over your shoulder  Using artificial intelligence or the machine learning kind of capabilities on the device instead of having to send it up into the cloud  It can analyze the data that's coming in from the front-facing camera and detect that there is another set of eyeballs  That's actually pointed at the screen. I think if you skip like a third of the way into here  Carson or maybe a half of the way  It ends up showing a little bit of the interface  But and then once that happens see it cuts right back and it shows you the pass-through camera and says oh they're looking  You know hide the content and little things like this that I mean, this is this is just a one example  I don't know if this is necessarily, you know ready for prime time necessarily the way it is right now, but  I'm sure we'll see more interesting kind of uses of that AI and  That added smarts on the device to do new things that might actually wow us and surprise us again. At least I hope so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think this will be great. You're right. Although the privacy element here is key  So not sending like having my phone look at me all the time and yeah, you know sending that's scary  But when we think about what's happening the next big phase in computing  you know is contextual awareness and  Having our devices derive context and exchange that information and that all has to happen at what we like to call the edge  I don't know what else you want to call it  So you need like local processing for that and I think we're gonna see our phones become  like they are like the  Like they became the controller for the smart home and people were like this kind of sucks  But it's kind of cool and then voice change things  I think we're gonna come back to the phone being a hub to process contextual information  So like hey Stacey's in her car right now  I should only offer her certain options or you know not offer her other options  So that's and it will be learning how to do that and that's really awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think there's there's a huge amount of potential to do stuff like that like I notice you're driving  so I'll you know read out text instead of  Instead of making you pick up your phone  The problem is the more context you get the creepier it gets so the more your phone knows about you the more Google knows  About you where you are what you're doing what you look like who's standing behind you what speed you're going  You know there's I know there are people that are gonna get creeped out by it that the  Report I don't know if it was on the lineup, but that Google phones were basically collecting data about your location  Even if you had location turned off and I mean all they were doing was collecting the location of a nearby cell tower  Presumably to make it easier to show you  Things or to know where you are and that's and that's good like that being able to send you  Location-based things is good and and being able to reach you or whatever it was they were doing is good  But it requires things that are gonna make people uncomfortable I think

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yes, so apparently South Korean regulators are actually really kind of digging into the story that you're talking about  It's against the law there  Yeah, there and I mean 80% of the market there is on Android  And so when you consider and I think really around that that's like awareness from the consumer  Level is that when I turn off?  Location on you know that that location button in my settings on my Android phone  My expectation is that you're not doing anything with that location data anymore  Right and I think Google wasn't doing anything with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was kind of an accidental setting in to even when you turn off your location settings  Even when you turn off your location settings the physical hardware in the carrier know where you are  Yes, so it it makes sense that your operating system  Would also come into that data now. They shouldn't if they  The question then is should they be and what should they do with it?  They certainly shouldn't store it if you've turned off your location services because that's an implicit  Explicit kind of don't track me and Google wasn't storing it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Notification to improve notifications and message delivery. Yeah, they said don't know what that means, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and they didn't ultimately use it either. I don't remember right started or not. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no Google says the data was not stored on its servers and they don't do it anymore, but still right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yes, so that's that's something where I'm sure Google thought it was innocuous. Maybe they didn't even know that was happening  They didn't store it. No one's gonna pay any attention to those details  They're gonna think is Google's tracking me and my location when I told them not to yep, right and in the phone world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's obvious that you have to know where the phone is because that's how sure works work  So if you're if you're a technologist, you're like well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and so maybe people are comfortable with Verizon knowing so they can send a phone call but Google knowing I think is a different  Is a different animal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But inside Google I'm saying the people who worked on that I can surely see them thinking yeah, and you know, honestly, I  Would rather have Google in many cases have that information than Verizon or AT&T which have in the past  Given through the government that data cart like our Blanche access to it. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but that's how they find the killer on all those like mystery murder shows  They always triangulate triangulate the cell signal  Enhance we need that we need that so they can catch a serial killer every week. Yeah. Yeah for our entertainment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And kind of what you were talking about Stacy as far as  artificial intelligence  The power of that but also the privacy implications of having to send this Matthew  I think you were touching on this as well having to send that up to a server in order for it to happen that reminded me  Kind of I feel like we're ending we're we're ending up in a new phase with Google where they're realizing that too sure  They stand to benefit from having that information, but there is a public pushback  We heard about you know, Google clips, which is still on a waitlist. That was the AI  powered camera  That they announced during their pixel launch and that has artificial all of its artificial intelligence  Processing happening on the device. None of it hits the servers  I see Google potentially doing more of that on the phone as well  So that you can do some of these really interesting things without feeling like oh great in order to get this yet another  Really amazing feature. I had to send them even more  granular information about how I live my life and who I talk with instead  Hopefully, you know it stays on the device. It that at least makes the consumer happy  Makes the consumer happy  I don't know if that makes Google very happy because they stand to benefit from all that information

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but I mean the trade-offs like I when Google photos when I started using it  You know in a really intensive way like uploaded literally every photo I've ever taken in my entire life. Yeah, I  I instantly saw the benefits when I connected it to my to my Google account  Then I was able to search those photos for my kids for you know  The family cat for anything like any keyword. Yep, and it was mind-boggling  like this is the kind of stuff like Google Earth or or  That you you think we're living in the future. This is this is so  useful and so amazing and all I had to do was give Google access to all of my photos and now it knows what all  of my kids look like and  Where I live and presumably all sorts of other things and so but  And and that's and that concerns me, but I'm also amazed by how useful it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yep, and you have to kind of go back and forth and figure out where you sit on that  I use the the keyword search and photos all the time and every time  I'm amazed at how accurate or how that one random photo from so many years ago that had  you know a tree in it and so I do a search for tree and  You know out of my thousands upon thousands of photos. I'm able to find it in seconds  It's just like it that kind of makes you go. Okay. I'm okay with it here have my stuff because that's super useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will say it is useful, but I noticed when I was looking for a particular picture of my dog. I  Actually did a search for dog and I know it's in there and Google did not find it and also so then I had to go  Back and look at all my photos and I noticed that it didn't pull up a couple dog photos  Where my dog still looks like my dog  So there is also when you're doing something like that, especially if you have the number of photos that many of us have  There's kind of like oh, this is so cool. But what about all the trees that it didn't pull up and it didn't get yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we may never know. I mean that is one of the issues like we've all got  Gigabytes worth of photos that we're never going to look at because how could you you literally wouldn't have time and yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I do I delete like I keep one one or two like  Like photos of an event so for Christmas 2017 there will be like four photos max Wow, I am weird  Do you do that right?  Uh-huh. I usually just go through after and I don't take a lot of photos all the time  You pick one or two and yeah because otherwise it's just crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is you're so you're so disciplined like I know I literally have a thousand photos of every  Event or everything I've been to or everywhere I go because I don't know which one  Yeah, is gonna be good and then I don't have the discipline to delete them. So now I have  thousands of  Quasi half-decent photos and that's what you know  I'm just a few good ones that I can't find right delete the worst photos

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we can automatically delete things with fingers in them or things like that, but yeah, well I'm not on Facebook  So maybe that's where I get all my time to delete pictures and I don't go for babies. I mean, yeah that kind of manicuring your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your photo reel like that that takes a lot of time. Like I've tried to do that too  And at a certain point I just kind of gave up and figured  Photo search is good enough if I need to find something  Google's making more enhancements to you know, help you clean up bad photos or duplicate photos or whatever  It's not 100% but it's something and you know, I don't even really use those

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just like actually there panorama features and stuff like that are really great like the Ottawa some stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, sometimes having all those photos. They're able to do some cool stuff with it, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true  I took a picture just the other night and I took three pictures in a row of a truck and it  It's now like a little gif. It just moves right across the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can frame that on the no you can't frame that  But you'll have it forever  What else what we're talking about photos we can talk a little bit about lens lens is  The capability that we heard about at Google I owe that I think actually ended up in Google Photos  initially where it can  Analyze a photo or analyze something on the screen and tell you what it's looking at  So if you happen to take for whatever reason a picture of a box of cap-and-crunch cereal  You know you run that through lens and it will know that it's cap-and-crunch  You know give you a link to buy or give you a Wikipedia or whatever  It's basically like now on tap but for any you know, any of your pictures are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever is it because I don't have it on mine yet, and I just did the update

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, okay. So first of all initially you could find it in photos  I think that's for all devices or maybe it was a pixel only thing  It is okay cuz I'm on a one plus 5t. Oh, I just found it and I don't have it  So you have it so you have it on your on your pixel in the photo you have it looks like you have to take

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A photo though. You can't just do it from the camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so yeah, initially it was just in the photos app now is starting to roll out to Google Assistant  so you can use it and and it will open up the camera and  Oh, I see it. Oh hey nice  Lucky

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Now, let's see. This is pixel only

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is pixels. Sorry. Let's pour Galaxy s7 owners are left out in the cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, well, I've been using the one plus 5t and I need to switch back over  Yeah, I actually really do  the one plus 5t of course is the  The recent update that one plus did on their phone and I'm liking it a lot. It's it's a really great upgrade  They move the fingerprint sensor to the back, which is nice  Because that that frees up more space on the display  So it's a little bit more bezel lists or bezel reduced on the on the bottom and top you can see  Little sliver there used to be a fingerprint sensor down there. But yeah, it's a it's a nice looking phone. This is a really  Zoomed in shot. So I'll just show it sideways but  So yeah, so I've been using that but I got to go back to my pixel 2xl  And I think I'm about ready to go back to the pixel 2xl at this point  But for 500 bucks you you kind of can't go wrong with with that's good price. Yeah  They do the the reasonably priced high, you know production value devices really well, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I'm interested in the lens  I was just gonna say that that to me like the first I think Google goggles was the first time I had that  kind of functionality in a phone on the Nexus I think it was and and  Even though it didn't actually work sometimes it would just crap out and say goggles has quit or something when it did  It was really useful like especially when I was traveling and I would take a picture of something and be like, oh  it's a cool pile of rocks and then goggles would be like, oh, that's  This incredibly historically significant thing and then it would it would tell me what it was and actually found that really useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah goggles was cool for its time now. They've really I mean, it's just crazy  How far that functionality has come then it was kind of a unique thing that you could do here and there and not necessarily  Depend on but now I mean, it's pretty you know, it's pretty dependable  Everything that all the changes that they've made. It's nice to see that. It's it's lasted  Let's see here what else is there  Well, this is just Pat news and it's not even really news actually what I do when I dug into this I was like  Wait a minute. This is a patent from 2013, but apparently Google  Might someday bring motorized lid to the pixel book  So the thought that's what I thought so it opens and closes on its own  Uh-huh. So you just tap the case and it opens and like the trunk on my Tesla. Yes  Exactly. It's like the Tesla book  And it would open  And and it would open to just the right angle so it used the camera to know where your face is and open to the writing  Do we really need help opening our laptops?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I like the the writing in the verge piece  Speaks to a magical world where laptop users are freed from the tyranny of having to engage in a physical effort to use their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at all, yes  Like I said, this is a pad filed in 2013  So that kind of if they haven't done anything with that yet, you know, maybe they will at some point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't actually the drawing looks like a computer from  It looks like an old, you know think pad or something. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So do we want to talk about Facebook's new capture test? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see here so  Apparently your face yeah, you upload your face so you try so you try and log into your Facebook account and  They really want your pictures. Yes  Apparently they won't let you in until you send them a picture of your face. And of course they're doing it  To you know prevent spamming bots and all that sort of stuff. They want to make sure you're not a robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's pretty smart. I mean, I don't care like Facebook  Presumably has thousands of photos of my face already because I put photos on there actually think that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good not everybody. Yeah  No, and so they're in they're promising to delete it, but Facebook's promises are worth like I like to read a brainstorm  so, I mean, I'm just saying like I  Don't like I don't put pictures. I put some pictures or people put pictures of me  But like this just feels like you know, what if we had an awesome shot of everybody's face  What we do this time? They're really gonna delete it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bull this time for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One it is impossible the way Facebook is set up to permanently delete anything from their servers because it's scattered all across  The world all well, yeah all across the world actually  When you do it so unless they figure you'll change your mind  Yeah, so unless they're putting it in a dedicated server that all of this stuff is going to and then they're freaking like  Magnetizing that server and it never touches or goes across anything else and they're dedicated places  All over the world for this that just get dumped. It's not it's a lie

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So just think of how useful that could be for like the NSA or you know Homeland Security. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean it's in so I'm part of this is kind of a ship that sailed because like  There is a face database for everybody who's got whose state licenses are  Yep, they have the new licenses  so, you know these already exist and  Most people do put pictures on Facebook. So Facebook has this but there's definitely people who like if if you're an abused spouse  You're running away from someone those kind of things. You don't want that information  available accessible to anyone really

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Agreed. Yeah, and I think the you know, the biggest issue with  Facebook on that score as opposed to say Twitter is Facebook continually  Is trying to get you to reveal as much information about your real self as possible use your real name  upload a photo  Identify yourself if you want to be verified you have to submit a document  And all of that can can backfire in a whole bunch of different ways  I was interested in the at the congressional hearings. I forget if it was the Senate or or  the house but someone  Kept going after Twitter and effectively suggesting that allowing anonymity was was wrong with that people shouldn't be allowed  To be online and do things and say things  Anonymously, which is kind of a creepy. I mean, yes, there's downsides to anonymity, but  The idea that everybody has to identify themselves at all times  Can be very very dangerous for certain people in certain situations. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you is that a direction that you think things are heading in?  I mean, can you see can you foresee a future where the Internet is so locked down compared to today that  That's a requirement. I don't know how that's possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but I know that that there are definitely people pushing for that to happen and it's you know  Certainly the Senate people in the Senate and and the house are  Among those people and there because the belief is that anonymity is what causes  The problems so right it's what makes trolls do what they do. It's what makes it hard to track  You know whether that was a Russian ad or not  But I think there's there's some significant downsides to  To requiring that everybody, you know be their authentic selves or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and that's I mean if you want to stay anonymous, I think it's probably  Well, no, I'm not even gonna go there. I don't think about it. No, I'm just like  Oh the mental work to think about anonymity and getting people  Making it easy enough for people who have a legitimate reason to stay anonymous to still participate  While also like people will perform certain hurdles  Maybe sending a photo isn't the right hurdle because it feel it smacks it  But you can get a real person who wants to participate to do some things that a bot wouldn't do so  The question is figuring out how to do that and as computers get better. That's just gonna be harder and harder. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Well the bots are getting smarter and smarter. I mean that's reading things clicking things filling in forms, you know, they're  They're more human than lots of the people I know who are online. Oh and that brings up a really cool article

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is not on the rundown, but I'll put it on the rundown. Oh  No, it it lost. Okay, it's from fast code design  Copy and pasting hold on you guys. I don't know where  And other so this was an awesome article that talked about  Oh  I see why it's not I can clean it up  Clean it up. There you go. So click that it's about how the future of user interfaces is  Going to be designing for a mix of humans and AI's so bots plus people and that's kind of what we're talking about  So this is a really fun article that kind of ties into some of this stuff and I thought it was actually pretty thought-provoking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Myself so reading and I actually think we're probably doing that already. I mean people at Google  I'm sure are designing for for bots or or automated processes almost as much as they're designing for human beings  the the  difficult part is when  So I don't you guys probably saw the YouTube video stories about the creepy kid videos and so on and  a lot of them are are effectively  produced or generated  solely to fit a kind of algorithmic or or kind of  facilitate search  Keywords, you know combinations of things that that algorithms have determined are interesting or will surface easily  Those are that's that's content created by  Machines for machines and then people see them and they're like, oh my god, this is horrible  and  Yet, I'm sure the machines don't care  and and some of it might actually turn out to be  Not useful but creative or interesting and then some of it is just going to be bizarre and disturbing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly machines see that in the in the way of a you know, a recommend recommended next thing to watch or maybe it  Follows you know, exactly but and then the challenge of course then becomes, you know, this story has been bubbling up for a while  You know YouTube kids which is an app that my kids are very familiar with  Just present the presenting the next video to someone who you know  To my children as one example who aren't going to question the next video. They're not going to question the next video  They're just going to follow along and be along for the ride and end up being exposed to these really crazy videos  Yeah, and I'm so conflicted on YouTube right now all these this continuing outpouring of stories about you know, these these horrible  highly offensive or offensive and objectionable, you know videos  Involving children targeted at children. I mean I always knew YouTube was it was a basically a minefield  You know between the comments and the amount of content that's being uploaded to it  I just feel like YouTube we're seeing how YouTube is kind of buckling under its own weight. There's so much video being uploaded

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you possibly police it all and in a way Google or YouTube is very much like Facebook in that sense  Let's say it's all user-generated content or most of it  it's there's massive volumes like the volume is  Almost impossible to contemplate  Yeah, we're to understand on a sort of human level the amount of content that gets uploaded and so and yet algorithms fail  Spectacularly at sifting through a lot of that because they don't  Have the kind of human context that human beings do you can you and I can look at a video and say well  That's just creepy people shouldn't watch that  algorithms are like  it has  Sex and bananas and robots and it's funny and you like funny things with bananas and robots  And so you know what I mean like it meets the criteria  Yeah, but you and I would both it would trigger something and be like no one wants to watch that or that's bad  We're not there yet where algorithms can kind of make those kind of decisions reliably is this comment trolling or is it?  Acceptable is this?  Video offensive or is it creative or is it interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like challenge. Sorry  No, I was gonna say and the challenge with kids stuff less so with more adults  But I don't know if kids can see one or one image and have it stick with them for like  the rest of their life like I vividly  Remember walking in on my parents watching Star Trek the wrath of Khan and the scene where they stick the bug  That scene was the only thing I saw for like  Months afterwards and I still vividly remember I mean like oh man  So young yeah  That traumatized me in ways that like I mean I'm clearly a self-actualized person but yeah, it stuck with me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder about I wonder if someone actually mentioned this while the YouTube thing was going on and it made me think I  Mean some of these videos are clearly  Over-the-top or in go into dark areas and you you know what your kids watching them, but they're also  there probably is room for  Auto-generated creativity of some kind where things are merged together or blended together and you get something new and you and sometimes it is creepy  Or weird but Bugs Bunny cartoons were pretty creepy and weird and you know  I grew up on those some of the people who designed those were probably on drugs or they were very strange individuals some of those  episodes where you look back at them now, and you're like that is like way out there and  But I mean it was also  Funny and so there there probably are things that are in that gray area, and I wouldn't want to say  You know I don't want my kids to watch any YouTube videos or I only want them to watch this channel in that channel  Maybe there are things that they would find  Funny or interesting that I wouldn't or that I would never pick for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Imagine a world where an algorithmically generated motion picture wins Best Movie of the Year at the Academy Awards  Not entirely outside the realm of possibility right once these computers get smart enough  They could absolutely create a narrative that's easy to follow  Just by analyzing everything that's already out there, and I mean AI is  There is music being created by computers entirely and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Journalism is being written

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Journalism is being written great great example  They're they're processing imagery and yes it ends up looking very kind of psychedelic or whatever  But if a human had had processed that or created that so won't be like wow that's really creative. That's interesting  I haven't seen that before

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think about it. We're like in we're in the first inning not even in the first in yeah  I mean the speed with which this is going to improve is going to be mind-boggling and so  Five years from now we could be seeing things that like now  It's sort of Stone Age you know and it's very crude and and you think yeah computers aren't that good at that  But they've gotten pretty good at some other things. They weren't very good at either so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely  Wow, okay, I meant to I meant to take a break for the sponsor about ten minutes ago  But I didn't want to interrupt any of that so we're gonna thank the sponsor then let's talk a little bit about Amazon and  Kind of the sales that happened. I'm sure some of you out there watching listening  Maybe both of you that here on the show today bought some stuff. I didn't buy anything really this year  We'll talk about that anyways, but I want to thank the sponsor of this episode and that is  Lighthouse sponsoring this week in Google Lighthouse is more than a security camera  It's actually really tall security camera this thing is really cool  It's an interactive security assistant and it's powered by the same technology that you find  That you would find in self-driving cars their 3d time of flight sensor  It's a game changer for people who are looking for the best security camera a lot of people are doing that in this world of the internet  of things  This is just an excellent security camera at the top of the device  Lighthouse actually emits invisible light into the room that it's in  The 3d sensor measures the time that it takes for the light to bounce off objects to create a 3d  Structure of the room and then using advanced AI  Lighthouse continuously analyzes the 3d structure to detect actual movement  To know whether it's a person a pet an object whatever it happens to be that's within its view  And unlike other cameras you you won't get security alerts every time something moves  It doesn't just let you know every time there's movement  So because it can identify this stuff so there's no more alerts for pets or sunlight shadows  It recognizes that thanks to the AI that's happening on the device and kind of doesn't show those things to you  But it shows you the important things Lighthouse learns who you know and who you don't and to eliminate false security alerts  Lighthouse lets you invite people to the app maybe family members the dog walker the nanny  House cleaners  Whoever while restricting access to your video giving you total privacy  And when you're alerted to a possible security threat you can sound an alarm  You can speak through the camera or call 9-1-1 directly from the app  It's basically it's like the search engine for your life at home when you want to know what happened  You can ask Lighthouse and it'll actually show you what did the kids do while I was out yesterday  If you don't see Michael by 4 p.m. On weekdays, let me know  Kids can wave to say hello and open up two-way talk. So you're always in contact with your children when they're home  It's got everything you want in the security camera 1080p  live-stream two-way talk night vision 30 day video history and  Three different permission settings with the option to turn off the camera when the owner is home  Super smart Lighthouse has an exclusive offer just for twit fans just in time for the holiday season visit  www.light.house  slash-twit and you'll get 40% off your very own lighthouse with the lighthouse  Intelligence service plan right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could be second place with a very small amount of money the way the world is, you know working out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much bitcoin do we have to own in order to beat Bezos at this point? Not very much, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not as many I mean no, we're at 11 now, I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is unbelievable when does the bottom fall out on that one I had about a hundred at one point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then I got rid of them because they were worth pennies. I was like, this is dumb

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's wrong  How do you feel how how does how does that feel because that sounds pretty painful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It feels a lot like not buying Apple when it was $5. Yeah, pretty used to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's the thing you don't know at the time  So it's yeah always hindsight, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like hindsight, but it does remind me that no matter how dumb something seems or no matter how much you think  Company is gonna go bankrupt. Why not buy a couple hundred shares anyway, you never know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you might as well. You've got a couple hundred bucks to burn however much it is at the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm measurement the guy who the older guy who sold his Apple shares not long after  Do you remember that story? I can't remember his name now  But he was an older fellow and and he got 10% of the company and he sold it for 800 bucks or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Networked it we we did interview him on triangulation. I think Wow, he was their first CEO  Oh man, somebody somebody in shots gonna remember his name and it's it's he thought it's just too risky

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so, you know, I might as well sell it and someone there was a sign somewhere  It was probably photoshopped, but it said are you having a bad day?  So and so if he had hung on to it, it'd be worth, you know, 300 billion dollars or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of Ronald Wayne is his name on all the Wayne. That's right. Thank you, Blake

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you, Blake. And the best part is he doesn't regret it at all  He said it was the right decision to make at the time, right? You don't mean you kick back. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You really don't know at the time if I'd have done this instead of that. I'd be over there instead of here  That's a dad ism if I ever heard when my dad used to tell me that all the time still does  I'm probably gonna tell it to my kids too. It's it's like a great we go. There you are  Yes, exactly  So  Yes, Black Friday then cyber Monday. It was a big year cyber Monday at least was the biggest shopping day ever  For Amazon anyways, we had a number though

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They never give you numbers. They just really big mush words around so it sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really big really big really big even bigger than the last really big one  Yes, which was prime

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to know Alibaba. I think singles day was 25 billion. Whoa, that was one day Wow  25 billion. I think they did 5 billion in the first 15 minutes  So maybe Amazon just doesn't want to be you know measure up. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have a much smaller market. Well, I guess globally no, okay, never mind. Yeah  I was like wait. Nope. Nope. They sell stuff elsewhere in the world. Yeah, Ali Express

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have not bought anything from there Florence. I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every is a big fan. I have bought stuff on Ali Express  I bought an Elsa costume for Halloween one year and it arrived and it was awesome. It was good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cheap cheap. I was gonna say cheap cheap quality. Well, I mean it was what it needed to be  Yeah, it was a hell. Yeah one day. Yeah, you just need it for that one time  You might as well get it as inexpensive as long as you're ordering far enough out  cyber Monday was the first  Well saw 81 million Americans shopping online to the tune of two billion dollars in mobile shopping  The most popular shopping app apparently was wish which I actually used wish this time  I've never ordered from wish before but wish kind of reminds me of Alibaba. It's kind of the similar  Kind of approach never heard of it. It's a similar type of marketplace. You find a lot of the same type of stuff on wish  You got to be okay with the fact that it's gonna take 30 to 60 days to ship  Okay, because you know a lot of it's coming from China and you know  They take the slow route on and that's why it's ridiculously inexpensive  So, yeah  If you're if you plan far enough in advance you can you can buy stuff for dirt cheap  You just have to be able to wait for it  and I'm guessing that cyber Monday or black Friday was not the right day to order from  From wish because everything takes more than 30 days and you're not gonna have it in time for Christmas

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say I didn't buy anything  Like you I didn't I didn't participate in the cyber Monday or black Friday. Yeah, I'm Canadian  So our Thanksgiving was some time ago, but we still have  Cyber money and black Friday. I don't know why because why not?  Yeah, I mean the US is doing it why don't why shouldn't we do it and there were some great sales  But I just to be honest, I don't I don't need that much stuff. I have a lot of stuff already  I thought about buying some  USB drives like you can get 256 gig USB drives, which I find fascinating Wow, what would I do with it?  I don't know, but it's pretty cool. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got 256 gigs in my pocket and I am happy to see you. No, it was 40 bucks like  Wow, I love tech that yeah, I'm like thanks Moore's law

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding. It's mind-boggling for anyone who's old enough to remember, you know  My first hard drive was 50 Megs or something and I thought that was more data than anybody could possibly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Accumulate in their lifetime at the time it was  But my how that changes that's crazy  Did you guys read this article this mirror article was an investigative report?  Reporter went to work for the Amazon  warehouse for an Amazon warehouse in Essex and  spent  Five weeks working in the warehouse final shift was on Black Friday and just kind of reported Wow experience from this warehouse and  It didn't sound like a very fun place to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know mother Jones did an article like that a couple years ago. There is exact exact same experience  So this again makes sense. I mean what Amazon's trying to do does  It will exhaust people. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I worked in a warehouse once long before the internet so there was no cyber Monday, but it's a terrible job  I mean there are there are probably warehouses that are nice and clean and where everyone's you know  abides by some code of but the warehouse I worked in was it was a nightmare, so I  Don't I'm not you know absolving Amazon of any it's just those jobs are inherently  Drudgery, I mean repetitive drudgery. There's no way to kind of make them not that right?  I think we could expect a certain amount of humanity, but I mean Amazon's got  Just such massive volumes of stuff. I read an article. I don't know if you guys read this a while back that looked at  Retirees who work in Amazon warehouses  Because they're obviously they need the money or they're looking for something to do and they're traveling around their RVs  So they the RVs park in the parking lot of the Amazon  warehouse and and they work in the warehouse and  It it was a slightly better story than and the mirror one, but you know, it's hard work standing up for hours at a time  I think Amazon had  Dispensers on the wall for like pain medication and and  arthritis  Medication and stuff that you could just help yourself to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a dash button  Yeah  orders Tylenol some Tylenol  Get it delivered  Yeah, no, it's it sounds like so just just a little bit of insight into you know, what the workers experience workers  Were expected to stuff a package every 30 seconds. So I mean this is you know, it's total  When you're talking about the volume like you like you say Matthew when you're talking about the kind of volume and the service as Amazon  Prime customers kind of expected this quick turnaround and you just think of the massive amount of  Products that are being ordered every second all that needs to be bogged  You know located boxed shipped out so stuffing a package every 30 seconds  Some workers falling asleep while they were standing 10 10 hour shifts  Standing they maybe get a couple of like 30 minute breaks. I think throughout that time  We're told they could not sit down even when things slowed down  They have a screen that shows them their units per hour  How long each unit has taken so obviously they're further incentivized to keep the boat rolling here. Keep the ship rolling  You know the reporter noticed a couple of colleagues were taken out on an ambulance from exhaustion  Like it's just kind of it's it's crazy  But I mean like like you say is that more indicative of this type of work or is this that Amazon?  Goes above and beyond it, you know as far as pushing their employees to the to the limits. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it certainly seems like the expectations have increased  Like you said everybody expects the package to show up, you know  An hour after they ordered it. So Amazon is trying to meet those expectations  But my favorite line was at every turn it felt like the human staff were reduced to livestock  existing only to service the machines  Yeah, that's a future

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Machines are  better better and faster and the  At this I mean that's that's one of the challenges of  Low skilled workers and you know, right because I write about IOT a lot  I will say that on the employment side in factories that get automated so not warehousing but in factories  the staff now has to be  More trustworthy more educated and able to make decisions based on the information the robots offer to them  So I mean what we're seeing is a hollowing out of kind of the unskilled labor force

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, we've talked about this before with things like the Amazon store where you don't have to go to a cashier  what happens to all the people who  cashier was a pretty good job and that was the way they not just entered the workforce but you know raise their kids or  Put them through school and what happens when there aren't any more cashiers what happens when?  Long haul truck driving is not a thing that you can do  and the jobs  Servicing robots are require skills that you don't have  So it's good in a way that you know, where his jobs are terrible  And so if it was all automated that would be good because people shouldn't be doing those jobs third. It's horrible  But what if that's the only?  Job you can get or if that's you know, then then what do we do with the people who that was their job, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean cuz you're talking a lot of people here. Obviously Amazon's been increasing the amount  You know their their warehouses  Doing you know massive hiring days to fill these warehouses with workers  So one hand they're providing jobs to a lot of people on the other hand the conditionable job  Yeah, the conditions are miserable  and you know someone I  Didn't see the name because it scrolled out of view but made a made a good point, you know Amazon's  Amazon will be criticized because of the working conditions of the workers  But then once Amazon replaces the workers with robots and machines  Criticized for replacing, you know real human jobs with robots and putting them out of work

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's kind of a no-win situation from Amazon's and this reminds me a lot of the controversies over  You know sneaker companies like Nike  using  poor people in other countries children in some cases to  Make their products that and paying them what what we would see as as  a barely living wage and yet  In those countries those jobs are actually pretty good and they're making a lot of money  So it it seems horrible and yet it might actually be better than the alternative  Yeah, so it's hard to make a judgment. I'm sure if you ask some of those  warehouse workers, they'd be like, you know, this is  Horrible, but I have a job and I can put food on the table  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true  Yeah, good good point. You owe whiz if that is your real name says it's actually a win-win for Amazon, which is true  It's only a lose-lose for Amazon in the court of public opinion  But Amazon still wins and Bezos still wins

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no matter what actually Amazon's the number of areas they're gonna win keep increasing, you know  They I mean retail is a whole  Now they've they're talking about getting into pharmacy  That's a yeah, that's a hundreds of billions of dollars that market  And if the Amazon brings the same kinds of things that brought to buying, you know  USB thumb drives and books to that market that's gonna I will get counterfeit pills so much easier so much faster. Yeah  See that's a service

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is  And then I think we're about  At wrap-up time before the the last the last ad but before we do that  I realized we didn't talk at all about Waymo. Have you guys been following the latest developments in the uber Waymo case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Things are getting a little is that gonna be like a novella on TV a telenovela. Good lord. It's  Totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Definitely has some some nuggets in there  There was some testimony yesterday from a former uber security analysts attorney Richard Jacobs  Who said that uber reportedly went to?  Great lengths to cover its tracks to keep quote unlawful schemes from seeing the light of day  that testimony also showed that the company was urging employees to use  Disappearing chat apps for for their conversations so that nothing was, you know held in a permanent record  Also that employees were trained to quote impede investigations  None of this is out of very good. Ultimately judge Alsop  Said it would be a huge injustice to force the trial to begin on December 4th  Which is I think what it was scheduled to begin in light of this letter that reveals a lot of this information now way most  Who has discovered this letter is now starting to dive in so they're postponing the trial date  It's being pushed back a little bit while they dive into this  Things not looking so good for uber in this case

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's amazing how that company well, what was just the just before that the most recent?  News was that they had this massive security breach that they paid people to cover up  I mean, I don't know how uber can get through a week without you know, some massive  Revelation about how they did something dodgy. It's like it's like  So that I remember having an argument with somebody about whether uber was actually innovative or whether they were just taking advantage of  Legal loopholes and trying to force laws to change and that and my argument was that's good  They actually have forced change in things like the taxi market  It almost feels like their big innovation was finding ways around doing the right thing instead of actually  Innovating to do a better thing if you know what I mean, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it was a it was a part of their culture, you know hands down  That was a part of their culture and drive to success was how can we?  Side-step all these things and now the new CEO Dara Kazir Shahi has vowed to  Kind of you know, may I copa to a certain degree and say things are change

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He reportedly knew about that that data breach. So now he told people about the data breach

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That Dara is why the data breach was out there. He found out he was like we got to tell people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But when did he find out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he's only been there for like a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know if you discover something like that on the first day you probably don't I mean this poor guy think about  I think about what else is under the bed, you know, he's like he's like a maid at a hotel room God  There's gonna be so much nastiness running around there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it does it reinforces for me that there's a very kind of gray area  loose  hard to define line between  pushing for change  and innovation and that sort of mentality that we need to move fast and break things and  this goes for Facebook too and and that between that and  actually breaking things that are kind of important like laws or you know  Moving fast and breaking things was fine when Facebook was you know  A bunch of guys in their hoodies and flip-flops but moving fast and breaking democracy or moving fast and breaking, you know  Society or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Information is that's bad. Yeah, so move fast and break every things

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and so we're looking sure break break things and then fix them  That's cool. And that's good if it's if they're just gadgets  But if their laws or their actual, you know things that allow society to function then maybe moving fast and breaking them  Is not the right approach? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, indeed  All right  so I guess we'll we'll find out when that court date is pushed off to and I'm sure  She has to talk about it on this show when that does happen  Have I missed anything else before we?  Start to kind of wrap things. Well, well, we're not quite at wrapping things up yet  But have I missed any stories that you guys really want to talk about before we do the break?  Then we can do the stuff I think might be good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  Well Facebook  Stepped in it again with the racial targeting  So that they said that wasn't gonna happen anymore and then someone found it continued to happen  That's another for me at least algorithmic kind of problem or more like a yes, you can target using all sorts of offensive terms  That doesn't mean Facebook wants to advertise  to racists just that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The system that it gives people the tools to become and ever be racist  Well, I would say no if they're their whole goal is to get you to share as much of yourself on there as possible  So it can create finely tuned demographic profiles to sell to advertisers. That is literally what Facebook does all right  crap about the world so  That it's able to do that in doing very accurately and  harmfully is not  That's not surprising

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No  but in these cases at least my understanding is people just typed in racist terms where you're supposed to put the name of your  Company or where you're supposed to put what business you're in and they just typed in things like Jew hating and so that and so then  the system didn't automatically flag that as not an occupation or  Not a thing that that you should be able to fill into a form where you're gonna do an automated ad campaign

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if nothing else we should know in the great the great year of our Lord  2017 is that people will be racist a holes sure on the internet and they will do that kind of stuff  So for Facebook to say oh, you know, you didn't know you have to do that  You have to build this into your platform you have to you're a hey  What's that racist a hole who hangs out on my reddit Nazi channel gonna do here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That should just be right over your QA and that's why things like Microsoft's chatbot that went instantly racist  I think in like half an hour that shouldn't come as a surprise  I mean if you've ever been to reddit or 4chan or anything like that  You should you should know going in yeah that like you said the worst aspects of humanity  Will take control of your platform or your service or your thing, right? And you should figure out how to make that not happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How can your thing or how will your thing be abused and right your business makes yeah, cuz it will  Plenty of people have have have reason to you know  Feel like they have reason to do that and really quick actually this I think I saw breaking this morning  Maybe maybe was last night andy Rubin and so any Rubin Godfather of Android?  Founder of essential is now apparently on leave from the company essential after a report of you guessed it an appropriate  relationship at Google and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, yeah, something's something smells wrong about that because you I don't see  That just a relationship with a co-worker is going to  Cause Google to get rid of Andy Rubin. There's got to be more. Well, Google didn't get rid of him and you're even  Sorry. Yeah, but but there's got to be more going on like there's  You know than just we were co-workers and had a relationship. Yeah seem  like a firing offense or a quitting offense or a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well they're saying that this happened while Rubin worked in the Android division  and  There was a report. Oh, sorry. I just disappeared. There was a report to HR  After that report to HR he moved to the robotics division  Apparently within Google the verge pointed out that Google's guidelines would have required if he was working in Android at the time of this  Whatever this is happened. He would have been required  To move or him or the other person affected to move to a different division to split them up  So that would make sense that he would move to the robotics division  It would also have required the company to disclose that relationship. I don't know if there was any disclosure  I mean, there certainly wasn't publicly  Rubin spokesperson says relationship was consensual whatever it was  But that Google's internal investigation said that Rubin's behavior was quote improper  And showed bad judgment  So yeah, so you could you could throw him under the sexual harasser bus given the times because his phone is terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In or he could have done something again it essential  How crazy would it be to be branded as a sexual harasser is better than being branded as the failed CEO of a smartphone company in 2017  Hmm  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's like choosing between being shot and being stabbed like I don't it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he apparently chose sexual harassment if that's the case, but you know, he may have yeah, I mean I've met Andy Rubin he is  The worst I could say about him is he was kind of condescending to me and  He has he has a little bit of a quality though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even when you see him speaking like publicly is he's got that that aura to him  But if that was a firing offense, there'd be nobody working at any of the main platform Silicon Valley. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm not but I will say that Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google if we

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The sexual harassment that goes on at Google or even things like dating your co-workers. That is not uncommon at Google  That's not uncommon at a lot of tech places, especially places that want you to live where you work and to be right social at work  So, you know this and that is an unintended consequence

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You force people to live in dormitories nearby and socialize with each other and you provide all sorts of you know  Chances for them to do that at work and you blur the lines between work and your social life  And then it shouldn't be that surprising  All right, I think we've done it I think there is not one possible news story left for us to discuss we've covered it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did so this actually was a tip from a twit a twit reader listener listener watcher whatever I'm like person who watches and listens to twit on Bluetooth headsets  So this oh I didn't put I just put Bluetooth headset so this is the sense so I was looking for cheap Bluetooth headsets to go with my phone that I could just wear you know running around and just  I lose headsets like nobody's business so I don't want to spend a lot of money on them so these are okay and they're comfortable for me with small ears there is I still feel like the sound quality is good when I talk to people on them there is if I'm outside there's noise but if I'm inside people can hear me just fine  So and I did go do a workout they did not fall out of my ears while I was running nor did the once the once sweat session that I did that did not short them out so I felt good about that so these are $30 pair of Bluetooth headphones and you know they're alright

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice I actually need to move into the Bluetooth headphone world because Google is basically forcing me to because of I'm living the dongle life now with my wired headphones and the pixel to I'm still not happy about it but I figure it's probably time for me to check out Bluetooth headphones finally and see if I really care either way about them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My biggest issue and I don't know if this is headphone specific yet because I haven't tried enough of them the others were the pixel buds and those are terrible so I'm not going to put this but there is interruption on them every now and then and I don't know if it's just my phone like things notifications going in but man  So every now and then yeah so every now and then they're not like they're still Bluetooth headsets I guess is the best way to do it they're great pair of $30 Bluetooth headsets with all the caveats that that implies

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Got it. Got it. Have you tried the pixel buds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah they're awful. I wanted to claw them they felt like something clawing at my ears. I hated them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then someone said in order to pair them with something you had to put them back in the case reset them and then pair them to move from like one device to another that just seems insane I don't understand how they could have made it out the door with that being the case  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not rushing out to get the pixel buds.  It's because they were focused on their hamburger emoji.  Yeah.  They had their priorities in the right place.  Distracted the whole organization.  According to Sundar Pichai.  Matthew what about you? Do you have anything, stuff, thing, tool, tip, anything that you want to mention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I guess I'm interested in there's this thing called Bitcoin. I don't know if you guys have ever heard of that?  A little bit.  Pretty, it's kind of a big deal.  I just I find it fascinating. I said it was saying to this to someone the other day watching Bitcoin over the last year or cryptocurrency and blockchain is the closest thing I can remember to when I first saw the internet.  So a mosaic browser and hyperlinks and then the early early days of the internet because I'm an old person.  I just it was simultaneously incredibly nerdy, really dumb looking, hard to use, confusing and yet incredibly fascinating.  And you just had a feeling that this was going to change not just one or two things, but everything eventually, which I think has proven true.  And I feel that way. I felt the same when Napster showed up in peer to peer networking.  But Bitcoin feels and cryptocurrency and blockchain feel so there it's it's just nerds and people trying to make quick money at the moment.  But that's the early internet was like that, too. I just feel like there's something.  This is going to change a lot of stuff, a lot of incredibly important things, whether it's insurance or banking or government or you name it.  And yet right now it's a it's a wild west sideshow. And both of those aspects are kind of fascinating to me.  So anyway, so you should look into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're kicking yourself for having sold the Bitcoin way back when?  Yeah. Does that mean you have you gotten back on that train now?  I mean, it's too expensive to get back on that train now if you want a single Bitcoin anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there's so many different cryptocurrencies now. And Ethereum, I think, is way more interesting than Bitcoin.  Like Bitcoin, I think, is was a proof of concept in it.  And it it led the way for a lot of things. But there are way more interesting things being done with other types of cryptocurrencies.  I find the financial aspect fascinating with companies doing ICOs, which are kind of equity issues, but kind of not the SEC scrambling to catch up.  I talked to a guy who works for the Bank of Canada and he they're thinking about launching their own cryptocurrency, the Bank of Canada.  So the central bank of a country. Wow.  Because they're going to have they're going to have to do something.  Otherwise, they will cease to be relevant because currency and markets will move elsewhere.  So it's just a fascinating area. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the bigger threats to banks is the fact that you can no longer do time delayed based arbitrage with cryptocurrencies because you automatically transfer the data.  It goes as fast as the data. So things like the wires for traditional payments.  You. Yes, it's gotten faster, but you still had like an overnight time frame.  Those weren't hit people's accounts and you could actually trade on that.  People did. So, well, not not yet.  Not everybody. This is why some financial players are like, dang, this is going to kill us.  So it's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah, it's going to be fortunes made and lost for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. Although already are my my biggest rule for any ICO, any Bitcoin slash blockchain tech is, first of all, why do you need a distributed ledger?  Because if you don't if you can't justify that, it's just yeah, it's just to get me.  Yeah, that's it. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do I have? Let's see here. I think I have a tip for you.  We talked about it a little bit earlier. We talked about the Pixel 2 having the Pixel visual core and with the new 8.1 beta update rolling out, it's going to activate that.  But just because you got the update on your Pixel 2 doesn't mean that it's activated.  So if you want the benefits of Pixel visual core, which is primarily the benefits right now are that you get all of the camera quality, the HDR plus processing that you're used to getting in the stock camera app.  But in all camera apps on third party apps like Instagram, whatever, when you use those cameras, you get the better improved quality.  That's a big part of what this allows for.  You're going to have to go into settings on your Pixel 2 device and activate this and I'll show you how to do it.  Basically, you have to have. Here we go.  You have to have access to the developer settings.  If you don't know how, if you don't have access to developer settings, you'll need to activate that first and foremost.  It's kind of a hidden thing if you go into system and then you go into about phone and you double tap or you tap the build number, which I'm trying to kind of hide a little bit here a bunch of times.  It'll open up the menu for you and then you'll find it in here.  System settings, developer options.  I'll go ahead and go in there.  And then when you go down to the debugging section down at the very bottom of debugging is camera, how HDR plus go ahead and turn that on.  And then in order to actually apply it, you have to reboot your device.  Once you do that, then you will hopefully experience the benefits of Pixel visual core in 8.1 and some of your third party camera apps that you use will see an improved bump in quality for your pictures.  So now you know and knowing is half the battle as you do.  And that's it.  I think we've we've we've got a bunch of magical title suggestion ideas that came from this episode, which tells me this was an awesome episode.  Usually the best episodes have like tons of title options.  So but I knew it was going to be because you guys are both awesome and I really enjoy doing shows with you guys.  So thanks for inviting me to the home.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Matthew.  Thank you, Stacey.  Matthew Ingram, Columbia Journalism Review, Matthew Ingram dot com.  Matthew, you're awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually have a Facebook page.  No, I sometimes even answer, but I don't go on it for social.  It's only work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I do decide to continue, get back onto Facebook and everything, I think I'm still going to keep the app off my phone.  But I don't even know if I'm going to do that.  I feel a little bit of the pull, but I need to resist the temptation.  I don't know if I have time for Facebook in my life right now.  What if you just stick a thing like after you've been on Facebook for more than 10 minutes, it shuts off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Screen turns off.  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's the app for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you put it on during certain hours and it logs off automatically.  Because a lot of the time, even I do this on Twitter, I'm like, should I go to bed?  I should go to bed.  Jesus, why am I still scrolling?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
