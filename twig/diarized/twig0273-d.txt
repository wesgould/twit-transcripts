So around about 1030 in the morning our time. I  Refreshed one last time and oddly it said the 32 gigs were out of stock. I thought well, that's strange. I  Thought that was an error.

I noticed a change on this side  It suddenly went from about you know pre pre sales soon to out of inventory like immediate. Yeah  So then over there I just started hitting and at some point I got in but it was I would probably say it was for sale  Maybe 30 seconds each device before it was completely so that's crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just saying it's what we should do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't I didn't try and buy it  because it seemed a bit expensive and  I still like the look of the one plus one, but I haven't found a way to get one of those yet either  So I'm still sitting with a Nexus five feeling left out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure they had quite a lot but this you know  20-second manufacturing means have to make some more Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so you said they were expensive. I guess they were they are not the low-cost Nexus five  Variety or even one plus one one plus one is 64 gig one plus one is  $350 and a very good  Very good phone for that price. Yeah, it's a good deal  I just I you know, and I'm happy with the note floor or the one plus but I did kind of want lollipop

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  That's the thing right that that's what I really want. I want the  Involunt about the six about the size and you know, of course  I always want the new Nexus just because the Nexus line has been so great, but it's the software, right?  But look, we'll get this the software get pushed to the next five the Nexus seven. What we'll see we'll see lollipop

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could I could get a Nexus nine tablet  No, those didn't sell out those for some reason they got lots of those  Yeah, what is it is it the nine inches but it says it's just right here  The real problem is I have a Nexus seven and there's nothing wrong with it  Yeah, and I'll have lollipop on that one at the same time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't got rounds of putting the lollipop on that with the dev build yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't want to use the dev build up  But I do want when five point Oh Andrew five point comes out. I do want to put you'll get it on the seven  Yeah  And if you have a Nexus five you'll get it and given that they're saying that the Nexus nine leaves the warehouse November 3rd  And we know it'll have lollipop that sounds like that's when lollipop will be available is early November

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like four days. I'm such a hoarder by instinct. I now that you can't the Nexus seven is discontinued  I almost want to buy one just to have a backup

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good cool, yeah, you're like Kim Kardashian and her blackberries

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She told care of she had like five blackberries

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In references Gina, no you you crush me every time you do that you you you lower yourself from

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a recode interview Kara Swisher interviewed her this is legit man, this is like the Daily Mail  This is hard-hitting tech reporting here come on and as as Liz Gaines noted in her

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  description of the interview care Kim's  Makeup looked incredible despite  And no actually I really thought this was quite interesting Kara Swisher is gonna join us on Twitter on Sunday  Yeah, I'll ask her you know what it was like to hang with the Kardashians

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny the only photo that I saw they were both both Kara and Kim were like  Not at all facing one another like the body language totally they both have a language. Yeah, it just didn't look like they were  Connecting really I found her profession of love for the blackberry. You know really interesting. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She says she has several  Because she can't live without it. It's a blackberry bold by the way. It's not even like a recent blackberry  She she she uses her iPhone for pictures, but the blackberries for the real business

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when one breaks she uses a spare and then she ebays another one so she always has three spares  She said if she could she would buy the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the funniest thing  Kara said you should just buy the company she said  I'm sure it's a fire sale

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Goodbye are the profits out of that game definitely out of the game. Yeah use the profits from her game to buy  I love this idea. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well now we know that Gina watches that show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, I think I just fell asleep in Madrid and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a nightmare. She is a huge fan. I'll spare I'll spare you my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The I find the Kardashian brand and the way that it was built in the family very fascinating  I think there are a lot of fascinating aspects of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think Kara is also a secret Kardashian fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kara is totally pro Kardashian. She was defending the interview, you know from the from the get-go  First of all that the success of the game is amazing and and I don't think it's a testament to to the Kardashians tech-savvy  Ness, it's a it's a testament to the power of their brand, which is amazing  I mean retail stores TV the app store. I mean fashion  Clothing, you know perfume I mean in every avenue like you put their name on it and they're in Sears  They make tons of money and and that's fascinating to me and they're so social media savvy  Like the most liked Instagram photo ever is she and her and Kanye's wedding  They apparently spent weeks on their honeymoon like tweaking it before they posted on Instagram  I mean, she's you know, extreme extremely savvy and I find that interesting  That's all I'm gonna say I'm gonna get lots of email about this yeah, look at here's the body language

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're they're just kind of just a little it just doesn't it's a little I don't believe Kardashian is real

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should it doesn't look like one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's one of those Iduros those Japanese 3d models

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly. That's not real. That's not a human being

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, of course. She's a human being Jeff  You're talking about  You know what? Here's what Liz Gaines wrote in the Liz Gaines wrote in the end the most impressive thing about Kardashian  I guess her new name is Kardashian West  This woman has incredible endurance  to deflect the hate and  Continue to do this thing that she chooses to do every day, which is something Jeff Jarvis advocates, which is share her life

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  True true. It's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know the glue game Hollywood had been out for a long time and it was a glue  I don't know if was glue or Kim's idea to put her brand into it  But that's what made it a sudden hit and you know, I've played it my daughter loved it and I played it  It's actually a very fun game

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean and the message of the game is something I get on board with you work really hard and  Then to make things happen, right? I mean in the game you work really hard to be famous, right?  And that's what that's what they do. It is a form of work  I guess  But I mean, you know, it's tiny tower but for you know, it's tiny tower for celebrities

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really interesting thing. She works really hard to be famous  But that's absolutely absolutely a description of what she and others like her Paris Hilton people who don't have any outward  Particular skill. They're not writers or actors or performers or musicians  Their skill is that they work really hard  To be famous. Yeah, they're famous for being famous  Like like Peggy Cass in our days Leo, yeah, we had them what the hell did Kitty Carlisle do  Actually she she was a writer yeah, but I mean there have been yeah  We are old Jeff  They've always been people are famous for being famous  Usually they were public intellectuals  Maybe they were comedians  But well, you know Charo  Charo is the closest thing to Kim Kardashian. She was famous for marrying a bandleader  Xavier Kugat was the Kanye West of his day  She was famous for being sexy and voluptuous  Kuchi Kuchi Koo and talking in a funny Spanish accent  She didn't actually I mean she sang but I don't think you know, she sang in Kugat's band  But I don't think she was a great singer. She was Kim Kardashian if she'd had a mobile platform  She could have done a game. Did you like Charo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, she drove me nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mean to diverge into it where there's lots of Google News to talk about so we probably shouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I'm busy watching the interview. I can't look away

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just it just delighted me that there was some sort of parallel between Jeff and and Kim

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got we'll get the behind-the-scenes story on Sunday from Kara. I'm sure there's some stuff. There's some don't you think right?  There's a little something. Yeah. Oh, yeah  That's actually that body language isn't so bad. No there was that one still that got out and they were facing away from each other  I think yeah, I  Think I think knowing Kara who's a fairly sardonic  Smart but sardonic person. I'm sure she got the humor of it. Oh  Yeah, what was Jah Jah Gabor famous for there's a good example. That's good  At least Kim has a game and a hit TV show  All right, so so what should we do should we beg Google to send us Nexus sixes should we just  Turn I already complained I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Said I said the message to the to the Google I said I said I was gonna warn you when I complain  I said I'm a screenshot of the out of inventory  And he said he bowed back and said they proved to be popular

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now  You may say oh, come on Jeff, but let me show you this picture because we were  talking last week about  Inbox which is the Google email program Gina very kindly did pull some strings to get both me and Jeff  In box and we both I love it I don't want to ask you how you love it  But as soon as we talked about it, look at the tweet  Because we were speculating I bet these guys are watching as we talk about. Yep  There is the inbox team  Watching us talk about inbox with beer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I when Leo was trying to find something then he finally did find it  I said I imagine there were Googlers saying yeah  Great they give credit for who put the picture there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason Cornwell  Thank you. And and brilliant Jason  I presume is on the inbox team because his Twitter icon has a giant inbox low icon in his hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and these and there it is the little name tags there  I think that's him

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His desk too. Yeah the bearded guy  so pretty sweet  I'd be really impressed if they took a picture of this on the screen. Yeah, let's do inception  Can you take a picture of this? Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.  Of us looking at you looking at us  Just actually before we move on from inbox  Gina you what do you think a weekend now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so I haven't been using it full-time because my main email address is my Google Apps address  It doesn't work. It doesn't work with it. I  Mean, I I I like it so much that I briefly considered changing my whole email setup  So everything gets forwarded to Gmail so that I could use inbox full-time, but I just I just never got around to it  I just I'm gonna wait until it's Google Apps, but but I'm I'm sold on it. I'm totally into  Inbox zero. I love the idea of deferring messages to later to remind me  I just I think that the concept the app is beautiful the material material design  I'm I love so I'm just waiting for Google App support

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and Jeff you can't use it either because your mail is a apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thing is it's sending more  Alerts to my watch right from the account. I hardly use well you could turn that off. I like that. Yeah  Yeah, I know, but I like that. I mean I'm liking it. I just I just I only use it only once a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I have to tell you  I am in love  Really? Yeah. Yeah, I got to inbox zero  which I've never been and  Don't worry and with it with a cut like three three three check-ins four check-ins a day  I'm able to stay there. It's the only solution I've ever had that are actually really works  And all my mail goes through this account. There's no this is not like a secondary account. It's the account  So that's great I haven't seen any flaws it's like I'm not I don't think I've I don't think I've missed any mail  Because you really understand when you're using this inbox program. You're letting  Basically letting Google do the filtering you can add yeah filters, but but they do such a good job

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My worry is that I'm gonna swipe away some groups number of things  you know conversations that and miss something, but that was my same worry about priority inbox and  It's been great  I mean it's fine as long as I can sort of see control a little bit and trust based on my behavior  Which I've been using gmail  You know every single day for the past almost ten years now, I guess  I think if I get get past that then I'm gonna be you don't feel like you've swiped away anything or or missed anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Important you guys once I swept away something that I didn't that I went oops and it's in it's the top of the done folder  So it's easy to get back to so everything's there right? Yeah  Some weird stuff that I didn't really understand or wasn't fully documented to me for instance. There's a low priority folder  which seems to get  Everything I don't like in my responses. It's I don't understand why stuff's going there as well as done  But maybe if there's documentation somewhere. I just that's the other thing. I have not read any documentation. I've just used it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're a human being that's what people do they don't read the docs, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a us. I love it. I  Have found it to be exactly what I was looking for and you know emails so broken  But and and you know I we got to be fair this is based on a lot of work done by mailbox  Which is now a dropbox company  They use some techniques that outlook mail uses the sweep thing so it's a merger of ideas from a variety of sources  But I think they really did a nice job

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you use the app you get three invites I guess after using it for a while use those up right away

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and then I haven't tried yet. I haven't got an invite

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would send you an invite if I had one I'll send one to you Kevin  That's your reward for being on this show  Kevin you use gmail as your primary mail. It's not the apps version

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I use gmail. Yeah, yeah, and but I mostly use it on my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is really well suited to mobile. There's a web interface as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I see on the web on the computer and on the on the phone, but I don't live in email anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've stopped doing that yeah, I stopped too because it's so broken  Sparrow mail was bought by Google. I wonder if these are the sparrow some of the sparrow folks  That's right sparrow was a very nice app remember that it was Mac only

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really liked that maybe that and boxer was another one as well, right? Yeah  I mean the leg up that Google has is that this is a native client for gmail that can do the the the multi-tag things  Right I mean and this is the thing we're talking about last week is that with with gmail you could assign multiple tags  And you can nest them to one message right whereas the pure I'm apricot pop config  You know pop implementation is you know one folder so I think like this is the great thing that something like inbox can do that  Maybe other third part third party clients can't maybe can't do as well, or maybe won't implement as true to gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really just another way of doing gene. It's a it's another window into gmail. It doesn't yeah  You still can use gmail you can go back to the gmail interface everything you've done in inbox will be reflected in gmail  I can't tell you how happy I am when I go to gmail, and I don't see any I see inbox zero  I've never seen that I used to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Messages you get the sunny message the the sunny day go go enjoy your day isn't like a picture of a son

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I haven't seen that yet. I guess I'm not truly zero

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had this in the change log  But I might as well mention it now because we're talking about inbox the inbox app is now in the chrome web store  It's basically just a bookmark to the web based app  But you know if you want to add it to your apps page and  Yeah, you can just search for it in the chrome web store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For as a chrome book user  this is true of the new docs that the new drive and  One box all is you need offline support  Yeah, and this does not have a line right now fat, and I think that the new  Drive which all let's try that all that's pretty oh, where's the offline right to old drive right you can still have your gmail  Offline as your offline version of gmail. Yeah, you use that version, but you're not using one box

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well inbox, so you know that's the thing I use inbox when I'm online and I use it all the time  but if I got on an airplane, I'd make sure I  Oh, yeah stacked, but see I've processed my mail so fast now  It's not like I have a big bunch of backlog stuff to work on on the plane  Most of my mail is apparently junk  Turns out I didn't really have anything in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know we're using we use a slack at a think up to talk to my team to do team and it's great  And so we just stopped using email we only use slack so and now that I'm not really doing much freelance work  I just the email just doesn't matter as much  So I'm terrible at email now  And I feel a little bad about it because I wrote a book with a chapter dedicated to managing your email

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so bad now, but you wrote a gmail add-on that everybody used for a long time. Yeah. Yeah, I wrote better gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love gmail and of course like I'm never gonna not gonna have email  But the nice thing about slack and other messaging services is like oh these are folks that the whitelist that we were talking  About last week, you know these are the folks that I know need to get a hold of me right away  They're my teammates. They're my co-workers  And yeah, it's crazy. I was on the plane. I was actually coming back from San Francisco and a full disclosure  I should say I was at I was in San Jose this weekend at Google's  Mentor summit for their Google summer of code program. I was a mentor this summer  Yeah, and they and they they paid for my travel  And I actually never got to the Google campus. I stayed at the hotel all the sessions were at the hotel  It was a a meetup of open source  Coders was a lot of fun  I was on the plane on the way home and you know that the guy sitting next to me was on github and slack like  Work like he was a coder and I was like, oh wow  Okay, and and slack came up several times in several different sessions and it was it became it became so quickly this like ubiquitous  App that it feels like everybody's using but it uses it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well for me, I think it's it's a sort of private version of the  IRC plus wiki way of working which is how would we do the open stuff?  you know any open source thing will have an IRC channel that you go and chat in and standard stuff does that too and then you  have a wiki to keep the persistent thing and slack is just like a  Sort of private version of that so you have a chat room that you your stuff's in but it the neat thing is all the integrations  It has as well  So every time you touch anything else that sends a little note to slack and you've got a record of that, too  So I'm using it for a couple of different startups. I'm working with and it's great. This is Stuart Butterfield's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Startup that he of course was the founder flicker with katarina fake and it's nice to see Stuart do something new. It's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we have a hit. Yeah, it's a huge hit. It's a great. It's a really great app

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've been using because we use Jira at last year in Jira  For our with our dev team for the website. They have hip chat, which is kind of a similar  Solution so we do it all in Jira, but it's but I think I could see why people use slack. It's great  It's a great solution  All right, let's take a break  We've got lots to talk about as you mentioned to reorg at Google put Sundar Pichai in charge of the whole kitten caboodle  practically  We could talk a little bit about Apple Pay because when the write aid and CVS shut down Apple Pay  They also shut down Google Wallet and all other tap to pay solutions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll be delighted. No, there's news on the front of life stone shoots wrecked

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get your reggae out the life stone should crack continuous and  We'll also talk to Kevin about his article his blog post  He's gonna get just be prepared. He's gonna use the word fatigue again. So that's it. I didn't even say

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

He was in charge of Chrome. Is that how he started at Google?  It's been there a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He has been there a while I'm not sure so he moved from so he was Chrome then Chrome OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then Chromebook when Andy Rubin left  Android to go to do something with  Google X he took over Android  He is in charge of Google Apps and  Now Larry Page has announced they're gonna transfer  Leadership of almost everything else to Sundar Pichai. They sent out a memo  last week  Announcing this in fact the only things that aren't  Under Sundar Pichai is is YouTube  Susan Wojcicki is still running YouTube and reports directly to Larry Larry Page and that makes sense actually  And I want to talk about another article by Ben Thompson. We talked about it on  Sunday he wrote an article called peak Google on his  Blog Stratecary and one of the things we've been talking about a lot lately is that  Google reached the peak with search and search advertising  And one of the things you can definitely point to  We mentioned that last week on this show too  Yeah, really great Ben was great on Twitter on Sunday talking about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But and then I was talking with Jason Snow on Monday on triangulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really clear that YouTube was a brilliant attempt by Google to find the next thing and it is probably one of the shining lights  So it's interesting  I think I don't know what else is not in his purview. Maybe the investments the Google Google Ventures, but he's got

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got  That means here or elsewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got  Energy he's got access. He's got nest. He's got calico. He's got Google X. He's got corporate  I said to get eggs. Oh, wait a minute. This is what he didn't get. All right, I'm sorry. I apologize page  Continues so part of this said Larry said look I'm just getting to I don't I'm just all I'm doing is reading reports  So I'm gonna give a lot of this to Sundar  So page will keep kind of the next generation stuff access energy nest  Calico Google X and then kind of I don't know administrative stuff like legal finance ad sales will stay under him corporate development  He says page says I want to focus on the bigger picture and I couldn't do it with all the stuff I had to do  But what do you guys think but I I think is a very smart guy

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's you know, he's a Google guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  and he's  He's got a good reputation for actually building things that work inside Google and and that's a that's valuable. I think he arrived

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More more good at getting things actually done. Yeah getting things done is a good thing to have in a manager  I think he arrived ten years ago. He was he was at McKinsey went to Wharton School of Business  Stanford and the Indian Institute of Technology. He's from Chennai  Apparently Microsoft considered him for CEO. At least that was the rumor Twitter tried to recruit him several years ago  He is now  basically senior vice president in charge of all of our products  But people have been pretty clear that he's not on the CEO track  Except he is isn't he? I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somewhere. Yeah, I mean he he's obviously very well trusted  Yeah  And you know, I don't know what it's like to work directly for him  but it sounds like he's a guy who's known for building bridges and  Making things happen and I don't know. I always liked it like the it may be in response to see jobs  I sort of like the idea of the executive who's not a complete a-hole, you know  Like that there's like that that one kind of management style. I like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My brief interaction with him it was when  Chromebooks started coming out and I said I don't get it  I don't see why anybody would buy a whole computer that just is a browser and  Instead of getting pissed off which he could he's easily done or becoming defensive  We had a great conversation about why he thought this was a good market and he was right by the way in every respect  And I was wrong  But it was a very not it was a nice pleasant conversation. It was good. I was really impressed. I  Didn't know he was gonna become the guy running Google though. I would have been nicer to him  Maybe you could have gotten a phone might have been able to get a Nexus 6  Some concern and recodes article about this  By Liz and Kara  Does mention that well if Sundar is now in charge of everything what happens to other?  Executives who are now underneath him instead of underneath page and  Their conclusion is most of them are longtime Google loyalists and probably will not leave Alan Eustis and research  He's the guy  This is another story who jumped out of the bay just broke the record for  High-altitude parachuting. That's an amazing story amidst singal is in search David. How is it best bris?  Is that I pronounce it? He's a Google Plus social  Jen Fitzpatrick and Maps  Sridhar Ramaswamy on ads in commerce or is hold so on  Technical infrastructure they say these guys are Google loyalists and of course Susan Wojcicki herself who rented her garage  To the boys when Google started out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think I think that's why that's where Pachai being very well respected and a little light  You know comes into play right you're not gonna people aren't going to leave and and you know  He's not known for cracking heads he's known for getting things done  It sounds like page just needs more time to you know, do you sit around and think of big ideas, right?  Instead of file, you know go to TP at TPS reports

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll bet at some level if you're frustrated you can't get an answer from Larry. You can't get an answer Larry  Now, you know, we're gonna get an answer right?  Yeah, the problem with Google is what I hear from a lot of Googlers is it's far more like them like the military than I ever  Would have guessed really like this sense that oh, yeah that person's you know, I rank  G43 and then they took those other jobs. They'd be a rank G G, you know 10  Yes, it's it's I was very surprised at that. There's there's heavy ranking within Google's right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting you it feels like it's a flatter hierarchy than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's too big now. It's 50,000 people or whatever the numbers. It's too huge. What was it like when you were there Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um  You know they  Structure and those those kinds of internal rankings and things like that, you know  They have grades in different people in different grades  What they were good at when I was there was not  Having that bit that sort of grading be a reporting structure as well. The reporting structure was were flatter  So it wasn't that you get promoted through these grades and that that created the containment hierarchy. It was much more of a  team oriented thing for building things and they the management pathways  Reporting chains were relatively short and also that if you're making something new you did have to go and pitch it to Larry and Sergey  at some point so that was  That was part of the process there  but the the the drawback of that was that could potentially create bottlenecks and that was something that was  it was  Marissa Marissa Meyer for example had office hours  But she was very very busy which meant you had to queue up outside her door to get them in it for a time to  Get approval to do certain things so that didn't that sort of caused a problem with scaling at one point  So it you know, it's always a challenge with any of these management things is like do you try and build a  hierarchical organization or do you try and build teams that  Concur less and build things and it was trying was really hard very long time to keep it as small teams that work together  but a lot of the things that they do like making you share offices and things like that are designed to  Encourage that that sort of small team feeling as well as being part of the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're doing something right but it is a challenge and I think that's one of the things Ben Thompson  pointed out with Pete Google which as we we talked about the last week  But we also talked about Sunday is it's a real challenge  For any tech company the cycle cycle is so quick and it's the innovators dilemma. It's it's how do I be sick maintain my success?  today and  Yet plan for the future future which is coming at at, you know full speed straight at us  Search clearly  Is is being supplanted by something else social sort of I don't know what?  Certainly search ads aren't gonna last forever  Google hasn't really licked mobile. Although I think that's possible, but maybe that's not even the future of advertising  So and YouTube is a and Ben said this is shining light here  Clearly the future is bright for YouTube  Let me so Alan Eustis who is a senior vice president is apparently  watched with interest  Felix Baumgartner jumping out of a spacecraft  sponsored by Red Bull and GoPro and breaking the record for high altitude jump watch for the interest because  He actually been planning the same thing for a couple of years  And Google even said hey, we'll sponsor and he said no, I don't want to make a video  Hey, we'll sponsor and he said no, I don't want to make it too commercial. I just want to jump out of a balloon

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And he didn't actually want to wear glass while he was doing it. That was the thing. He didn't wear glass, did he?  He had a couple of GoPro cameras

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We there he goes  Unceremoniously attached to a giant balloon and they just let him go and they said bye  Bye  Red Bull and GoPro sponsored it. No the other guy Felix. They didn't nobody sponsored this. I was sponsored Alan paid his own money  Okay, I can afford it goes up 25 miles  It's 20 here. He goes. He's releasing now 25 miles  Part of the problem is that when you get that high it gets very hot on the Sun side and very cold on the other side  So they had to have all sorts. He's in a spacesuit basically. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Little life support system you've had built around it. Yeah, he's took him 15 minutes to come down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not a lot of work. I mean you basically you're falling the whole  Landings hard though. Watch he comes in for a little  But he's fine he's raising his thumb he made it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that different than skydiving  That let you know the landing oh, it's just a long fall and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There he is. Just fine  He couldn't so they had a switch for him to talk to the ground on the radio  But he didn't want to move because it was so hot  So instead of talking back he just twitched his leg. Yes once for yes twice for no or something. I don't know  It's a great story I love Googlers  They're fun fun people  So  Tell us about your article on  Your back to a payus a pig in e or whatever it is. So so my

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What like what did I call it?  I  Basically called it  How Twitter became the hate speech wing of the free speech party

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The hate wait a minute. Let's get this  Let's parse this the hate speech wing of the free speech party  So certainly Twitter is great for free speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  if you're and they've and that's the thing they've always been very good at free speech and that's been a part of their DNA from  Day one and it's something that they've they fought very strongly for  but that puts them in intention with the people who are using it abusively, but my  My take on it is that they've sort of  Gradually changed the way that Twitter behaves so that it so that it's much more of a useful platform for people to annoy each other  On than it used to be so when Twitter started the point was that  We did we it was you know the time of blogging we had blogs we had blog comments and they tended to fill up with  People trying to pester you and we had various ways to try and get around that  I can take some of the blame for building technology and making easy for people to  Write something their blog and ping you and sit on your blog  But also blog comments basically didn't verify anyone you could just go in there and shout at people and they were they were annoying  so  So the social network sites were ramping up because they said okay, you can only see things from people who you're friends with  And Twitter did something subtly different which was they created one way following  So they said you can publish things and you can choose who you're following and that's what you'll see  So you basically had to decide who you would see  But there wasn't this awkwardness of it had to be reciprocal. You had to be friends as you had to do on  Yeah, that was cool Facebook. Yeah  and  So that that the valence of that was was nice  But there were some subtleties that what it meant was that when you went to Twitter  Actually, you know early on you didn't even go to Twitter most of the time  It would come to your come to your phone  You would sign up with SMS and SMS would come to your phone and it was a kind of group SMS feel and the web and  They had the web version and they also had an IM version  It would patch into IM and you would get tweets through IM as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it it feels so so long ago that the Twitter stream could be encapsulated on your text messages or an IM stream?  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a few friends and that's and that's it and so you chose who to follow and then gradually we added think  You know, we invented ways of bridging the gap as users and then Twitter adopted them  So we started out with that replies where you where you had this group conversation  And as the speed of tweets sped up it wasn't always clear who was responding to whom so you put a little at in to  Say who you're replying to and Twitter adopted that and made that part of the platform, too  and what that meant was that  But even but then it was still a secondary place your your primary state stream was the note of the tweet stream  You've got you had to click a button to go and see the ads  They didn't get sent to you on the phone. They were just on the website  And they were  The other thing that Twitter did once they started doing them was that they hid  At tweets that started with an ad if you weren't following both parties  This is really important and that was and we grumbled about at the time because we said no  I like yeah, I like seeing who my friends are talking to right  But actually it meant that you didn't get one with back-and-forth bickering it down to town unless you were actually following them  So that was I remember grumbling about at the time  but actually it was a very wise thought because it preserved that sense of  The Twitter stream is the stuff I've chosen to see and the at is another place. I go and look  And they they changed that and then the next thing that happened was with hashtags now hashtags create another side channel because if you have a hashtag  You are creating a searchable place where people are talking about the same thing and then Twitter made that clickable as well  Which meant that you could  Migrate across  You know not not just people who were actually trying to talk to you but people who were talking about the same subject  So that create another sideways engagement pattern as well  And you know that was again it was users trying to do that and it was a mixture of trying to fill the things out and  Fill things in and it worked and then the thing that happened when Twitter was  Started building you know first independent  Building mobile apps for it and other third-party apps that would that would actually  Feed the app replies and make them more prominent and that was particularly for people who were trying to do like  public engagement and you know  Media type stuff with it or comcast trying to follow its you know people being annoyed about yeah or companies as well obviously  but  after Twitter  Decided that they wanted to own the clients and developers weren't supposed to make them anymore  They they defined how the platform behaved and one of the things they added was these pieces that that were  Not part of that original engagement so one of the nice things about Twitter was it didn't have an inbox  It didn't have an unread count  You know that we were talking about inbox zero and all that stuff  But that little sort of number in the corner that nags you wasn't there the app didn't have a number on it in the  phone on ios like no red numbers in red circles and one of the things they changed was that they made  At replies be notifications, and they also made them and the number that is shown on your phone  so when so now suddenly you've got an inbox again and  This this completely changed the balance of the structure of Twitter from your primary thing is this set of people you're following and paying attention  To and the secondary thing of these responses to making the responses that the biggest thing there now  There were you know there are reasons for them to do this partly it was they're trying to drive engagement  They're trying to get people to come back to Twitter understand it and one of the strongest ways to be engaged is having someone have  A conversation with you so that was what drove that  But what it means is that the actual valence of Twitter changed has changed a lot since it started and is now much  More of a powerful platform for harassing people for having flame wars and that kind of thing and you know Twitter knows this they  Part of the verification program  Was a way to insulate that the famous people who they're encouraging everyone to follow in their signup process  From this very back-and-forth process, so if you are verified  You you have extra settings that can say just show me a response from other verified people  And you can say you can also say just there  While the users can sort of dig through and say I'm only showing me notifications from people I'm following that's there  But it's fairly hidden. It's like three three levels down in the settings  With a bit of verify people it's more obvious and also as part of the verification program  They spend time working with the famous people to make their lives easier  And so what this what happened is gradually the sort of character of Twitter has changed and it's become much more like blog comments or  A public discussion forum or things like that where it's it's very easy to  To go and annoy someone and also very easy to cause a sort of cascade pylon and that's where we are now  we're now there with  With gamergate and with all these other controversies to go back and forth  Where it's very easy to create a set of people to go on a  Pester each other on Twitter and it makes Twitter feel like a hostile place  And it doesn't feel like the place it was because its primary mode is now  Notification and the notifications are from strangers as opposed to be primarily from people that you've chosen to follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a really easy way to throw tomatoes at somebody and and most of the and the mob by the way the mob thing is big  I mean, dr. Drew was here. We were talking about this and that's exactly we pointed out. He said really  You have to understand the human humans love mobs. They get sucked into it and mobs don't end until they draw blood and  That's what Twitter has become a mob facilitation tool sometimes positively  To rear square or the Arab Spring but lately not and and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the hashtags are a way of creating a group conversation about something and a lot  You know, they can be jokes, but they can be quite powerful things  You know, yes or women was a very powerful hashtag that it left was a flood of  People's experiences. Yeah, but what Twitter is not good at is  understanding the difference of valence between  The engagement that is positive and what you want and the engagement that you find abusive  And their reporting mechanisms for that are broken the way you report abuse  is  a multi-stage process  It's not spam is one click abuse is an essay question and then you write an essay and then it says well  If it's not you being abused we're going to ignore you after you've written the essay  So people learn not to use it  Is not getting the information they need to distinguish the abusive engagement from the positive engagement and they don't respond to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like in most cases and let your celebrity

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and so for somebody who creates one of these conversations starts at something that potentially controversial and they find themselves  They suddenly find themselves in a space Twitter usable their phone is beeping ten times a second  The the Mac client crashes because it has too much data and falls over  You can't get to the settings to change it. You basically end up having to like go private or leave Twitter  and  It's it sort of undermines the basis there and I think part of this is that they are being measured on engagement. They're being  Measured by Wall Street on how much engagement they can get  And that's something that they've announced the results this week and they their stock went down because apparently they weren't demonstrating enough of that  I'm a very direct connection isn't there?  Because the money they get the what it is advertising led. This is a bit like the stretchery thing about Google  For the brands this they do want this this is that the kind of engagement you want you want to start a conversation  You want to be able to track everyone down do that?  But if you do that as an individual you start this it can be overwhelming and the tools aren't there to distinguish the two

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of brands are overwhelmed too. They may say they want it then when it happens they go what the hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's yet that that's part of it and that that can be you know amusing and funny that  Be like when the brand tries to start a conversation about they get all the complaints right there, right?  but but that you know, but it's it's it's  It's a similar sense of not being able to distinguish these different things  To do it but it's also the other part of this is and there's a sort of broader point  Which is the problem with all of these social experiences is you start out needing more people to talk to so you sign up for the  New thing you have to find people to talk to you know  Don't get what it's for or it just seems empty and that that's definitely the problem Twitter has been new signups and they've done  work to try and encourage you to follow people but  That that can exacerbate the problem by getting you just just to follow Kim Kardashian or Justin Bieber or something  And so the only interactions you see are not the more personal direct ones, but these  Shouting at the the broadcaster type interactions. Um, is there a fix?  Um, it's not a it's not a simple fix  The problem is they they would need that what I'm saying is that this is a you know, it's a gradual change of emphasis  But the thing is now that most of people on Twitter haven't been there for seven years like us  They don't remember that original feeling and their feeling on Twitter is this  I just accidentally kick the the hornets nest and people are  swarming me and you know to the point where that  You know that it's I'm following some of these discussions about building  Separate social networks for people who are vulnerable to attack and so on  and their focus is all about building block functionality first because that's that's their that's their experience of Twitter because  these the experience of having a sort of  Semi public a sort of the the notion of the notion of semi overlapping publics was something I talked about in my original Twitter thing  2009 which is the idea that we're all publishing different bits of it and seeing different bits of it  And that's part of the value of it. It doesn't think we don't all see the same way  We don't all see the same Twitter  But we see different subsets of it and the things move gradually from side to side for that  And and and it took some work to do that  You actually had to repost things or join the conversation and spread things initially and over time it gets more efficient and more  You know easier for that to happen and the  Dangerous you cross the activation point from the I don't have enough people talk to to have too many people to talk to and it's far  Too easy to go through that hump and it's quite hard to get back from it  and so the the attraction of  LO and  And  Some extent attraction of some of the indie web stuff is that we're building another one of these groups  Where it's still in that early stage and we haven't got to the point where it's is is too swamping yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I do have to point out that LO very quickly added blocking  Yes, it does seem like the first feature you want they're not holding that out that one on premium for premium users  Well, I agree 100% with you Kevin. I don't know if there's an answer, but I think that you you nailed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you. And one of the things we're doing with  Indie web is is trying it one of the things we built with any web is is the idea of distributed conversation and web mentions  So the idea of a web mention is that if I mention you on my blog post  I send you I send your website and notes saying I've mentioned you and your website can then display that at the bottom  so if you go to like this post I mentioned the  Kevin master calm slash Twitter hate speech  You can see all the web mentions at the bottom from people who've discussed it because I've got them hooked up  and this stuff that's  The problem we potentially have is that we will hit the same problem because there isn't a filter in that  So the thing we're trying to work out for this in the web mention in the internet community is what we're calling vouching  Where the idea would be that when you send a web mention the moment where mention is hi  Here's my URL. I pointed to your URL and then you can go and pause it and see that I actually did and decided to display it  And you could apply a whitelist blacklist to that as part of the processing on your site  That's up to you. We don't define what you're supposed to do with it. We've got some tools that help  But we're also want that we're adding a third parameter, which is of what we're calling a vouch parameter, which says if you don't know me  Here's a place where here's someone that you link to who has linked to me. So it's trying to say  Friend of a friend friend friend of a friend thing so that but is actually machine possible friend of a friend so you could create a  Automated whitelist blacklist rule that only allows friend of friends in  and that's that this does not seem to be a problem on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook or Google Plus is that why not is it because they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Recipient controlled because because yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well Facebook and Google Plus have the bi-directional friendship graph rather than the directional friendship graph. That's one part, right?  You can't you can at people on there  But they they they also they don't have the commitment to showing you the full fee that Twitter has had right  They are saying we're all we're always filtering your feed  We've been deciding what to show you already and we've got a bunch of knobs that we adjust to decide what you see  So with Facebook unless you explicitly go and star people they don't you don't see all their posts  You only see whatever Facebook decides were popular or if they have congratulations in or whatever  You know this they've got a bunch of there's a there's a running joke on Facebook  If you want people to see your post you start it with congratulations  But the the  So they're they're already doing  High-level filtering to decide that now Twitter has got bits of this the part of the notification settings in Twitter are  They have this  tailored for me setting which is a wonderful piece of opaque tech speak which means  We will show you some of the things that that are people replying you or whatever, but not all of them  But it's not clear what they're doing there, and it's it's not a coherent setting for people to choose  And I don't think they have all the signals they need to work out what what's abuse and what isn't though  I know I'm sure they're trying very hard to try and understand this but without the ability to say  Directly to them this was abusive  you've only got the block button that says block everything this person ever says in future and  Even if you do that, you know that that's only reactive is key. You can't say  Block everyone who is sad as a tack isn't a friend of mine  You've also got mute which will which will do that without informing the person that they've been blocked  But both of those don't necessarily block other people retweeting them things like that. There's there's leakage in all of those  And to some extent there's always going to be some kind of leakage in so far and the reason that you know  Twitter get grumpy about this is they say well people gonna you can't when you block someone  You you're not hiding your post from absolutely unless you go private because they can always go to the website without logging in and see  your posts, you know, so you know and  Mark Andreessen has brought me on Twitter for arguing with him about women in tech  So if I want to read his post I have to go and go directly to his page and read it  Or log in as somebody else and read it  Or but I'll still see them if somebody else retweets them  So I get this sort of weird like one piece of a 20 20 line post that he's created

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never see it all I don't understand why anybody would post anything thoughtful and lengthy on Twitter as a storm  It's a strange thing to do. I'm a separate thing. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's actually if you actually look at them  He does it right in that here if you reply number them  You number them and then you reply to each subsequent one from the previous one  Yeah  So it will you will get a blue line down the side and you can see where the ones hidden because of the numbers  So that does work and the value that he claims to get from it is that people can comment on it line by line  Which is a you know, there's some something else we're trying to hack on on any way with web  A nice feature in IndieWeb. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but the but the but the point is that  I'm straying a bit  But the point is you can't absolutely block people from seeing what you're posting if you're posting in public  But the the valence of it is you don't necessarily want to block them from you though  That's that's a nice side effect  But you do want to block seeing their nonsense and being pursued by their nonsense most of the time and that's the piece that's  Sort of off by default and is you could the question is could Twitter go back to the default of not not notifying you about  At replies or tuning that they could they could adjust that but I suspect that would do worse things to their engagement  Than then they're expecting and also that would involve changing a setting which means at the moment that  The user would individually have to change that setting or if they changed it globally. They'd probably get a  Revolvement so they're in a kind of sticky place to to try and fix this  So I was trying to sort of narrate the history of this and try and think it through  For how we design future things but also to understand how we got to this point in the first place  That was that was the part of that person. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean the issue is people harass other people on Twitter because they know when they at mention that person that the  That the subject is going to see that tweet, right?  And and so that the sub the the person who's being harassed can block the person after the fact  But the harasser gets the satisfaction that this person saw what I wrote  So to take the teeth out of that you you know  There could ostensibly be a setting that says only show me in my mentions column people I know  I'm not private but only show me people I know or you know make it so that you know someone who I don't know  Can't address me or be be in my space or you know show up in my mentions tab. I mean, this isn't totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I mean that one that that's a shame. It would not be a shame if  if that were the case I  agree with you technically absolutely it's a clever view but  You know people do just out of nowhere  Most people who I mentioned me out of nowhere are nice decent people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fall to the schmuck I mean absolutely I agree but you know what at some point  I was getting so many at mentions that I set my mobile Twitter client to only notify me like only send me a push  Notification if it's some if it's one of my friends who mentions me right like that. I want to see right the others  I'll just I'll get later in my mentions tab  You know what I mean? And that's and that's something not everybody has this problem  Privilege right and there's a problem  I have because I have a lot of followers because a twig and because a life hacker  But it does feel like oh this person's not gonna get into my mental space  You know unless I've whitelisted them and and I and this is what you you are you were advocating for this  Some degree in last week's discussion of email

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Green with you. I'm just I'm just lamenting that that you know what you said last week and what Kevin has just said  Have this to burger troide what's become of Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right right  But that's the thing is it's been a gradual change  It's a setting you have this is like four levels deep in the settings is you have tailored for you from anyone or off?  That's no dimensions and photo tags  And the problem is there isn't a Justin people I know there now  I think if you're verified one of you guys is verified. I think I'm very fine. I think we're all  Right. Oh, yeah, okay. I think you get a different setting there. I think you get from from verified people as well  So have a look and see  But so there are there are different. I don't want to go to Twitter  Well, just do it on I did it on the phone because I don't want to look at Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do have some really terrible people Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Notice how many other how many notifications in this list and these have been incrementally added over time and this is four levels deep in  I've had to click you have to know to click your account and then notifications  it looks like a single parameter setting and then underneath it is this and there's a set the things to turn off and  News and other and what are these things?  I turn them all on this device because it's not my phone  So I want to see what they all are on my phone  I've had to turn a lot of them off and there's this I get weird ones, which is  Random person has just joined Twitter. Why don't you welcome them? I know I hate that right  And that's true. That's one that's one of the others and the point is, you know, they're trying really really hard to drive engagement and  And  Encouraging to that and which means they've got a large team of people who are growing the ways of making it more engaging  and  there are they're sort of  Kellen put this very well once he said you're in asymmetric warfare with yourself the point where you're trying to sort of make people's  Experience better while you're also trying to improve your signup experience and auto suggestion and flow means that  Every time you improve blocking unless you also make it hard to make a new account  You're stuck because and they will just go away and create new accounts to harass you with or write bots to do it and retweet them  So it's a it's I'm not saying it's an easy problem. I'm saying it's I'm saying it's a hard problem  It's a structural problem with a medium  Because it's you know, systemically  You do want at that point where you don't have anyone to talk to you do want to gain people  And then at some point you cross over to this place where every time you touch it  Something that just makes you back away from it again, and it's very hard to get that sweet spot in the middle  And I think they sort of stumbled into getting that right initially because of the following model  And because there was there was some resistance there, right?  But in turn in this, you know in the in the last three years where they've been trying to ramp up engagement  they've got the  They've got they've sort of gradually lost the folk memory of that as the number of users who've joined have not had that experience  But also the employees have not had that experience a lot of people who work at Twitter now weren't around on Twitter  You know in that in that period and don't have that folk memory of it being that kind of place and assume

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just what it's like. Yes, not and that's but it's always happened. I mean in  We just sound like old farts. The well was really great. Remember how great the well used to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the stomach said this is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, or copy-serve or whatever it seems like all social networks eventually descend to this and then you just have to move on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really interesting. That's the big issue. We need that Leo's law

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, name that Leo's law see how long that lasts

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think this is part of the thing with email as well, I mean, you know  If you're my age you've been using email for 20 something years  And you remember when it was the place where  The only thing you ever saw in your inbox was was helpful things of people you were excited to hear from or someone who'd found you  somewhere  Through some complicated process and was asking an interesting question and it was it was a lot  Right, yeah, and you know you use that was the same use if you go back, you know 30 years  Use that was like that use it was a place where you can have these public conversations and you could assume  By default that anyone who's who'd found their way into their  Initially was it a university or was was associated with it was that was part of the filter in the same way that that was only  Facebook filter and that the conversation was good and it was you know  cancer and seagull inventing spam and deciding to post their green card lottery nonsense to every use group on newsnet that sort of opened the  floodgates there  because it was a you know, it was a deliberate exploitation of this public resource and that the  You know blog comments is the same ten years later  It's like initially we were just posting comments to each other and then eventually people's  Started using it to harass people and then the bots turned up and started spamming everything  And it's it is this sort of structural problem of of how you build these things in a way that are resilient to this  But are still capable of growing and that that is okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin I go back to the thing I always say at this moment. What are the two things where?  channel make Elgin right now  What's true proof? He argues that it's Google Plus and Facebook to some extent why because the user has more  The recipient has more control. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am now getting every single day my Google Plus the same guy spamming a bunch of price a price list  He's putting in all my community. It's not me. He's just he's just doing it  I block and spam him every single time and there's no disincentive for him to come back the I  Believe fully that it isn't the tools that Google Plus offers you it's that it's new and is it could be  It's just a matter of time. I I will stand by Leo's law. I think it's a bit of both

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That they it's not just that it's new  I think there was a tendency for things to go in this way in and it is you know  it is harding treachery the Commons or whatever, but the the tragedy of Commons was somewhat mythical because  People do find rules to actually govern Commons  And that was the you know, that was if you actually look at the literature of this  The tragedy of the Commons was a thread of them  Actually people have managed common land very productively for thousands of years because they come up with rule sets that the menu didn't overgraze them  And the challenge for us is is is the same thing of building these systemic structures rules of engagement  That means that we can have a common space that that it doesn't get overgrazed or doesn't get overrun and  This is not straightforward. This is hard and it is very hard to do it with mechanical rules  You do need people the other article this week that was fascinating  which was I I can't know where I read it, but you'll probably seen it was the  The the long article about all the people who are employed to take the nasty stuff  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, although ron ron on all the android last night said that he was at a concert and kind of you know  Bounce, you know bopping to the beat that would count maybe not bopping  But then he got a notification on his watch saying hey, you've hit your step goal today

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His name is arturo behar  And he has the job of teaching  The site's users particularly its teenagers how to be respectful to one another  And I really liked this  He is director of engineering for the facebook protect and care team. There are 80 people on that team  He says most users are not trying to be mean  And will retract a comment and even feel bad about it if they realize it caused someone harm you might have seen on facebook  If you see a picture  Of you or a comment on your stream that you didn't like there's a button that you can click in fact  I should do it. Let me let me complain about something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So good at this. I don't know if this is enabled for everyone. I feel like well, I don't get all the features. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think if you're a teenager, you might get all the features, but let me um, let me find a picture of me  first  pictures of you and let's say  Here's a picture of me, let's say for reasons I couldn't understand I didn't like this picture of me  Whoops, let's go back to it. I think I can complain about it  I go to options  and  Is it report photo? I guess it is. Okay  Help us understand the problem. Why don't you want to see this photo? It's annoying or not interesting  I'm in i'm in this photo and I don't like it  Okay  Click continue. Why don't you like it? What's a bad photo of me? It's inappropriate. It makes me sad  It's embarrassing. I'm gonna say it makes me sad  Well, you know what and I love this the best way to delete this photo is to send a note to the person who posted it  And tell them why now this is not the pros  That nick reported in his article this the pre-fills this one with hey, I don't like this photo. Please take it down  But if you're a teenager, you might get some different  phraseology  so  Facebook has started giving users a list of emotions like embarrassing to say why you want it removed  You know my normal reaction. I think teenager normal reaction would be to go if you get rid of that you ass  But or maybe even that sounded I sounded like jeff for a moment there  But  They say  Face when facebook in early versions of feature only 20 of teenagers filled out the form when facebook added more descriptive descriptive language  Like feelings and sadness the figure grew to 80  We've played around with having pre-populated messages  Versus no message at all. If kids are given a blank box. Oftentimes they're going to say things that are not going to be helpful  including cursing at their friends when facebook offered more developed responses like  This post is mean. It makes me feel sad and I don't want it on facebook  85 percent of teenagers who wanted a post removed sent the message  And what I think is very interesting is it's not merely that they want people to be more civil  I think they're trying to teach younger users

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Emotional intelligence. Yeah, I mean this is mindfulness, right?  Like this is like someone else's articulated your feelings and you're like, yeah, that's it and it works. They go. Yeah, I I do feel sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is what I love local perennis  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pretty great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not you know  Maybe we're not teaching our kids because I know we're not that good at it as an adult. I'm very bad at it  How to respond in this kind of mindful way?  Sometimes I think what would the Dalai Lama say up yours you bozo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the heat of the moment when you're overcome with emotion and you feel attacked or you feel vulnerable  Which we we often do when someone says something or post something about us that we don't like, you know  It's it's it's very difficult to have that kind of distance and perspective and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Therapists always say use i-words tell us how you feel about something not  you know  Criticize the other person say how it makes you feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's what they're doing. Yeah, this post is mean. Yeah, it's interesting right and it's criticizing the post and it makes me feel sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want it on facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that good? Oh caring for your inner child. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, um when facebook asked people why they shared a post that hurt someone else, this is also interesting  90 percent of respondents said they thought their friends would like the post or would find it funny  Only two percent wanted to provoke or alarm someone else. Wow, come on. Maybe they're not admitting it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  I have to think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think though there's some truth in that I think that  Digital media do not communicate nuance as we know this very well  And loads of jokes are often lost in translation on twitter and on facebook, right?  I'm, not sure I disagree with this  They one of the reasons you see stickers now they say is because they're trying to put facial expressions on stickers  So another way to help you express feelings and be more empathetic  Next they're going to experiment with sounds  Imagine sending someone the sound of a grunt sigh or a giggle to communicate your feelings about a post  I think this is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the point about about fatigue is is it the meaning of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No fatting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fatig is and I looked it up it is fatigue  Ae how do you pronounce ae?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, oh, all right  It's phonetically ae that it leaded ae. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the  The is that it is um a communication that the word is not there for meaning but for emotional  communication so  So when you when you say  How are you you're not saying tell me your medical history you're saying I care about you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This reminds me of that story  Um, the the facebook comment that ruined a life  I put it on the rundown right below the the the mr  Nice story, but it was about that teenager that posted a really badly executed joke  About shooting up at kindergarten  Oh god, yeah  And went and went to went to prison and suffered like extreme abuse in prison and it was a joke  Yeah, yeah  um  Which was just an unbelievable story in every single way  um, but yeah, it's it's interesting, you know, we  You know, we built these communications mechanisms and you know that that aren't face to face and now we have to sort of make  Them as face to face as we can possibly make them so that humans act like humans

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I do really think sounds like size  Are a great idea and stickers so you see people's faces  This is quite a story and it will really depress you so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry. I didn't mean to be a downer  Yeah, and it's old news, but it just reminded me of that

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but that was that was that was very distressing because um  It was you know, he did say something very stupid and and you know, but it was  It was a trolley conversation with a friend and you read it on the face of it it's all in caps and it's horrific

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because text doesn't communicate any nuance  You don't get the sense of what he was what his you know, you don't see this, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tilted the head of the smile. It's sad

Transcript:  It's still gonna freak people out. I know. Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, do we care about the fire stick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or fire amazon has announced a basically now. It's more like the roku stick  Than it is like the chromecast. So don't get scared kids  But it's priced like the chromecast 39 dollars and if you're a prime member

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty soon you're gonna be able to get a fire phone for 39. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now the fire tv, which is 99 and the fire stick are I think functionally almost identical. They don't have obviously the voice search  You do get a dedicated remote you get there is voice search with this there is  Oh  You say what you want and where do you say it into the remote? I guess you say into the remote. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh  Yeah, not bad, huh and the fire phone is a buck. Oh, wait a minute. No, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Simply say what you want to watch and start enjoying it seconds with the free app or amazon fire tv voice remote sold separately  so the remote that comes with it doesn't know there's no there's no mic in that remote, but  You could use your app on your phone. So there's an app for it. I guess I should get this  I still haven't hooked up my fire tv  So, what do I need this for it's the same basically right do you have the gaming  You get netflix amazon, of course hulu plus crackle amazon music iart radio spotify

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tetris  Pba bowling challenge sonic the hedgehog too. That's pretty good  You don't know jack  So yeah, that's kind of I mean the price is what's interesting about this  Yeah, 39 bucks  And if you apparently were on the stick you'd have gotten it for 19  And does it has all the family stuff too the kids yeah has the kids stuff  So all you need is the phone  The fire tv remote app which does not require a fire phone  Thank god  You know what's not on here. It's interesting  Are the two new music streamers that are streaming  uncompressed cd quality sound  And the sonos offers those and that's kind of intriguing  They're 20 bucks a month though and the trend for streaming music like spotify  And beat seems to be going down not not and google music not up  to five dollars seems to be the  the bottom  Oh, there is one other story that actually might affect us  Microsoft today announced that they're going to offer unlimited one drive storage if you buy a  Uh office office 365 subscription, which is as little as 70 a year  Unlimited not one terabyte not five terabytes unlimited  I happen to have an office 365 subscription. So I immediately signed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so  Can you hotly can you gonna host your shows there now? I think we should

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now available on one drive now uncompressed hd video  It's not the size it's the bandwidth that gets you that's what she said so, uh  Anyway, I but what I think is interesting about this is that this is very competitive space google started it by dropping the price  of google drive storage to almost nothing  and uh  Microsoft's competing amazon's competing dropbox is the one caught with a squeeze

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think right because it's their only business and they can't subsidize it. Yeah, right  But the advantage they have is that they are actually truly cross-platform  Whereas everyone else has got some kind of place where it's hard for them to do it. I put one drive on my

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android phone and it will do the automatic upload thing just like everybody else does of pictures and documents and it seems to work pretty well  apparently, uh  Mary Jo Foley was saying that uh office for android is imminent  So, uh, yeah, so if that's you know an office for the ipad's pretty sweet  So office for android comes out you've got the automatic photo backup  I don't know. This is a little bit of a competitor

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I spent I spent a bit of time trying with office 365 and that's always for the desktop by the way last half of  But the but they have a web-based office, which is which is good. I thought is that the web-based added

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the web-based stuff is good and it feels like feels like dogs  But if you actually try and use the apps you suddenly start with locking and whoever's got it open  Nobody else can touch it and you get it all gets confusing again, right?  so it's it's interesting so they've  They've managed to fix the website of it and get quite good at that  but they're still stuck with the native apps on on windows and mac where  The app doesn't have a concept of two people editing at once  So it feels like source code control from 15 years ago  You have to check out the file and anyone who's touched it  Means nobody else can touch it and you still have to merge it  Whereas the web-based side of it and I think the iphone side of it  They it has that google docs you feel to it  so it's it's interesting that the you know that they're they're keeping those legacy apps because that's the  You know, that's the thing people are used to but they're having to sort of work really hard to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and what's neat is that the office the office.com apps?  Work on a chromebook they work on a mac  And they're good  I mean, I suppose there's stuff missing. I'm sure there is but  It's pretty amazing an html5 browser. You've got  you know a  office  for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the value is people who really really like excel spreadsheets, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because word processing is pretty straightforward. It's excel. It's the unique. Yeah, I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually the word the other the people who really love word are lawyers who really like track changes because no one's right  um taught them about git yet, um  And merging so that they they their sort of workflow is all in that and I bet  The only time I have to use word these days is when I have a legal  Document that I have to send changes to and I have to go into their workflow for a bit. That's right. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  baby  All right. Let's take a break when we come back. We are going to get your picks of the week  So everybody prepare  Right now i'm going to prepare for betty buy time. I'm putting on my jammies because I got my new  Casper mattress  I don't know if you've ever uh gone mattress shopping  Of course you have who hasn't if you're a grown up you've been mattress shopping  And it's kind of crazy to think that you could go to a mattress store  middle of the day lie on a bed  With your clothes on looking up at the ceiling and the and the sales lady staring at you  And think that you could in any way judge whether that bed is right for you. You can't  Casper  Kind of counter intuitively sells mattresses online. You might say well  Then I really can't try it. Oh, no. No, that's what's great about this. You have 100 days  to try it  You can free delivery painless returns within a hundred day period  So if you don't like it after three months, no problem. They'll come and get it  Here's our casper mattress. This is a queen-size mattress that came in a box the size of a small child  I know because after the mattress was out the small child got in the box and started playing with it. It's a wonderful box  Uh, this is the mattress they give you a nice little tool. It's wrapped in tie-veh  By the way, no outgassing. It does not have any odor. It smells great  Uh, you and the reason I mentioned that is because it's a latex mattress with memory foam on the top and you might say  Well, it smells great and look at this. It's oh  It's comfortable. Oh  It's I don't know how they do it. It's soft on top and firm in the back  It's just what you want in my opinion  It's it's firm but so  Ozzy even loved it and uh, it's great for a great night's sleep, but you do get to try it off  Also, it sleeps cool, which is really nice  Casper is an online retailer premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost. We're talking 500 bucks for a twin  950 dollars all the way up to the biggest size the king size  And you'll save an additional 50 bucks even ozzy likes it  As one of our audience members by going to casper casper  Dot com slash twig and entering the promo code twig  This is one of those things that really works great. I love it. I liked it so much  I got one for my son in his uh, it wasn't his dorm room. He moved out of the dorms this year  He's a sophomore and he has a new house and we were all thinking  Well, how are we gonna get the a bed for him and I mailed it I had it mailed in a box. He loves it  He loves it  Casper dot com slash twig use the promo code twig and you'll get 50 bucks off any mattress for a guest room  For a college kid for yourself. It's a really great  Solution it is not you're right. Somebody in the chat room said shouldn't it be 100 nights? Not 100 days. Yes  You have 100 nights to try it  I spent a lot of time on my casper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We love you. Thank you be good  Be cool  Let's get a tip from kevin. I think you have one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've obviously got i've actually got three but let that's um fire away  Let me let me go through this. So I just got told by bear about this if you go to the internet archive  They have emulators for old games  so if you go  Archive.org slash details  Slash console living room. They will have have emanated the games there and they're actually trying to work their way through all the different  Um things and they have javascript based  Virtual machines that that run the game roms and things like that  That's probably one of the projects they're doing and they're starting to try and do this with um  CD roms and things as well. They get they're gathering those so their goal is that um by using emulation they'll be able to  You were to play back some of these these games  Some sound frogger. I got frogger  But how do I how do I move but this is this is this is not the frogger machine  This is like the atari 800 playing frog. Oh, I need a joystick  Low-spect machines. Oh, yeah, it's 2600. Yeah. Yes, 27  That's cool  They they there is  There are there is multi-archive machine later, which um actually plays real roms from games, but yeah  Yeah, but then you've got to go and find roms which are not circulated because they're um, they're copyrighted by the companies  So that's that's hard. But but the point the point is that they're trying to preserve everything. Um, so I  I was inspired by that by two things today. One was the internet archive has finally changed their um ui  so  um  If you go to internet, I think you have to actually go to a through a link how internet archive.org  Archive.org slash new or something. I don't know if i'm where it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If this goes sega i'm gonna go crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Archive.org slash v2. So if you do archival slash v2 you get a new  um  2014 i'll get everything there. Um, you are to the internet archive  Oh  It looks pretty and modern and has like that interest pinterest tidy thing going on  But it's still got the round corners, but much more images  um  So that inspired me um to go back and look up my first website  so I did a um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm playing this on the web by the way. This is in a browser. It is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, unbelievable  The this is the point is this is this is the you can do everything in javascript thing  So it's basically they're using asm.js and they're compiling the emulators into javascript so they don't rewrite the code

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They actually are emulating it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um  So layers of emulation. So, um, it's the 45th anniversary of the arpa net today  Happy anniversary and it's the 20th anniversary of the w3c and there's a big gala performance going on in  santa clara this afternoon  at um  And I link that from my post so I this made me go back and say what was let me see if I can find  my first webpage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh  Look at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My first webpage which was from 1995  I'm not exactly sure where in 95 because this was on my company's homepage that I was working for at the time. It was a  mmscorp.com slash tilde kevin marx, um  And I posted photographs of my son after he was born in 1995 and then didn't touch the page for two years  Um, but that was just long enough for it to get into internet archive  And which started crawling in in 97 and now he's in college  And now he's in college. Yes  Wow, so so but the the thing so select  I was actually pleased that I could find that and I got away with it by I by didn't have the internet archive because a lot  of people lost the first webpage partly because  Um companies shut down and deleted them. Yeah, um, and part and the internet archive didn't start crawling until  97 and so if he was if it and if they didn't manage to catch it and then it would go away and gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I was what you want is the way back machine and you need to remember your old url, right? Yes  mine was  slash tilde

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Laporte, I think well, I looked up mmcorp.com which was the the company website  Um, actually look at that. That's that's quite a that's quite a thing in its own way  So you have to go all the way back to 96 to look at it because it's somebody else bought it after we shut down  Yeah, um  All right. No, you know i'm looking at my old screw you i'm trying to find my site

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it yesy. It's uh, okay. So what's which one should I look at? Um, mmcorp.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just the whole thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there's a lot go back to 96 because somebody else bought it afterwards. No 96 has nothing 97 is the first one  Yeah, february 20th  1997 ladies and gentlemen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's just I love that. I just love the retro design of this man

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We thought this was cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This was that was a bit. This was pretty this is pretty nice because it's moving cool in 97 anything that moved on the web  Anyway, so buried somewhere three levels down and that was my original site  Which i've now dug out and preserved which is pictures of me and my son  So that was that was my I think everyone should should go go and share my first webpage on twitter the hashtag my first website  Uh, what did I do my first webpage? I did page. Okay, because it was really just a page

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could I just search for my name or do you have to search for a url?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to search for a url so you have to know where it was. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CRL.com maybe it was slash tilde leo laporte  Maybe a slash tilde leoville

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nope it's fun though to play with this and so they started in 95

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're about to look back at any url

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They started crawling in late 96, but they weren't doing very comprehensively  It's basically based on the alexa search engine was the original stuff before they started calling on their own  Um, and i'm not sure how comprehensive they're the early years of the crawler  But they've got they've got better over time and now the other thing the other tip is that you can now actually tell it  To go and crawl something which is handy  You can say I just posted this thing go crawl it  But you can also say I just linked to this thing go crawl it and that means that if the thing goes away  At least they've got a copy too  very neat  Um, but the actual the actual app tip I have um, and this is i'm sure this is an app you've seen before  Is is plex.tv? Do you know plex?  Mm-hmm  Which is basically it's you run it on your machine at home and it's pets up a server for all your local media  But the thing that I found is they now have very good chromecast support  um, so  You set up the plex server at home  um, and then you use your phone to serve the audio and video you have to your chromecast around the house  And you can then watch your home movies or stuff you've bought from um, apple store or other videos you have  um and and watch those on the on the chromecast and that that was um  I've been using that a lot recently  I was really impressed with how smooth they made the experience and how much nicer it was  Than the sort of the the google play experience to some extent you have to have a premium account  I think though, right? Yeah, you have to you have to pay five bucks for the app  I think and then it works  So the server you run yourself and you pay five bucks for the app  And I I found it worth it because it was it made it much that process was always like  I've got to go and copy this somewhere and i've got to open the browser on the on the mac and share it to the thing  And this means you just run the the plex server on the mac that has the hard drive attached  And then you can use your phones to send it to your chromecast. So that was my

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually actually useful video sharing tip and this is a tip from our chat room  Travel to the past of the web by right clicking pages and links. It's called memento. It's a chrome  Oh, that's cool plug-in  You'll set the date  Me for time travel and then right click on a web page and say  Get near  And you'll see what the page looked like  From around that selected date now. It works well with wikipedia because it's been around for a long time  But it would only work with a site that is has a continuous history, I guess  It's must this must tie into archive.org though. Yeah, it must be not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it does. In fact, I see the way back machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I found a very early version of my first company site, which was nj.com in 96

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nj.com  And so are you going to post that on twitter or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your social network was my earliest my earliest was called rain or shine. It was it was the first version of nj.com. What year was that?  It was probably 95. That was definitely early 95

Transcript:  And everything I post on my blog now I post on there too. Good. Yeah, I noticed you posted it everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, that's part of this is the indie web thing of publishing your own site first and share elsewhere  So I I said, okay, i'll post it on my site and then it's like oh  But I should post it on my known site and I should post it on my blog  That's the problem and I could put it on a medium and you know  And it's a lot of that is still fairly manual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it a lot. I used it to post some of my uh, london pictures and so forth.

Transcript:  Well, that's the challenge is is is that we're working on in the indie web thing is and this  Is what we're talking about?  um  The web mentions and vouching and things like that  We we need to be able to read things as well as write them, right?  So we need we need to read a half of this and now that you know, that's part of what  Um twitter brought and facebook newsfeed brought was that you read in the same place you're posting right?  um, and we need to bring that to the web too and I know the known guys are working on that but the challenge and  And if you if you if you use known as a group blog if that works now because you can all see the people who  Are in the same blogs post as you and that's one of the use cases  They've been finding a lot of traction from from groups of students and people who write together  But the challenge is can you then subscribe to people elsewhere as well?  And how do we make that work and and the sort of getting the mechanism for that, right?  um  Is to some extent it's it's reinventing the the blogging subscriptions and readers and things that we had before  We want to try and do that in a way that that sort of plugs in with the social web too. So that's that's  That's an ongoing thing that's going on. Um, and I know that the known guys are at internet identity workshop this week. Um, and  Talking protocols and specs there and the other thing that's going on this week is the three c  Meetup in Santa Clara where there's lots of spec work going on there. That's where I was yesterday  So there's there's there's lots of  Trying to keep the web. Um the web is is a lot of what this is about and that's um,  I'm getting encouraged by that. I said somebody wrote an article that was um  Um going back to the web that was or something. I don't know what it was called. Um  The great web 1.0 revival that was it. Oh, yeah, I love that  Um, which was which was talking about these sort of indie web type things and tilde club  um, and you know an lo which has a graphic design style like that website of mine from  1996 um  And it's it is very much this sense of oh, right  it's going back to that point where we remember that the  The group was still just the nice people and and because we hadn't hit the explosion of the trolls yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's tilde club. This is such a great story. The guy spun up  a amazon web server instance just one machine  and uh sent out notes saying  Uh, it's a terminal here  If you want to set up a webpage put a webpage on here and of course you can only handle a few hundred pages

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's literally  It's paul ford who's um  F train.com  Um, and he also gave a great speech at um, xoxo, which I think was posted this week, but  What is he literally said? Okay, why don't I make?  um a  Web a web server like we had back back then 20 years ago  And so he did and the thing is now it's like it's costs him like, you know, 10 dollars a week  To to have this up and running at amazon because it's the small thing  But he can host hundreds of people on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said he knew he'd made it when somebody found him went to his house and slipped 24 under his door to thank him  For creating tilde club. And of course one of the ethic the kind of the ethos of it is no images, right? It's all ascii  No, no, no, it's a web service. So there are well there are actually there are quite a few images come to think of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It depends but the point is that is that you're using a web server of that era pretty much. Yeah  So you're trying to fit that it's running a patchy. Yeah. Yeah, so when it's images, it's like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right don't ask for an invite he's closed

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's full but but he says what is one of the things he says they're doing is they're putting together

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do how do you set up your own one? Yeah. Oh, by the way, one of the nice things about tilde club. They've got a web ring

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember those if you remember web rings, then you need to be back to the web one point. Yeah  Some of this nostalgia probably is misplaced. You might admit that kevin, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um  I don't know. I think it's the part of the point is it's trying to read a scup  it was the thing I realized that made me write that post about twitter was that the  Conceptual environment is different on twitter now than it was  You know even five years ago when I wrote the first twitter theory post  Because the stuff has changed and people's mental model of it has changed with that  um  and  You I think going back, yes, somebody described the indie web group as the sort of creative anachronism for the web  Yeah, you're just just reenacting the medieval web. It's a renaissance fair for the web  Yeah, but but part of the point is is that there were a set of things that we did  then  That had assumptions around them and trying to recapture those assumptions  Then we can examine them in the light of what's happened since and say there were good things at that  There were good things at this  How do we how do we make a you know a new web that brings the best of both and that that's you know?  Indie web is not like um thou shalt thou shalt never use twitter  it's how do we plug our own personal sites into twitter in such a way that um the website will still be around in  10 years time even if twitter's come and gone by then and that's that's that it's sort of it's that long-term thinking  But it's also saying we want to take advantage of the pieces the communication methods and things that are here now because obviously twitter  Is great. I i'm not attacking twitter with this poster with indie web stuff  I think it's wonderful and I want it to stay great and part of it is is helping  You know think about how to do that  How to make it part of the web not something that fights the web?
