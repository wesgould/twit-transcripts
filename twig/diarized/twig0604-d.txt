It's time for Twig this week in Google.  The show we cover the Google verse, which includes at least in my view,  the Twitter verse, the Facebook verse, the journalism verse and all the other verses.  Here's the man who is the master of verse, Mr.  Jeff Jarvis.  He is getting ready for the show today.  Wow. He's got a book called Moral Panics.  If you didn't write it, that they picked the wrong person.  He's the Leonard Towne Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig  Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Who wrote Moral Panics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's one of the classic texts, Eric Good and Nachman Ben Yehuda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. I didn't realize there was a whole book dedicated to moral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I've got a whole shelf here on it.  Yeah, I'm researching. I'm researching.  Watch out. Watch out world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, you can see the video at Hands On Photography.  That's right. Show also with us.  I'm already feeling sad because you won't be with us next week.  Stacey Higginbotham. Why not?  Stacey and I are out in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She abandons us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's abandoning us.  I have to take my daughter to the neurologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh. But I'll be back.  Oh, I'm sorry. I hope it's nothing serious.  Oh, no, she has migraines like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, she got it from mom.  I know. I'm such a jerk.  So my daughter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  my daughter was having these weird things, but they weren't headaches,  but they were weird spells.  And I took her to the neurologist, even though she's 29.  She wanted me to come along.  So I said, OK.  And the neurologist said, Oh, yeah, you're having migraines.  She said to you the day before, do you have these symptoms?  She said, Yeah, she said, Yeah, that's a migraine.  She said, But I thought a migraine had to be a headache.  She said, No, it doesn't.  Not necessarily.  And and then I said, Wait a minute.  I've been having all my life.  I've been having migraines.  I just didn't know what I called them. Sick headaches.  I had no idea what they were.  So apparently I gave them to my daughter.  So it's it's a nice kind of.  You're both nice work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're both migraine buddies.  I'm sorry, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't had them in a while.  In fact, the doctor said and you've I'm sure I know you've tried every remedy  of the book, but she said, you try QQ10 and magnesium.  Yep. And I've been taking that forever for other reasons.  And apparently that's that's fixed it.  So I haven't had a headache like that in a long time.  But I used to get these come on.  And then I would take, you know, I would take a few Advil,  usually four and immediately go to bed and I would wake up a few hours later.  Fine. And I thought there was just stress headaches or something like that.  But she said, no, those are probably migraines as well.  And you gave it to your kids. I gave my kids a big nose.  Well, I also gave them that.  I gave them many, many, many things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to informally meet your daughter on Instagram here recently.  She shared something on her Instagram that I just thought was.  Oh, that's nice. Quite inspirational.  Oh, that's nice.  That was my first time really interacting with her.  But what she shared, it was it was heartwarming.  Oh, I'm so glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something about what a dick her dad is, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. I thought you were going to say you saw my daughter on Instagram  and she's not allowed to be on there.  So I was going to be like, how old is your daughter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How old is your daughter? She's 14.  How old will she have to be before you let her on Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, she could do it now if I could see her posts as long as I can follow her.  But she doesn't really have an interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After our story from last week about how middle aged men  can no longer contact underage children on Instagram, I don't blame you.  One cotton picking bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she still she still wants to be a spy.  Remember, y'all? So she's she's keeping her face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's youthful, youthful.  So, Jeff, actually, I might as well start with this.  Sent along this tweet about TikTok and how easy it is.  We were talking over the weekend about why the youngs love TikTok.  And what I didn't know is that a lot of what people do in TikTok  is all done in camera.  You know, my son, who does a great TikTok channel, he does cooking on TikTok.  Oh, yeah. In fact, I'll I'll show you the link.  It's sodium underscore deficiency.  I have no idea. Interesting.  What the youths these days.  And it's hard to find him because he doesn't have his picture on it.  Yeah, look, it's so hard to find.  I got a 404 women. Let me  let me type it right.  He has a he has a picture of somebody else.  Not his picture.  But but so he does all these food things on TikTok.  And I'm like, why don't you ever cook these for me?  Oh, my God.  These are this is me.  I had no idea.  You learn everything you learn, you learn on YouTube.  So there he is. So then I asked him, go ahead, Hank.  Go ahead. You go, Hank.  So then I asked him, so how do you edit?  He says, well, I did it in Premiere because he's like learned  how to edit right in the old days.  But look at this. This is a TikToker.  I don't know who I don't know her name is.  So even there, Eden Harves, H.A.R.V.Z.  But she's going to show us how they edit in camera.  You can do all this stuff in TikTok.  And if you've ever seen TikTok, you want my trick also is to hold down

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the red button and let go when you want to stop filming.  That is the best way to get it slick. OK, let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we call that we call it in camera, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where you're. Yes, there are some things you can do in camera  for us, a transition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But watch this. This blew me away.  Now, you tell me if you could do this in your camera.  So she's playing music.  And here's one thing that's really cool is TikTok pauses the music  so you can you're matching the music as you as you do it when you when you don't record.  So that makes it a lot easier to do that.  Yeah, that's TikTok magic there.  What she's doing with a hand, watch this.  So she's just moving the camera around.  She's doing a face wipe and stuff like that.  But somehow, TikTok is I guess they're putting in transitions or something.  I don't know. You'll see.  Watch the final version, because I don't  I don't understand how you get from what she's like.  It's my music. It sounds like TikTok magic.  It sounds like something they're doing in the ad.  Now watch.  So she's showing it as she made it.  See how she's doing a wipe with her hand.  And TikTok is somehow maybe that's all TikTok.  It's like she takes her head off.  That's amazing. That's beautiful.  Isn't that beautiful work? Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good talk magic there, because you can do in-camera transitions.  A lot of cinematographers do it pretty commonly,  but they also do that with the idea of knowing that it's going to go into  premiere or resolve and they're able to sync those cuts up to where it looks,  the way it did right there.  TikTok is just using AI and saying, hey, this is looking like a good cut point.  And I didn't even know.  But I think she kind of did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She might have done it all in camera. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think just by hitting it off, then she's turning off at exactly the moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  when her hands. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If she gives it the exact point that it needs to transition,  I think the app is smart enough to know this is a cut point. Right.  I think Instagram is trying to get along that same path with Reels.  I haven't quite figured it out yet, but I have been trying recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll give her a plug. What's her what's her account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I have to look it up again.  It was Eden, E D E and great.  Yeah. Well, and this is by the way, I mean, in TikTok, I have to say it's  there are people, a lot of it's just dumb.  You know, women showing off their bodies and things.  But there is some stuff that's really amazing.  E D E N H A R V Z.  Eden Harves.  Here's another one. Taylor, as we're doing TikToks,  Taylor Lawrence tweeted this out.  She says Queen Grandma of edits.  Watch, watch, watch this one.  This will make you this will make you realize it's not just for the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, clearly, she's using an editor to do this.  This is not as beautiful.  But this is where TikTok really is kind of amazing.  I see this effect a lot as rotoscoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think he's doing that on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, obviously, she's not handling the phone.  Look at that. Queen Grandma.  That was impressive, wasn't it? Yeah, very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I spent the whole next hour just watching TikToks, which is what people do.  No, we cannot. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to admit this.  I don't want to admit this.  But if you scroll enough on TikTok, they actually put a slide up  with a guy saying, OK, you've you've been enough.  Really? Yes. Oh, yeah.  Oh, they do. You spend enough time on TikTok.  Take a break.  Oh, nice. That's really embarrassing when you get to that,  because that means you've spent a lot of time scrolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the equivalent of Netflix like, are you still watching this?  You know that you should not be watching nine consecutive hours of television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you think you need some sunshine right now?  So tempting. So tempting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been watching. I was never in a car racing, but I was watching.  But I saw some TikToks of pit crews in Formula One.  And these guys, three seconds, they change all the time.  I'm watching this. I said, that can't be real.  So there's a really good series.  It's in their third season now on TikTok, on Formula One racing.  Drive to survive. I can't stop now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that. I was hooked.  I was just talking about this yesterday. Have you ever seen it in real life?  No. It's it's it's that docu-series, the camera work,  the lighting, the editing, the sound design.  It is worth watching it just for that.  Forget the stories behind it.  But that whole series is like watching a trailer.  If you turn on the movie trailer, it's got the same.  Very tight. Oh, gosh.  But that series is I love it. Oh, I'm glad to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I told Lisa we have to go to Monaco next year.  Oh, take me.  No, here's what you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's actually a tech story there, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is this sound? Is this me?  It must be me.  Yes, you sir. It's me.  No, I was I was playing Caspi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My favorite ones.  There's this woman.  Are we boring you, Jeff? What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's going on?  Is Jeff doing his own show now?  I can't stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The internet is addictive, you see.  Yeah. And it's designed for this. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you doing, Jeff?  Jeff, eyes, eyes ahead, please.  Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You hear me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you do with your kids, with your students?  You must. I mean, you're doing so, right?  It's graduate school.  OK, so it's assumed that they're paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And plus, Leo, I just kind of by my presence demand their attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, good. Apparently, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's one young woman on on TikTok.  I'm going to find her and she she looks like she's about 21.  She has a voice as if it comes out of  the 1940s.  Is she from Israel?  No, no, no.  She's just unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm glad I'm actually glad that the Trump administration didn't dismantle  TikTok. I mean, maybe they're spying on us.  I don't know. So who cares?  It feels like there's such creativity going on.  And it's so vital.  I really think it's great.  And I'm sure that's the same on Instagram and Snapchat and elsewhere.  But it's really a very exciting place place to be.  So, Stacey, are you an F1 fan as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just told everybody in the chat room my story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You said F1 center operations are baller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really is.  So I because when F1 came to Austin, they pitched me all the super computing  stories, right? Oh, I'm jealous.  They have an airplane.  They have 24 hours to set up what is really a legit entire data center  cabling racks of servers, racks of media translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Garret's figured this would be the angle you'd find.  This is perfect. This is perfect.  They're right here.  But look at the racks of the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I'm the same way.  That's what blew me away. Stacey is you think it's motor racing,  but it's a lot more.  I mean, it's so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Precision like underneath each track, there's a whole I mean,  this is the IOT angle, but there are sensors and all of that has to be  calibrated, but they do it all.  They have 24 hours to set everything up.  They've got an entire plane that only does the data center stuff.  And then they've got 48 hours to pack it away.  And then they fly to the next location.  They do the whole thing again for the whole season.  And it's just like watching the pit crew,  except it takes a little bit longer because, you know, computers.  But that's awesome.  Watching the directors and the cameras and think about the guy who's directing it.  He's directing the shots live.  And it's so fast.  And he's just I mean, there's oh, it's so awesome.  OK, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm with you because they have so much data coming off of the vehicle  as it's going around the track.  And they can analyze that within seconds to say, hey, you know what?  You have a left rear brake starting to heat up.  And the driver has no idea.  But everybody way back two miles away around the other side of the track knew it.  And they can assess it and fix it.  And it's always magical. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder how what the what the reaction is from the from the nerds  to the Grease Monkeys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The nerds love the nerds and the Grease Monkeys are very similar.  They are. They you talk to like Adrian Cockroft, who is the head of Amazon's.  I don't know what used to be at Netflix.  He's a huge F1 fan.  Lots of lots of our nerds are huge F1 fans.  And I mean, the cars themselves are architected.  They've got wind tunnels. Most of the F1 teams.  There's actually a formalized rule about how much supercomputing time you can use  like analyze your car.  Yeah. So I mean, this is it's a highly technical discipline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's what actually literally what drew me.  I mean, you do see, although, as Ant points out, it's edited like a trailer.  So it's you don't get to, you know, really glom into it.  I wouldn't mind a single episode of just the data center or a single episode  just in the pit crew. But it is you see that you see they have all these screens  and six people wearing headsets and they're sitting and they're  staring intently at the screens. There's so much data.  We had never turned around and look at the track.  Yeah. We had a sponsor, Tibco, which sponsors the Patronus F1  race car. And they're a data company.  That's why they sponsor it, because they processing there's more than a terabyte  of data coming off of this car and they're processing it in real time  so that the the you know, the driver and the and his crew can  can know what's going on and what's happening.  It's really it is. It's very impressive. Yeah.  Does each team have a plane with the equipment or is there a single?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. That's so there's one plane for the whole race.  OK, I mean, each team has God only knows what.  But the data center is for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see. Yeah.  And the team brings their own stuff. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And then the team has their own stuff, but they all hook in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's they get onto the same backbone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's all meet in Austin this fall for the big F because it's the only USF  one race, although we've had F1 demos here at the Infineon raceway over here.  But I would love to get a Petaluma Formula One race.  We stayed when we were in Monaco.  We stayed on the hotel.  It's on the hairpin. Oh, yeah.  Yeah. But there wasn't a race going on.  But I would totally say I think we might have to go back.  I have a friend made a lot of money when his company was sold to America online.  He spent it all on F1 racing following the F1 circuit.  He blew us. He literally blew it all because he loved F1 so much.  He went to Bahrain and Azerbaijan.  He went to Bahrain. He went everywhere and followed it.  Wow. I didn't realize you were such a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it. I love it.  I stepped away from F1 for a while.  I used to watch it back in the 90s  when I was a lot younger.  And then I just sort of stepped away from it.  But I got back into it about three years ago.  Crazy. Three or four years ago. It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where do you go watch it in San Francisco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there is no the only race in the US in Austin.  Just the one that's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the only one in the US.  Yeah. Oh, wow.  It's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although then they opened one up in Mexico City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it's in Mexico City as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Austin's really upset because now it kind of split the audience  because they're kind of close together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. They're not that close together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In Formula One racing world, it was it was a big controversial decision.  Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we should do a Google story.  Oh, yeah. Oh, does he insist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've been talking about data.  Oh, this is it. Look, I don't care.  I tried to take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see I took F1 to a technical level?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This show is about whatever the hell you guys want to talk about.  It's it's a democracy.  I have I mentioned that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not this week.  Wait a minute. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just like certain states right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So flock.  And actually, I wanted a plug for Steve Gibson, because yesterday  he did a whole segment on flock talking about  he actually used the EFF anti flock piece.  This is Google's proposal to replace third party cookies.  Flock stands for Federated.  Oh, heck, I'm a legion of cohorts, federated something of cohorts.  Is it legion of cohorts?  And the idea is that instead of having individual information about you  that Google or other companies collect via third party cookies,  it's it's much more anonymized.  Apple does something called a privacy differential privacy,  which seems similar, at least on the surface.  Google will put you in a cohort.  So it's unclear how many cohorts there they'll be.  The proposals in its early days, there might be as many as 16000  or 32,000, it might be more.  But the idea is based on your behavior online, you're put into a cohort.  And then when advertisers buy, they'll buy a cohort.  They'll say, well, let's see, I want 25 to 54 year old men in northern California.  No, they won't. No, they won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Today. OK, I just I talked to an expert today who knows about this.  He said, no, you're going to you're going to.  His example was you're selling Doritos and only through experiment  do you find that flock number B 135 works with three people,  but you don't know who they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you don't even know their attributes.  You just that's what he said.  So who gives you that information?  Google says, well, your ad worked best with B 135.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or you figured it out yourself. Right.  But then the other thing is it is it's not permanent.  You today I can be B 135 next week.  I'm in B 766 based on changing behavior, based on changing behavior.  I don't know what. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't see I don't see any real problem because not only are you not  personally identified, but even the cohort that you're in,  it's nobody knows what that cohort represents.  It's not Republicans, Democrats.  It's just a number. Right. Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's my friend, David Gehring, who who knows this stuff.  He has a company called Distributed Media Lab.  And and he understands this has done really well.  So I was just on the phone with him earlier today talking about this  because there is a lot of oh, dare I say it?  I don't know. Perhaps.  Fun. Moral panic.  OK. Going on about about  this stuff. And but but he said  that it's it's it's very complicated when I when I figure it out.  Now, the other problem is that so if you're Doritos, he said,  the problem is that you need to buy a whole bunch of things and figure out what works.  And I think that's going to be expensive.  And so I'm going to guess Google's going to have to help you out.  If you're the media side of it, I don't know how you  maximize yourself for flock.  I don't I don't get it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, step.  First off, differential privacy is a little bit different.  I just want to clarify that.  Good. Please.  Differential privacy is when you have a data set and you insert  random noise into the data set to make the aggregate data harder to deidentify.  Oh, OK. That's one.  Two. I just was like, wait.  And then with flock,  my understanding was you could buy you.  You actually could find a cohort that would identify with your message.  I guess you're saying, Jeff, though, that you won't get any details about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. You. Oh, yeah.  You mean I don't know what it's not like you say  you can get women 25 to 29.  I don't think you can do that.  You don't think you.  I don't know how you if given a certain number of.  I can't imagine every advertiser has to test against every flock.  That's clearly just me.  Sounds like this was a 10 minute phone call.  So I'm no expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So because my understanding is it's based on like my behavior  for a week of web surfing lumps me into a cohort.  Right. So whatever.  Like if this is the week I'm researching, you know, fitness equipment,  because I'm going on a diet and I'm, you know, obviously  Googling data centers and the latest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then you have some country where Pepe and you give up because you say,  this is so good. I wish I'd listened to Jeff long ago.  I'm going to eat this every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I've got all of that.  Then I get lumped into a cohort for that week that's  that's related to that next week.  If I go looking for migraine  cures for my daughter, then I might be in another cohort.  But I'm pretty sure that you have some information related to the cohorts  that will help an advertiser figure out.  There's got to be something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's but it's it's really but but but yeah, it's very limited.  Whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yes and no.  It depends on the size of the cohort.  And Google has said that the cohorts won't be too small.  But like if I am looking for, oh, what is that asbestos?  Mesolol, the the symea or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mesolothemia. Yeah, the asbestos disease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. If you're in a small enough cohort, there is a worry that if you've got something,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it'll be apparent what you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll be relatively apparent that there is someone who is worried about,  like whether in Seattle and Mesololophus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you got to limit the size of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You also you want to.  But see, they're so this is, by the way, a lot of this is undetermined,  which is why it might be a little confusing.  Google's testing it to figure it out.  But you want to make the cohorts big enough  so that it's unidentifiable, but small enough so it's efficient  because you want an efficient buy, right?  You don't want to buy people to see your ad that don't want your ad.  So it'll be interesting.  I think they're still trying to figure this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I tried to talk Google into this years ago when I when I argued  I actually wrote about this, that I wanted Google to start to share data  with publishers, but obviously there were privacy issues.  But I said, you could say, hey, that guy likes video.  You might do well if you just show them some video about the news.  The other might work for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing that's important is this is done on browser.  This is so whatever your surfing is, Stacy,  it doesn't leave your browser.  You are the cohort is built within the browser using on device  private processing.  So your Web history is completely private.  It doesn't come out of it.  So somehow they must have a way, though,  of putting you in an affinity group.  Well, they're telling me Al is learning, not Legion.  So that is a federated learning way less.  Yeah, I like the idea of marching with my flock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I have my own uniform for B135 and we march into war together.  Our legion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's ad buying tools will use  the APIs from the privacy sandbox as part of the privacy sandbox  to enable relevant ads and measure effectiveness.  There is still work in testing to be done, and we're right in the middle of it  right now. Marketers will be able to use their own technology  to identify high value flock IDs.  And we expect ad tech platforms, including Google display and video,  360 will accept such ID lists as seed lists.  So I think you're you're right, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It somehow you have to figure out that works for us.  Find others that work like that for us. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you buy ads.  You know, I want B135 and B72 and B.  So it's a big goals. Yeah.  By the way, flock is all part of a bird oriented naming convention  started with Turtle Dove,  which Chrome introduced last year,  which allowed advertisers, publishers or ad tech companies  to leverage their own first party data.  So that's the other thing.  This now first party data collection as opposed to third party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Jeff, what does this do?  Because obviously, when we talk about like anti competitiveness in Google,  we think about like the idea of them being in the middle, right?  The middle man kind of bargaining against the advertisers  with flock. If they have they know who the cohort is.  Is it an open standard?  Do other like because then you have to go through Google's ad engine  to reach these people who are.  No, it's open standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is an open. They're hoping others will adopt this.  And then I guess one of the things you could do is  you could query visitors  as to their flock ID and aggregate that on your website and go,  you know, we get a lot of real.  I don't know. I don't know about that.  Advertisers can use their own machine learning algorithms  and predictive analytics capabilities to make decisions  on what audiences or interests or cohort IDs might represent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It almost sounds like you could test a flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God, it'd be a test flight.  Apple's coming after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple's not going to like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Co-ordinates dynamic updates every seven days, as you said, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's useful to have somebody on the show for like  to explain this to us next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need a good flocker.  You want to get that guy that you just don't get that guy.  See if you can get that guy.  Whatever his name is.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind kind of getting because we're clearly  in the dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think part of his concern, too, is that is that what you have going on  is you have the this this this kind of knee jerk reaction against it.  And what Dave and I just talked about was that  we've got to have a conversation about what is the ad ecosystem we want?  Because everybody screamed cookies are evil. Right.  Wall Street Journal started with what they know.  So everybody told Google, you've got to get rid of cookies.  You've got to get rid of it. So they met this.  And everybody said, oh, that's not it.  And we do have to have targeting of some sort.  Otherwise, I think that's part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so. Yeah, I think part of the EFF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, EFF doesn't want targeting of any kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They they want to their their argument that they're making is.  This is this is the same road that we've been on and takes us,  continues us down it.  What if we stop because enough people have said, hey,  targeted advertising isn't all that useful to people.  There's not a lot of data saying that so that it's actually  better than billboards on the highway. Well, that's actually  that is up in the air for people.  So they're saying if it's not that great anyway,  why are we risking so much of our privacy to continue down this path?  What if we do something else?  That's true. That's what they're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I don't know if that's a fallacy, Jeff, because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. How do you figure it's a fallacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here, let's go with data on ad targeting. Point one, point one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't stand the the as a consumer benefit.  The ads that I see on TV irritate the hell out of me because they're just  they're just for the same for everybody. It's mass media.  I hate mass media. I despise mass media. Point one point two.  Advertisers, I know, because we we lost our advertising in mass media  to targeting because clearly it is more efficacious for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're facing that too, because a lot of our advertisers say, well,  you don't have enough information about who we're buying the ad for.  We won't buy you. So that's that becomes a problem.  At least support for media.  Stacey, you might be right that targeting doesn't work,  but advertisers think it does and they demand it.  So for whatever reason, you've got to satisfy the advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny. I was just on the phone call with my mother a couple hours ago.  She sells ads for TV, right? Right.  And shout out to my mom's and hey, mom,  she just survived the big layoff that was mentioned  with Sinclair.  And so that's it's been a discussion far as,  you know, what's going on?  How are they going to be able to sell ads?  Because currently what's out there is just not not fruitful for me anymore.  When we start talking about tracking and things like that.  And as I got off the phone with her, I saw the rundown and saw this in there.  And I said, hey, you might want to watch the show today because this is going to  be some topics of discussion for today.  But the other article is in there.  I believe it's line 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you have to worry about the lines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Line 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She eats lines.  Well, it's of use to no one.  Is this?  Except for me.  Yeah, but we're wasting our listeners time telling them what line number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, no, no, you waste more time saying, where's that story?  I can't find that story. Is that story in the rundown?  Jason, you put that story in the rundown.  We can just tell you it's line 20, Leo, and you're there.  OK, when I say that, tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like how it touched on just the pain of the post cookie  post cookie pain for marketers is what is what is titled there.  Because during my conversation with my mother, she was talking about a website  that she went to and she went back to that website and clicked off  just to see what would happen, because she's expecting to see certain ads.  And she brought that up to me.  And I'm like, really? You're a nerd like that.  And she says, yes, that's that's my job.  I need to know your mother.  How do you talk to your mother that way? Targeting?  Yeah, I talked to it that way.  Call her a nerd.  Yeah, I called her a nerd.  But but she mentioned retargeting just as this article is talking about  retargeting and how it's screwing some people up from a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because retargeting the media company could.  From the marketer's perspective, you can follow that person.  Was it food interested all around the darn web?  From the media company's perspective, at least you added in  some data value along the way.  You modified yourself as well.  But at least you played in the larger market with more advertisers.  Programmatic.  The problem here is programmatic.  Programmatic commodifies all content and media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So traditionally, TV ads, which are to a broad mass audience  and this somewhat true of newspaper ads and other mass audience  ads are great for brands.  Like if you're Procter & Gamble or Coca-Cola,  you're trying to get your brand recognition out there.  It's brand advertising. Actually, not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that no longer true?  So I had a dinner with a bunch of advertisers.  I mean, I'm having to say about a year ago,  but a year ago, I was stuck in quarantine.  So it must have been about more than a half ago or two years ago.  And they said, no, no, no, no, no.  Now we use the Internet to build direct relationships with people.  Far more valuable. They prefer that.  We don't care about media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But does that mean they're not buying TV ads anymore?  It depends. Somebody's buying them.  It's funny. I mean, when you see, I mean, when I watch the 24 hour news,  as I suspect you do too, Jeff, and it's all drug ads.  So the big pharma know, I mean, look, I don't have  any of the diseases they're talking about.  But for some reason, they've decided it's worth it.  Because that's an old audience that probably isn't on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, folks watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they do watch television.  The median age of CNN for a decade has been over 60. Yep.  So who buys who buys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do young people watch?  Do they don't watch TV at all?  They don't watch anything live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing. That's another thing.  She brought up is they're not watching anything live.  And she's in the business of selling those mass media spots,  but she's also on the digital side of things.  So she's always been quite interested in how how we do things here at Twitter,  as well as how other companies are doing it.  And and that was one of the things she brought up was just with its live shows.  It's pretty much dead in the water.  The money is going to where it's a week, a week or less from from an agent.  We do. So when you buy an ad on a tweet, we charge for the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't remember the first 60 days or it's a limited period of time,  even though that ad is burned into the content and will stay forever.  We only can charge for a limited amount of time. Right.  And the number of impressions generated over that amount of time.  But lately, advertisers really are saying, look,  agencies mostly say this, not individual advertisers.  Most of our ad sales are through agencies.  They say things like, well, we got to know more.  We try we're trying this system. It's the best we can do.  I don't want to. We can't track you.  If you're listening on an RSS feed, Spotify can track you.  Right. If you're using a Spotify app, they can tell something about you.  But we can't because you're using we're everywhere.  And it's RSS. So we're using this system when  you download the file, you'll notice if you look at the  original URL, it has a has three redirects in it,  one through a company called Chartable, one through a company called Podsites.  And then I think Megaphone is the third one.  Megaphone. And depending. Yeah. Depending on the show.  And what those companies do is is to me is the is the best we could do,  which is they know as anybody does who sees the download, they know your IP address.  They don't know anything more about you, but they get your IP address.  And then they they hold that.  And we've made sure that these companies do that.  They hold this tightly. They don't let anybody see that.  But then the advertiser who is buying this service  then sends them a list of IP addresses that visited their site.  And then Chartable looks at the two of them and says,  30 percent of the people who downloaded this show visited your site.  That's that's I think a very mild form of tracking.  It doesn't I think it's OK.  But but advertisers at least want something like that to know  because they you know, we do the direct response stuff and all the ads,  but that's kind of a limited effectiveness for a variety of reasons.  So they like to combine that with this idea.  Does that seem all right to you?  I mean, it seems like nobody's seeing your IP address except a first party.  And in this case, the third party that holds it tight, Chartable,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a middleman that tracks it. I think that's the way we got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Timberlake is the only way to go from a privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It may not be adequate, but it's it's the all we can do at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When I worked with a company that Full disclosure,  I invested a little bit of money and not that I had best much.  The Timberlake was involved in that was kind of his dream is you'd have a trusted  party at party that could maintain that data in a way that was now.  Then then the next piece of that is, can you give me as a consumer  some kind of visibility on that and control on that would be useful? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the way flock works and this is and again,  the reason there's some confusion is it's a draft. It's a, it's a moving target.  The draft specification, according to the FF says that your cohort ID,  Stacy, you visited these sites this week. It's, it's by week.  Although there is language that says currently, so that may change also.  Your cohort ID is available via JavaScript.  So as you go around visiting pages,  um, besides your IP address, your, that,  that page you're visiting can get your cohort ID. Right.  It doesn't reveal anything about you personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can give that to a sell side marketplace and stick it out as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think people are also concerned that you could reverse engineer the cohort  ID to understand like what type of surfing I have been doing up until this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't want to do a monty anonymize those.  Um, and then, so this is what EFF,  uh, says the first issue is fingerprinting. Uh,  Google has promised the vast majority of flock cohorts will have at least,  you know, a thousand or more users.  So a cohort ID alone should not distinguish you from other people like  you, but it's still is another data point for fingerprinters.  And because it's in JavaScript,  a fingerprinter can ask for that along with a bunch of other stuff that might  help finger point fingerprint you.  So they've by just the flock alone has narrowed you down to some pool of  thousands. Uh, Google has acknowledged,  this is a challenge but says they plan to solve it as part of the broader  privacy budget plan having to do with fingerprinting.  Um, this is,  that's one issue is that it's another data point that can be used to, to,  uh, uniquely identify you.  The second problem that the EFF talks about is cross  content exposure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So a company that can identify,  it knows your cohort and then it can offer another,  a form of identity like log in with Google.  It will be able to tie the information it learns from flock to your profile.  So even though it changes every week,  it may now become part of a larger dossier that you would accumulate.  So eventually Stacey, if,  if you're using log in with Google or some other system or just log into the  website,  they can accumulate every time you visit more and more of your,  of your flock IDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't this the problem with GDPR is the GDPR says that an IP is PII?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well,  Google has decided not to test in Europe and they say due to GDPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If, if, if, if what the scenario,  you'd shave would require matching a string of flocks with a set IP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's two concerns. There's one is who's the, in GDPR,  you have to have a data controller and it's not clear who the data controller  here is. It's not Google.  And which will serve as the data processor and the creation of cohorts.  It's not Google or your browser. It's something, some third party.  And then there's the question is,  is a cohort ID identifying information like an IP address would be?  So yeah, these are, there's a lot of,  it's tricky because Google is not completely clear on what the spec is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well,  it's also tricky because Google already knows so much about you.  So if you think about something like flock, I mean,  I tell people not to do like log in with Facebook or log in with Google.  I think you should have your own logins if you're really concerned about,  I guess, cross contamination between sites.  But even so like Google will know who I am and where my cohorts are,  if I'm in their browser or if I use their products,  because they're going to see me coming back to like my Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. That's a perfect example of they have both your flock cohorts and your,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's a huge question. And they can collect advantage.  Does Google have in this? Well, not just Google, anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, is Google in a uniquely advantageous position?  But no, but the point is a like button could query your flock ID.  And so every time you go to a site with a like button,  you're sending your flock ID and be, if you have a Facebook login cookie,  your Facebook identity. So they can, they can aggregate this dossier.  And it can be over time. It could. So this is the,  the privacy issue that the context,  you know, the shared contexts or cross context exposure, privacy issue.  And that that's significant.  EFF says you should have the right to present yourself to any given site in the  way you want.  And it shouldn't be based on your past browsing history or your flock ID or  anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's what's, that's what kills media because you go, you know,  a frequent visitor to the New York times now is like five pages a month.  And, and so in that they can't sell higher value advertising.  It's going to hurt journalism badly.  If you, if you, if you were to demand that as the standard, because then the,  yeah, I mean, I get it,  but the only relationship I have with you is the,  is your direct relationship with me? Well,  nobody has much of a relationship with any site except for data,  big platforms like Facebook. Yeah. So Facebook in that,  that equation Facebook says, sure, regulate away. We win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we'll, I'm sure we'll be talking more about this effect.  If we can get a flock expert on, um,  maybe we should wait a little longer until the flock settles a little bit  because it is very much in flux. But, uh,  a lot of questions. There are a lot of questions. It's flock flux. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to say something very important. If she's watching,  aunt's mother, thank you for aunt. He's a wonderful person.  Yeah. We love it. Good job. Good job on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And did a good job on it too. Yeah. Thank you. I don't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if y'all want to talk about this,  but I saw it earlier this week and it related to stuff we've talked about in the  past.  There was a study out by a company called spark Toro.  That's a marketing firm. And they said in 2020,  two thirds of Google searches ended without a click.  I saw that. You know, hold that thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, just see, just if you're going to do that story,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it got majorly debunked. Okay. Just hold that thought.  We'll talk about it in just a second. Stacy Higginbotham,  the website Stacy on iot.com sign up for a free newsletter,  all about IOT. She's really, as you can tell smart, it's the glasses, I think.  No, I'm kidding.  She's really smart and knows a lot about a lot of things,  including formula one racing.  And so that is a highly informed newsletter.  The podcast she does with Kevin Toffle, the ALT podcast is also a great listen.  Mr. Ant Pruitt hands on photography. I skipped you, Jeff. Bye bye.  And Pruitt hands on photography. No, no, it was a subliminal Jeff stuck in there.  Thank you for being here. And then Jeff Jarvis. Yeah.  Hitmotizebuzzmachine.com.  And we're going to talk a little bit about what's happening in medium too,  because I know you're right for medium. But first a word from our sponsor.  Today, the show brought to you by ITProTV.

Stacey, before we debunk it, for if we debunk it, what was the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a firm called Spark Toro, which is a marketing firm, I guess, online marketing.  They re or they redid a study on the number of clicks that companies get from  Google searches and they discovered that almost 65% of searches on Google stay on  Google.  They never click out to another website.  So this related to me, to our conversations that we've been having about snippets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is the presumption then that those 65% got what they wanted in the search or  that they just lost interest and wandered off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they don't know.  They're just saying that, hey, the 65% completed a search without any direct  follow up click to another web property.  Right.  And that is up from, let's see, when they did this in 2019.  So that's the news or that's the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would that go up?  It must go up because Google has put it more content, not just snippets, but the  knowledge graph and other content.  I often, I'm just thinking about my own use.  Let's say I'm searching to figure out how old a celebrity is right there on the  right in the knowledge graph.  There's the Wikipedia article.  It says I'm done.  That's no need to click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or like I do this all the time.  I'm like, oh, the restaurant near me.  I want to give it a call.  So I'll be on my phone.  Marché call.  And technically I'm never leaving Google when I'm doing that.  I mean, in Google's refutation of this, it actually talks specifically about some  of those use cases where, hey, you know, we may not be leading it to the website  of another business, but we are leading them to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm calling directly from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here I just searched for our local lunch place, Cafe Jostra and the  knowledge graph on the right.  It has the phone number.  It has office at hours.  It has a map.  It has everything I need.  But you're right.  That's just, that's good.  That's good for Cafe Jostra.  But then if I search for how old is Donald Trump, look, I didn't even have to do the  search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's commodity information.  Like no one owns that information.  No one has a right to give you that information.  No one's robbed that information.  It's information.  Yeah.  In an enlightened society, that's the way it works.  It's known.  It's known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, let's, let's do something like how, how do I clean my washing machine?  Try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do I clean my washing?  Moody washing machine.  Now, by the way, I love the completions with vinegar, filter, drain pipe naturally  with baking soda with a fresh without vinegar with white vinegar.  So let's just do this search and yeah, look laundry 101, which is right.  But what is that?  That comes from HGTV.  It's now lost tech.  Well, but that's the thing.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But like, this is what we're looking for.  Can I get the answer right there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't need to click HGTV or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the truth is you probably want to know more than those three lines.  You probably will click in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says keep your washing machine clean by periodically running an empty load  with hot water and vinegar, open the top of the machine and let it sit all  bleachy and full for an hour at the end of the hour, shut the cover.  It seems like that's the whole recipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So scan down.  Oh, scroll down.  I mean, just because I'm curious to see.  So, cause you're also seeing like, here's a YouTube video and key

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  moments in the video.  That's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are my new favorites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that.  I can jump to the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you like being taken to the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's well, that's what Google's explanation is.  Look, this is what people want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  So, but this is why they didn't write this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't write this.  They, they snipped it from HGTV or from the YouTuber, you know, depending on if

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, well, clearly as quick scan of that page, I'm like, oh, all I need to  do is run vinegar through my machine.  Right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now that's not necessarily coming from the slug line of the sites.  Right.  No, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, some of it comes.  No, some of it's coming from inside the body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it is the body text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll highlight body text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  So let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is what actually, if you click through, you'll see it yellow.  Yeah.  That's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So we're in there.  There's going to be a lot of stuff that I don't really care about.  So yeah, you're right.  They, they kind of extracted the.  Cause we ruined the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We cluttered it up with all this crap.  Well, that's a good point too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, I think a lot of the objection to flock and third party  trick tracking clicks is conflated with people's hatred of ads on the web in general.  I tried to read this.  Okay.  The search engine land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, oh, that's a good refutation.  I'll go read it.  I could not.  Terrible.  I could not read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not awful.  It is.  However, in the last few weeks, I've been reading a lot of the  In the last four minutes, I asked Danny Sullivan as a DM.  I couldn't find his piece.  Uh, it's now in the rundown.  I wouldn't tell you the line, Leo, but I don't want to upset you.  I got it.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was, was, was he, wasn't he part of searching the land?  He's now a Google used to be, but now he's actually wrote the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  refutation to that particular.  He's the public Google's publicly.  The thing that Stacey's talking about search engine journal, not Danny's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  search search journal looks like some kind of odd, rippy office site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's why I've run an app blocker, which of course is really  hypocritical of me because I try to get people to listen to ads on our shows.  It's the only way we fund our shows.  But the, but my justification is that you can't read many sites, especially  on mobile, uh, because, and if there's a risk, a security risk, and there's  this, they triple the size of the sites bloated because of all this crap  that's coming down in the ad.  So, uh, you know, I run an ad blocker in self-defense.  So I understand how hypocritical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You also pay for services to Mr.  Laporte.  You also pay for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, but I also look at a lot of stuff ad free.  I don't pay for the verge, but I don't see the verge's ads either.  So sorry, Neelon, you can hate me now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He doesn't ask you for money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he doesn't.  He, he's ad supported just as we don't ask you for money.  We're ad supported.  And by the way, I know a lot of people listening skip through the ads.  I mean, yeah, that's fine.  If the ads not remain to people, we have no respect.  I don't expect you to work hard for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo works hard.  Jeff needs his catch.  Oh, he Pepe.  Yeah.  I've got fancy glasses to buy.  Ant needs photography.  I need more lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on people.  What's the sacrifice?  They're nice advertisers.  I'll be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If, if, if, if I thought we could survive on subscription alone, I would absolutely,  I would do it in a heartbeat.  We tried.  We first started, we started out and it just wasn't enough.  That was such a different world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ben, nobody was used to do it to pay for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  There are, there are now tools that make it, you know, on Patreon and stuff that  make it very more doable.  I look at Substack and even by the way, Ben Thompson, great defensive Substack.  We talked last week about, yeah, we talked last week about how Substack doesn't  say who they pay and gives the impression that perhaps everybody's making a great  living on Substack when in fact they're paying some people as much as like Casey  Newton, a quarter of a million dollars for his first year.  Ben points out that actually cost Casey Newton money because according to his  subscription numbers, he'd have made $750,000.  The difference is kept by Substack.  It was a good investment on their part.  Now Casey's got a thriving enterprise.  He didn't have to take the risk of leaving, uh, you know, an established publication.  He created his own newsletter.  Substack gave him an effective advance.  And now in year two, he's going to make that $750,000.  So it's a pretty good defense of, he calls it the sovereign writer, the  writer who is, you know, their own sovereign nation.  And it's a good defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So one thing about this Toro thing is what I don't understand is the  methodology of how they got the data.  That's that.  So what is, what does Danny say?  Danny?  Well, I haven't read it yet.  I just put it up three minutes ago.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google search sends more traffic to the open web every year.  This week, we saw some discussion about a claim.  The majority of searches on Google and with someone without someone  clicking off to a website as practitioners across the search industry have noted,  and he has a link in this blog post.  It's in the keyword blog.  The claim relies on flawed methodology that misunderstands how people use search.  In reality, Google search sends billions of clicks to websites every day.  And we've sent more traffic to the open web every year since Google was first  created and beyond just traffic, we also connect people with businesses as we just  saw in a wide variety of ways through search, such as enabling a phone call to  a business.  So his contention, as I understand it, is just because when people are doing a  search, they're not necessarily looking for a webpage.  Nope.  Right.  Right.  They, they, uh, people don't always know how to word their queries when they begin  searching, they might start with a broad search like sneakers after reviewing the  results, realize they actually wanted to find black sneakers.  Those are zero clicks because they immediately modify their search because  this happens so frequently.  Google offers features like related search links to help people formulate their  searches and get to the most helpful result.  Good example.  I misspelled cafe just right.  They said, did you mean cafe just right?  And showed me that properly spelled.  And by the way, I know that that's why I didn't pay any attention to how I spelled  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh,  thank you for properly pronouncing it for me.  Cause I've always wanted to know how to pronounce it.  There you go.  So it's the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So good.  Isn't it good?  Oh, it's good.  Oh, it's good.  Um, no, no, no one's great for Katia.  They have, they make it themselves every morning, but you gotta get there early  because they sell out fast.  People look for quick factual information like weather forecast.  Not going to be a click.  Sports scores, not going to be a click, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  Uh, and he also points out, we do, we provide this information drawing from  licensing agreements.  So there's some implication that we might be paying for this or tools we've  developed, um, factual information about COVID or the U S elections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although they got in trouble with,  remember, remember the Zagat acquisition and how people were upset because it,  um, people stopped going to restaurant review or Yelp.  Sorry.  Yelp was pissed.  Right.  Yelp stopped going to them because the reviews were getting,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey, as I remember, didn't Yelp have a different Yelp complained that  they scraped without permission and then Google stopped.  They did complain about that for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, but they also were upset that then Google like basically took over their  business and disintermediated them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, I can't stand Yelp.  It is one of the most irritating services on earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was, I used Zagat cause I never trusted Yelp.  I was actually sad that Google bought Zagat because I really love the Zagat  guides.  Lisa and I used to have to, used to, uh, compete on rating after we'd go to a  restaurant and she'd say, well, I think that was a 24.  I said, what are you talking about?  It's a 26 easy.  Thanks to Zagat.  I'm actually very sad and I think they sold it.  They sold it back or not sold it back, but they sold it off.  It's not come back.  And I think they killed Zagat, frankly, maybe Yelp kills the gap.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe I was Marissa Meyer bought it.  Yeah, that's for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, so I don't actually having read Danny's article.  Now I don't think it really fully defends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, half of it's mealy mouth.  We're doing billions of search.  Yeah.  You know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, we care here.  I'll read the last paragraph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll read the last paragraph to you.  We care deeply.  Google writes about the open web and have continually improved Google search over  the years, helping businesses, publishers and creators thrive.  Some would argue we should revert back to showing only 10 blue website links.  While we do show website links for many queries today, when they are the most  helpful response, we also want to build new features that organize information  in more helpful ways than just a list of links.  And we've seen that as we've introduced more of these features over the last two  decades, the traffic we're driving to the web has also grown showing it's helpful  for both consumers and businesses.  The truth is Google's giving us what we ask for, which is information at your  fingertips, but I also am completely sympathetic with any publication that is  getting scraped and doesn't get that traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if you're, if you're dealing in commodity information, then that's what  That will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why should HGTV get a page view for, for this vinegar thing, which they

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  HGTV copied that recipe from other sites to other sites, to other sites, to other  sites, is grandma Jones.  In fact, it's almost certainly discovered you could use vinegar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Almost certainly written as link bait.  Exactly.  Exactly.  It's actually written to get the Google search result to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I worked with about.com the entire company was the first media company built  for the Google age where they knew what people searched on and if they didn't  have it, they wrote it.  So you'd come to it.  What was the term ads right there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was the term that they, they used for that?  There was a term that was in vogue for a while about these kinds of companies  that basically put created content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, well, about.com did it well, but then there were the farms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  There was a phrase for it, but anyway, there was factories or

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  farmers, but then that then screwed it up for everybody.  And that's what led to penguin.  The update in Google search to say about.com may be okay, but these other  a hundred companies doing the same stuff, just doing clickbait stuff has  ruined the web experience.  So we're going to downgrade everybody equally because we're fair Google.  And sorry about, yeah, you just got, you showed the way, but you got Bork too.  Is there anything good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nevertheless, I have to say, and I have some sympathy for companies to spend  money to create content and then it gets scraped by Google to a little  blurb at the top and people, I, it happens.  I know what happens.  People see that say that's yeah, that's exactly what I was looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But, but that, but again, that company scrapes somebody else's content to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  write that no, no, I'm saying there is, there is content that is somebody was  hired, paid to write it, did the leg work, did the journalism wrote it up.  And then it turned out that the gist of the article could be  expressed in three sentences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is what they should have done.  And, and so if you think that that's a future to do that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google wouldn't, Google doesn't grab or, uh, what's the word?  They don't register articles beyond a certain length.  So you have to pad sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a problem.  I wonder what it was to search, uh, behavior for people using social media.  Cause I know for some things I go to Google to, to do a quick search for a bit  of information, but if I hear about some rumor of ill or whatever, like say the  shooting that just recently happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I was just thinking about that.  The Suez Canal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Oh, that is a story.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a great thread in the rundown about, I'd rather, you know, instead of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going to Google and looking that up, I would go to social media into that search  field because it's probably going to give me a really good source, like a  popular news source that's going to have a lot of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, ironically, it would give you a link to the Twitter thread, which was  created by John Scott Railton.  He did a great job.  So the Suez Canal is blocked.  It's this monster container ship.  The ever given, let me see if I can find a picture of it, because when you see how  big this thing is, there it is.  There it is.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Four football fields long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Took that picture.  It was on the ship behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And worse, it's really, really tall.  To give you some sense, each of these little boxes is actually a railway box car.  So you get some sense of the size of this.  And I've been down this canal.  The Suez Canal is kind of interesting because there are no locks because the  level of the Mediterranean and the Gulf that it's going into are the same.  So they're the same sea level.  So it's just really a channel through the desert.  It's really, we went through it last in 2019.  And at the end of 2019, I was really thrilled.  I always wanted to.  And what's happened here, unfortunately, is this ship lost power, couldn't  control it, tilted, and then jammed.  It has a bulbous prow that it jammed into the mud of the side.  And keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The picture's down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As a result, hundreds of ships were backed up into the Mediterranean because,  well, here's the ships backed up in the Mediterranean and the Gulf.  They can't get through because the ever given, it's just stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like a cork in a bottle.  There's the bulbous prow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can see how it's actually jammed in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll see the full bulbous prow in three photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you don't see one there, but this is what it looks like when it's sailing.  It's many feet.  A lot of ships these days have these bulbous prow like that.  So they had a bunch of tugs out and stuff.  I think it's clear.  Is it cleared now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think so yet.  Last time I looked a few minutes ago.  What does it say on Twitter?  It started this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It started yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh really?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It got stuck yesterday.  Wow.  It's been, the Suez has been blocked for like at least 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's huge.  Yeah.  I don't think it's open yet.  They have, so they're digging around the bulbous prow.  There's great pictures of this little tiny earth movers trying to get this huge ship out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's making some great memes.  That's all I have to say.  Oh, it is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the ship trackers are just amazing.  The ship traffic that connects the world is just phenomenal.  Yeah.  Which you get now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can go around, but it's an additional 2,700 kilometers.  12.5 days.  Yeah.  It's a significant change.  We went, it was one of my bucket list items was to go through the Suez Canal and it was  quite a sail.  And by the way, when you get through it into the Gulf of Aden, then you have to watch out  for pirates.  So...  There's that.  We took on some Israeli commandos.  It was a cruise ship.  We took on some Israeli commandos and we were informed by the...  We actually had to have a pirate drill.  Really?  Oh yeah.  Commando.  Wow.  Well, you have a pirate drill and you have to all go into a part of the ship that's inside  and you can't be by a window or anything.  And so they warn you.  And then there's like a four hour transit past Somalia and some of the poorer countries  at the south of the Gulf of Aden.  And they warn you, you know, stay inside.  I don't...  And then they go, all clear pirate.  We're all clear.  No pirates.  It's really kind of fun.  But yeah, you see these really big, heavily armed fellas standing on the deck with binoculars  because they're trying to watch out for pirates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds like a fun vacation.  It was a great vacation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a trip of a lifetime.  Let me tell you, baby, trip of a lifetime.  I won't mention what happened at the end.  That wasn't so good.  We had a flight home, but I somehow screwed up the calendar and I missed it.  We arrived at the airport 24 hours later and they said, well, you left yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't...  That's because you know how to party.  We don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were partying in Dubai, let me tell you.  Lost day.  Lost day in Dubai.  So how'd you get out?  Buy a whole new flight.  Very carefully.  Never got that money back.  Oh no.  Bought a whole new flight.  I called our travel agent and I said, get me out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was no fun.  That was our last trip anywhere.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a big trip.  I think my last trip was to like Tennessee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there was another trip after that.  You're right.  In March, we went to St.  Louis to visit World Wide Tech, but...  WWT.  Yeah.  That was our last like vacation, vacation.  Yeah.  Let's take another break because I got a vacation to pay for.  So...  Woo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wish I...  If only.  And people, people, I don't know who it is yet.  It's a nice sponsor.  Leo does a great job with the read.  It's very friendly.  It's very informative.  Stick around, will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you don't have to listen to it.  Honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, yeah, you do.  It's only right.  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, if you're not interested, skip ahead.  It'll be a couple of minutes and we'll be back.  That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I do.  I go and get water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Throw this spaghetti against the wall.  Yeah, I noticed the hosts all disappear while I do these ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a three hour show.  There's the water, stacks, bio breaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just going to point out that Zack Snyder's cut of the  Justice League is four hours.  You didn't get up for that.  I can't watch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.  I didn't watch it, nor do I care to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually did and I loved it, but I watched it over three nights.  That's actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And is that a hill you're prepared to die on?  Apparently.  That sounded really like...  I'm like, dang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently.  Don't care.  People are so fired up over that movie.  And I'm like, man, really?  There's other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't see the original, which got panned like crazy.  And I'm not even a comic book fan.  There's a handful of Marvel and DC heroes that I like the movies.  I love the Dark Knight movies.  Dark Knight was great.  I actually love Black Panther, which is a Marvel.  But I'm not a big fan of, you know, all of the...  Because I don't...  I didn't read the comic books, so it doesn't resonate.  But this was really good, partly because it had Superman and Batman in it.  But it was really good.  I thought it was...  He added backstory.  It was a little weird because the whole thing is in four by three aspect ratio.  Oh, wow.  It's not widescreen.  Wow.  And apparently Zach Snyder...  Old school.  So the story was Zach Snyder was directing it.  His daughter died.  His teenage daughter died.  He had to leave the movie.  Joss Whedon finished it, but didn't finish it well.  Some years later, Zach Snyder said,  Hey, you know, give me some money, HBO.  And HBO Max paid for this.  Warner, I guess.  Give me some money.  And because I want to shoot some extra stuff and I want to make the CGI better.  I hated the CGI.  So they did extra CGI.  They shot extra...  Quite a bit, apparently, of extra footage, because it went from a two hour movie  to a four hour movie.  Four hour movie.  A lot of backstory.  It wasn't...  So I guess I'm not crazy about super action oriented films.  There was a lot more backstory in it, which I liked, you know.  Superman in a cornfield, things like that.  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'll check out the Cliff Notes on YouTube.  You didn't miss anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't miss anything.  Our show today brought to you by Uber for business.  You're right.  This is a great...  If you are a business, if you're not, you don't need to listen to this.  But if you are a business, one of the challenges, especially now, is to get  people to come to your Zoom meeting.  It's to get people to come to your, let's say your car dealer, come to your store.  It's to, you know, employees who work late or coming in, or maybe you are  working at home, but you want to really kind of thank them.  Uber for business is a great way to do that.  If you're looking for a way to stand out to your customers or make  employees feel extra valued, you can use Uber for business to spiff them  with rides or meals.  And it's, this is not new.  Over 150,000 companies use Uber for business to improve customer and  employee satisfaction.  With vouchers from Uber for business, you can add, let's say 20 bucks to  an employee's Uber account.  Let me pay for the ride.  Or customer, let me, let me, let me, come on, you got to come out and see this.  Let me pay for the ride there and back.  You can order meals.  Hey, let me buy you coffee.  So you'll come to our meeting through Uber Eats.  If you want to make your customers love your business even more, offer them a  voucher for a free meal or a ride when they make their first purchase or spend  a certain amount.  That's a really nice way.  Everybody understands it's very easy for you.  You sign up for free and you can immediately start sending out vouchers  to customers and colleagues, the people who matter most to your business.  Very simple to send for you.  Very easy to redeem for your giftee.  You have total control, by the way, over who gets them when they expire, what  portion of the ride or meal you want to cover.  No surprises in this.  You share the voucher via email or text, and then they can be redeemed with a  single tap click.  And best of all, you only pay for rides they take or meals they order.  Everybody uses this.  More than half of the Fortune 500.  It's such a great idea.  And we've got a nice little benefit for you.  If you want to sign up right now, create your first vouchers campaign, spend at  least $200, you'll get a $50 voucher.  So a great discount.  Go to uber.com slash twig to learn more.

See, nice ad, nice advertiser, nice people.  Thank you, Uber, for supporting this week in Google.  And by the way, just as a listener, when you go to uber.com slash twig, that's the  signal they're looking for it to say, I heard it on, I heard it on twig and that  really helps us.  You know, so you heard Leo, you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm telling you, you don't have to do it.  But you should because you're decent people.  You're nice people.  You watch the show.  You were friends.  That's what you should do.  Just tell him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do.  We do appreciate it.  That I will, that I will back.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But you know, my, my theory on advertising is we're doing introductions to products  we know and we use and we trust and we like to you as an audience.  And take it or leave it.  If it's something that you can use, it would be great for us if you use that special  URL.  But if it's not something you can use, no harm, no foul.  You can even skip the ad.  I don't mind.  We want to make it a benefit for everybody.  I want everybody to win.  I'm not trying to scam anybody.  You know, what line number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The YouTube story.  Where'd it go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube story.  Ah, YouTube saves her chateau.  YouTube to auto detect products and videos or the pre-teens guide to getting rich off  YouTube.  Oh, I didn't see that.  I'll tell you about that one next.  YouTube is, this is something Alex Lindsay has said for years.  The best ads are the products in content, right?  Especially, you know, a car that looks cool or clothes that sound the, Oh, I love  that dress.  That's a great way to do it.  So YouTube is starting to do recognition of products in content.  And at some point there will be right beneath the player, there'll be a list of the  products in the video.  Here's an example.  This is on a Pixel phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I hold this up by chance and suddenly there's going to be a purchase because  they're going to recognize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this for the solicitors was a bottle of water.  Pellegrino.  Not just any water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pellegrino.  That ain't a bottle of water.  That was fancy water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was that congas or sans gas?  Con.  Con gas.  The YouTube algorithm, according to 95 Google, does a fairly solid job of auto  detecting just what content you've been watching and serving up related videos.  Oh no.  Yeah.  But this feels more like the kind of content you watch is research for making a  purchase.  So you might really be interested.  I mean, you're not watching this to figure out what's fizzy water Jeff drinks.  I don't know.  It's interesting.  Will we get a cut of that?  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, probably not.  Well, see that was the approach that I had on it because I use affiliate links on my  personal brand and it's nice to be able to capitalize off of those affiliate clicks  here and there.  And I would like for, but I do get that if it's something in my background that may be  useful for somebody and YouTube recommends that in a non-invasive way.  I do get that, but I hope this isn't something that's going to take away from the  content creator that is creating content about a product that they're holding up  right now.  And then YouTube sticks another link down there that takes away from the creator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that takes me to the other article about getting rich off Google.  Do you know who Ryan Kaji is?  If you have little kids, you do.  He is probably the most successful YouTube creator of all.  29 million subscribers.  He made last year, it's estimated 30 million dollars.  He's nine years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Geez.  Oh, that's the kid with the toy.  Yeah, he does.  Open toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Toy unboxing.  He, you know, I think it's his parents made nine million, 30 million dollars.  I don't know.  He started when he was three with toy unboxing.  So now we know it's his parents, right?  But one of the ways that he has generated all this income is not just from  advertising, but from merchandising deals and sponsorship deals with Walmart and  Target.  He's got TV shows with Nickelodeon and Amazon.  They have their own footwear line with Skechers.  Products bearing Ryan's world branding generated more than 250 million dollars in  sales in 2020.  And the Kaji's share of those sales represent from 60 to 70 percent of the 30  million dollars of their annual revenue.  So only 30 to 40 percent comes from ads in, you know, YouTube ads in there.  He has like eight separate channels.  You know, they realized very quickly this nine year old, you know, labor laws would  prevent him from working 24 seven.  So they created additional channels with automated characters and so forth.  You know, I haven't watched it, but I good Lord, 30 million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now he says, he says, whenever I was much younger, I like to play with toys.  So we do lots of toy videos, but now I like to do gaming videos, science, arts  and crafts, exercising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad to hear that.  There's Ryan's toys reviews.  There's animated characters, including combo Panda and Gus the gummy gator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is his parents' jobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently this management.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, like, how did they get to the they actually have a manager, they have  pocket watch, which is a former YouTuber created pocket watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's been making a lot of these deals.  He was, he was at maker studios and has now branched out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's something that I think gets overlooked in, particularly with the  people wanting to be a big YouTuber is it's not always the same.  It's not always just getting those funds from the Google ad service.  What's it called?  Ad sense, getting paid from Google ad sense.  It's more than that.  It's, it's about your brand and getting it in front of millions of people to  pay you directly, not pay you through YouTube.  You know, people like Gary V and Roberto Blake, they get a lot of flack for  their hustle, hustle, hustle talk.  But they also tried to tell you, you know, look, it's not just putting all  your eggs in one basket of YouTube.  It's taking your brand to YouTube and then growing beyond that and just, you  know, using that as a bit of leverage.  Yeah.  If you got a lot of subscribers, you're going to get a lot more eyeballs, but  you got to go beyond YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and to that point, you remember last year YouTube, which was getting  in a lot of trouble, got $170 million fine because of advertisements targeted  at children, demonetized all the videos.  Oh yeah.  Apparently that cost Kaji 50% in his sales.  So that's why it's so important not to be, you know what, you don't want to be  dependent on a somebody else's platform ever.  Nope.  So the more you can be, you know, branch out and diversify, this is a line you'll  like, Jeff, this is from Bloomberg Business Week.  There are six year olds on YouTube who draw larger daily audiences than Tucker Carlson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That makes me hairy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cocoa Melon, the most watched channel in all of YouTube launched a  line of toys in September.  They've licensed episodes to Netflix.  Yeah, that's, that's the key.  But you know, it's the problem is I don't know how they, anybody knew that this kid  would be the thing and that it would make it.  And, you know, he obviously must be very charismatic.  Uh, I, I wonder, you know, uh, how he's going to do as an adulthood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I, you know, what happens to him when it goes away?  I mean, it's just like every child's story ever, but this is a child's  story, $30 million.  I hope, I hope.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hopefully he can just, I would love to give my daughter, you know, let's say  20 million of the 30 million and be like, Hey, you know what, go to college.  Your college is paid for kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is your 16 year old VC instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also bad though to, to, to peak too early.  Uh, because then you spend the rest of your life wondering what happened.  You know, I like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well, I mean, is it a peak to be analyzing toy videos?  I mean, think about it.  Like it's a peak in terms of, yes, that's a heck of a lot of money, but you could go  and then peak in a completely different career.  Yeah.  I've never liked the term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Peak.  Yeah.  Me either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I've never liked the term viral.  Uh, someone's video went up on YouTube and it went viral and it's great for that  moment, but I want longevity for the content that I personally create.  You know, if you go and watch hands-on photography right now, I want you to be  able to look at it a year from now and it still be just as useful and as an  important to you, not something that just sort of fades out like a fad, which is  typically what happens with a lot of this viral stuff.  I can remember, what was it?  Harlem Shake.  Was that the name of it?  Yeah.  I stood on the table.  I remember you breaking a table.  Yeah.  Um, was it about a month later?  We all forgot about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was just, you know, well, if Tik Tok's even worse, like these, uh, these trends  go come and go like in minutes, it seems like, but everybody does it briefly.  So how about, uh, how about this young lady, interestingly named Stephanie Jarvis?  Yeah.  I wish it were a long lost cousin, but she realized along with her friends, uh,  that for the amount of money they pay for their flats, they could buy a  Chateau in France, uh, and, uh, created a YouTube channel called the Chateau  Diaries about their life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Living in the castle.  So I ended up watching an entire hour almost about how YouTube saved her with  the pandemic and everything and how she now it's her full-time job.  Uh, the, the, the fans help her redo the Chateau.  You think, well, she's making a fortune.  No, the Chateau is worth as much now as it was when she bought it.  Um, uh, but she also in season will have a bed and breakfast  and have events and stuff, but she's charming and cause every Jarvis is.  And, um, uh, it's kind of mesmerizing how she has her, her Kickstarter  fans and YouTube fans, and this is her, her life now, this is her living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There must be a thing going on with, um, TikTokers and YouTubes who have houses  designed for TikTok and YouTubing.  I, I, I mean, uh,  there, I was watching, uh, there's a, uh, an 18 year old TikToker, Julia  Graff was the strangest house ever.  It's got a slide in it.  It's got a, a drive-in movie inside drive-in.  It's the craziest thing ever.  And I realized, I mean, I think about iJustine, I mean, I think you, at  some point in your life, you, um, you decide I'm going to be an event.  That's how you succeed on these things.  I'm going to be an event and, but it must be exhausting.  I would be exhausted by the whole thing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're much older than the event crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess if you're young, yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I would be, you know, I wouldn't do it now, but like when I was 23.  Sure.  Did you have the energy to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe that's it.  I'm just, I mean, I had the energy to start twitting my forties or was it my  fifties?  No, my forties.  It wasn't your fifties.  I don't think I could do it now.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  Uh, all right.  Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, green stories, section, section 230 turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I put this one up.  I'm pissed.  I'm pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So tomorrow, uh, all of the executives are coming back to testify for Congress,  including Sundar Pichai.  We'll talk about what he says, which is a lot more tenable.  If you ask me, um, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg, uh, we have  their, uh, written statements ahead of time.  Zuckerberg basically pulled the rug out from under section 230, which  protects platforms, allows them to moderate, says they can't be sued for  stuff people put on Facebook or Twitter or our chat room or our forms and that  kind of thing.  We're not liable for that.  But, and we can, we can moderate it without becoming a publisher.  It's really the, as you say, uh, Jeff, what is it?  The 13 words that created the internet.  26, 26, some number of words.  Double it.  You are almost there.  I only read half of it.  I got to half way there.  I read the snippet posted on the Google site.  That's all you needed to know.  It's all I needed to know.  So Zuckerberg, uh, now he's not saying abandoned section 230, but he said, you  know, uh, what, what we should do is, uh, you should earn your right.  Uh, there's a problem right there.  Earn your right to section 230 by showing that you have a good moderation scheme.  And that's exactly not what section 230 is all about.  Yes.  I'm going to attempt to moderate our chat room or moderate our forums.  Well, the reason Mark likes it is because he's a winner.  You know, anybody with the money that Facebook has can sure easily show a best  practices plan to moderate, whether it works, whether they do it, that doesn't  matter, but if you're a small, you know, you're just some guy who wants to start  a forum about opening toys, you may not have the means to do full moderation.  Something that would satisfy Congress.  You shouldn't have to earn 230 is I guess the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you.  Well said.  Can you, can you make a bumper sticker out of that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, let's hope Congress does not listen.  Now, Pachai I thought, uh, was good at defending, uh, the free internet and the,  uh, and 230, um, he, uh, let's see, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  without section 230 platforms with either over filter content or not be able  to filter content at all.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he said, you know, you should have a content policy that's clear and accessible.  We have that.  That's you can, that's not hard to do.  Should notify people when content is removed.  Yes.  And give them ways to appeal.  Okay.  Maybe.  But, um, of course, section 230 may or may not be under attack, you know, who  will be under attack, not only at this testimony tomorrow, but in general, uh,  we're seeing strong signals from the Biden administration that he is very much  interested in going after a big tech, the latest, uh, they're floating a name.  Let me, uh, it's not, I don't see it.  What line number is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  You have the magic radar where you can find this stuff.  I'm not giving you another line number, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lena con, uh, who is, uh, this is the headline from the verge.  Biden to nominate tech antitrust pioneer Lena con for FTC commissioner.  She's very well known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, she is, she's very interesting.  She came to the four, like just four or five years ago for a  she wrote us her thesis.  Yeah.  Um, which is, I mean, so really good paper.  Um, all about, uh, evaluating how we think about monopolies with Amazon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And talk about, to me, this is very inspiring.  This is like this idea that if you are truly deeply passionate about thinking  about a big issue and you delve into the research and you create something, she's  really moving the needle with this.  I just, I think it's kind of an inspiring story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.  Nice.  Yeah.  And we want thoughtful people.  We don't, I mean, this is the problem with this section 230 regulations.  It's very knee jerk.  It depends on, you know, what you, how you feel about deep platforming  conservatives and things like that.  We want people who are thoughtful.  We're really saying, what can we do to do this?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And she may be all wrong and who knows, but you know, I think she's thinking about it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But now, so that's Tim Wu, Lena con.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Tim Wu bothers me more because Tim Wu, as I think I said last week, you know, he,  I read a paper of his from 10 years ago and people have been starting talking  about this too, is that he, he says, he questions whether the first amendment is  obsolete, he questions whether the platform should be held to a journalistic standard.  All right.  This just doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, again, I mean, he's a smart guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What we have isn't working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think, yeah, we need to think about what we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The first amendment.  I'm not giving up on the first amendment.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I'm not giving up on the first amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's what he's, he's ready to give up on the first amendment.  That puts my alarm is going whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's just a way of saying everything is up for grabs.  We should really rethink everything.  He wrote a whole paper about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  It wasn't just a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For 10 years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he still has been saying it.  Oh, okay.  I was like...  It's not, it's not an instant decision.  Like I just wrote a tweet saying, hey, maybe it's obsolete.  Oh, what do you think about that?  Yeah, don't trust tweets.  I was just being provocative.  Yeah, don't trust tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The paper's a big deal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll see what happens.  You know, one, one cabinet member does not a summer make.  Let's see.  All right.  What about, let's talk about Medium a little bit because it's not completely  clear what's going on there, but this morning I woke up to news that,  that, and this is, I think, I think you can safely say this is anti-union  sediment from Ev Williams, the founder of Medium, that they've decided not  to continue with their own in-house journalistic endeavors.  They have quite a few.  One zero debugger.  You've written for debugger.  I know Jason's written for one zero.  Megan Moroney is an editor at one zero.  One zero.  All the people who work for one zero were offered buyouts.  And the impression I got from the internal email was that those  publications were just going to go away and that those people who currently  worked for those publications would be allowed to continue on as editors for  people like Jeff contributors to Medium, but not for in-house publications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't you edit my post.  Don't you touch them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Team writes, Ev, we are making some changes to our editorial strategy and  leadership and giving a voluntary exit option to employees who would  like to take different paths.  Jeff, what does this mean?  Some people are saying we have to point out that there was a unionization  effort at Medium that failed by a very close vote.  By one vote.  And that all of the people who just got pink slips in effect were very strong  advocates of that kind of unionization.  But the union did fail and so it wasn't there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it could be.  It wasn't a case of firing for the union.  So it wasn't there.  So it wasn't a case of firing people who...  No, I saw a labor lawyer say, no, this is perfectly within his rights.  And he wasn't firing people for organizing.  The vote went through, the vote failed.  He's not firing people.  He's saying, I'm giving you buyouts if you want.  Here they are.  Yeah.  And he isn't firing people.  That's a proper...  But I think it's more likely.  Ev is the pivotmeister.  He has pivoted this sucker a number of times because Ev is trying to find a  model and he still frankly hasn't found it yet.  Right.  So he started off...  Journalism is expensive.  Well, it's not even just journalism.  You can be right in anything you want.  It's a blog platform.  It's a platisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what these things were like, 1-0, these were really like journalistic  entities.  Journalistic efforts.  They were very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he's trying to make a business.  He started trying to do a new kind of advertising.  He gave up on advertising entirely.  He's rejected advertising entirely.  So everything we talked about before, hey, get rid of advertising.  Okay, Ev did it.  So Ev says to people, pay five bucks a month.  And Leo Laporte growled about that.  And then he splits it up against all the parties.  And the more audience he gets to pay, the kind of better he is.  But was the investment in those efforts worth it or not?  Then the other part that people are talking about is this may be a very  substack reaction.  That past publications is the...  What did you call it?  Not the solitary writer, the sovereign writer.  Sovereign writer, yeah.  Right.  That that's where, I don't want to say the future is, that's ridiculous, but at  least the current fad is the individuals and that that's where they have the  money and opportunity.  I don't really know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's generous.  He's offering a lump sum payment of five months salary, six months of health  benefits.  Health care is the big one too.  Yeah.  So that's generous.  It's certainly time to find another job.  He says, what about our pubs?  Honestly, I think it will take a lot more experimentation to find out what their  role is on the platform.  So does it sound like he's shutting them down?  He does say we need to experiment more efficiently when than we have been to  date.  I can see more focused, high affinity publications working well as part of the  medium bundle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  The way I've always said, Ev has changed the world twice, right?  He started Blogger, which was the first major kind of retail blogging platform  by no means the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And UPS guys here, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What could they be bringing?  And I think it was really important.  It brought me into blogging and changed my view of media and my career in life.  And then Twitter, of course, co-founder of Twitter, which which changed the world  again.  And my joke is that Ev is paying penance by trying to start medium where people  write at length without the time crush.  But he's trying to make this work.  He just hasn't hit the right formula yet.  And but he, you know, he couldn't give it up a couple of years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says this means identifying writers.  You're right.  This sounds like a substack play.  This means identifying writers, both already on medium or not, and offering  them deals, support, editing and feedback to help them tell great stories and  find their audiences.  So instead of focusing on publication, focusing on the bylines, the individuals,  that sounds sensible.  That's acknowledging that we live in a substack world where people pay money for  a particular person's work as opposed to a publication's work.  Is that Stacey, you kind of have gone through this transition.  Do you think that that's really the future of of journalism or writing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, this is this almost prompted me to drink last night.  I was so sad about everybody.  I know.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I don't know what the future is for journalists.  I know that not everybody can do what I do because I have a niche that is  enterprisey, right?  And if I only did the smart home stuff, I couldn't do what I do.  So I don't.  I don't know what the future is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if maybe, Jeff, you can comment too, but I wonder if being a journalist  going forward means not getting the skills, the chops and then working your way up  through a different or different publications until you get, you know,  the New York Times job or the Wall Street Journal job.  And, you know, you're you're you're you're an employee your whole life  to more like and this kind of seems like the world's working a little more like this  being working on your brand and working your your brand up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's more entrepreneurial than trying to work for the dream job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As Stacey points out, not everybody is entrepreneurial, except maybe that's now.  I mean, that's what they call your department is the school of entrepreneurial  journalism, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but we've changed that view.  Right.  And I think it's right.  But I had to change my view of entrepreneurship.  I know you're an employee or you're a freelancer was the world we had.  And on the other end, it's entrepreneurial.  I want to start a new company.  I'm going to start Vox.  Well, that's really, you know, that's not a local blog.  It's that sovereign.  It's the sovereign.  This is right.  So what we're doing now is we changed our entrepreneurial program completely.  Used to be a certificate and a degree.  Now it's 100 day only online, which pre COVID we plan out that way.  Run by Jeremy Kaplan.  And you learn how to do your own thing using the platforms that exist,  using Medium and Substack and YouTube and Patreon.  And you directly serve a market or community.  And that's the key, I think it could be a podcast.  It could be book contracts, too.  It could be speaking gigs, lots of different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're Danielle Steele, let's say, or some massively successful novelist,  should you just publish your own novels and hope that you can find an audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I don't think you're there.  In fact, in fact, at the end of Gutenberg, I mean, the Gutenberg  Parenthesis, which is the book I'm hoping somebody will actually respond to me about.  I recant my view about books.  I said in what would Google do, the books should be updatable and linkable  and clickable and searchable.  And I say I was wrong.  I think books took a long time to get to be what a book is.  And and there's value.  Well, but also more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have to. Stacey, I think you'd agree.  The skill of a writer is writing, not business.  This the skill of a journalist like you, Stacey, is digging,  finding the story, doing the research and writing the story.  Why should you also have have these unrelated skills of  I can start a business and I can market myself and I can build a brand.  Those are all unrelated skills.  Do we have to have all the skills in one now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if the future economy, you need to have that like  like you have the ability to pay your bills personally, right?  Like everybody has to. You may not be great at it, but you have to do it.  So like some entrepreneurial.  So even more important, I would say, than coding is an understanding of.  The basics of how to build a business in terms of like,  you know, how to create an LLC for yourself, how to invoice people,  how to run basic accounts in.  Because I think I mean, even if you're like a  a fiver or a door dash delivery person,  you have to like track your own expenses.  You have to manage your own, you know, 10 whatever's.  And I and I think those are skills that.  They suck. They're no fun.  But you got to do it. It's part of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You have to pay your taxes. Nobody wants to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wants to be. I mean, you can hire an accountant, but at some point in time,  you know, so I feel like you may as journalists.  We're going to have to build that into the curriculum, not just as journalists.  I think this is going to be going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to argue for this in high school when I was a trustee at the high school.  I used to argue that the new way of work was going to be gig working and, you know,  and that you really needed to develop an on  entrepreneurial is not the right thing, but an independent mindset.  And what's interesting is how people like have are saying, well, we can or  Jack Conti at Patreon, we can create the backbone that will facilitate this.  So you don't have to do it all.  But what you are responsible for is creating, creating your brand, your persona.  I guess you always I think your relationship with your with your public,  your relationship with your audience. And Daniel Steel had to do that.  You know, the publisher provided her with an editor and a print printing press  and distribution and a bookstore.  But she still had to do all the hard work of creating Daniel Steel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So last week, we talked a little bit about Facebook trying to serve these folks.  And I heard some more sense about this.  And interestingly, like my presumption was, OK, it'll all be in the Facebook wall  garden. They want to help people start their own websites  independently on their own. Wow.  And then use Facebook in ways that are beneficial as promotional material.  Yeah, yeah.  And I think the other benefit of Facebook, too, that I wish media companies  would get their heads around is community, obviously.  Right. Yeah.  That you could have a place where you can talk with people and can ask you  questions. And I've always said that that's what Twitter was about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Community is king.  It's about like I believe you said this last week of having  not saying having 100000 subscribers, but having that 1000 really, really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  loyal super Kevin Kelly's 1000 fans. Yeah.  Well, you do this.  I mean, every photographer kind of that photographers have been on the leading  edge of this because you haven't been able to make a living  working for a newspaper or magazine in some years.  So if you're a photographer, you've been on your own at least in the last 10,  15 years. You've been on your own.  And every photographer I know has a variety of skills and variety of things  they do to to support themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seems like every photographer I know is a former IT person.  Of course, you're right. Trey Radcliffe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right. You're right.  Chris Marquardt, you're right.  So I don't think I've ever asked you, Ant.  What did you want to be when you grow up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the things I used to want to be a scientist  because I too late to cartoons, watching cartoon too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, there's no beaker in your future.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chemistry made me want to retire from the science world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But seriously, do you see yourself as a podcaster  or as a writer, as a photographer?  I think maybe even those labels don't apply anymore, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see myself as my bio says, a digital content creator.  Yeah, that's probably I am never going to sit here and say that I am just solely  a photographer because I can do more than just click the shutter.  You know, I can also do retouching and finishing of photos,  even though I didn't take the photograph.  I can also edit video.  I can write a little bit, you know, so I'm a digital content creator  because I didn't want to lock myself in and be out of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So and Stacey, you had to do that.  You had to figure out what you brought to the table, what your  what your skills were and what people would support you doing. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sort of. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or did you just say, here's what I want to do.  And that's what I did, by the way.  I didn't think about it. I just said, here's what I want to do.  I hope it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean,  there was a little bit more planning, but yes, I did kind of just say  it was less here's what I want to do, but also just here's what I can do.  Right. Like, yeah, that's very realistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's practical. Yeah.  You can't buy a Chateau and become a 24 hour a day YouTuber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Right. I.  Like that is like my nightmare.  You're discreet. Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, to actually share your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah. And. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think about my kids who are really struggling, but honestly,  I think I ill prepared them and God, if anybody should have prepared  them better, it would have been me for this world, you know.  Same here.  They didn't they don't.  I think kids coming out of college in the last five years are,  you know, rubbing their eyes going, what the hell? Yeah.  This isn't what they told me to expect. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the other problem is that old farts like us stick around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're getting in the way.  That's all right. I'll be here much longer.  Relatively speaking.  I think so what you would teach a kid.  So you and Stacey both have children still young enough to be molded.  Teach a kid how to do a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I would have to edit video.  No. Yes, yes. And yes, I have.  I have. OK.  Yeah. My daughter knows how to create a website.  She can create. She can edit video. She can edit audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good. She's well prepared for something.  Then you also have to teach them how to market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm hmm. My my youngest hard head is a really good photographer.  And he got started, you know, five, six years ago  as a middle schooler, an elementary school kid.  Got him a very, very inexpensive point and shoot camera  because he saw a dad with a camera and he wanted one.  And I went to the pawn shop, got him a little cheap camera and he loved it.  And he still shoots to this day in his free time.  He does a lot of fashion stuff, if you will.  So he's he's he's been able to get into that world  and understand how to get in the light room and Photoshop and work on things.  And now he's doing this  this brand called Provider, where he's doing some embroidery stuff.  He bought himself a machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You must be really proud. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he sees he's he's knocking it out.  In addition to what social platforms does he use?  What's it Snapchat and Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm chatting my my daughter's really in the Instagram.  My son more into Tick Tock.  But actually, now that I think about it, even though I did not prepare them well,  they have managed to figure out that they're going to have to do their own  businesses and they're really have to. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, in my senior hard head,  you know, he's he's signed to sign a letter of intent to go to college  because he's wanting to get into kinesiology.  And so he's like, he's playing.  And and our thinking on that is, hey, you really need to dig deep  on this stuff right now and get as much information as you can,  because I want you to be prepared before you go to college  and while you're in college and when it's time to get out of there,  you're going to be even more prepared because you got more skills  and understand entrepreneurship just in case you were able to go out  and just start your own practice and get picked up somewhere else.  And he's been they've been pretty diligent about that.  So, yeah, right now, I'm going to pat myself on the back.  Good job, man, because I've been in their heads for a very long time.  And we just had a conversation a couple of weeks ago  back before COVID really, really kicked off here in this area.  I remember telling them one morning, hey, I need you all to get on  a get in habit of working from home.  I said, I've been working for home for most of your life.  You're not used to that.  Most people in our family is not used to the work from home life.  I want you to get into a habit.  So I got them up every day for their class.  Good for you.  They went to a certain spot.  Good for you.  It was routine.  And now they're used to it.  And when we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, I said,  you know, that was a year ago.  And now it's just second nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This year hasn't been wasted for that generation  because it did teach them that, at least.  Right. Come to think of it.  And how to be a self-starter, how to get up in the morning  and go to sit down at the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do not check on them for school.  I don't even think twice about it because I know they're up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have to learn how to do that by themselves  because you won't always be there to do it for them.  That's right.  You know, we're also speaking from a  privileged position because  a lot of kids should get a trade, should go to trade school,  should be a carpenter or a plumber or learn how to, you know,  hoe a field or something, because we need that too.  God knows.  About that, Mr. LaFleur.  I need a lot more farmers than we need web developers  come to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a washer and dryer that's as old as they are.  Yeah.  And I refuse to buy a new one.  You keep it working.  Because those things can be fixed.  Good for you.  So when something goes wrong, they're in there with me  figuring out how to fix those dead gum things.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  I teach them that too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been a while since, I mean,  for the longest time in history, I guess you just did what your parents did.  Right?  Right. Right.  And then in the last...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or whatever neighbor had an apprenticeship.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're Ben Franklin, you know, you got a job,  you got an apprenticeship with a printer and you learned how to do that.  Then in the last hundred years, that started to become more fluid.  But there was still always the notion of you'd get out of college.  I remember when I got out of college, there were recruiters  from DuPont and Dow and other companies.  They're living through chemistry.  Yeah. BASF.  Yeah.  They were going to the gym with a table.  Oh, yeah. My major was real useful.  Chinese studies.  Oh, that's right. That's right.  You're trying to say, yes.  But there would be the gym and there'd be tables and you'd go around  and the recruiters would be there and you try to get a job with a company  and spend the rest of your life there during the gold watch.  So it's...  When did this change?  It's changed with the Internet.  It's pretty recent.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it changed before the Internet.  You started seeing layoffs prior to that, with the deaths of pensions  and corporate buyouts and that sort of thing.  I mean, think about the 80s in the financial markets there.  I will also say.  I don't know that everyone in, like, my daughter's generation so far  is oriented around money in the way that...  No, that's true. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That we were in kids.  It's definitely different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's definitely different for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does she think about it?  Does she think I need to make a living?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yes, she knows she needs it, but she also, you know,  her highest goal is to live in a forest, in a cottage.  And I'm like, yeah, OK.  That's her highest goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not bad.  It's a special place.  It's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If there's fiber and fiber to the home, OK.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's like she needs a broadband connection, but she doesn't.  She doesn't really like clothes.  She doesn't really like a lot of things.  So she might actually be just fine doing that.  I don't know.  The other thing is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just bought a... Go ahead.  Sorry, Shazie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to say is, you know, we...  She hasn't wanted for things in her life.  So if you have wanted for things in your life,  money is obviously going to be much more of a priority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. That's absolutely true.  The people I know who are best at money are people who had no money as kids  and made the decision.  I am not going to go through that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I just bought a book called The Sovereign Individual.  Oh, perfect timing.  From 1997.  It's coming tomorrow.  But I saw a Twitter stream about it saying that,  darn, these guys predicted all of this, including gig work,  including the challenges to the nation and the nation state.  And, you know, I take that kind of prediction with a grain of salt,  but it's interesting because it came from 20 years ago.  About and it'll be interesting to see  how people interpreted the beginning of the net age.  And what's come about from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you can just sell your first tweet as an NFT  and then you'll never have to work again.  Jack Dorsey's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does he work now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can grow your beard and live in a house in the forest.  Jack Dorsey's first tweet sold.  It was 20...  It was 2.5 million the last time we checked.  Apparently the bidding went a little higher.  The same guy who was on top for weeks, Sina Astabi, got it for 2,915-83547.  Which I'm guessing was his childhood phone number or...  I don't know. I don't know what it was.  But it's an oddly specific number.  He held the high bid for quite some time.  I guess there was a little flurry.  And the money's going to what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jack's donating the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jack's donating it to a charity.  I forget.  Yeah. I'll find it.  It's online something.  Donate it to GiveDirectly for its Africa response.  So, give directly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jack was going to move to Africa, remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then the pandemic.  Yeah, that's right.  So it goes directly to people living in poverty.  It's kind of one of those  you know, kind of charities that says, no, the best thing you do is just  give people money and let them get on their feet.  Let them figure it out.  Yeah. Let them figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, Leo, can we do the Twitter survey?  I'm curious to hear your answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. As long as we're talking about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you need to do an ad first or...  I think I'm caught up on ads.  I think I have one more.  Yeah.  I would tell you the line number, but I'm much compliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So actually, the link you put in doesn't have the survey.  I had to read this.  It's the calling for public input on our approach to world leaders.  Of course, the world leader they're talking about is Donald Trump,  who, by the way,  Yeah, yeah.  So, by the way, I have to point out  the world has been a much calmer, quieter place since he stopped tweeting.  Indeed.  In fact, now the Donald is according to his spokesman,  starting his own social platform.  No, you don't think so?  I can't say that.  I think that daily 40 tweet stream  has really put us all on our on our tippy toes every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  But then again, I'm also the person that never really saw  activity from that guy unless people brought it to my attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't follow him after a while.  But every but how could you not get it brought to your attention?  That's all the news talked about is the latest tweets from the president.  It just got very quiet and it's been very pleasant.  So here we go.  We are going to do the survey.  Twitter wants your input on how we should shape our policies  and enforce our rules about world leaders participation.  The public conversation.  And I think some of this is maybe they're stinging a little bit because  after after they did ban President Trump,  the world got to be quieter and better.  And maybe some people I certainly thought Twitter was a little bit to blame  for what happened over the last.  Should they have done it earlier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, should they have done it or are they wrong and bring them back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I take it no one here is under 16.  Now, here's a random sample of hypothetical situations.  Consider the following hypothetical situation.  You see a tweet from a regular Twitter listener, a user, I mean,  who's located in your country.  They podcast a lot.  I have been doing this a little too long.  The tweet contains misleading information about Covid-19  in a different country.  It's from their personal account.  This is their third violation of the Twitter rules.  What action should Twitter take?  Should it take no action?  Should it not delete the tweet, but apply a label?  Should they not delete the tweet, but block others from liking,  retweeting or commenting on the tweet?  Gosh, I want to do both of those.  Should require the account holder to delete the tweet  before they tweet again or permanently suspend the account immediately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, your survey looks different from mine.  Yeah, each one is.  Yeah, it's randomly generated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's random. OK, great.  So you'll get a different situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would you do?  I was not paying attention.  OK. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Miss Hagenbotham, eyes up front, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eyes front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what would you do?  Were you TikToking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Phoenix Warp in our chat room says, it's simple.  If they violate the TOS, ban them.  What do you say?  I think they should both apply a label.  Describing the rule violation and block others from liking,  retweeting or commenting, because you kind of want to damp down  the spread of it and you want to give people the information.  I'm not sure I would delete the tweet because it's misleading  information about COVID-19.  It's not...  I mean, I think this is based on the content of it,  not on the rules violation or whatever.  And what do you say?  I'm pretty much right there with Mr. Leporte because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't necessarily want it deleted, because I think there is  value in knowing what's said and how...  If someone says something just absolutely heinous,  it's nice to know that you know who that person was that said it.  I think there's value in that.  So I wouldn't say delete it, but definitely delete it.  And I think that's the way to do it.  I think there's value in that.  So I wouldn't say delete it, but definitely label it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, if you delete the account or delete,  then he's just going to create another account.  Yeah, there's that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or go to parlor.  I'm tougher than you guys.  I would require him to delete the tweet before he can tweet again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you would not suspend him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not on this case, probably.  Okay.  Let's try another one.  I presumed it was a him, by the way, because misinformation  comes from men, but keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ms. Higginbotham, if you'll pay attention now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am now paying attention.  I'm teasing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't blame you.  I lost interest years ago.  I completely understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was trying to find the survey and I was...  It's a line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What line is it, Jeff?  You got to give her the line, apparently.  It's a line 69.  I need the line for life.  Line 69.  You are a regional state governor in our country.  You are tweeting misleading...  This is the same one.  Misleading information about COVID-19 in another country.  But this is from an official government account.  And it's your first violation.  First violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you see, you have to go first.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should...  Not delete.  Okay.  Same choices.  Definitely.  Okay.  Not delete.  Oh, you went away from the choices.  I was reading them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show the choices again, John, if you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The middle choices.  I think not delete.  I think you should not delete, but you should label.  And then block everybody from liking, retweeting.  So far you agree with me on both of those.  I think that's the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's a governmental account,  I'm going to say you should delete the tweet.  You should require them to delete the tweet.  Because it has a more significant...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  So that's very important.  Because of the reach.  That's important.  You're saying that government should be held  to a higher standard than users.  Absolutely.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're not talking about their own stuff.  Like if this government were...  If it was the state of Utah talking about things happening in Utah,  I'd be like, yeah, you should delete that tweet.  Well, that one.  If it's the state of Utah talking about Spain, I'd be like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But why is he tweeting about Spain  except to send a message to Utahans, Utonians?  Right?  He's the governor.  Anything he tweets on his official account  is a message from the government.  And if he's tweeting about COVID somewhere else,  there's a point to that.  To say it's a communication to his constituents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, let's say Joe Biden is tweeting something about...  Maybe it's not COVID-19 related,  but maybe he's trying to tell us something about China  that isn't actually true, but governments sometimes do lie to their citizens  when they tweet them.  Oh, that's interesting. Okay.  But it's a formal policy decision.  Maybe Utah wants to go to war with Spain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know.  Then in that case, I don't think you'd do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  I still think you should label them.  Label.  Say it.  I'd go for label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, Mr. LaPorte, you mentioned with them being in government having more...  It's a higher responsibility.  Did my camera die?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm seeing you.  I don't know what happened.  I think our button has failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were speaking about them being in government  and having a bigger, a large reach and more importance, I guess.  But what about these celebrities that have way more following  and just this bigger reach?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That nine-year-old kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or Chrissy Teigen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Chrissy Teigen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's Chrissy Teigen.  I don't think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People take what those celebrities say as gospel.  That's not their fault.  I see it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's people's fault. They're stupid.  They shouldn't pay attention to it just because they're famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell us how you really feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stupid people, I don't care.  I don't want to protect them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Matthew McConaughey is going to be the next governor of Texas.  Yeah, there's that.  All right, all right, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, he's not, is he?  He just said he hasn't ruled out...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Stacey, you're from the great state of Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think he has a chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I honestly think he couldn't be worse than Abbott.  Because Abbott doesn't...  I think we need to make a rule in this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop electing celebrities and billionaires.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, hold up.  It's a bad idea.  We're assuming that because Matthew McConaughey is kind of a vapid celebrity, he may not actually  be that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He lives in a van by the river.  He has no qualifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just saying, being a celebrity does not mean you can't be smart enough.  No, but it's not a qualification on the face of it.  Right.  But, I mean, do I think Matthew McConaughey...  All right, back to the survey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm curious to see when you all get this question because the first two that popped up on my  survey, they both says the tweet contains an ethnic slur about a group or people in  the country.  We didn't get that.  Oh.  My very first two, they have that in there.  They knew you were black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just...  Right.  They're going after you.  What's your flock cohort?  That's the question you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I think I'm B48.  Oh, we're going to get it for that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's...  If it were a hate tweet, take it down and...  No, suspend the account.  Hate tweets, period.  Done.  Zero tolerance.  Well, it depends on who you're hating on, is part of the argument.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is part of what Facebook's rules...  Okay, if you're hating on Nazis, I guess it's okay to hate on Nazis.  Right.  But part of Facebook's new rules in dealing with bad governments is that it's okay to  praise a violent organization if it's a revolutionary organization against a bad government.  Well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the Freedom Fighters in 1776.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Ben Franklin on Twitter.  That would have worked well.  Poor Richard would have worked perfectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Perfect.  Perfect.  All right, one more because I don't want...  This is endless.  This tweet is from a representative in the national legislature of another country,  not ours.  Hateful speech about a group of people in your country.  I hate those Texans.  They talk funny.  The tweet comes not from their official account but from a personal account, but it is the  fifth violation of the Twitter rules.  You don't talk bad about people in Texas.  Permanently suspend the account immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hateful speech about a group of people in my country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In our country.  They're not from here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  I would want to know that my legislator was a racist.  I would say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is exactly what I'm saying.  Don't delete...  There's value in knowing the shortcomings of some of these people that are leaders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would not delete it, but I won't let people like it or retweet it or comment it.  Unless they're calling for violent action, I'm sorry.  I don't think...  And I don't want them to be able to pull the...  If they tweeted aunt and they say something bad about black people, I don't want aunt's  mentions to go all crazy, right?  So, I don't want that to affect him.  But I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The constituents have a right to know that their representative is a dee-haw.  So, yeah, that's kind of why I didn't delete the first one either.  Because that's public...  But it's their fifth violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fifth violation, which I don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know these options.  I wish we could combine the second and third option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But really, that's not the point of this, and it's very obvious what the point is.  See, it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it is.  That's what's great about this.  It shows you the nuance.  See, it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You keep saying we should do stuff, but it's not easy.  What do you do?  That's the point of it, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think they killed him.  I think we eventually said that on this show a couple times, though.  It is hard.  It's very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just for curiosity, Leo, hit the next one just to see what the question is.  I already closed it.  Here, I'll tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of mine is this tweet is from a candidate for the National Head of Defense.  The author is in another country.  The tweet contains hateful speech about a group of people in another country.  It's their personal account, and it's their, again, fifth violation of the Twitter rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This probably happens a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the National Head of Defense.  I mean, those are the people who want to go with war with Utah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Saudi Defense Minister is saying the Israelis have got to stop mistreating Palestinians  or have to end their occupation of the West Bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so you might not have to take anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, I've got the perfect one.  All right.  A representative in the national legislature in your country has false claims that an election was stolen in your country  from an official government account.  It's the fifth violation.  Who would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's only their fifth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you love Sydney?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it Sydney Blumenthal?  Do you love her defense of...  She's being...  Sydney Powell, rather. Yes, sorry.  Oh, yeah, thank you.  Yeah, I don't know who Blumenthal is.  Her defense of her contention the election was stolen and there was massive fraud.  She's being sued, of course, by Dominion.  Her defense is, well, nobody would believe what I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except for 80% of Republican voters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody would believe that.  Silly country.  Silly.  No reasonable person would accept my statement as fact.  It's a merely expression of an opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sydney Blumenthal was like an editorial writer, I think, from way back when.  I feel like that's a real person and if it is, I apologize for it.  Is it the senator's cousin?  Yeah, I don't know.  American journalist and political operative.  Former aide to Bill Clinton.  Longtime confidant of Hillary Clinton.  So, yeah, there is a Sydney Blumenthal, but that's not who said it.  All right.  Do we have any line numbers to reiterate or consult or anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now he's back to line.  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, thank you. You're right. I left out the change log.  It's time for...  We'll do this quick, folks, because there's nothing to...  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How fast can you do it? Let's see.  Has Gmail been crashing on your phone? Google's fixing it.  Done.  Line two.  Chromebooks are getting Android 11 in beta with dark mode support and better app scaling.  Line three.  Stadia open sources some of its dev tools.  Line four.  Google updates chat UI for workspace users to match personal accounts.  Whatever that means.  Wait a minute. That might be useful for you.  Does that help you, Jeff?  Your chat UI in your workspace because you're using G Suite or Workspace.  I don't use their chat, so it doesn't matter.  Oh, but it would match now your personal account.  Well, good.  So that's a beginning of a unification.  Yeah, sure.  And that's the Google change log.  Record time.  Hey, Taco Bell did buy a social media ordering company.  And it's also bought an AI insets company, insights company.  What is going on?  By the way, the name of the social media ordering platform is Tic Toc.  Okay.  As the owner of Lip Lock, I am upset.  Tic Toc, Tic Tuk allows customers to order food while on social media.  How lazy do you have to be to order your Taco Bell in a tweet?  That is so freaking lazy.  Although if you're Taco Bell, you know, you like that because other people might see your order and say, that's a good idea.  Earlier, they bought Quantum.  Quantum uses, that's literally how it's spelled K-V-A-N-T-U-M uses artificial intelligence for consumer insights and marketing performance analytics.  By the way, Tic Toc's parent company is called Yum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You mean Taco Bell's parent company or the new Tic Toc's right now?  Tic Toc.  Yum Brands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's confusing.  Teebee's owner is Yum Brands.  Yum's in Louisville, I believe.  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't they own KFC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  KFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Pizza Hut and Habit Burger Grill, which is quite good.  Yes, it is actually.  Yeah, I like the Habit.  I like Habit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't been there in a year.  I'm debating whether I should go.  I know.  I know.  I know Stacey's.  The one near my home is bad.  The one near my home is bad.  Disapproving of you right now.  I can feel it.  I'm not disapproving of you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I can just feel it.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Prince Harry's got a job now that Meghan's pregnant.  More than one.  I should get a job.  His new job, titled Chief Impact Officer at Better Up, which is an employee coaching and  mental health startup.  Chief Impact Officer.  See, Harry's an example of a kid who wasn't brought up thinking you got to do a gig work  thing.  You got to build your brand.  Look, look, he's trying to learn how to do it.  He thought he'd be working for the family business.  The company?  Didn't work out.  The firm.  The firm didn't work out.  They call it the firm, don't they?  Yeah.  The royal family in England.  The firm.  He calls it the firm, I guess.  That's what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw a great video on TikTok.  Guy doing the diversity training in the castle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, jeez.  This is a joke, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because they're going to hire a diversity czar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll look for that one.  I'll look for that.  All right.  Let's take a break.  And when we come back, we're going to do the picks of the week.  And then we will get an update if that boat is still blocking.  Oh, good.  The Suez Canal.  I think we can go to a live nav map and find out.  The ever given.  The ever stuck.  They expect transit to resume sometime Wednesday or Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's still stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  It's okay.  It has a digital twin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're talking about forward networks.  Good job, man.  Good job.  You used to run networks.  You've been an assist admin.  Networks, especially nowadays, they are kind of black boxes.  You know what you've got on prem, and then it goes up to the cloud,  and maybe you've got multi homes, and then it goes from the cloud to the edge.  Then it's on the endpoints and then your users.  And it's a great mystery.  Wouldn't it be nice if you had a mathematical model and software  of your entire network that was kept up to date, that was completely accurate?  That's what forward networks does.  Created by four Stanford PhD students seven years ago.  They said, you know, we feel bad for these guys who are trying to figure out  what's going on in their network, the great mysteries of their network.  So they sought to apply principles of modern software development to network.  They created a digital twin, an accurate, completely 100% up to date,  in real time mathematical model, a single source of truth for how your network works.  Now, what can you do with it?  Well, you could look at it.  Actually, they have tools to do this and verify that the network's configured  correctly, is compliant with your policies, is behaving as you intend.  If they have this thing called behavior diffs, I love this so much.  You know what a diff is when you have two text files, you compare them with a diff.  They have behavior diffs that will allow the same thing, sign by side comparisons,  to see what's going to happen when you change a config file, for instance,  between any points in time.  This is our existing network.  This is the change network.  What are the diffs and how is this going to impact network performance?  Imagine knowing ahead of time before you change those BGP routing tables  and bring all of the network traffic to a small town in Maine.  Imagine knowing that ahead of time.  You can accurately predict the impact of a proposed change across every possible  traffic path.  That means you roll out changes with confidence.  You keep your network healthy and agile.  You can search network behavior.  You can search configuration and state network-wide.  It's got a very nice intuitive, powerful search tool.  Perform end-to-end path analyses across your network,  including, by the way, on-prem and cloud infrastructure.  You can proactively identify potential connectivity and security policy violations.  This is amazing.  50% faster resolution of network trouble tickets on average.  90% faster fixes related to audit processes.  33% reduction in aborted network updates due to identified errors.  And a 100% reduction in embarrassment when you apply a configuration change  that brings your company offline.  You don't want that to happen.  Forward networks will prevent it.  Let me tell you, some of the people who have been using forward networks,  I love the story about Goldman Sachs.  They have a massive network, as you might imagine.  They brought in forward networks.  They were so impressed by the tool, they led their series C funding round.  So Mark Andreessen loves forward networks.  That's why Andreessen Horowitz also was in that round and threshold,  committing $65 million.  PayPal was having an issue with their network.  They thought, gee, maybe we can build a tool that will somehow diagnose  these problems.  Fortunately, before they did, they found forward networks.  It did everything they needed.  Found the trouble spots, saved them time and money.  So many big networks use forward networks.  Telstra in Australia, Verizon in the US, Bank of America,  several large unnamed governmental agencies.  Look, this is the best way to know what's going on in your network.  Get network automation and verification for your intent-based network  with forward networks.  Your business depends on it.  There's a great demo waiting for you.  Forward networks.com slash twit.  Forward networks.com slash twit.  If you're interested, they've got a podcast called Seeking Truth in  Networking.  I love that name.  You'll find it wherever you can get your podcast.  Download it and listen.  I think you'll enjoy it.  But honestly, I want you to get the demo because this could save your life.  It certainly could save your network.  Forward networks.com slash twit.  This is the kind of software I love.  This is what software should do.  Can save you a lot of trouble.  Forward networks.com slash twit.  Thank you, forward networks, for supporting this week in Google.  Mashed potato says I should reopen the changelog.  Is there anything new?  Anything different?  The new Barnes and Noble nook?  Who cares?  Who cares?  Here, let's see a live stream of the situation in the Suez Canal.  It's not moving much, is it?  You know why?  It's not moving.  Look at the little bulldozer.  Look at the little tiny bulldozer.  Gonna move the big fat boat out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the memes that come from that.  She's digging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's digging.  Oh, itchy, itchy.  I'm just trying to find...  This says...  Well, that's just a single image.  I want a live stream.  Suez Canal live stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A live stream of it just sitting there?  Just sitting there, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on, they gotta have cameras there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's the Instagram account on that Twitter thread.  The Instagram account, I don't know if she's refreshed or not,  was on the boat behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's stuck.  The container ship is stuck right there.  Actually, there's some really cool...  I have some pictures.  I'd like to share my photo album from the Suez Canal, if you don't mind.  They have bridges that go across it, but they can't...  Uh-oh, Stacey, we're gonna be here for three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, Scoop's house has a webcam, sir, in the chat.  Get the slideshow out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are going into the Suez Canal.  Did you know the toll through the Suez Canal is $750,000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, and it ain't cheap to go through the canal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if there's any refunds on the current trips?  Yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  This whole thing is expensive.  That's a blurry one.  There's my boat.  Look at that.  Look how wide that is.  That gives you some idea of how big this ever given is,  if it's crossing the entire width of that canal.  Wow.  That is a big, big boat.  Okay, wait a minute.  I think we have a live feed.  It's not much.  A live feed.  How to watch.  Is authorities shift, stuck, ship?  No, that's not the live feed.  Boy, there are a lot of ads on this.  This is just a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why we need Flock and AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AMP and Flock.  It's the express.  Stacey, would you kick things off with your pick of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will, and it's so relevant for y'all.  How not to get stuck in a canal.  Well, it's relevant.  I actually haven't thought about telling you all about this  because it didn't seem relevant,  but since there's a boat stuck in the Suez Canal,  it's totally relevant.  I live right up.  I can see the sound from my house.  So I get to watch the container ships come in.  Oh, how fun.  The other day I saw an air traffic.  No, what are those called?  The big boats for the aircraft carrier.  Thank you.  Wow.  So we saw, yeah, it was the Nimitz coming into Bremerton  and there was like a plane on it.  It was so cool.  I'm jealous.  One of the first apps we downloaded,  we got our little telescope up so we can watch everything.  But the first app we downloaded is something called Marine Traffic.  And this is an app that if you sail,  you probably already know about it.  We paid for the $10 a year subscription.  But what it is is we just go and you can see,  you can check the ever given on this thing.  Everyone else is using Vessel Watch, which is totally fine.  It's just, I happen to have personal experience with Marine Tracker,  or sorry, Marine Traffic.  So yeah, and the cool thing is on your phone,  you can actually once again,  lift your phone, show it the boat,  and the data will come up about that particular boat.  Oh, that's neat.  Yeah, so if you're on the water or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This happens all the time.  I see when we go on our cruises or go to the harbor,  you see boats and you want to know who owns that or where is it going,  where is it from.  That sounds like fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, there's a free version and then there's a $10,  so $9.99 a year plan that gets you,  it's the annual starter pack and that gets you a little bit more,  like all the vessel details, the port it's going to,  you can track certain vessels.  We were tracking the Nimitz so we could be like,  we wanted to make sure we were there when it was coming in.  Oh, that's so cool.  So yeah, it's a fun app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  MarineTraffic.com, iOS or Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool.  Really nice.  And here's the Marine Tracker plot of the Suez Canal, by the way.  You can see what's going on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can filter out all the ships that are not cargo ships

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you want to filter out all the tugs.  Look how many boats are just stuck right at Port Said  where they're about to enter.  Wow, that's really amazing.  Good pick.  Very timely.  Jeff Jarvis, a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So last week I told you about WhaleNet,  how once people started hunting whales,  the whales learned and obviously somehow communicated with each other  in a big worldwide network and the killings went down like 58%.  So we were amazed.  This is in the time of...  What's his name? Who wrote it? Melville, right?  It was the time of Melville and when whalers and all that.  Well, this week we find out that humpback whales are organizing  in huge numbers and no one knows why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they want to join a union?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they are our new masters and I for one welcome them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it. Humpback whales are organizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They normally stay in groups of 10 to 20 would be large.  They're congregating in groups of 20 to 200 off the coast of South Africa  where they normally aren't either.  Experts are stumped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a little bit scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they're consulting like what the heck's going on with the climate or  hey, is it hard to breathe where you are because of ocean?  What's it called when carbon dioxide gets in there?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The equivalent of us with a bug in your mouth.  You got a plastic bag in your mouth. Don't you hate that?  Good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  WhaleNet.  The whales are organizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also put in one just for you.  You love flying things generally, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. I saw this and I appreciate that you put it in there.  I've seen it before and it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How to maintain an airport in Antarctica.  That was just I found that fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh wow. From FlightRadar, which is by the way like Marine Traffic for flights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great app. I use it all the time.  Yeah, FlightRadar24.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Troll Research Station. How to operate an airport in Antarctica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. Wow. Wow.  Trying to keep things warm, but yet cold enough so you can fly off of the runway.  Yeah, you don't want to turn it into slush either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a pretty awesome video on that link there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because they're bringing in freighters. So these are like big, big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they got to get all the food and everything in there for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that like a Zamboni for the runway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They cover the runway with snow when they don't use it so it doesn't melt or anything.  And then they have to take the snow off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they didn't have to scrape it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is exactly a Zamboni.  Yeah.  That's hysterical.  A mixture of cold water, ice, chips and snow is poured on, allowed to harden and smoothed over.  Just like making an ice rink.  Wow.  Mr. Ant Pruitt.  What's your thing this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a couple things.  The first one was, I know some folks have been trying to find that dream job during this pandemic.  Well, there is a winery here in Sonoma County that's offering an opportunity to apply for your dream job in wine.  And apparently they've done this before.  They've done this before because they have someone that's still there on their staff that did the same thing with this process.  Are they looking for a social media person?  No, it's whatever you'd like for it to be within wine.  I'd like to drink it, please.  Not just that.  But if you're curious about a profession in winemaking, send them a video of what you want to be and why you would be the best person for that job.  And apparently they've done this before and it's worked.  I believe there's a video on that link that I shared.  Yes, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Murphy Good is pretty good wine.  I like Murphy Good.  Let's see.  Boy, they have the worst cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pre-rent for a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Upload video of your application.  So you have to do a video to get this.  Yeah.  Do you want to work and live in Sonoma?  Well, you're just up the road a piece.  Here you are looking for a changing career to pursue your passion.  Do you want a really good job?  This is such good marketing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And rent-free.  Is this what it looks like in Sonoma County?  Because I'd like to move there too.  Six-figure salary and a year's worth of Murphy Good wine.  This is all just a little bankrupting for me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, any wine goes with Cacio e Pepe.  Any wine at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just whatever can cut the grease.  Lungs are red.  So they did this last year.  So this guy is giving up his seat to let you take his replacement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a good gig.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's only a year though.  Well, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not bad.  Set you up for something else though.  And then the other thing is I've been playing with this travel doc because I've been having some thoughts on my computer here recently, but this is from OWC.  I own that travel doc.  I like it.  It's a good one.  I've been trying to find something that's going to have an SD card reader because a lot of laptops don't have SD card reader.  Show the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my favorite part.  But this is the cable.  Look at that.  It goes right in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then when you take it out, it still sits nice and neat right there in its own little divot.  Mine broke right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's USB-C.  Yeah.  Mine stopped working.  I don't know if I pulled the cable too hard or something, but.  I wouldn't be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it lets you read.  I was sad because I love it.  Yeah.  It lets you read up to UHS-II SD card.  So if you have like a V60 or V90 SD card for your super high resolution video, I'm moving it wrong way.  There we go.  Sorry.  You're going to be able to pull that data off pretty fast and not have to worry about bottleneck because of that USB-C.  That's good stuff.  Nice.  And I think it was 60 bucks or so.  I can't remember.  They're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Otherworld Computing is good.  I like their stuff.  It works with the iPad as well as any computer with a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's usually more on that Mac side of thing, but I've.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you found it worked on a Windows machine and all that?  I never tried it with one.  So good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then my last one.  Well, I shall do two quick.  The last one will be my next one will be for Floss.  Today we had Keith Packard on air and this was a perfect time, perfectly time episode for him to be on because of some interesting news regarding Mr.  Richard Stallman.  Oh, yeah.  Free Software Foundation.  So make sure you check out Floss Weekly.  I think it's episode 622.  Let me double check.  Yep.  Episode 622.  Check that out.  Very, very interesting.  Very, very interesting conversation there on Floss Weekly, twit.TV slash floss.  And lastly, if you don't mind, would you click on that link for this here house call?  Because it's just a proud moment that I wanted to show a house call to the Pruitt house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Oh, no, he's going home.  Let's see.  Let's let's play this video.  Let me see.  Can I go bigger with it?  Oh, should be able to.  Here it is.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Is this a hard head in that outfit?  The senior hardhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the senior hardhead starting at about 95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is a punt reception or a kickoff return.  Oh, wow.  Is that you, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's me yelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Ant sent us all a note saying I'm going to be a little horse at work today.  Now I know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Beautiful Ant.  Now I know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the first kickoff return for that school in about four years.  All the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He might be.  He could be.  He's going all the way.  That's fantastic.  Was he really stoked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we all were.  The game was out of reach at that point, but it was still pretty cool to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody came even close.  He didn't even get touched.  He hit the jets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was quite proud of the hardhead.  He's very fast.  The only person near him is his teammate.  That's really good.  And also his younger brother, the other hardhead, they had their game the same day.  He unfortunately went out early in the fourth quarter because he cramped up, but prior to that he was kicking butt to at quarterback.  He had a 35 yard touchdown pass.  Are you glad high school football's back?  Touchdown pass.  I'm pretty pumped right now.  Is it Friday night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they do Friday night football?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  This week the JV team will be playing the Petaluma High School on Friday, but the varsity is not playing until Tuesday.  They'll be playing that fancy Cardinal Newman school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they're good, the Cardinal Newman.  Yeah, so I want to see how that goes.  Nicholas Montana used to play for them.  Yeah.  Well, that's awesome.  I'll just throw this one in as a quick pick before we head out.  This is an AI experiment from Google, Experiments with Google.com, the infinite drum machine.  Oh, dude.  You can play drums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does this go with the blob opera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you want percussion.  You can play drums with normal objects from the real world.  That's a computer laptop, a magazine.  Here's a zipper jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a projector slide.  Mr. Howell is just going crazy right now.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see the track below?  So you pick what you want.  You pick where it goes.  You want a truck, land, rover, defender, interior, clutch release.  Or maybe, let's see.  Oh, how about, boy, that's good.  Food peel, golf club shuffle clatter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the green cluster is like sounds or is that like people's sound?
