Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Stacey has the week off, but Glenn Fleischman's here.  He's always a lot of fun.  He's joining Aunt Pruitt, Jeff Jarvis.  There is a lot to talk about, the new bills or regulations  in the EU and how they will affect Google, Apple,  and all of big tech.  That's going to be a big story, and there's  a lot to talk about there.  Why flat earthers are never going to change their mind,  how they paint ceramics, and what to do about meat sweats.  It's all coming up next.  Yeah, I know.  It's time for Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't seem to get rid of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was a star on Sunday's Twitter,  which was great fun.  Thank you.  And we've saved a few stories for your visit today.  So flung away.  We also have, of course, Ant Pruitt, hands-on photography.  Hello, Ant.  Hello, Mr. LaPorte.  Welcome back.  Community manager at the club.  Thank you.  And I do owe a thanks to Jeff Jarvis, who ran the show  as a democracy last week.  Great, great, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not that much of a democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Benito has joined us as our board op.  Are you going to be a predator, Benito?  Are you going to do all three, the editing, the producing,  and the technical direction?  Are you going to do all of that?  Oh, not today.  Just soon.  So we welcome Benito.  And Benito, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Got a throat in the deep end last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he was here last week.  Oh, yeah.  OK.  In the Jeff August.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I want to thank the folks out there who said nice things  on Twitter about my week in Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was with the giant Cheeto, though?  I heard about that.  That was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So we have it in the rundown today, too.  Oh, no.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We got all over the big story of the week, which  is tech after row.  And then we wanted a little lighter moment.  So Taco Bell announced a 16 times larger Cheeto tostada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cheez-It, not Cheeto, I guess.  Cheez-It.  Thank you.  I wanted my Cheez-It.  Oh, yeah.  Cheez-It.  That would be fun, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  16 times larger Cheeto would be fun, too.  You could float in the pool with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff, and I'll show you Benito when you play that.  Jeff is the Leonard Towne Professor  for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmont  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New  York, perfectly performed by our choral group,  who is now going out for cigarettes.  We continue with the Boris Johnson watch.  Alexander Boris DeFifle Johnson.  Oh, my gosh.  He says, I will not quit.  So I know we've lost all of our British viewers  who are watching the tube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He will fight on the benches.  He will fight on the benches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will fight them in the bushes.  I will fight them at 10 downing parties.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Blood.  He's putting the Queen in an uncomfortable position,  like some kind of chess player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Does the Queen?  How does the Queen get involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's this whole issue about dissolving Parliament,  which if he calls for the Queen to do it,  she has limited choices and some which  could produce a constitutional crisis about the nature  of the monarchy.  So she probably won't.  But it's a kerfuffle or an ado.  Something could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This happened in Canada, the pro-rogue,  which is to discontinue a session of Parliament  without dissolving it.  And I remember this was a big thing in Canada  because the Queen is the titular head of the Canadian government

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as well.  Is she still?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a Commonwealth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jamaica?  Jamaica.  She's got Jamaica.  She's got Australia.  Aruba, Jamaica, girl, I need a.  Anyway.  Monarch.  Monarch.  We will continue to follow that story.  Although we will not show any videos of Queen Elizabeth  and Paddington the Bear because this show is still held hostage  by the studio canal.  No, no, no.  You may not show any videos of Paddington the Bear  without express written condition  of the commissioner of Major League Baseball.  I guess we'll do one Rose story, but just one.  Because it is still an issue.  Google has now said there is this data loophole about location.  Developers can see where you are.  So they're going to stop sending your visits  to a variety of places, including abortion clinics.  Stop recording those.  It'll turn off the recording.  And the developers apparently have an ability  to see other apps on the phone.  So this is a big deal.  Google has allowed thousands of companies  to monitor and sell personal data from Android smartphones.  It took a further step on Friday to limit the smartphone data that  could be used to police new abortion restrictions,  automatically deleting location history on phones  that are close to a sensitive medical location.  But also, there's this issue of apps checking  to see whether apps are installed.  So I guess that's a little sensitive.  I don't think they should have allowed in the first place.  Collecting, Google said, in March 2021,  we announced we plan to restrict access to this permission  so that only utility apps, such as device search antivirus  and file manager apps, can see what other apps are installed  on the phone.  Collecting app inventory data to sell it or share it for analytics  or ads monetization purposes has never been allowed.  That doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  They just, you know, if we catch you, mm-mm-mm.  So there you have it.  Query all packages will be restricted from July 12th.  The other big story, and this one,  I feel like we got to get the internet's lawyer on for this  or something, but the EU has now approved two big regulations  that will very much impact Google,  the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act.  There are two of them, DMA and DSA.  The DMA is more about competition,  and I think that's the one that's going to probably more  affect Google, but Google will be affected by both of them.  It says that digital service, quote,  gatekeepers who break the laws for promoting competition,  the law says these companies must obtain explicit consent  to target ads based on personal data.  That, of course, completely undermines Google's model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It undermines most media companies.  It undermines most of the entire media business now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see what Google does about this.  It requires interoperability between messaging platforms.  Of course, that's probably targeted at Apple's iMessage,  which is very much a closed...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, also targeted at Facebook's, at Meta's.  Facebook, WhatsApp, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although it's good for Meta, if WhatsApp can interoperate  with Apple's messages, that's very good for Meta.  Really, Apple has this monopoly on iPhones with messaging.  Highly complex.  It also says that large platforms must let,  and this affects Apple more than Google,  because you can choose browsers on Android,  let users select a browser, search engine,  and personal voice assistant of their choice.  Although Google is very much involved,  because Google pays, it is estimated,  between $10 and $12 billion a year to Apple  to be the default search engine on Safari on iPhones.  Apple does not let any other browser use its own engine.  You have to use WebKit, the Safari engine, on iPhones.  So really, Safari has a monopoly on iPhone  with everything but the UI.  And you can change search engines,  but as you know, the default is going to be  always the dominant search engine.  So Google pays a lot for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Apple's been quietly building a search engine, too.  Isn't that a...  I mean, if I look at my logs on my server,  I'll sometimes see massive queries from Apple addresses  for various pages of sites that are operating.  So, like so many things at Apple,  they've got things in the lab that they roll out  when they're convenient.  And I think they've probably got enough storage  and data capacity to run a search engine  if they had to for their customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can have a robots.txt  that will allow Apple visiting or block it.  That's interesting.  I haven't looked at my logs in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I sometimes see, I have relatively low-end server,  virtual server, so occasionally people get overzealous  and I have to put in some blocks  and I have software that's like,  hey, Apple just requested 50,000 pages.  And like, oh, they probably can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had no idea they were spidering.  That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, did you know about...  I didn't know why this has been around for a while.  I didn't know what Open...  Common Crawl?  I do not know about Common Crawl.  What is that?  CommonCrawl.org is an open crawl of the web.  I'm not saying Apple's gonna use that.  Anybody can access it.  But anybody can access it.  Oh, interesting.  Isn't this really interesting?  Yeah.  Because I've been playing a lot with GPT-3  and writing about Lambda and all of that.  This is the kind of stuff you use as the...  For your data set.  The data set, right.  Thank you.  So I'm not saying that's that,  but crawling used to be this high art  and difficult barrier to go over  for functionality of other applications.  I think it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a big deal.  I think it still is.  I think Google...  I think so.  For the level of quality you get, yes.  It really are only two search engines,  Google and Bing.  Everything else is derivative.  I mean, you can go to DuckDuckGo.  They say that.  He said Bing and then just Gaffaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  One and a half.  I always laugh when I hear Bing.  He just came off Windows Weekly,  so he has to suppress his natural view of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't you have Jonathan Mann's Bing song  just queued up to go at any time?  I should.  Come on.  Right.  One of his song-a-days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bing goes the internet.  It would be meaningless  if it weren't the default search engine  in Microsoft Windows.  And I think because, again,  the tyranny of the default,  people don't change things,  Bing is still pretty important.  It's not.  I mean, you know what?  Google does not want Bing not to succeed  because that's the same reason  Microsoft wanted Apple around.  Anti-trust stuff.  Yeah.  Google can credibly say,  we're not a monopoly, Your Honor.  Even in the EU, where they are much more dominant,  Google's only about 80% of the browser market.  I think it's only 60% in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm a funny,  I don't know if it's exactly a technical question.  I mean, we've all been around the block  a few million times,  and I feel like it shouldn't be that hard  to make a search engine.  And I don't mean that in this facile,  well, there's not that many,  it's not that big a deal,  but the internet kind of stabilized, right?  There's a lot of storage.  Storage is relatively cheap.  Computational power is relatively cheap.  There are companies out there with piles of money  who don't know what to do to reinvest it.  I actually don't understand why somebody,  I mean, Apple is a likely candidate, as I say,  but it's not an intractable problem the way it was  when you literally couldn't buy enough servers  to stick in racks fast enough  to keep up with the growth of the net.  And a lot of sites are programmatically driven now.  They're database driven.  So when you go to Amazon,  it's a whole different matter now  than when it seemed like a million static pages.  500 million database driven pages.  So I don't know, I feel like there's something missing.  Is there not enough money to extract it?  Or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got a billion dollars a year, Glenn?  Cause that's the estimate of how much of it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We can ask Elon Musk, I think he's probably...  So there are some people who are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you're also dealing with spam.  You're dealing with spam.  There are big companies that can do this.  You're trying to intuit the content,  the topicality of the content.  It's not just...  No, all true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But don't you think there's people,  enough computer scientists have been minted  enough AI work?  I mean, is there enough work of all kinds out there?  Oh, it's doable, yeah, it's just expensive.  Yeah, but expensive to the scale  of where you have trillion dollar companies  and Microsoft's engine is not great,  even though the company's been executing  a lot of other ways very well.  Bing is not great.  And DuckDuckGo is kind of a weird,  the fact that it's emerged so much  because of privacy issues in a world  in which there are trillion dollar companies  that could throw a billion dollars a year at a problem  if they felt like there was a return.  I don't know, I feel like I'm missing a piece here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Another way to put it, Glenn,  is what's the next generation of search?  Oh, yeah.  So I think what you're talking about is search,  as we know it, like phones, has been static for a while.  You're totally right.  And we're old enough,  have you been around the block a few times, as you say?  We're old enough to remember the advance  that Google was on Fast and on AltaVista at all, right?  Because of its, but what was different about it was,  of course, PageRank was about seeing,  understanding the world differently.  And I think that there are frontiers to be had  when you get to things like quality or relevance  or authority that are much harder problems to attack,  which I would hope that Google would be the one attacking,  because I don't think there are really companies  set in their ways, but is search done  is kind of what you're saying,  or are there new frontiers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's it.  I mean, that's where you get into Siri  and voice assistants where maybe the issue is,  I mean, it's nice.  I still laugh because I've got an iPhone,  I'm a very Apple committed person,  and I'm trying to get Siri  where it likes it around watching TV, the family,  and somebody asks a question, I'm like,  oh, I'll ask Siri, and Siri gives me a lousy answer.  I'm like, all right, I'm going to launch my Google app,  because I know when I use voice recognition on Google,  its response will be even better  than if I typed it in on the Google app  and I get the answer I want.  I mean, so that's kind of it,  is Google feels more advanced in that sort of query,  even though Apple, I know really,  I mean, there's a lot of companies  that would love to be the master of that new domain, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you're saying there's a lot of companies  that would love to be the master.  Who are some of those companies?  Because there's only going to be a handful of them  that can afford it, number one.  And number two, is it a big enough return on the investment?  Google is making a ton of money.  Why would someone leave Google  if there was a new search engine that's out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's one of the reasons  there's all that conversations about what's next,  because nobody wants to go head to head against Google.  It's not merely the billion dollars a year  that you'd have to spend to spider the net.  There's also, Google's been doing it for 20 years,  so they have a huge amount of track record historic.  The queries are your value.  Our queries are the value.  So I think probably, and by the way,  to get back to our original subject,  with the EU getting involved,  with the EU getting involved in regulating all of this,  you might think twice before saying,  I'm going to plunge a billion dollars a year  plus whatever software development costs are to do this.  Brave says they're doing a search engine.  DuckDuckGo says they're doing a search engine.  But none of these attempts, I think,  really compete with Bing and Google.  By the way, just so you know, I looked it up.  Google in the US is a 70% market share.  Bing is 13.3%.  Maybe this must be global,  because Baidu is in there at 12.5%.  And Yahoo's still around at 2%.  I don't know if that's even fair to say,  because Yahoo's based on Bing.  But Google has held pretty steady for desktop.  Now, that might be a little bit different  if you look at mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we can do that, I think.  Device type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Change that.  Google is not stressing.  Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, Google's even more dominant.  Mobile, almost 95%.  Okay, nevermind.  Man.  Man.  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, I guess the question,  I mean, it's just kind of one of those things about,  like, does time travel exist?  Well, if it did,  we probably would have already seen time travelers.  So maybe you can't have another good search engine,  one that competes with Google,  because it would have happened by now  Because you'd have to kill your grandfather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the Google grandfather paradox, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't Google your grandfather.  No, I've asked that question.  It's a really good question, Glen,  is why isn't there competition  in what is clearly a very profitable,  if Google can afford to give Apple $12 billion a year,  just so that it's the default search engine on iPhones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's a lot of money.  A lot of cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of cash flow being driven by a browser.  Clearly, though, I think it's fair to say,  and Google's been in trouble for a while,  favoring its own properties,  and that's one of the things that DMA  is particularly there to fight against.  This is, of course, in this way it works in the EU,  because of complaints from,  you know, remember Google's shopping,  people complained about that.  Yelp complains about Google reviews, that kind of thing.  So it comes from competitors,  but it is now official, the Digital Markets Act.  The Digital Services Act only affects platforms  with 45 million monthly active users,  so it's pretty much aimed at Facebook and Twitter,  I guess, Twitter might just skate in under that.  If Google had Google+, maybe, I don't know.  So the DSA puts responsibility on platforms to police  and take down illegal content.  The problem is, what is illegal speech?  This is what, of course, Elon Musk  has been trying to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you're giving him more credit than he needs to,  but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google and Apple both are gonna have problems  with their app stores, because of the Digital Markets Act.  This can be very interesting.  Now, one story I saw from Reuters said,  the EU has approved these regulations,  but hasn't funded them, and so enforcement may lag.  The fines are significant.  The fines for violations of the Digital Markets Act,  up to 10% of global revenue.  For the Digital Services Act, 6% of global revenue.  That's billions, obviously, and enough to sustain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Unless you are bad, then it goes up to 20%.  Yeah, if you do it again, whew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, but the question remains,  GDPR wasn't enforced right away,  but did have its impact, didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, did it, though?  I was just reading an article,  I wish I could remember it immediately,  just a few days ago, about the impact of GDPR,  and that there were a lot of initial complaints,  there was the perception something would change,  and then very little has actually happened.  Some people blame it partly on the pandemic,  because it produced kind of molasses flow in the EU,  which was focused on other things.  But did the GDPR do anything but give us more,  disable access to EU residents from resources  that weren't GDPR compliant, and put more,  accept all these various cookies messages,  like even more complicated ones on our screen?  I don't know that, I would love to find  the list of the fines, I think in the end,  no one's been fined extremely,  and I think some complaints are now four years old  in the system without having been fully acted upon,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and I also saw, sorry, Glenn, I also saw a story,  maybe it's the same one you saw,  that, I can't find it either, I thought I bookmarked it,  that it basically benefited Google.  That it's all the small guys,  as happens in these regulatory moments,  the capture is the big guys can afford to deal with  whatever it is, okay fine, we'll deal with it,  but new competition is harmed.  I've been on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I found it, it was at Wired Magazine,  how GDPR is failing from May, Matt Burgess,  that's the story, and I think that was the conclusion,  I'm sorry, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, I might disagree with that,  because, for instance, we wouldn't have  the California Privacy Protection Act without GDPR.  It emboldened California legislature to follow suit.  I don't know if failing is the right word,  and it's also early days, things move very, very slowly,  I mean, this is one reason Google probably doesn't have  to worry about the DMA and the DSA so much right away,  because it may take a decade to litigate this all,  and these big companies absolutely will fight it  every step of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And each, unless I'm wrong here,  each country will do its version.  That's the other thing.  This is what's happened with other things,  and so they'll be litigated separately.  It's so complicated, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there have been quite a few,  I think there have been quite a few actions based on GDPR  that have been taken by the Netherlands, by France,  I mean, I think that these things are happening.  They're just not, it's not the sky is falling,  it's taking a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I should say actions, I should divide that,  because I think the thing this article focused on,  and that's what reminded me is back when the GDPR passed,  you had individuals and some groups  file complaints immediately,  and some of those complaints four years later  remain completely unresolved, right?  So that was, so the penalty part may have lacked,  but I am totally, I will back up on my words,  because as we know, in 2018,  and it's happened in successive years,  two other things have happened similarly,  a lot of the big companies, DoubleClick and Google  and advertising networks, Microsoft's advertising division,  they had to completely retool what they were doing  to be as compliant as possible.  So even if their complaints have not gone through,  yeah, the complaints haven't necessarily gone through,  but they changed their entire method of doing business  to the extent they thought they had to.  And so the question is, do they have to do more?  And the complaints process was supposed to provide  a check on that,  and I don't think the complaints process was working,  but the incentive of there is now a law in place  that will affect the union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, from the same Wired article,  Luxembourg has fined Amazon 746 million euros.  That's not an insignificant amount of money.  Luxembourg.  Luxembourg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Amazon has its operations extensively.  They probably reap $100 billion in revenue  as recorded in Luxembourg or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Ireland fined WhatsApp 225 million euros last year,  both decisions under appeal,  and that's what happens as it drags on.  So we go back and forth on this show all the time, Glenn,  about what the remedy is for big tech.  We talked on the show on Sunday  about the negatives versus the positives of tech,  and of course, that's something Jeff's always reminding us,  that the net is probably positive of big tech.  And the prosecution of these things is very slow,  but we'd have to do something.  I don't think big tech should get to decide  what's okay and what's not okay, right?  You want government to?  Yes, that's our...  Is speech okay?  What's speech?  No, no, I want society to,  and government is the arm of society.  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, government is interested parties,  and we have a First Amendment for a reason,  and I'm glad we do,  because otherwise right now we'd be having...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how would society enforce it, then?  Oh, speech.  So you stipulate...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Through the market, through norms.  It's slow, it's difficult,  but it's the way it's happened since...  Get ready, folks, get your glass ready, since Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Drinking here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how we do on this show, Mr. Glenn.  Find some type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like you're right.  I mean, government's imperfect, but it is...  Dangerous, government's dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I'm a Democrat, I'm not a libertarian,  I'm just being very clear here.  When it comes to speech,  look what's happening in Florida,  look what's happening in Texas,  where they're trying to impose noxious speech,  where the governor of Florida is trying to tell teachers  what they can and cannot say,  where in Texas they wanna tell teachers  they can't say slavery,  it has to be forced relocation.  That's when government gets involved in speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Forced relocation, I miss that.  It's a really inconvenienced...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm guessing Mr. LaPorte  would play devil's advocate here and say  that society is influencing the government.  Societal norms potentially influencing government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess you could, I mean, geez,  having great faith in the invisible hand of the free market  is probably just as foolish  as having great faith in government.  I'm not saying I'm faith in it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm just saying it's what ends up happening.  I've got a whole chapter in the book about this.  Efforts to censor almost inevitably  lead to unintended consequences and ill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, government regulation does not have to mean censorship.  In fact, this DSA and this DMA  seem not to be about censorship,  but about trying to keep it competitive  for smaller companies, right?  That's different from speech.  I didn't say anything about speech.  I didn't say anything about speech.  I'm severely saying that it is the realm,  of the appropriate for society to express its desires  from these companies through government action,  through regulation, that is the most direct means we have.  The market forces aren't necessarily very effective,  and norms, what the hell are you talking about, norms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can I throw another log on the fire here,  which is just that the latest trend has been  to use citizen enforcement through civil action.  Which is horrible, I agree.  Technically enabled by government,  but it's civil action and then individuals are involved  and there's monetary damages typically, right?  And in California, if somebody is on the pro,  like a second amendment maximalist track,  you can look to California and say,  well, if you like, say, the restriction of speech  in some areas, the restriction of certain  constitutional rights through private lawsuits,  well, in California may impose a law that would allow  people to sue over certain aspects of gun ownership  on a private basis using the same principle  and have the same outcome.  So it's a double-edged sword there too,  because if the government enables individual action  to sort of pursue as an arm of government,  and the California Privacy Act is,  you have to have a stake there, right?  You have the law like the Texas Abortion Law  and the California is proposed like gun related law,  those both give you standing just by being a member,  somebody in the state, right?  But the California Privacy Act, you have the standing  because you wanna get information from a company,  a company's done you harm.  So that direct connection gives you both a reason  to do something and a reason for state mechanisms  to act partly on your behalf, right?  And a company to be penalized for it.  But I think we're moving to an era in which private actors  may be enabled to take essentially quasi-governmental action  by using lawsuits, which is, I don't think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we all agree that's a terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's being tried out, Supreme Court doesn't seem  to have an opinion on it yet, which is also terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, it's my understanding that that was  the intent of the Texas legislature is to end  around the Supreme Court, right?  They don't have to do that anymore thanks to the road.  Exactly.  So that was a necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look, when the soldiers are being,  when we start dealing with Fourth Amendment right,  is a Fourth Amendment right,  the quartering soldiers in your house,  then you're gonna have complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then we're gonna have a problem here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We do not talk enough about the Fourth Amendment.  I might have a spare bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We'll be quartering women trying to get abortions  in our house instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Jeff, do you feel that your entire reliance  on reining in big tech should be free market and norms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was going on my speech rant.  I thought that's what you were talking about.  No, but there was a great paper by James Dewar  at the Rand Corporation in the 80s,  in which he argued, looking back at,  I'm gonna do it again, folks, get ready,  the early days of print and Gutenberg.  That countries that tried to control print  fell behind, societally, fell behind in many ways.  And he says that the internet is filled with  special unintended consequences.  Speech is a very special thing.  Speech is special, but even beyond that, government,  I mean, GDPR, I think you're right,  it's causing other things like California,  but GDPR is clumsily and badly written and has issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, how do we, let's say,  we all agree that we should control our data  and not big companies.  We should have a say in what happens to us.  What does that mean, though, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It means that I should have a say.  When you buy something on Amazon,  Amazon has a right to know what you bought.  You are in a transaction with someone.  That's so, for you to say, I own that,  well, no, you only own half of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fine, but if my internet service provider  is selling a list of websites I visit to Amazon,  I should have some control over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also, arguably, you could do something like proxy buying.  Like, what if, I'm not suggesting  that we put this into effect,  but it's kind of like drop shipping.  What if we could order from Amazon?  They never saw who we were.  All they knew was a charge had been approved  in an anonymous fashion,  and when they sent it to a shipper to go out,  the shipper wouldn't disclose to Amazon my address.  I mean, that's not infeasible,  and it's actually done for certain kinds of purchases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, honestly, in most cases,  it's people's interest that Amazon knows you buy it,  so that you could return it,  so that you could complain about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's plausible.  You could have an entirely proxy-based system,  which Amazon, I mean, that's an extreme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an extreme, but it's not infeasible.  I think I would go the middle ground,  which say it's fine for Amazon  to know about a transaction I have.  That's a first-party transaction.  That's fine.  It's the collection of data by third parties  and the selling on to other people  that people are really concerned about.  Can we agree that there should be some means of us,  as consumers, controlling that?  There isn't currently.  The only way to stop that would be regulation, I think.  I don't have a choice of which ISP I use.  That's a monopolistic market.  So, I mean, there's...  I don't think there are a lot of resources.  Well, what Google just did when it came to...  I can't use the free market to say,  oh, I don't want to use Comcast.  I don't have a reasonable choice.  Well, that's a different question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a monopolistic question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, why can't that be fixed?  Why not fix that first before getting into some other stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I also think that I should also have the right  to tell Comcast, stop looking at what I'm doing.  We have, just as you talked about, Glenn,  these dropshipping, we have technical means  to hide our tracks from our internet service providers,  but I think it should be illegal.  Let's use something that's even more topical.  Shouldn't it be illegal for a period tracking app  to sell that data on to third parties, not just Tampax,  but maybe some citizen in Texas that wants to sue?  Should that not be illegal?  Are you saying market forces and norms should stop that?  Because it's not doing a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I would imagine that if it gets out  that any such app is doing that,  then every single user would stop using it,  so market forces would probably be ahead  of a two-year legislative process.  That's all.  I'm not saying you can't pass a law, fine,  but if it's found out that that's occurring  and that they're doing an app to serve women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess what it comes down to, you're right,  but what comes down to me is it feels like  there are wrong things to do.  Like an app developer, that's wrong for them to do that.  And that it's appropriate for government  to make a law against something that's wrong.  And I kind of want them to.  And it shouldn't be incumbent on me.  Yeah, but you watched the hearings.  It shouldn't be incumbent on me to figure out  that, oh, this is happening.  It's opaque, it's not obvious it's happening.  The only reason we know it's happening  is because we have a strong independent press  that reports on it, otherwise we would not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right, and that's your best protection, Leo.  I mean, again, you watched the hearings with Facebook  and Google and their idiots.  I think it's all of the above.  Right, so good, fine, agreed.  Because if you're gonna depend upon government,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's a lot of food to pick in place.  No, but it sounds like you wanna take that weapon out

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  of the arsenal.  No, I don't wanna take that weapon out.  And we've done this on the show, I'm not gonna bore.  I think there's different models for it  because it's a rapidly changing world.  And when I was on the Transatlantic High-Level Working Group  on Content Moderation and Freedom of Expression  on the internet.  The group, which included former head of DHS,  former president of Estonia, a lot of researchers,  smarter than I am, what we came up with in the end  was a recommendation of accountability through transparency.  The form of the regulation should take  is to demand that platforms hand over data to researchers  so we know what the impact is.  Now I go one step beyond what the group did.  And I think that they should be required  to make statements of what they warrant to their users  and they can be held accountable for it  as the FTC would hold you accountable for,  if you make a microphone and say that it will make you all,  us all sound like Leo Laporte and happy and it doesn't,  the FTC says we're not gonna tell you  how to make a microphone, but you lied  and we're gonna hold you accountable for that.  So the question becomes, yes,  government should hold you accountable, but to what?  To what standard?  And to have one standard for all online companies  doesn't make as much sense as saying they should be  held accountable for the warrants they make  and they should make warrants and they're not making them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry we dragged you into this, Glenn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love this stuff, I love this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's challenging to figure out what you do about it.  And I think my point of view is coming  from this kind of injured party,  but it's wrong and there ought to be a law.  Something must be done.  I fear that Jeff is kind of the Robert McNamara of-  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Kind of the best and the brightest establishment saying,  no, no, let the people decide and nothing's gonna happen  and we're gonna end up in a quagmire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've already heard the Rand Corporation say that.  No, jeez.  Robert McNamara, are we in the 60s?  It's a good vannevar Bush on the show for his opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just remember this notion of the best  and the brightest, the bureaucrats who ended up  getting us into a lot of trouble in the 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Remind you, that was government, by the way.  That was government.  But it was government, but coming from-  Funded by the Rand Corporation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I see is your attitude,  which is this academic attitude of,  well, we've gotta consider all parties.  It doesn't feel right to me, does it?  But maybe I'm coming from a very moralistic point of view  where, oh, no, I am too.  I feel like it's just wrong and there ought to be a law.  And obviously-

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you've got to work off empirical data.  You've got to show what the harm is.  You've got to define the harm.  You've got to define the impact.  Then you've got to design the interventions.  The problem is we're designing interventions like,  every kid should have immediate literacy training  when it's not the kids who are the problem,  it's grandpa who's going to screw up the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So do you think that these two regulations in the EU  are misguided?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Um, I think their roots are in many ways misguided  based on presumptions.  And get ready, Ant, get ready, get ready.  I'm queuing you up here.  In some cases, even moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's stuck, the moral panic is stuck.  Oh, no, do you want more panic video?  It won't move, yes we do.  There we go, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no.  The moral panic sound believing.  Somebody doused the flames.  There it is.  Oh, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, wait a minute.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on there.  Ant, you've been one-upped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've been one-upped.  No, no, no, that's compliments of Mr. Nielsen there.  Somebody got it in the Tricaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ant's got it.  Whoa, let's run that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is very nice with a picture of Jeff Jarvis  floating above the earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I want that on, I want a GIF of that, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is me, Jeff Jarvis on the McLaughlin Group this week.  I have a feeling about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, he's even got your lips moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Awesome, so awesome.  If you're only listening to the audio,  I don't know what to tell you.  So awesome.  Can we tweet that or something so people can see it?  We got to tweet that.  That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's when you used to be,  you were one of the hosts of the McLaughlin Group, right Jeff?  And you'd be, Jeff, Jeff Jarvis, I need your opinion on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wrong, Jarvis, wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, okay, thank you Anthony Nielsen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That stopped everything, yeah.  Incredible.  Good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good work.  My general feeling, and maybe it's a little Pollyanna-ish  of me, is that the EU is attempting to do the right thing.  This is a work in progress.  There is no, you're gonna have unintended consequences,  you're gonna have misfires, but they're doing something.  Coming from the right spirit, which is,  we need to rein in these completely unregulated companies  that are amassing more and more power in our society.  And there needs to be, at least at some point,  somebody saying, well, maybe that's a bridge too far.  And I think that that's appropriate for government to do.  It's not gonna be perfect.  It needs to be refined, it needs to be improved.  But I feel like these two acts are actually a pretty good  step in the right direction, personally.  And I think they're well-founded,  I think they're well-intended.  We'll see.  I like Marguerite Vestaiger.  I know I'm one of the few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Great UK story was the EU reduced roaming fees years ago  across cellular carriers,  which are essentially meaningless.  It was huge.  Someone was complaining recently,  the EU is reimposing roaming fees on the UK.  And it's like, no, you left the EU, you fool.  So you will have roaming fees when you go to the EU  because you, the UK, are no longer part of the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a wonderful thing.  Once you're in the EU, you can have a SIM card  from any EU nation and you pay the same amount.  I think that's a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was garbage, the roaming fees were ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, it impacted every US traveler  in the EU as well.  So I really think that's a perfect example of-  It is a good example.  Of regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I found a positive.  That's a, you know.  Thank you.  One, one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I understand that the method of government,  using government to achieve any of this is fraught  with peril, is-  I wish it were better, Leo.  I wish it were better.  And I wish it weren't so corrupt, I agree.  But I don't know what else we have, to be honest.  And I guess for me, it's the only tool we have.  I mean, people, women now that they know  that period trackers are selling their data,  they don't know specifically which one,  but they know that because of good journalism  on the part of, I don't know who it was,  The Verge or ProPublica, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I just fear the idea of an overcorrection  from our government.  You know what I mean?  They're wanting to step in to try to make things right  for us, these citizens, but I think at some point  they may go too far and really start to hurt.  That's of course a risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's of course a risk.  And the founders were very afraid of government,  and rightly so.  The other choice though is to let big tech self-regulate.  And I think we don't even have to guess if that's a risk.  Right?  We know what they're going to do  if they're allowed to do whatever they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or the other thing is they're having regulation  in each state too, right?  The fact that companies have to comply  to California regulations, which are quite,  some of the best in the country now,  or some of the tightest about privacy and retain-  Yeah, but that means that if my state, Washington,  were to pass some very restrictive rules,  some companies, maybe our market's not big enough.  Maybe they'd exit.  But as with emissions, climate, sorry,  emission controls in California,  which was allowed to and may still be allowed  to set its own standards,  it's a big enough economy  that it could have a ripple effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We drove the auto industry.  Yeah, exactly.  And the EU is doing that too  with carbon emissions and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So California gets the lead in that regard too,  and some of the states have been ahead on it,  but then there's this patchwork, it's the usual argument.  There's a patchwork of legislation  that makes it hard for small businesses,  and big businesses don't care.  Either they pay the fees or they ignore it,  or they comply, but sometimes they comply  and it changes their policies country-wide or worldwide.  And it's always unintended consequences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the nature of law.  I think, Jeff, if I rephrased this argument,  to say instead of big tech,  if I said big oil or big tobacco,  I don't think we would have,  you wouldn't say, well, let market forces determine.  I'm not saying market forces should determine at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What I'm saying is what Doer said in the Rand paper  was actually the opposite.  He said that what regulation does  is it tries to forestall unintended consequences.  What we should do is get to the unintended consequences  as quickly as possible.  He was saying the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so let's everybody,  let's make cigarettes completely legal.  Let's eliminate emissions.  I'm not a libertarian, I'm not gonna say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's eliminate emissions controls.  I am gonna say, we didn't know what cigarettes were  for years and years and years, and they were legal,  until we got the science that said,  oh, this crap's killing people,  and then finally we did something about it.  But big tobacco hit it for years.  And we're making presumptions about the internet  being cigarettes, which is wrong,  and is dangerous to the freedoms that it brings to people  who were too long not included  in the institutions of society.  That's my argument.  It is an effort to control this change in society.  If you look at the attempts at the laws  in Texas and Florida, it's trying to say,  we wanna control these voices we didn't hear before  very conveniently, now we're hearing them.  We don't like them.  Five years ago, that might have made sense, Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but these now, big tech is so big,  that it's got to the point now,  well, for instance, Glenn asked a great question,  why aren't there other search engines?  Because the incumbents are so dominant and so big,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  there can't be.  So my response was, that's fighting yesterday's battle.  I think Facebook is the next MySpace.  I think Facebook, which was gonna take over the world,  it would ruin all society.  When you made that argument five years ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook was the answer.  Oh, no, no, because social search is the next big search.  That didn't happen, I might point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, no, it did to the extent of Black Lives Matter  and Me Too.  It wasn't what was planned for by Twitter or Facebook,  but people used the platforms  because they finally had the mechanism to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But not as a, again, you're going to speech,  we're talking about search.  Not as a, so I think by the time we realize  how much power big tech has in our lives,  it will be too late to regulate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I tell you, when Microsoft has this browser everywhere,  God knows what power they're gonna have.  It's just gonna be, we have to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you can make a strong argument  that the DOJ's lawsuit, again,  Microsoft's in the late 90s,  did in fact have a very salutatory effect.  Oh, no, it was the EU that killed Microsoft.  No, that was the browser ballot,  but it was the DOJ suing Microsoft about bundling  and the consent decree that Microsoft  agreed to and Microsoft backing down  on its embrace and engulf and devour business strategies  that allowed Google to thrive,  that allowed the internet to grow.  So I think there's a, and you could look at it  at the AT&T break-up.  Which is the market coming.  You can look at, I mean,  there are plenty of good examples of this  and of regulation really working and improving things.  And I just worry that we're rapidly approaching a time  when Google is so powerful  that no regulation can reign it in.  We may already be there, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know what I think?  I think that we're gonna find that the ad market,  so Google is already losing ad share.  It and Facebook are no longer half of the digital ad market.  Who are they losing it to?  Players like Amazon.  A bigger fish.  Oh, who else?  Well, no, and then other companies, I'm forgetting.  This was on the rundown last week.  It's in there.  It's in my things from last week.  If you were just here, Leo,  not gallivanting off around the world  in places that we couldn't figure out where you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, I was wondering that because the big battle right now,  like Google and Facebook cry about  Apple's, sorry, Google and Facebook have been crying  about Apple's changes to advertising,  to how it, third-party tracking and so forth.  Yeah, the tracking.  And all its lockdowns.  And I'm not gonna cry on Facebook's behalf  because they can't target me well enough.  I mean, I don't use Facebook now,  but they can't target people well enough  so they can't charge as much to their advertisers.  And I feel like there's a coming battle is,  if we watch market evolution, maybe the government is,  government often, to your point, Jeff,  the government gets involved late  and it takes a lot of time,  and they often maybe produce the wrong solution  for the point we're at.  So there's arguments that Microsoft,  the antitrust lawsuit dragged on so long  and was reduced enough in scope  that by the time it had happened,  maybe the sheer nature of the suit caused change  and caused market, like just the government suing  gave the position for competitors.  I remember how real networks came out of that.  And not that it thrived necessarily,  but they had this huge payout eventually from Microsoft.  They were able to promote this alternate media player,  which broke the hegemony of Microsoft's media players.  And it changed the whole market,  even before any settlement had happened,  even before Microsoft agreed.  So governments often come in late in the process,  but initiating action can cause some change.  And I think right now we have a battle between Apple,  which as a marketing stance,  I mean, I think it's legitimately technologically implemented,  but as a marketing stance is all in on privacy.  And you have Google, not negative on privacy,  but it's not their paramount concern.  Their big revenue is advertising.  They have to balance that.  And you have Facebook, which I don't think really cares  much about privacy, except is chin music.  And so their whole goal is to continue  to achieve these massive profits they've had in the past.  And I think that that's gonna be the fight is over  how these companies use that marketing message  and whether they're successful enough.  And when Google, for instance, implements the version  that it intends to do eventually,  of essentially blocking the same kind of tracking  that Apple's already put in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do remember though saying many, many years ago,  watch out when Apple is as big as Microsoft,  they'll be just as rapacious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that that has proven to be the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's a different way though.  It's funny because Apple is so insular.  Microsoft wanted to, Microsoft like ate  and beat down the landscaped around it.  They would buy all the competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They used to do what Facebook does today, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they would go to every neighboring principality  and say, you have a really nice place here.  You want us to raise your castles  and sow salt into your fields.  You probably don't want that.  And Apple doesn't necessarily do that.  Apple says, we've raised our ramparts so high,  no one shall ever enter, which is a very different model.  I'm not saying it's necessarily less rapacious.  It doesn't seem to it when you're inside the castle  and you say, those are really nice tall walls.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't get to be a two trillion,  almost $3 trillion company without a little rapaciousness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So to answer your question,  Metta and Google are losing market share to TikTok.  Apple, Walmart, and Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not an improvement.  Walmart.  If you ask me, but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well yeah, the other thing that's going on  is that it's an advertising changes.  So we've talked about this in the show in the past.  Best Buy's selling floor is now a marketing entity.  Instacart is an advertising platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, I'm a little surprised  that Google and Facebook are failing  because it feels to me they have such a dominant position  just because of what they.  Or are they not growing as fast or are they actually shrinking?  Oh no, they're losing share.  They're losing share.  They're losing share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And the ad market is still going up,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I believe that the advertising market.  So there are more pieces,  but Facebook and Google are not getting smaller.  That's going to turn around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I sat in a dinner before the pandemic,  the last time I sat in a dinner ever,  with a bunch of advertisers.  And once the very good wine was passed out,  this was put on by a PR company,  they said that, do they care about newspapers?  They admitted, no, we don't care.  We build our own relationships now.  The only thing we care about newspapers for  is our stock price.  The rest of them, we just don't care about media.  Right.  When you say there are more pieces in the pie,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  are you saying there's just more options?  It's just the ad market is growing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a much bigger pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The economy is growing, thus the ad market is growing.  So there's more to share,  but they're getting a smaller share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it makes sense.  Leo's saying the pie has been built higher,  if I remember the quote correctly.  It's a pie.  It's a pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I want that pie.  It's a pie.  It's a pie.  It's a pie.  What's the Turducken equivalent of a cake and pie?  Oh, there is such a thing.  Oh, you do a baked Alaska.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a baked Alaska with a cake on the outside,  I think too, right?  You can do what they call a frozen Florida.  I think it was in Scientific American had this recipe,  they use liquid nitrogen to have a hot cake  inside an ice cream shell.  So just do two of those, baked Alaska, frozen Florida.  Good, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Since we're off topic anyway, Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a lot of 33s.  No, no, stop.  Just stop, okay?  Just stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  33 is a nice little moment  from your earlier British discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to show you the pie cakin'.  Oh, you found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you found it.  Oh, it is the pie cakin'.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is a pie inside a cake.  Oh my.  You don't have to choose.  Oh, Aunt is making this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's that show?  Oh my goodness.  Look at that, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's three pies inside that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that truly, I don't know if that counts.  That's like three layers with the fondant.  It's kind of disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fondant holds it together, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know, or maybe just not even fondant, but.  Something, bro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plastic.  This with some vanilla ice cream.  That's a cherry pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like a.  I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know, you could do a pride cake like that,  but I feel like it separates the layers too much.  Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pie cakin' is the answer to dirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Knead.  Try frozen Florida first, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like, whatever frozen Florida is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Liquid nitrogen, you make a hot cake  and then you use liquid nitrogen  to make the ice cream on the outside, boom.  That's amazing.  And is the cake still hot inside or no?  Yeah, the cake is hot inside  and you have ice cream on the outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so it is very much like a baked Alaska then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's inverted.  Yeah.  With science.  Oh.  I think it's Scientific American, right?  Yeah.  It's a.  This is kitchen counter culture, but.  Most food is science.  Most food is scientific.  Food is science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As the great Harold, what's his name?  Mitchell would tell ya.  All right, I wanna take a break and talk about our sponsor  because we have a wonderful sponsor.  I know you know the name of this sponsor, Glenn,  because you probably have some of their stuff.  I have stuff from Nomad all over my house.  They started as a Kickstarter project about 10 years ago.  They were gonna build ultra rugged minimalist tools  for the 21st century that would seamlessly integrate  into your everyday carry.  In the past nine years, they have expanded.  They do cases, they do Apple watch straps,  they do wireless chargers.  They have some great wireless chargers.  I'd show you the one that does the watch and the phone,  the MagSafe charger, but Lisa stole it.  It's at home on her bedside table.  It's so good.  They make premium wallets.  They make passport holders.  And all their stuff is crafted with, if it's leather,  with Horween leather, which is the best leather  from the Horween tannery in Chicago,  which has been around since 1905.  And anybody who loves leather knows when you say Horween,  that's chef's kiss.  An unparalleled blend of quality and consistency.  What's nice, this is a brand new case on my iPhone,  but this Horween leather case will age over time.  I should show you my old case.  It develops this nice patina.  Leather ages so beautifully.  And it's unique because only, you know,  now that only you have this particular case,  and of course, because it's great Horween leather,  it smells fantastic.  The wireless charging solutions for home, office,  and bedroom.  AirPods, as well as Apple Watch, as well as iPhone.  This is the base one with MagSafe.  It's great.  It's so heavy.  It's right there on the table.  It's not going anywhere.  You put the phone on that and it just, boom.  You know, you could, I don't know, I probably can.  Let me see, yeah.  You could turn the phone upside down.  The charger upside down, the magnet's so strong.  That's awesome.  They now have GAN AC adapters.  We love these gallium nitride technologies  that give you very powerful 30 and 60 watt,  or 65 watt adapters in a very small place.  One of the things I love about Nomad is the,  believe it or not, pay attention to the charging cables  when you get them.  You'll see the crew at Nomad was just done  with crap charging cables that fall apart every few months.  They decided we're going to engineer the best cables around.  Double braided Kevlar outer sheath,  strong metal alloy connector housings.  These have been engineered for extreme durability  and everyday use.  They're also a climate neutral certified brand.  Let me show you.  I haven't put on my watch because I want to keep it  for the ads, but as soon as the ads are over,  I'm going to take the steel band out.  This is a beautiful Nomad steel band for your Apple watch.  Just gorgeous.  Easily remove the links to get it sized exactly right.  It's a bracelet that has a very strong connector.  It's not going to go anywhere.  That is gorgeous.  I'm a Nomad fanatic.  Nomad is and always will be a company that prioritizes  design and quality over everything else.  One of the most important aspects of Nomad,  when designing new products is they use the highest quality,  longest lasting materials available.  I love it when you get something like a case, a charger,  a watch band, you can feel the quality.  You know it's going to last.  You know it's made with the best materials.  It's just the quality is right through it.  They design all their concepts from the ground up.  They're not white labeling existing products.  There's the charger, the base one Max at least it took.  I said she could have it.  She needed a good charger.  My watch keeps falling off the Apple charger  and the phone keeps slipping off the Apple charger.  I said, honey, this is the answer.  The base one Max charges both  and it's really a nice connection.  10 years they've been doing this.  They're having a 10th anniversary sale.  They launched with that simple cable  on Kickstarter 10 years ago.  They have grown and they are doing such great work.

Transcript:  Are we, out of curiosity,  Web3's going great, right?  What's Web3?  Just checking.  Yeah, what is it?  It's not good.  That's not good, it's going.  Yeah, it's going really, really good.  I like to go to the website just once in a while  and see what Molly has to say about the latest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh my God, did you read the New York Times  had a fantastic op-ed, or what do they call it now,  an essay, sorry, it's an essay.  Oh, excuse me.  It's not an op-ed anymore.  It's the essay section.  And they had a great piece by a crypto, pro-crypto person  just going like, every currency's had its trouble,  we've had a tulip panic, it was like the most,  the things you tell yourself at 3 a.m.  when you realize your bank account is empty  and you owe people a lot of money  and they're about to knock on the door  and you're trying to get out the back with a suitcase.  This is what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It happens to Caesar and those coins he had, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, look, this is the only thing in history  that's had no value attached,  that has had no purpose whatsoever,  and so it's going to have its ups and downs.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just put more money in.  So did tulip bulbs, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look, you know, tulip bulbs, you read Michael,  or what's his name, there's a book about the history  of tulips and potatoes and so forth.  I'm blanking out the guy who wrote this book.  He wrote a whole bunch of interesting books.  It'll come to me.  But the tulip mania, those bulbs were actually  worth a lot of money because the broken disease  that caused the variegation in tulips  produced flowers that were extremely valuable.  And there was actually inherent value.  I think tulip mania has been overstated for centuries.  I mean, it was a mania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unlike Bitcoin, there was real value in the tulip bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People were willing, so do you remember the difference  between the pets.com crash and a later crash?  Pets.com was shipping 40 pounds of kitty litter  for less than it cost them to ship  and less than it cost them to buy it, right?  I mean, pets.com and some of those early companies,  they had no actual revenue to match the outflow.  It was all venture capital funded.  So when the next sort of bump hit, like 2008,  you didn't have the same failure occur among .coms.  And in fact, they drew strength from it  because they had real revenue.  People are like, oh, it's just the same pattern again.  It's like, no, it isn't.  So then I think when we saw the pandemic hit  and you saw this incredible surge in value  in online companies, like Zoom or like Amazon or like Apple,  it was based on that strength  that they were not the vaporware that we're used to.  And say 2001, we've evolved to a time of action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And ironically, we now get our kitty litter delivered by mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  So here's my little-  Bill Gross was right just early.  He just was too early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mike, think gross.  It's my little resistance against Amazon  as I order things that I think cost them more to ship me  than it's worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all right, they'll make it up in volume.  It's fine.  They got a model.  They got a model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We actually literally-  Bill Gross, who started that company,  our friend at Idealab,  did a study once of what makes a company,  what's the factor that's gonna make a company  most successful, leadership and so on and so forth.  And he said it was timing.  It was absolutely timing.  I think it's absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's absolutely right.  If I were to launch Twit today,  we would have a-  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You'd be bought by Spotify.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Michael Pollan is the author.  I wanna make sure to give him credit.  Michael Pollan, oh, Michael Pollan.  Wonderful author and he's written a lot more  about food lately,  but if you wanna understand what Johnny Appleseed,  for instance, was really doing,  not what we were taught in school,  you gotta read one of his books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He almost said Michael Pollan and I thought,  well, I don't know.  Did he write about the history of tulip bulbs?  But I guess he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's in one of his books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, really great.  I love Michael Pollan.  We quoted him the other day, actually.  Oh, that's fine.  I think yesterday we were talking about it.  So, not much to say except that  all the crypto exchanges are failing,  flailing, going down.  I've got a question for you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  Why, if they were exchanges with a whole bunch of money  in their, air quotes, bank,  why were they all borrowing money and-  Well, they wanted to make more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's, they leveraged.  So, for instance, Uprise, which is a cryptocurrency  investment fund, lost 99% of its customer funds  when they tried to short Luna during its collapse in May.  Whoops.  Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy.  A crypto broker suspended withdrawals a week prior,  says it's filed for bankruptcy due to the, quote,  prolonged volatility and contagion in the crypto markets.  They also had invested in Three Arrows Capital,  which was another bankrupt crypto fund  that defaulted on a loan from Voyager worth $660 million.  You see the dominoes falling.  The problem is, many of these cases,  if you've got a custodial wallet with these exchanges,  you may be a creditor.  You may not, it's not like a bank.  Ain't no FDIC here.  You may be out.  And so, it's just dominoes, I think, falling.  CoinLoan, crypto lending platform,  reduces account withdrawal limit.  That's like, you remember, you know, Jimmy Stewart?  He went to the bank and he tried to get his money out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Couldn't get his money.  Your NFT isn't in Leo's house, it's in Ed's house.  It's in Jeff's house.  When I went there, there's no NFT there, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only can withdraw $5,000 a day,  down from the half million dollar a day limit.  But they tried to reassure customers,  rest assured, your assets are safe.  Crypto lender, vault, suspends withdrawals,  considers restructuring.  I can go on and on and on.  That's only this past week.  It's really a bloodbath.  It's scary.  It's a bloodbath.  And then there's the hacking.  So many NFTs have been hacked.  You know, I should, I've been getting emails from people  about board apes.  There is a video going around on the YouTube,  claiming, using, by the way, documentary techniques  pioneered by Steve Bannon, or maybe by Walt Gabbles  before that, I don't know,  but showing how board ape is actually racist.  And actually, as I look at the sketches of board ape,  they are kind of racist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, and my 15 year old comes to me the other day and says,  board ape, this is the conversation  that we have in my household,  board ape is based on Nazi iconography.  That's right.  I'm not paraphrasing.  That's pretty much my 15 year old.  And I said, oh, come on.  Now I know it's terrible.  I hate it.  It's a bunch of, it's scams.  It's whatever.  And they're like, no, no, I watched the video.  I'm like, all right, what's the source?  I have not watched this yet,  but they showed me a link from it  that shows an almost exact trace over  of a piece of Nazi iconography  that I was unaware of with a skull.  Here it is.  And the board, yeah.  Oh, wow.  So this is the Waffen SS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the death skull of the SS.  I need to watch the whole thing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but you're like, there's some things,  there's coincidence and there's people trying to force  square pegs into round holes.  And then there's things where like,  oh, if they didn't do that intentionally,  then why is it such a perfect match?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a perfect match.  There are the same number of teeth.  That number resolves to Adolf Hitler's birthday.  Yeah.  There is a lot of iconography.  Maybe it's a coincidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I never thought getting on the internet  in the 80s or whatever it was called,  Viet Nam maybe then, right?  I never thought it would wind up being so many Nazis.  I thought we don't get to beat those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what I'm thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of Nazis anyway,  and they just, they're showing up.  They're permissioned now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think we're at the point where  anything up to saying what the Nazis said  and what the KKK says is now free game.  And the idea is to be as offensive as possible.  And how do you fight that?  When that's the goal, you can't use norms.  You can't say, oh, shame on you for saying that.  Ha ha ha, lib farts, don't you cancel me.  That's what we are now.  And we don't have a strategy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lib farts, don't cancel me.  It should be a bumper sticker, Jeff.  I think so.  In quotation marks because we're being ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have a strong opinion one way or the other.  If you watch the video, it's fairly convincing,  but it's also, it's done in such a almost hypnotic  over the top propaganda style.  It's a bureaucracy way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's just say.  We're talking about it being racist.  Is that what you're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they make the case that it's racist.  You know what, Ant, you should probably watch it  because it just sounds like you're skeptical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I gotta watch the thing.  I'm of the mind.  I know that racism is this, but I'm also of the mind  that good gosh, if you look for racism,  you can find it.  Hard enough, you'll find it.  Yeah.  So I'm not always just out there looking for it.  Well, I'm worried.  As far as I'm concerned, this black microphone  that I'm staring at right now could be racist.  Yeah, right, exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I watch the video and there's a lot of coincidences,  let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, but you can find coincidences.  Exactly.  I'm waiting until I watch it.  Is it really worth watching?  I need to take a look.  Watch a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My 15 year old recommends it and they're pretty smart.  They're savvy.  It's interesting raising teenagers who are as savvy  as you pretend to be, I would say as I pretend to be,  because we have these wild conversations about  what's reliable, Jeff, this is so in your wheelhouse too,  it's like what's reliable information?  How do you figure out things that are authoritative?  They're like, well, I saw it in a video.  I'm like, well, you know as well as I do  that YouTube is full of unreliable things.  They're like, yes, so what I did is,  and then they describe a methodology  by which they feel they cross-checked it,  but are all the sources using a cross-check it good?  I don't know.  So we have very interesting media  and credibility conversations  because my children are raised this.  Alex Nadez is with his kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's the same way.  They basically saying, hey, check your sources.  Don't play the first thing you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the Waffen SS Totenkopf Death Head logo.  It's very, it's very similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the yacht club one, but still, I don't know.  I don't know.  I showed the Nazi one first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the Nazi one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the, I don't know.  That's one of the, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's just say this.  It's all so effing stupid.  Well, and-  Well, that's the biggest-  And people have spent fortunes on this crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  The hashtag is burn B-A-Y-C, board Ape Yacht Club,  and the video, which now has 1.3 million views,  it went up about two weeks ago by Philean, F-P-H-I-L-I-O-N.  And I don't know.  I really don't know either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll tell you, I think I may have mentioned this  on a previous episode.  Ryan Broderick does this newsletter called Garbage Day  that I highly recommend because for somebody my age  in their 50s who pretends to know something,  I don't really understand what the kids are doing at all.  Or I don't fully understand it  because I'm not engaged in TikTok  and influencer culture and all that.  And so to understand the fulminate of what's happening,  Ryan is like a concierge.  He's like a bridge between us older people  and the younger people because he's part of the culture,  but he stands back.  And so I always recommend Garbage Day.  I read it every day.  One of the only things I read every day  because it helps me make some sense  out of what looks like absolute chaos.  Like it's morgan time or the gentle minions.  Like why did minions do so well?  Well, of course teenagers were dressing in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And why are they showing up in suits at the, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I feel like an old man.  I'm like, get off my internet lawn.  But so I read this newsletter.  But we have an obligation to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here, maybe this is a better side by side  of those, of the, this is the Panzer Korps  from the SS next to it.  18 teeth, very, very similar.  Coincidence, I guess it could be.  Well, are there Nazis all around us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes.  I mean, I just put another story up.  There is some, Georgia has kind of the Georgia Stonehenge.  It's these tall.  Oh, that's a weird thing.  They got bombed because the religious right  thinks that they're satanic.  It's their arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a weird set of statements on it though.  It is kind of like, you don't have to,  you know what it reads like though?  It reads like a far right wing person's idea  of what a far left person would put out  as guiding principles.  So it reads like a parody,  but it's kind of slightly terrifying.  Not like it should be bombed or blown up  or graffitied as it has in the past.  It was put up legitimately as I understand it.  But it's still, the statements are like,  from some kind of Nike party sci-fi.  This is what we're arguing about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is this kind of crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The world is so full of so many things.  It's weird, isn't it?  I'm sure we should all be as rich as his kings

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Meanwhile, if you want a little moment of fun,  just a quick moment, line 33.  Just a little moment of fun.  Now, if you want lines, I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You hate it when I do this.  I have to go back.  I have to go back to the lines.  Hold on, slow me down.  We're all gonna get onto.  Line 33, great little BBC moment on the Twitters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and he has his feet up and he's on his phone.  Oh, no, I gotta tell you something.  Thank God it was his feet up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I gotta tell you something.  There's no way the director didn't know  he was going to that shot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, somebody was selling scores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little score settling going on there.  Oh, I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I thought you'd like it because a TV guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  At least it wasn't a tubing moment.  That's the important part.  What's a tubing moment?  Oh, thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, oh that.  Nevermind, nevermind.  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I blanked it out, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry, we should have.  I apologize. Good for you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And speaking of the Twitter, we have now put,  for those of you listening,  the Jeff Jarvis moral panic video is now  at Twitter so you can go right there and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Even beats light strokes wrecked to a reggae beat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it that they clutch-cargoed your lips.  That's his style.  Oh, yeah, no, it's amazing.  That's really amazing.  Well, whose voice is it?  Oh, Mr. Nielsen.  Do we know?  Wait a minute, let me, it's your voice.  This is not mine.  No, it's not.  That's his voice.  No, listen.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got a bad feeling about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, maybe you're, is that Harrison Ford?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Harrison Ford from Star Wars.  Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, Star Wars.  Yeah, I got a bad feeling about this, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe.  You'd like Harrison Ford to play you  in the movie of yourself, right?  Oh, yeah. Absolutely.  Well, not today's Harrison Ford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Harrison Ford of 20 years ago.  He's a little crusty now.  Actually, maybe that's why he'd be playing me, yeah.  He's crashed a lot of planes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scientific American asked the artificial intelligence  GPT-3 to write an academic paper about itself  and then trying to get it published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think they were trying to be smart-ass about it  and do it sneakily.  They were trying to say, let's actually publish this  and issues got raised.  What's the byline?  Who's the author?  Yeah, who's the author?  How do you attribute things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the same problem with Microsoft's copilot,  their GitHub copilot.  Who's the author of the code you're stealing, right?  Who is the author of an artificial intelligence generated?  Because the algorithm is pulling, with copilot anyways,  pulling actual human-written code snippets.  GPT-3 is trained on actual human writing.  It makes a mockery of copyright

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  because the samplers in hip-hop  who use stuff from all around,  all GPT-3 is, is textual hip-hop.  It's sampling.  It's pulling from all over.  It's sampling.  Yeah, it's sampling.  And it's predictive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At least in the hip-hop world,  those guys and gals tend to go  and get a license agreement from the people they're sampling  because they've all been sued so many times.  It's sort of standard code-card.  They did it at first, is what you're saying.  It was after the...  They're pretty good.  Pretty woman-paced, right?  In the 80s, yeah, it's a different story.  In the 80s, yeah, it's different.  But 1990s, yeah, they had all learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They sampled Roy Orbison, is that what they did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's it, the Oh Pretty Woman case.  Yeah.  That was amazing.  Oh, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happened to the Supreme Court?  It went to the Supreme Court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it was a very key decision.  It was actually really important for remix culture,  but I think it paved the way, as Ant's saying,  for licensing.  It opened up opportunities because there was a framework  as opposed to being ambiguous.

Transcript:  Luther Campbell, aka Luke Skywalker,  versus Acuff Rose Publishing.  Justice Souter, in 1994, delivered the opinion of the court.  Luther R. Campbell, Christopher Wong-Wong,  Mark Ross, and David Hobbs, collectively known  as Two Live Crew, sampled Pretty Woman.  Acuff Rose's agent refused permission,  stating, I am aware of the success enjoyed by the, quote,  Two Live Crews, but I must inform you,  we cannot permit the use of a parody  of Oh Pretty Woman.  Two Live Crew released records, cassette tapes,  can compact discs of Pretty Woman  in a collection of songs called As Clean As They Wanna Be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Man, dude, they were all over the news back then.  That's funny.  They were all over the news.  That album, their non-clean album,  and then there was the parental discretion stickers  that were put on.  It was pretty much them that had all of that stuff  put into place back then.  So, parental advisory, I should say, not discretion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Supreme Court found that it was fair use  through parody and allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right, that's right.  Because that was that, fair use,  this is something I'm sure Jeff has volumes to say  about this, but one of the fundamental flaws.  I have volumes to say about anything.  Well, I don't wanna put you on the spot.  The fundamental flaw with fair use is it's a doctrine  as opposed to something that you can just figure out.  So, there've been talks about the copyright,  the US Patent and Copyright Office,  or a trademark, no, sorry, the US Copyright Office, rather,  setting up an expedited fair use trial court  so you'd be able to go and say, here's what I wanna do,  and would this be fair use?  There's a lot of restrictions around it,  but without it, you're open to massive copyright liabilities  or your case goes all the way to the Supreme Court,  as in that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The great Harvard lawyer, Larry Lessig,  says that fair use is the right to hire a lawyer.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow, man, this'll date me, but Suzanne Vega had this issue  with Fatboy Slim, very, very early in Fatboy Slim's career.  Tom's Diner remix, and I think that she actually,  in the end, settled my recollection.  She was okay with it  because she made a ton of money out of it.  It was pretty great, it was a great remix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had Suzanne Vega come in and sing  the original a cappella version on the screensavers,  because it was used, it has a tech angle,  it was used by the Fraunhofer Corporation  for improving the algorithm of MP3 compression  with human voice.  Oh, wow.  So we had Suzanne in, we talked to her,  and we had her sing the song,  and I sat five feet away from her  as she was singing Tom's Diner,  one of the best songs of all time,  although Fatboy Slim's remix is the big hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's clever, yeah, he's over 30 years later,  and he's still doing his thing too.  She's still out touring, recording albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely, she's still performing, she's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, touring again just now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The Scientific American had to ask the computer  whether it was okay to cite the computer as the author.  And what did the computer say?  And then had to ask, the computer said yes.  Then they had to ask the computer  whether it had any conflicts of interest,  because you have to do that.  It said no.  And it's all, there is obviously a joke here  is that they're treating it as a sentient being  after the whole Lambda idiocy,  but I'm having such fun thinking about  what all you can do with this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You actually asked GPT-3 to write an op-ed.  I did, I'm not sure what.  About your favorite topic.  Uh-huh, get ready.  Moral panic.  Dark mode, not dark mode, moral panic.  Dark mode.  Although you might have had more success.  I might have.  Yeah, so should I read what GPT-3 wrote?  Is it worth reading?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I asked it to write three things.  I asked it to write an op-ed about moral panic.  Then I asked it to write a short story  with a hero about moral panic.  And then I asked it to write a blurb  for my book about moral panic.  So I put it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of the thread.  I wouldn't call any of these an example of sentience.  No, no.  The internet is often blamed for the ills of society.  But is it really to blame?  Moral panic over the internet is nothing new.  In the early days of the internet,  people were concerned, quote,  that children would be exposed to pornography and violence.  It never ends that quote, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That sounds just like Mr. Jarvis.  Yeah, okay, that's the, that's the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's, hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's in the thread.  Here's the short story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The GPT-3, a story about a hero who defends the internet  against claims moral panic is destroying society.  Harrison Ford, amazingly enough, is playing the hero.  Shall I do this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes.  When society began to crumble,  the internet was there to pick up the pieces.  It was a safe haven for those who were lost.  And it was a place where people could connect with others  who were going through the same thing.  The internet was on lifeline for many people.  And it was the only thing that kept them going.  However, there were some who saw the internet as a threat.  They believed it was destroying society.  It was full of pornography and violence.  They tried to get the government to shut down the internet,  but they were unsuccessful.  There was one man, oh Lord,  one tall white haired man who saw the internet  as a force for good.  He was a hero and he fought for the rights of the people  who used the internet.  He defended the internet against the claims of moral panic.  And he showed the world that it was a valuable resource  thanks to him.  The internet is still around today.  And it is still helping people to connect with each other.  That's actually pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got an arc.  It's got a protagonist and an antagonist.  And that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can rewrite into a voiceover,  in a world where one man,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  society, pornography and violence,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the government tried to shut down the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So then I asked it to do a blurb for a book  about moral panic by me,  because I am actually working on a book proposal.  And it was kind of bland.  So then I said, can you be more enthusiastic?  And it was.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's nice to have a little plastic pal.  You can scroll up, keep you friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blur romantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  I sent my first book years ago to an author  I won't name to humiliate right now,  because he did me a favor to blurb it.  And I got back to blurb within 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's because he didn't want to read the book.  And he just thought, I'll just get him off.  So here's the more enthusiastic.  This book is a must read for anyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who wants to understand the internet.  Jeff Jarvis provides a clear and concise defense  of the internet against claims of moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Good job.  It's a little bit like a ninth grader,  but okay, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  This stuff is such fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's...  It's never feels like a machine didn't write it though,  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Of course, of course.  Yeah, and it is all it does is predict the next word  that would work best and work best means  it would satisfy us.  That's all it's doing.  And people are noticing as they're using this  that it gives back wrong answers all the time  because it's not tied to facts.  Right.  It's tied to the corpus of what we've talked about  on the net.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take a little break.  We'll come back and search through time  with Google celebrating 25 years of search history.  Our show today brought to you by My 8 Sleep.  Oh, My 8 Sleep pod pro cover.  Love it.  Good sleep.  It's the holy grail, right?  As you get older, not much matters  if you can't get a good night's sleep.  It's the ultimate game changer, nature's gentle nurse.  And the 8 Sleep pod is the ultimate sleep machine.  How imagine a bed that can get hotter or colder  depending on the room temperature, your sleep stage,  your preferences.  It's amazing.  Temperature is one of the main causes of poor sleep,  it turns out.  The 8 Sleep pod cover is designed to make your bed  the most comfortable, wonderful place you've ever visited.  We got ours, oh my gosh, we got it in the winter.  So at least six months ago.  And at that time I was having it heat up,  was getting it warmer, although it's interesting  and I think this is biological.  When you go to bed, of course, you put out the fire  in your log cabin and the house is toasty,  you get in bed, it's toasty warm.  But then as the night passes, it cools off.  And it turns out that mirrors exactly your sleep cycles  into a deep sleep and then into the REM mode.  And then the Sleep pod starts to warm up again  and bring you, in fact, I have it set to wake me up,  not an alarm, but to wake me up by raising the temperature  slowly, gradually and slightly on the bed.  So I go naturally, I wake up in the morning.  The pod pro cover can go all the way down  to 55 degrees Fahrenheit, all the way up to 110 degrees  Fahrenheit or anywhere in between.  Plus, the Sleep Doctor monitors your sleep stages  and will, with your permission, modify it  to fit your room temperature.  For instance, now that we're in the summer,  it's made a little bit cooler.  And so I sleep now nice and cool.  I think it's amazing.  A clinical data shows that eight sleep users  experience up to 19% increase in recovery,  a 32% improvement in sleep quality,  and 34% more deep sleep.  And honestly, if I could just have one thing,  it'd be more deep sleep.  That cleansing sleep cleans out your brain,  gets you ready for the next day.  There's a lot of evidence that shows good sleep,  consistent good sleep, reduces the risk of heart disease,  lowers your blood pressure,  can even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.  When you've got eight sleep powering your nightly sleep,  you could show up as the best partner,  parent version of yourself, because you slept great.  I love it that it knows what temperature the room is.  It knows where I am in my sleep cycles  and automatically adjusts.  It's also so nice, so nice when you get in that toasty bed  and it cools off.  You never wake up sweaty hot.  You never wake up freezing cold.  It's really cool.  Go to eightsleep.com slash twig  for exclusive 4th of July savings through July 10th.  So you're gonna wanna wait.  Go right now, cool down this summer.

Very happy with my eightsleep.  So was Lisa, by the way.  Oh, and I should mention, each side of the bed  has different settings.  She, for some reason, she likes it really warm,  and now she likes it really cold.  Her tastes have been changing.  So her side is one side.  Sometimes I'll reach over and go, it's hot.  What's going on?  She says, I like it.  It makes me feel good.  So you get it the way you want it.  Thank you, eightsleep, for your support.  Back we go with the show.  This is Google's 25th anniversary.  Did you put this in, Jeff?  Can you explain it to us?  Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just saw it right before the show.  They promoted it, and I guess it's their little  birthday tribute to themselves.  So if you go to that page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They launched in 1997.  No, really?  They say Google searches, I know,  isn't that hard to believe now?  I know.  Has continued to evolve.  Is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Huh?  I guess, okay.  I remember getting, I was running an internet company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Ant was still playing high school ball then, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  I was running an internet company at that time,  and this referrer URL came in called Backrub.  Kept showing up.  Oh yeah, Backrub.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hammering on my systems, and I wrote them,  and he said, I don't know who the heck you people are,  but you need to exercise some more discipline  in how you're hitting my server.  I got a T1 line, it's one and a half megabits per second.  Ooh, T1.  And I got this old Sun workstation.  Yeah, I got this old Sun workstation.  You're beating up, anyway, I thought that was before them,  but I guess officially that was still at Stanford, right?  So PageRank is the official launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here it is.  Show the page if you would, Benito.  Search through time.  There we go.  Scroll to explore.  Okay.  Here we go.  1996 PageRank.  Google.com is registered as a domain.  So it's a little animated timeline.  Oh, it's gonna keep going, yeah.  And Google expands.  And you can hit the play sign,  and you can see the first 10 language versions of Google  are released in 1998.  French, German, oh no, 2000, sorry.  French, German, Italian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish,  Portuguese, Dutch, Norwegian, and Danish.  Today it's 150 languages.  Also in 2000.  All Northern hemisphere languages.  The first international doodle.  Larry and Sergey asked Dennis Huang,  an intern at the time,  to produce a doodle to commemorate Bastille Day.  July 14th.  It is so well received that Dennis has appointed  Google's first chief doodler.  And doodles started appearing regularly  on the Google homepage.  That guy went from intern to billionaire in 0.8 seconds.  Google's index reaches a billion URLs.  That's 22 years ago.  AdWords is in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Everything goes downhill when capitalism comes in.  After that, capitalism, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  2002, the first Zeitgeist,  they've been doing that ever since.  APIs.  Google News launched 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yep, they just had a party for it in New York, kind of.  That's kind of cool, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello.  I've lost my scroll bar.  I have to do it by hand now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shopping came out in 2002.  I'll bet it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo, did Larry and Sergey come on some of your early shows  pre-twit or pre-twit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I interviewed them.  Must have been around 2000 on Tech TV.  I remember being invited to a lunch.  I've told this story, I apologize if you've heard it before.  In South Park in San Francisco,  that's where Twitter was invented on the swing sets there.  There was a little lunch place there.  It was Larry, Sergey, a handful of other people.  They had to tell us about their new thing.  We all got little Brio trains  that spelled out Google in cutout wood.  I wish I had that Google train still.  I don't know where that would have been.  Yeah.  It had just started.  I remember Larry, who was a creator of PageRank,  and I think kind of the scientist in this,  saying something, and Sergey explained to me

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  what Larry had just said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  He said, for us to improve our algorithm,  most interesting thing is the end, when you get to the end.  And I said, end of what, the end of the search?  Yeah, when you get to the bottom.  Larry, I didn't understand what he said,  and Sergey explained it,  and I still don't understand what he was talking about,  but anyway, Sergey tried to explain.  Something about, I guess the gist of it is the outliers  are what tell you how you're doing in search,  not the main big results, but the outliers.  That's all I remember,  and obviously I never learned a thing from that.  Google Books, 2004, Google Local.  More trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm impressed they put Google Books,  I mean, it's great, I have no complaints about it,  but given the years and years of litigation and, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They still offer those books.  They've scanned more than 40 million books.  Yeah.  I live in Happy Trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we would be able to go to more.  Publishers hated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Happy Trust is amazing, yeah.  We are so lucky, we live in a golden age.  I think about how people did,  how you'd have to go to the library,  get our library loans and photocopy things,  type stuff up, that's where it's, I mean.  That would be like 1999.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  One library, Cornell has it, and now you can have it.  One of the first Google Easter eggs,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you asked in 2002,  what is the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything,  it would pop up a calculator with the answer 42.  42 from the great, of course, Douglas Adams.  Where is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hitchhiker's of the galaxy.  Damned tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I lost the tab.  You knew what I was doing.  What happened, where'd I go?  I've been there, done that.  Yeah, 2005 mobile web search on a flip phone,  site maps, which is important for webmasters.  Oh, remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh boy.  Hurricane Katrina.  Google's response to that was kind of,  was a roadmap for future responses to disasters,  to help you find critical information.  Eventually they would put up pages  of survivors and things like that.  The first Doodle for Google contest.  The CSS is funky in this.  You know why?  I'm using Firefox, they're punishing me.  There you go, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Punishing me.  I was thinking, is mine just, just gliding around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're using Chrome probably, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Safari mobile, it's just by my iPad.  It's great, working perfectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  2007, here's 2010 product listing ads,  help in the time of crisis.  That's the person finder, that was the Haiti earthquake.  That was a big deal, right?  Caffeine, the new web indexing system  with 50% fresher results.  Image search launched in 2010.  How many times have we used Google image search, right?  Very important.  2012, the knowledge graph,  graphing calculator built into Google search.  If Apple won't put it on the iPad,  at least you got it in your search engine, right?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where'd that cursor go?  Golly, I have to drag, like a, it's like a animal,  I have to drag it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Use Chrome, you fool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I will not use Chrome.  Oh, Leitzung Zieschrecht.  Zieschrecht, feature snippets,  a format that shows page description or snippet  above the link to the page.  Started in 2014, of course got Google in a lot of trouble.  Still in trouble with publishers who say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're stealing our content.  You stole my soul.  You stole it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  2014, Google My Business, people also ask.  HTTPS, that's when Google began,  it's really strong push successful, by the way,  to make every site HTTPS.  They said, we're gonna rank you higher  if you use secure TCPIP.  Popular Times, I didn't know that had been around since 2015.  Popular Times at Restaurants.  For the first time in 2015, wow, yeah.  More Google searches were completed on mobile devices  than desktop computers, that started in 2015.  That was, that's a landmark, right,  when it shifted to mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember meeting with folks at Google  around that time, they said, we don't care about the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For some reason, in 2016, they launched Fact Check.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where's the entry for when they tried,  with a Chris Sagoyan scenario, is that in there somewhere?  Oh, maybe.  Was it Google or was it Facebook?  I forget who was trying to get the other  to do disinformation about them.  I can't remember which one it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, flood forecasting, neural matching.  We're getting up into the present here.  If I could just drag it to the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, man, I know you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I apologize, that was Facebook trying to get,  that was 2011, Facebook trying to get Google targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're never gonna see this in Facebook, right?  The timeline of Facebook's failures.  Oh, your cursor's there, grab it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You wouldn't be able to use it  because the page would constantly be pivoting.  It would just be swiveling around and around and around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Spinning round and round its axis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there you go, I think that's kind of fun.  The history of Google Search.  What's multi-search? 25 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Multi-search, well, I guess we can-  Multi-search.  Go beyond the search box with multi-search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Funny you should ask, Jeff.  We're always dreaming up new ways  to help you uncover the information you're looking for.  This is something relatively new.  They launched in beta in April,  using text and images at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure.  I'd like to see the,  this is like Google's burial site too,  where there's a Twitter account that does that,  but it's everything that Google killed.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Parallel graphic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes it, they could do a little-  Yeah, killed by Google.  That'd be fun to have a little timeline.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Should remember that, that's an easy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I just wanna make a note.  I was reading the Supreme Court decision  on the Pretty Woman case, and they, in fact,  and I think this must be a first for the Supreme Court,  feature in the appendix of the decision,  both the original Roy Orbison lyrics  and the Two Live Crew lyrics.  Big hairy woman, you need to shave that stuff.  Big hairy woman, you know I bet it's tough.  Big hairy woman, all that hair, it ain't legit.  Because you look like cousin it.  Big hairy woman.  Huh, that's Adam's family reference.  It's like a deep cut.  Bald headed woman, girl, your hair won't grow.  Bald headed woman, you got a teeny weeny afro.  Bald headed woman, you know you're,  do you know this song, anybody?  I don't know this song.  Bald headed woman-  I played a fifth.  You know your hair could look nice.  Bald headed woman, first you gotta roll it with rice.  Bald headed woman here, let me get this hunk of biz for ya.  You know what I'm saying, you look better than Rice-A-Roni,  the San Francisco treat reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so, so bad.  It's so bad.  It's not what you're ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Qualifies as parody, and that's all that matters.  I just love that Justice David Souter had to put that lyric.  Put it on the official record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In his decision on the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hope he read it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty woman walking down the street, pretty woman.  Okay.  It's all in the official record.  It's Johnny Carson, very good.  Rise of the Woebots.  The Guardian asks, why are robots so sad?  So sad.  So sad.  Oh my.  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is that true?  Well, when you have a pagan priest asking you questions,  Lambda was sad.  Yeah.  So I did do one more thing with GPT-3.  I asked it to tell me jokes.  Yeah.  That didn't work so well.  Oh.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's a relief.  At least there's something.  So they're not happy robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not sure they make the case in this article  that they're sad.  They're sad.  Robot, I mean, AI reflects back what we are.  So if we're sad, it's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Marvin, the paranoid android who had that ache and pain  all up and down the diodes of his side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't talk to me about life.  He was really sad.  Marvin was the saddest of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you back to that nerd book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm afraid to tell you this.  I think you might be a nerd also.  Or are you a geek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm fringe on all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here I am, brain the size of a planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they tell me to take you up to the bridge.  All this job satisfaction, because I don't.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pardon me for breathing, which I should never do anyway.  So I don't know why I bother to say it.  Oh, God, I'm so depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The press robot, as Mr. Berks says in a chat.  That's what I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will send you the original BBC radio,  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,  which is the really one and only true version of that.  And Marvin is beautifully brought to life in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are a handful of people kicking around  in the math community who worked on the software company  that made Battleship Titanic, I think.  And some of the games, the text adventure games.  They kick around the Mac world like James Thompson,  who coincidentally makes a...  Did he work for Zork, the Zork folks?  It wasn't Zork, it was a different company in the UK.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I don't forget.  Because Infocom did a Hitchhiker's Guide

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to the Galaxy text adventure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, David or Douglas would come into the office  and everyone kind of knew he's a very nice guy.  So James Thompson in honor, his PCALC software,  which is a software for your Apple TV.  Yeah, he's going on 25 plus years with it.  It has 42, is it in the logo?  Always in the logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As it should be.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hitchhiker's Guide permeates Macintosh culture,  I gotta say.  There is kind of a...  Geek culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at the answer to the question in the Google search.  It is, we all have our...  You know what, earlier today,  actually this is very germane.  What day is towel days in June, I think.  But earlier today, we had a little problem in my studio.  There was a dripping coming out from the ceiling.  I looked up, there was a bulge on the tile  where apparently there was a massive well of water  accumulating.  I screamed like a woman.  I screamed, ah!  And the engineering staff came running,  but you know who really saved the day?  Mr. Jerry Wagle, who had his towel.  Always knows where his towel is.  Knows where his towel is, and there it is,  this EDTV towel mopping up the water in my office.  This came up...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This came up just the other day.  There was a little photo bomb there.  Yes, I saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're trying to put some planting on our front lawn  so that we can be a little screened from the sidewalk,  just a little bit.  And my 15 year old says, well, you don't have to do that.  You should go down and look at the sight line.  I'm like, wait a minute, if I can't see them,  they can't see you.  And of course I think of the bug bladder beast of trawl.  A creature so fundamentally idiotic  that it believed that if you put your towel over your head,  since you couldn't see it, they couldn't see you.  So I didn't accuse them of that,  but I said, refraction, sight lines.  If you've taken physics, if you can't see me,  I can't see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brilliant.  I want to send Ant the...  I have in my drop box, Ant,  and I'm going to share it with you,  the original BBC Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  I've read the books, I've seen the movie,  but this all began when Douglas Adams was writing this  as a BBC radio play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Writing it as it was recorded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Writing it down to the minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love deadlines.  I love the sound of them whooshing past my head.  As he said.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look here, sir.  I'm down to three hours, 19 minutes on Termination Shop.  Wow.  No, no, no, this is not to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is something you can let wash over you  like those deadlines.  It's really perhaps...  The best thing ever recorded.  Let me see here where I have it in my data directory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think so.  It's funny.  I know it's special because you knew it specifically  in Dropbox as we were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  It's in my vault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I actually have a fond space in my heart  for the version with Mostef and Martin Smith.  That's the one that I saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm like, why did I watch this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's impenetrable I think if you didn't read the books  because it's almost like a quick flip through it.  It steals the...  So I think if you don't know the books,  I don't think it holds together as a movie,  but as a window into...  And Bill Nye is Larder Bartfast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I love Bill Nye.  So I would love for that reason alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've watched some weird stuff,  but I remember thinking, boy, this is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The movie was...  Incomprehensible.  Is that the movie or a TV show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The movie.  The movie.  Yeah, from like 10 years ago.  Terrible, terrible.  I don't think.  Oh, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you?  You loved it?  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But maybe because you already loved...  What gets me is everybody that told me to watch that movie  when I came back with my complaints,  they're like, well, you should have read the book first.  And I said, well, you never recommended it.  You didn't tell me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not fair.  I don't think it worked as a movie.  I think it worked as a love letter to readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it really was.  Yeah, yeah.  Boy.  I'll send you the original, the audio play,  because it's actually, to me, it's one of the greatest.  And the only reason I was aware of it,  I didn't hear it on the BBC,  but Boston Public Radio, WGBH,  played it all the way through every Saturday.  And I think I recorded it.  I think that's how I have a copy of it.  Whoops.  Because I don't think it's generally available for download.  Maybe it is if you look around.  I don't think you can buy it or anything.  Let's talk about the Flat Earth.  What?  Shall we?  What now?  Great article on the next web, TNW.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh-oh.  It actually-  I almost didn't put this in, sir, just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bookmarked it, because I liked it so damn much.  It's actually an article published,  it was published in The Conversation,  and then TNW republished it, so I saw it there.  I watched hundreds of Flat Earth videos  to learn how conspiracy theories spread  and what it could mean for fighting disinformation.  I'll give you the TLDR.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's not much to learn.  Uh-huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, basically,  countering disinformation is difficult  when people internalize it as a personal belief.  Well, yeah.  Shocking.  Fact checking can be ineffective and backfire,  because disinformation becomes a personal opinion,  or more importantly, a value.  So you're attacking their values.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was told facts don't care about your feelings, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and apparently feelings don't care  about your facts. It was meant ironically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  And feelings don't care about your facts, either.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Feelings, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you can identify the rationality  behind their specific beliefs,  a counterargument can engage that logic  if you can propose a homemade experiment.  But overall, beliefs like flat earth theory, QAnon,  and the great replacement theory grow  because they appeal to a sense of group identity under attack.  It's precisely because people are attacking you  for your beliefs that they solidify,  that you adhere to them,  because you're on this in-group that is being attacked.  Even far-fetched misinformation and conspiracies  can seem rational if they fit into existing grievances.  Since debates on social media require only posting content,  participants create a feedback loop  that solidifies disinformation as points of view  that cannot be fact-checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, there you go.  Okay, easy thing.  You put them in the bottom of a well,  and they can just reproduce the method.  I mean, I'm sure, we'll just take people,  put them in the bottom of a well.  Yeah.  And they can reproduce the method that was used  in ancient Greece.  Eratosthenes or somebody, right?  Oh, very good, Eratosthenes.  That sounds right.  I mean, the flat earth thing is hilarious  because nobody has thought the earth,  I shouldn't say nobody.  The primary belief among people who engaged  in various kinds of philosophical and scientific work  across millennia has been that the earth is round  because it's easily proven.  So, you can go to all these cultures at their height,  and some that maintain their height for millennia,  and they're like, yeah, yeah, the earth's round.  It doesn't do us any good, but it's round.  We think it might be 14,000 miles around.  That was wrong, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He, Eratosthenes, had heard from travelers  about a well in Egypt with an interesting property.  At noon on the summer solstice,  the sun illuminated the entire bottom of the well  without casting any shadows,  indicating the sun was directly overhead.  He measured the angle of a shadow cast by a stick  at noon on the summer solstice in Alexandria,  found, which was some distance away from that well,  found it made an angle of 7.2 degrees,  150 of the complete circle, did the calculation,  came up with an estimate that the circumference  of the round earth, I should point out,  this isn't 500 BC.  It is circumference, you say.  Circumference of the round, or actually 276 BC.  He estimated to be about 24,  between 24,000 and 29,000 miles.  It is, in fact, exactly 24,900 miles.  So, he pretty much nailed it.  Yeah.  By putting a stick in a well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, we've now, if you just pay attention during math class.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you show kids a stick today, they won't listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Find me a well, I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Give me a lever big enough and I'll move the earth.  Come on. That's right.  I'm fulcruming here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm fulcruming here.  Fulcruming here.  I'm fulcruming here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My new catchphrase.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a bumper sticker would be handy.  I'm fulcruming, fulcruming here.  Metta warns employees of serious times.  Should we be concerned?  Where's the serious music here?  We are in serious times here and the headwinds are fierce.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Fierce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  An internal memo.  Warning of a leaner second half, 2022,  from Chief Product Officer Chris Cox.  I have to underscore, Cox wrote that we are in serious times  here, the headwinds are fierce.  We need to execute flawlessly in an environment  of slower growth where teams should not expect  vast influxes of new engineers and budgets.  Wait a minute.  This is exactly the memo Lisa just wrote.  If your ceiling bursts, it's on you.  The biggest revenue challenge continues  to come from privacy changes affecting Metta's ad business  and macroeconomic pressures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And by the way, your stock options  are gurgling underwater folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Monetizing.  Are they doing restricted stock units  or are they doing options at Metta?  I don't know, that's a good question.  I mean that was Microsoft's secret  is they kept people during some bad times  because they switched to RSUs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I got RSUs at Time Inc at the worst possible time  in the middle of a takeover fight with Paramount and Warner.  And so it was at the highest it was ever,  was or ever was going to be.  And I only recently got rid of the last of them.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook gives you RSUs, they lend their lesson.  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Easier to make money that way.  It's easier to entice people too  because you can say here's a million bucks worth these  if you come and work at our lousy company.  Oh sorry, our company.  Yeah.  I'm going to say lousy.  No editorializing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook RSUs, this is from the product manual,  product, not the product manual,  this is from the employee handbook.  Facebook RSUs are a valuable benefit for Facebook employees.  As long as you understand the tax implications  of the investment and plan accordingly  with your tax advisor, it can be a benefit greater  than traditional stock options offer.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll tell you, Microsoft is a dominant force  in Amazon in the Seattle area.  I was at the eye doctor with one of my older kids  the other day and we were talking about benefits.  They're like, oh do you have Microsoft insurance?  We're like, no.  They're like, aw.  Aw.  It's like, it is such a gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have Boeing insurance.  Oh get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If we have individual insurance,  but it's not bad for pediatric optical.  But I had a friend whose husband worked for Microsoft.  She's like, I got my braces for free.  It's incredible what they do.  So it's restricted stock units and good benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Among other things, Facebook says we have to monetize Reels  as quickly as possible.  This is Chris Cox again.  And we talked about this yesterday.  I'm fine with it.  Reels, Instagram has just basically turned into TikTok.  Right?  TikTok clone.  If you post a video, it's a real automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Ant seemed to scowl a bit at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, I'm fortunate  where I'm not just a photographer that shoots stills.  I also shoot video stuff.  So I'm fine with it.  But the folks that don't do the video stuff,  it sucks for the photography community  because now their work is being just suppressed  and pushed down because they were not posting video content.  And I've done the A-B testing before,  whether it's on TikTok or Instagram,  particularly Instagram,  I see what people are viewing in my analytics  and can see where the comments are.  And people will comment on an image  that's posted three, four days ago  as if it was just posted right now.  But the video content, they see that pretty quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And so the algo is pushing the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  And there's some other things in place too,  but I won't get into all of that.  But I'm fine with this.  If they want to start monetizing Reels,  sure, I'm fine with that.  I believe I'm eligible for it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, monetizing would be nice.  Yeah.  It ain't TikTok yet, but I do.  No, it's nowhere near.  The problem is I have TikTok.  I want Instagram to be Instagram.  I miss the old stills of Instagram.  That was a great picture photo.  Same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the whole algorithmic feed  versus the following feed,  I think that's what they call it.  That's fallacy because I click on that  to make sure it's only showing me the people I follow  and it still will throw in suggestive post of things  that I don't care anything about.  It drives me nuts.  So I'm still missing out on a lot of the people  that I want to see unless I actively search for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the search is so bad on Instagram.  I can never find people.  I mean, it's, yeah, talk about search.  And just improve that one.  Yeah, yeah.  Neither of them feel like it's important  to let people search because they want to push you  to where it provides them the best revenue response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is that the strategy?  I've never been able to figure out why.  If you want to find a friend, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Arguably that why would they let you search  on what you want because that doesn't produce  them the best outcome.  You're the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you find more friends, you're happier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't have a problem finding people.  It's always like it's keywords or not even keywords.  I mean, Instagram is focused a lot around keywords.  I know you probably have strategies for this.  I have so many friends who post on Instagram  and there's like 40 keywords in their description  because that's the only way, isn't it,  to get people to find you?  Sure enough, put those tags in and it'll push it all out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TikTok's worse.  They put hashtags for random products in there too.  I guess it's, I mean, it's crazy what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you were saying, Mr. LaPorte,  it's definitely not a TikTok and I agree with that  because TikTok does a good job or a fairly good job  of suggesting content to you.  Granted, you follow salt underscore Hank  who has over a gazillion followers right now.  I barely get to see his content,  even though I actively follow him,  but they do try to push up.  Yeah, but they do try to push up other things to me  that would interest me.  Instagram on the other hand,  they're constantly showing me a bunch of teenagers  doing weird stuff that I care nothing about  or people fighting and I'm like,  I don't wanna see any of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you get the one, it's a very cool process,  but I've seen it a lot and Jeff, you'll appreciate this  as somebody interested in praying technology.  It's the thing where they print ceramics  or they use this thing and it goes bloop in some ink  and then it goes bloop and then it puts a dish underneath  and it goes bloop.  I get this all the time.  It's beautiful.  No, I've not seen that.  Oh, oh, it's an incredible thing.  The pattern is like this flexible, gooey,  like almost rubbery looking thing  and it's got the entire interior pattern of like a dish,  like a plate or a bowl or something.  So you know like those, when you go to a Chinese restaurant,  they have those beautifully like fish,  blue fish decorated patterns around a bowl.  This is what makes it is this thing goes,  the pattern is on the rubber surface,  it goes bloop onto a pad of ink, comes up,  a bowl goes in and it goes bloop  and it fills the entire space perfectly  and deposits the ink.  I'm sorry, this sounds too much bloop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just hoping someone captured a gif of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Instagram wants to push that at me all the time.  Here's how these bowls are made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is actually an argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I dare you to make bloop a show title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an argument for why TikTok is great  because you said Instagram.  Do you mean TikTok or do you see this on Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Me on Instagram, I don't do the TikTok.  I don't do the TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It used to be a big TikTok meme,  so it must've spread over to Instagram.  But somebody was making this case,  I think maybe it was on Twitter on Sunday,  you were here Glenn,  but the TikTok is really opening our eyes  to all sorts of things we would never seem for,  including industrial processes.  I think that's partly because a lot of the original  TikTokers were Chinese showing how they were manufacturing  the world's goods, but it's actually quite fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  One of my favorites is da underscore captain underscore  Mark on TikTok.  He's a Maersk container ship captain.  There you go.  And I'm fascinated by it.  Videos of these containers going down 10 levels and up  and little factoids about how he does his work.  It's weird, but I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm following him right now,  although as you point out, Ant,  following him doesn't necessarily get you  any more of his stuff than right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I do get a lot of his,  because I obviously like it.  Well, what you do, the real trick.  But I also do with Hank and I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the real trick is to go every time you see something  you want to see more of in the for you page,  which is the random page.  You just, you will go into it and you look at a few videos  from it, you're set.  And I've noticed you can really,  if you want bikini rich content,  go in there and look at the bikinis and you will get more.  So whatever it is you signal.  But I've done that with Hank and I don't get Hank.  I get a lot.  Well, I don't get Hank.  I get a lot of cooking is what I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get a lot of cooking,  but I'm specifically looking for Hank.  Yeah.  Cause I'm curious to see what he's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you just have to search unfortunately,  which is too bad.  I know exactly what you're talking about though  with the bloop bloop thing.  And I saw that originally on TikTok  and it's my guess that it's appearing now on your Instagram  because of a TikTok envy, frankly.  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  I love industrial processes.  Show me more industrial processes.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watching how that stuff is made is fascinating.  All right.  I've been just testing Benito.  He has for the last hour and a half had his finger hovered  over the change log button.  And Benito, you are a rock.  You are stellar because now you can finally release  the hounds.  It's time for the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that.  Unbelievable.  Look at that timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So good.  Benito, you might as well play the next one now  because there aren't much of the change log.  There's four items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is the world's shortest change log.  Androids, July security patches rolling out to the pixel,  factory images.  That's about right.  Usually takes about a week into the month.  It's coming out.  July 2022 update now rolling out to Galaxy devices as well.  That's unusual.  That's good, Samsung.  Good job.  Google Photos is now rolling out.  A lot of rolling happening on the change log today.  Rolling out a new pop-up.  It's not much else.  Yeah, that's it.  It's all rolls.  New pop-up UI for quick sharing and library management.  I haven't seen it yet,  but look for a new interface to quick sharing.  I do actually really love these highlights  and things that they generate.  So I end up sharing those a lot.  Pictures of pets and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I like the little memory stuff that pops up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple does pretty well too with that on their phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But the last two years, it's ridiculous.  It's just like, I've had no light for the last two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Masks, lots of masks.  And there is a new zero day threat,  the fourth of the year for Google Chrome.  We talked about it yesterday on Security Now.  Good news.  There is a patch.  Your Google Chrome will be patched.  It's a fairly serious zero day,  so make sure you get the update to your Google Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should happen automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.  That was fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I am ready.  I know you are for the picks of the week.  That's coming up next as we continue with a very fun  this week in Google.  Thanks Glenn Fleischman for filling in.  Stacey's got a couple of weeks off.  We really appreciate you coming in.  It's always good to have you on.  Pleasure to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you for having me on.  Pleasure to be here.  You're taking this in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Stacey's in Paris and you're here.  Who won?  She's in Paris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's at that, what do they call it?  Whammo, Nammo, Whammo, Whoa, Whoa,  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Low Ran.  She's speaking on something about open IOT,  I believe is what she said.  Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Low Ran, Low Ra-Run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody's hit Leo, he's gone to a crash.  He's crashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Low Ran, Low Ran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a pick of the week for us Mr. Fleischman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do and it's very appropriate.  I think given the audience, it's a book by a graphic design  production person who works in movies,  which is a very specialized thing.  I saw some images from it and got a copy.  It's called Fake Love Letters,  forced forged telegrams and prison escape maps,  designing graphic products for film making.  It's just got wonderful details in it.  I love this stuff, I eat it up.  But it's a loving little book.  It's not a big book, but it's just kind of about  the process of making films look like they're lived in.  Even the degree of research they go, where they are,  like oh that didn't exist in 1922, we can't put that in.  But this is one of my favorite things.  She did some research and found this sign on the left.  It's a legitimate sign that says steamed eels  and mashed potatoes.  Always ready.  Common dish, this is from 1900.  Common dish at the time, eels were very popular  to eat in England.  And then her version for a film where they're trying  to recreate that feeling.  But she said this is the thing,  is the eels part in mashed potatoes not surprising.  The always ready part is the thing she said,  I couldn't guess that without doing the research.  Compare the amber sands, wait Glenn, hold on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Compare the amber sands.  Yeah, hers is not too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did she, hold up.  The modern version?  The modern amber sand is so different.  Well that's what I'm saying, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now look at hers.  No, she did the same, okay.  It's a little bit cleaned up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this was for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love amber sands in.  Penny dreadfuls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's just fun to see how, it's a great mix of,  I'll tell you this other thing, it's very tactile.  I can't do this on a podcast or videocast,  but there's actually a special kind of varnish  that's actually kind of smooth.  So the cover's smooth and this area that says  the match book has a little bit of texture on it.  So it's not just shiny, which most varnish is,  it's actually got a little bit of rough feel to it.  So anyway, I just found this a delightful thing to read  because it's about creating new things  and just the complexities of movie prop making  without going super inside baseball.  Like they had to make, if you want to put one telegram,  bloodstained telegram into a movie, as appears in,  I think it's the Grand Budapest Hotel,  you have to make like 47 of them that look nearly identical  because what happens when they have to shoot that scene  again and again, you can't not have these props available.  Here we go.  That's the spread.  Look at that.  So they're all slightly different, but close enough.  Because, so they have to design it.  Yeah, and then make these multiples.  So anyway, it's just a, it's a fun read.  It's a short book and it's just beautiful  and beautifully designed and that made me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Annie Atkins, fake love letters, forged telegrams  and prison escape maps, maps,  designing graphic props for filmmaking,  available in paperback from Amazon.  There's an analogous craft called playback  that maybe is more timely, which is those computer screens  you see in movies and TV shows.  There is a person, I've talked to them  because they use stuff from our show sometimes,  that does that, that makes those screens and they make-  Oh, that's great.  It's a, that would be a great book.  I'd love to, or a video or something.  I'd love to see more about that.  It also reminds me of when we went to see Hamilton  in New York, you know, every once in a while on Broadway,  they do these benefits for Broadway Cares  where they're auctioning off things.  And I kick myself because I didn't stick around  and buy this, but they were selling.  There's a moment in Hamilton where,  I think is that his wife burns his love letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They throw the love letters in and they burn them.  They were selling those love letters from the set.  Same thing, somebody had to make them every show.  Somebody had to make your love letters.  I'm sure there would be thousands of those.  They were selling them and, you know,  along with autograph posters, a bunch of other things.  And I gave them money for Broadway Cares, I always do,  but I wish I had stuck around.  There was quite a press in the lobby.  I wish I'd stuck around to buy those  because that would have been, in hindsight,  that would have been something to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jaffa will fire up his iron hand press  and make you some duplicate letters, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But those were on the stage.  That was amazing. That's pretty cool.  Yeah, I know you hate Hamilton and everything,  but you know, that's pretty cool.  I didn't say I hated Hamilton.  I said I don't like musicals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're gonna like any musical.  That's exactly what I said.  That's a pretty good musical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I have one in a second,  but I've gotta make Glenn jealous.  I went to a used bookstore last week and I got this.  Chronicles of Genius and Folly.  Oh.  It is a history of the R. Ho printing press company.  Oh my.  Oh, oh.  We just geeked out together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's that from, like 1923 or something, 1930?  Oh, oh, interesting.  Ho was the, H-O-E was the early manufacturer of press  and then a lot of other equipment helped transition.  Printing from a kind of quiet little industry  into this massive, I have a picture of press.  It's a 10-man press and literally people are,  it's like 40 feet high.  People are standing on each level feeding paper in.  Feeding paper in, yeah.  It looks ridiculous, but it was real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's what made mass media possible.  Yeah, that's why we're here today.  That was my little moment for Glenn there.  Thank you.  We geek out on these things.  Notice, Jeff, I've just been handed this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the curatorial care of works of art on paper.  Had I only bought those Hamilton love letters,  I would be able to conserve them.  Burke, this is like how to keep mold and insects  off of them, acidity.  Where did this come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why did we have this in the studio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's probably camera right back there in the corner  where everything else is.  Oh my God.  I've been to the conservation lab once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you trying to restore some art, Burke?  Oh, he's trying to restore some art.  Wow, that's a great field.  Have you learned about the removal of old matting material?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Very complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very complicated, not an easy thing to do.  You gotta use special blues.  Disinfecting by fumigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a great book from the 1800s called  The Enemy of Books and it includes things like children  and the help.  It's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The help often has sticky fingers.  Insects.  Insects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Insects, but also children.  And help.  And your maids, your many maids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't believe you had this to hand, Burke.  That's amazing.  Thank you very much.  He is our official restorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff, I just want to point out the red linotype book.  In my real background here.  I saw that.  Finally got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You did, yeah.  What year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that I don't know.  I have to pull it off, but it's 2020s.  It's a little distressed copy,  but now I've got one of my own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Those are the font sample books,  which are just beautiful.  It's just amazing.  Would you two get a room?  This is not my picnic.  Glen's here.  Just give us this week in fonts.  We'll be all set.  Yeah, we are.  By the way, I had to learn that a font is one...  Tell me if I'm wrong here, Glen.  A font is one size.  The design is the typeface.  Typeface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One size and style, that's right.  Cause you would create a font.  You would buy a font of type.  There's a Walt Whitman poem called The Font of Type.  And just...  It's a font right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just as long as we're squaring the circle,  here is a video of printing on ceramics.  Oh, Glen, can I make a guess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, good, you found it.  Yes.  Just watch, here's the...  Do the sound effects here, Glen, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And here comes the ball.  Never sound like this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't this a good...  Okay, that's pretty cool.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, if you're just watching...  Incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're just listening,  you're just gonna have to imagine  a giant rubber bloop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bloop?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Would you ever...  This is what I love about manufacturing processes.  Would you ever have imagined this...  Like, Dr. Seuss thing was how those were made.  It's totally Dr. Seuss.  I think it was sprayed on through a stencil or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's totally Dr. Seuss.  Some poor little lady sitting there.  Yeah, oh yeah, painting.  Look at the brush.  Dead eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Your eyes going...  Nope, it's bloop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bloop, bloop.  Bloop.  Any other picks and numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I've never shown this one,  but since Glenn's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about Arby's Old Spice?  I'm gonna get to that in a second.  Oh, wait a minute.  The Autumn Tide of Middle Ages.  Wow.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Autumn Tide of Middle Ages by Johann Hünsinger  is a magnificent, magnificent history,  beautiful book, one of the most beautiful books  I've ever owned.  Interesting.  All right, all right.  Now, yes, now that's the classy me.  Now we go to the real me.  And if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to compete with a giant piece of it,  but I think you might have found it, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Arby's Old Spice and Old Spice come together  for a marketing marriage made in heaven.  It's a collab, what the kids call a collab

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  between Old Spice and Arby's.  Show my screen, Benito.  Here you go.  Get ready for the meat sweats.  Arby's half pound roast beef piled high  and of course you eat that.  Oh wait, I'll turn on this.  Let's turn on the sound.  Can you turn on the sound?  We didn't check our sound.  I don't know if we have the sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Arby's half pound roast beef piled high with...  Meat sweats!  Who said that?  Old Spice meat sweat defense.  Defends against the meat sweats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm on a horsey sauce.  Arby's, we have the...  Meat sweats!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Defense.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is the strangest.  It's not a real ad.  It is.  It is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are they promoting though?  I don't even know.  Their giant half pound roast beef sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need that sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, are you horsey sauce fans?  I'm on a horsey sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute, they have horsey sauce?  That's not made up.  No, that's not wrong.  Oh no, for years.  I've been in Arby's sauce.  Why do they call it horsey sauce?  Horse radish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've not been in Arby's for 30 years, maybe longer.  Bless your heart.  Am I missing out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I go a couple times a year.  I just like plain old roast beef sandwiches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But is it really roast beef?  It's so pink, I feel like it might be made out of...  Is it real?  Rubber.  Kangaroo or something?  It feels like it's formed.  It's not like...  Roast off a roast.  So I used to work at Ponderosa Steakhouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  And all of our beef came from low grade Australian beef.  And if you took a raw defrosted steak  and you bent it back,  you saw needle marks every quarter inch.  Oh, the tenderizer.  The tenderizer, right.  So yes, it may be beef, Leo,  but who knows where it comes from.  Low quality Australian beef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It tastes fine.  It tastes fine.  All right, I'll take your word for it  because you were not wrong  about the Popeyes chicken sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Popeyes chicken sandwich.  Oh, I was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now I didn't know when my son lived in Boston,  I would go to Boston,  and I could never understand.  And finally, just as he was moving away,  why does everybody in Boston have roast beef?  Pizza and roast beef.  It makes no sense.  Pizza and roast beef.  It's the Irish.  I finally had a Massachusetts roast beef sandwich  with horseradish and mayonnaise.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the real thing.  It's no clam cake, but I'll grant you that.  I was in the land of clam cakes last week  and had more than my share.  Let's put it that way.  Also had some Dunkin'.  Now it is time for Ant Pruitt and his pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, mine will be quick.  First one, I just want to do  a bit of a public service announcement.  I know a lot of folks have been wanting to get  into being more healthy, getting out exercising,  even buying a bike if he can get your hands on one,  particularly e-bikes.  Well, Walmart has come to the rescue to give us an e-bike.  And I want to tell you, don't buy that bike.  Oh, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa.  It's 1500 bucks.  You're saving me some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do not buy that bike.  It's a e-bike mountain bike.  And I've had mountain bikes in the past  that I used to ride quite a bit,  but now doctors orders tell me not to ride.  Oh, that's sad.  Well, because they're crashing.  So I don't want to destroy my replaced hip.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Oh, man.  And I've had inexpensive bikes before.  I've had bikes from Walmart and other inexpensive bikes.  They do not last.  So do not spend $1500 on this e-bike  as much as they're trying to sell it.  Get something else.  Get you a non e-bike for a lot less money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did a review on an e-bike for us.  And I'm trying to remember what the-  Yes, I did.  VanMoof.  The VanMoof, these are like considered  kind of the top line touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, VanMoof are quite nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those bikes are quite expensive.  But you like the VanMoof.  You get what you pay for.  That's the thing.  You get what you pay for.  Yeah, that's it, the VanMoof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are some real breakthroughs in e-bike.  I'm a huge e-bike fan.  I just, I love electric bikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But-  The one on the left is what I demo.  Yeah, the step through.  The one on the left.  Oh, you had the one on the bar, huh?  How much?  They're like-  It's like 3,200, I think.  That's not bad.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, it's not bad.  I mean, we have a specialized for our kid  that was $7,000.  This is 3,000 near the S5.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is actually not bad.  And look how elegant it is.  You don't have a big ugly battery on the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I believe Mr. Nielsen  coined it the Tesla of bikes.  Yeah.  Well, don't insult the thing.  No, it was just really pretty, beautiful lines.  You didn't see any of the cable in.  Yeah, there's a review out there on our website somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm looking at rad bikes because I want to have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have three rad power bikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's great.  I think they're headquartered in Seattle,  so I can go and test them out here.  I love ours.  I'm keen to have some good entry level models  for a non-mountain bike version.  I'm very curious.  We have Lisa has the fat tire one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the city step through.  They're excellent.  They're lower cost.  So you're going to, some of the components  won't be the best like the brake pads.  You have to replace the brake pads  every once in a while, things like that.  But I really like our rad power.  Really great bikes.  Yeah, I could recommend those.  And the Electric does reviews of electric bikes,  which I trust.  I think they're quite good.  They're an electric car magazine as well,  and they have some good recommendations.  But I love my rad power.  I'm very, very happy with them.  So how much does that run, Leo?  They're more like 1500 bucks.  They're not bad.  Yeah, and I can go test drive here in Seattle,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and I could rent it for a day, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you want an off-road or you want a city bike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just a city person.  I've got knees and other issues, so I can't do the hills.  I'm too old for the hills with my current set of health  and recommendations.  So Seattle, known for hills, as you'll see next week,  I believe.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what I have.  The Rad City Steps Through.  These are great.  Get a Step Through.  It's not a girl's bike.  It's just an easy to get on bike.  Those old guys.  Yeah, and I haven't seen these other ones.  And then I got a basket for mine  so I can go to the grocery store  and get a big old basket on that thing.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Toto.  Toto and the basket.  Stay away from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Lisa has the big fat tire off-road, the Rad Rover,  and she loves that bike.  That's a great looking bike.  But again, we've had to replace the brake pads  after a year of use and stuff like that.  There's just little maintenance things you have to do.  Maintenance.  But they work great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So how does it work?  You can just turn on the power  and not pedal at all on a big hill?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pedal assist mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so there's two ways you can do an e-bike.  You can do pedal assist,  which means you have to pedal or it won't go anywhere.  There's specializes like that.  Most of the bikes I get,  including all the Rad Powers, have throttles.  So you can just push the throttle and go forward.  A steep hill, you're going to have to pedal.  You're going to have to help it.  It doesn't have so much power.  Yeah, that's what I'm right.  It can get you up a steep hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We had the city full of e-bikes here.  Seattle was one of the places  where like five or seven companies  deployed all those bikes at once,  and then they moved into e-bikes.  So I was able to test some of those,  and I thought, wow, this is a whole different thing  than, I don't know, 15 years ago,  when I saw people buying e-bikes  and before lithium ion batteries were reliable and all that.  And I felt like, gotta get into this.  I want to get out more and less driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you are going to,  your kids are a little older now.  If I had little kids, they have Rad Power bikes for kids.  I mean, you put the kids on the back.  They have cargo bikes, this Rad Wagon.  You could pull cargo behind you.  This is for a kid to sit on the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have a friend in the Netherlands  who she had four children,  and the Netherlands is very flat  and super bike friendly.  She had the Bakfiets, the cargo bike,  and she would take, I saw pictures of her  with her four small children,  driving them all around the big cargo thing.  And I was like, how fast can you go?  And she's like, well, you know, like five miles an hour,  but that's all we need.  Everything's close together.  It's all flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see families on their Rad Powers all over town.  It's really cute.  They're really, yeah, it's really cute.  I love it.  I'm a big fan.  I just wish it were safe,  because it really isn't safe to bicycle  anywhere around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got, I live on country roads,  two lane roads out here,  and yellow line roads, and...  Hard head, they have scooters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hard head and low weight, they have scooters.  They wanted the bike, like what you had,  because they saw them at your house,  but they ended up getting scooters,  and they love those things.  Perfect for their age.  They're more portable too, I know.  Yeah, and they can really just throw them anywhere  and lock them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Michael used to take the smart train,  the light rail, close to school,  and then he'd bring a scooter,  and he'd get on a scooter and go the extra mile to school.  He did that all through high school.  It was really great.  Did you want to plug this battery quick charger too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is a funny story, because I bought,  I was talking to Mr. Nielsen earlier.  I needed to get a new V-mount battery  to put on my video camera that I'm talking to right now,  because I'm starting to do some more video work,  and the reason I got away from V-mount batteries,  because they were too big and bulky,  so I was using what we call,  what's called these NPF batteries.  So they're smaller, lighter,  just don't have a ton of power,  but when you go to charge them up,  this battery right here,  it takes about 12 hours to give it a full charge.  Damn, that's a big old battery.  12 daggum hours, and I have one that's smaller than that,  and it still takes it about eight hours to charge.  Well, this here is from ZGCine.  It's an NPF battery charger that's a quick charger.  It uses USB-C PD.  So if you get something like what we talked about earlier  with NoBad, sponsor, and having a GAN charger,  plug it up to that.  It will cut that time in half, if not more.  I charge this NPF.  I think this one was about two and a half hours  to charge up full.  Wow, that's a huge difference.  And it's only 30 bucks for that.  So I was like, yeah, get those.  And it came with these nice pretty cables too,  because y'all know I love orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So V-mount means the battery is mounted  kind of on top of the camera, not inside the camera.  So what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a V-mount battery right here.  It's called a V-mount because it locks into a plate  that's shaped like a V.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you do with the battery?  You don't use the internal battery at all on the camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Correct, because cinema batteries  on the internal side are so weak.  Yeah, they don't last very long.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you put that on top, and how do you tell the camera  that it's getting the juice from that battery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can use a D-tap connection,  or it depends on your camera.  You can use a USB-C or a DC out.  So they're designed to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They understand that you're doing it somewhere else.  Cool, all right, very good.  And Pruitt is our photographer extraordinaire  at Hands-On Photography, but he has another job.  We love the job he's doing as community manager  of the Club Twit.  We wanna get you in Club Twit  because it's very important to us and our success.

All the stuff that doesn't make it to the shows  and ad-free versions of all the shows,  and that's only seven bucks a month.  Yeah, that's a heck of a value.  Get the year plan and you don't have to think about it  for 12 months.  Twit.tv slash club twit.  That makes a good gift too, by the way,  for family and friends.

Transcript:  We actually did talk about Google Affair.  It's kind of our cousin.  You should remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of the Twit cousin show.  It's the cousin.  It's the little kids table.  Yeah, well, I don't think so.  I mean, when you get great people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've forgotten what it was.  He is the director of the Town Night Center  for Entrepreneurial Journalism  at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism  at the City University of New York.  Frank Sinatra called him a bum.  Ray Kroc called him a nickel millionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nickel millionaire.  Alan Thicke begged me to stop making him my whipping boy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alan Thicke.  There's a name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Alan Thicke, I'm sorry, I beg your pardon.  Now, oh, I think of the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Jay Leto wondered why I was so mean.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was another credit.  I really was trying to, oh man, he mentioned it.  Chat room, what was it?  What was it?  I'm trying to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Worst I ever got is the art director of Time Magazine  called me up and yelled at me,  but I didn't even work for Time Magazine at the time.  It was very good.  What did you do?  I worked on the, I don't think you can see it in this view.  If I have to turn my camera,  I worked on the Ted Turner Man of the Year cover back in,  was that 92?  Wow.  And I was just, I was working for Kodak.  We had this place up in Maine called the Kodak Center  for Creative Imaging.  And we had some of the most advanced equipment  under one roof.  And so photographer, Greg Garee Heisler,  fantastic award-winning photographer,  had come up and taught some classes and done some stuff.  And he said, hey, can I come up and do this secret project?  And we said, sure.  My boss said, sure.  And he came up and we, one of my good friends,  who's one of the people I manage there,  she worked with him for a couple of weeks straight  and he kept asking for more hard drives.  So I'd come in and help and consult on,  we're using Letraset Color Studio to produce this.  This was a photo shop and Letraset Color Studio.  We were scanning film.  We had to keep pulling up 500 megabyte drives  and chaining them together.  It was an incredible effort.  We exceeded the capacity of technology  at the time to produce it, but it was running late.  And so instead of calling Greg,  who is the high-paid, wonderful photographer,  really lovely guy, the art director called me,  got my number from someplace and yelled at me.  And I said, look, I'm just plugging hard drives in.  I'm just plugging hard drives in.  Not important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The art director said, what's a hard drive?  Is it because you had all this compositing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with all these other images?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh my God, there was so much compositing.  We were scanning all these slides from frames,  all those images in the cover you see there.  So this is the time of the year.  They were all individual frames taken from CNN  and Greg had shot Ted Turner.  The next year, Greg got in trouble because he shot  the two faces of George Bush, that's George H.W. Bush,  and he did it in camera.  So he had a large format, two and a half inch camera,  I think it is, right?  Two inch film camera.  And he shot Bush's two profiles simultaneously in camera  and got temporarily banned from the White House  and the White House press corps had to go and stand up for him  because they said editorial opinions are not something  you ban people for in this country.  Strangely.  Wow.  That's kind of wild.  Yeah, back in the day, I used to hang around  with photographers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, hey, hey.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, folks, folks, folks.  It's been a pandemic, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You haven't heard about it, but there's been a pandemic.  Yeah, I know.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why did the two faces cover get him in trouble?  Well, he did it.  Is that editorial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
