It's time for Twig this week in Google.  The show where we cover the latest news from the Googleverse.  But also social media in general.  Journalism and a whole lot more.  Jeff Jarvis is not here.  He has the week off.  I think he's probably traveling hither and thither.  But of course we have excellent fill-ins for him.  Let's start with Kevin Tofel.  He's been on the show before.  You know him many years at GigaOM now at ZDNet.  Where he's a contributing writer.  It's great to see you, Kevin.  It's good to be here as always.  And also regularly on Tech News Tonight.  I almost forgot.  And to my left, Ron Amadio from R's Technica.  Great to have you, Ron.  He covers Android.  It's mostly Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Android, Google, whatever.  I feel is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice.  Ron is the writer that all the other Android writers read.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm completely with you, Kevin.  Thank you.  Amadio says it.  It's got to be true.  It's Goth-able.  Yeah, it's Goth-able.  So speaking of Android, I got my PHY.  Got my PHY on.  Jeff Jarvis and I had both been bitching that we'd ask for invites for months.  And that cut's happened to be on a couple of weeks ago before I went to Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if...  You were able to publicly corner him.  Yes.  And demand an invite.  Precisely.  That's what it takes.  Okay, good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he says I have nothing to do with PHY.  As you know, Matt's kind of on leave anyway.  But he said, let me call somebody.  And I'm assuming that that's what happened because both Jeff and I got invites about  a week ago.  We both already have Nexus 6s.  In fact, I think the Nexus 6 was Jeff's daily driver.  I had moved on to some more modern Android phones.  Although coming back to the Nexus 6, I realized what an advantage you have if it's pure Android.  Gosh.  I love the Galaxy S6 camera, but that thing has all sorts of problems because of the  interface, the skin.  Same thing with the LG G4.  This is just a rock solid...  It's giant.  It's a rock solid phone.  I'm kind of glad to go back.  And I decided to make this a pure Google experience, not even use a different launcher.  I'm using the Google Now launcher and the Google keyboard and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it the same phone as the Nexus 6?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is the Nexus 6.  I didn't buy a new phone.  This is the Nexus 6 I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can go to the Nexus system image page and they have a download specifically for the  Project PHY Nexus 6.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, where you can just kind of flash your phone to whatever the Project PHY software...  Oh, I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So again, Rotom Audio, to the rescue!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But no, they should give you OTAs and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't need that.  I'm just using the 511 that was on this Nexus 6 forever and I put in a PHY SIM.  So you get a kit.  Now you do have the choice of buying not subsidized but an amortized Nexus 6.  They spread the payments out.  But I opted just to get the SIM.  So they sent me the SIM, came in a few days, put the SIM in here and the phone almost  immediately went from being T-Mobile, which is what I was using.  You see it says PHY network, which isn't much of a surprise since it is in fact T-Mobile  and Sprint that it chooses between.  There must be a way of knowing whether it's using T-Mobile or Sprint, but I'm not sure.  Maybe that's in...  I don't know.  Maybe that's in the APN...  Somewhere in the...  APN settings, maybe?  Yeah, the APN settings is all I can think of.  Let's...  You know what?  Let's check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are those when you rapidly switch between two different carriers?  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's one of the reasons you can only do this in the Nexus 6 is clearly...  Clearly there's something going on here.  Cellular networks.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah.  They put special hardware in this for Project PHY, which is why it's the only phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which means that they knew about PHY...  Last year.  Last year.  Yeah, there doesn't seem to be any way of knowing...  You can turn on or off Wi-Fi calling, but that's kind of normal.  And under cellular networks, there's only one setting, turn on or off data roaming.  So I don't know where the APN settings would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it go back one, I think?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's more...  That's where I was just looking at more.  Where you were in more?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where did it go?  There's Diddley.  There's got to be APN settings somewhere because you got to be able to customize the APN settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're automatic now, so you really shouldn't have to mess...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's the case.  No, if you go to cellular network, there's an access...  Where is that?  Okay, cellular network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  More, and then cellular networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, I'll show you what I get on the Project PHY phone.  Show them what I get on the Project PHY phone.  Yeah, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They hid all the network...  They are hiding it, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does anybody know what that code is that you can enter that will show you the details?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Up, down, up, down, left, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very good.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Leo, you should be on Build LVY48C for the newest Project PHY thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, so I'm on LVYZ28E.  So it works fine.  They didn't tell me I should get a new...  They didn't tell me anything I should get a new or anything.  Let me see if there's a system update.  No.  So you don't have to be on a special version of the operating system to do this.  It's just...  I'm up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would guess you're missing bug fixes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, so...  But they didn't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's weird.  I don't know.  PHY is weird.  I don't have one.  I have no idea.  They won't send me one.  Same here.  Google it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's try the special code.  Star hash, star hash 4636.  Is it hash star or star hash?  Well, they say...  It's the opposite of it.  It's the opposite, isn't it?  It's hash star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be hash star, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hash star.  That's what I thought.  It's the check-in...  Yeah, it worked.  Phone information, battery information.  So let's see.  Phone information.  I'm on the PHY network.  So this must be an MVNO thing because that's what they are, right?  Is an MVNO.  But they're doing something that no one I've ever heard of is doing,  which is sharing between Sprint and T-Mobile depending on which runs the best.  And I can't see here anything that indicates which of the  two I'm on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need to do a trace route and look up the IP addresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  HSPA is T-Mobile, right?  That's going to be T-Mobile.  That's T-Mobile.  It's not CDMA.  So it will go.  It will fall back to CDMA, which is Sprint.  So I'm on T-Mobile, but without...  Unless you knew that that's what that meant, you wouldn't otherwise know.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of the point, though, is that you don't know.  You don't know.  You don't have to care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It just says the PHY network.  And then you do get, of course, a Project PHY kit, which I'll show you here.  This is all free.  And actually, you get...  And others have reported this.  It's kind of cool.  You get some special Project PHY headphones.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically trip monitor stereo, whichever sounds better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turn eardrum solos into eardrum duets, it says.  Don't know what that means.  Oh, you can share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a...  You can share...  Two people could listen.  Oh, you're right.  It's got a special connector.  It's a splitter.  It's a splitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  Look at that.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes it really fit funny in your pocket.  That's good.  And by the way, these make excellent Tupperware containers.  Yeah, isn't that wild?  I didn't notice that.  And it's the PHY color scheme, which is ugly as hell, is white.  This is...  You also get a in-case case that says Project PHY on it.  White with kind of icky buttons, green and blue.  You get the SIM, in my case.  And they also give you, which is kind of cool, a Project PHY battery.  It says all natural juice for your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like the new swag that everybody gives out.  I have like 10,000 of these stupid things now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see.  Let's just add a curiosity.  That's interesting.  It has a little thing to hang it on the shelf with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got to be a good 5,000, 8,000 milliamp hour battery.  Yeah, it's a crappy 6,000 milliamp hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a 20,000 that's this size.  Come on, guys.  That's all right.  It's free, right?  What are you going to do?  It's free.  And wait a minute.  This looks like it has...  Yeah, it does.  Two USB connectors.  That's kind of nice.  Separate amperages?  Output 1 amp?  Output 2.1.  Oh, so it has a fast charge, which is good because the Nexus 6 does support quick charging.  So you would want to use the 2.1 amp connector.  All right.  So that's the kit.  I put in the SIM card.  First thing it says is,  do you want to port your Google Voice number over or do you want a new number?  Now, this is where it gets complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And do you want to jump off the cliff?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my advice to you, if you use Google...  I use Google Voice and I thought, well, I'm going to be the guinea pig.  We'll try it.  My advice to you is to not use your Google Voice number  because you lose many of the Google Voice features.  The phone forwarding continues.  So one of the main things I do with Google Voice is I use that as my number  and then I change phones all the time.  And it's continuing to forward to three phones total.  So that's good news.  But the other thing that...  There are a lot of things that are very cool about Google Voice,  one of which is you can have...  Use your Google Contacts, group people and give them different answering machine messages.  You can change how the response will be.  Some people you'll pick up on, some you won't.  You can have screening.  So if somebody calls my Google Voice number, they have to announce themselves.  And then I have to press one to pick up on it.  All of that seems to have disappeared.  In fact, it looks like all you really get is the ability to do...  These are the settings.  Voicemail, call forwarding, service address, which is the 911 address, alerts.  So it'll tell you on device or email if you go past the data that you agree to.  And then call forwarding.  I'm not going to show those numbers, but it forwards to two other numbers.  So really the big deal on this is that you only pay for the data you use.  So it's...  What was it?  30 bucks for the voice and text service, unlimited texting.  And then 10 bucks a gigabyte for data.  You say ahead of time, as I did, how much data you think you'll use.  I said five gigabytes.  But it's really irrelevant what you choose because you'll just pay 10 bucks a gigabyte,  whether you use 10 or 20 or 50 or 100 or whatever.  And then they'll rebate you the difference.  Or I guess you give you a credit on the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That credit goes down to like the penny as well.  I mean, it's a pretty detailed accounting of what you use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can see as you go.  The other thing that's very cool is there's no extra charge for tethering.  And the tethering just counts against your data.  So this is a great MiFi device.  International usage is the same as T-Mobile.  So 20 cents a call and 10 bucks a gigabyte, but limited to 256 kilobits per second.  That's how T-Mobile works as well internationally.  So obviously using the T-Mobile network for international usage.  It looks to be even the same countries.  So that's it.  I mean, I have to say it's very clean.  It's very simple.  I presume they have good support.  The phone supports estimated wait is one minute.  Email replies with one to four hours.  There's a Project Fi community on Google+, which I still can't get into.  I think you need to get an invite to get into the community.  But other than that, that's it.  So the real caveat for anybody who wants to do this, and I can see why you might want to do this,  is that you should probably get a new phone number if you use Google Voice.  Because as far as I know, there's no way, I don't know if there's any way for me to go back.  I think I've lost my Google Voice number.  So that really...  Go ahead, Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it a big difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you care that much?  Is it just the billing thing is the reason you should care that much?  I mean, it seems like a lot of effort on Google's part for not that huge of a differentiator.  You mean, oh yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So the price isn't that much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of the service is the same as you're going to get from T-Mobile or Samsung.  The service is the same as you're going to get from T-Mobile or Sprint in your area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's one big advantage though.  This also has seamless Wi-Fi calling transfer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But my T-Mobile phone does that too, by the way.  So that's just...  This phone, in fact, did it with T-Mobile, as does the Galaxy S6.  Any phone that can support Wi-Fi calling, when you're on T-Mobile, T-Mobile will say,  oh, you're going to be using Wi-Fi if you make a call.  And you can turn that off, but I've used it.  The Wi-Fi calling is fun.  And yes, seamless means that if I'm on a Wi-Fi call and I get in the car and I tried this and  I drive away, there's a handoff to the cell network and I continue the call without any interruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To me, that's one of the biggest advantages for people who have challenging coverage areas,  especially in the house.  You basically have a triple network there between Sprint, T-Mobile and your own Wi-Fi.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and if you were in an area that had good Sprint, but not a good T-Mobile,  but then you work in an area where it's flipped, this would be a good choice for you.  I think that the data billing, while not necessarily saving you money, is sensible.  And if you use tethering, I think this is a good deal for tethering.  You don't have to pay extra for tethering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have to ask, I mean, we talked about this just before the show.  It seems to me that Google had a great thing with Google Voice and it's dying a slow, painful death.  It's ignored it.  I don't understand why.  And I also don't understand why they couldn't integrate it better into this offering,  because now you're losing features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, remember there was always the rumor that they were going to kill Google Voice.  Like for the last year, people kept saying with the merging of Hangouts and text messaging and all of that,  that that was the end of voice.  Maybe this really is the beginning of the end for voice.  It's not the end of the world for me, I know, but I kind of liked having different answering messages for different people.  I do like the screening that I guess that's gone.  And forwarding looks more like how you would forward your cell phone,  except that you could forward to multiple numbers.  It doesn't have that kind of additional feeling of like I can use different phones and so forth.  And this phone now has my Google Voice number.  That's the Google Voice phone that's attached out of that SIM, which is also a change.  So I think probably if you decide to go with Fi, and I think Fi is probably a good choice,  if T-Mobile and Sprinter are good in your neck of the woods,  you probably would want to get a new number and continue to, I think you could continue to use Google Voice,  have it call that number, right?  Yeah, you could you can use Fi just like any other carrier number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing they suggest, maybe you guys have an answer for that.  They suggest you use the Google Messages app, not Hangouts for your text messaging.  That's so dumb. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, one of the best parts of Hangouts is getting, or I mean, Google Voice is getting,  you know, your text messages on every single computer on earth.  So how does that work?  When you don't use Hangouts?  Right. Well, I think it still does it, which is really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I started using Messages as my default text messaging, and I still it acted as if it was Google Voice.  Do you know what I'm saying?  So the text messages to the Google Voice number would end up being like Hangouts go to everyone.  I wonder if you would get duplicate messages then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I went back to Hangouts. I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just very, it's very disorganized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very disorganized.  And there's, you know, there's different groups that kind of have the same idea of let's do something  different with your phone number, but they're separate and they don't work together.  And it's very Google-y to do things that way.  They always like to make multiples of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So why are they doing Project Phi? What's in it for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would hope it's like the Google Fiber plan where it's like, let's,  it might have started out that way where it was like, let's go be this internet service provider  and we'll do things so differently that the competition will have to change.  But I think Phi at some point got watered down more and more and more from, you know,  MVNO rules and everything else that it just kind of turned into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of a me too cell carrier. I don't, it's not vastly differentiated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure they started with a very ambitious plan and it just never made it  through however many committees to get here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right, Ron. And, you know, Google has tried to upend the carrier market  for some time. They started with the Nexus One and the plans have never worked out to,  I think, what Google envisioned. And I don't think they're going to drive much change by doing this.  So I'm a little lost on why they're really doing Phi, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The one thing that kind of backs up your thought, Ron, that the MVNO deals  might have been what diluted this, is that they want you to use Messenger or whatever it's called  instead of Hangouts for your text messaging. Because Hangouts, I don't think ever uses,  or no, I guess it can use SMS, can't it? Yeah, yeah, they integrated that.  But Messenger is all SMS. Right.  Does it ever use data? No.  So I wonder if the carriers are saying, we want you to use, I don't know, why would they care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you might end up with like a weird message duplication thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not going to take a chance. So I made my default SMS at the Hangouts.  And I haven't had any problem. It works fine.  Well, there you go. There's a kind of a mini review of Project Phi. I mean,  can't say anything negative about it. I've been using T-Mobile anyway, so it's exactly the same.  Speeds are the same. Everything's the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you were Larry Page, you would demand 10x thinking. And this is definitely not like a 10x thing.  No, this is like 0.125 thinking. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just doesn't seem anything compelling. And yet Ron and I still want an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do, don't you? It's scarcity, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we're probably just completionists. Like this thing came out, we need to try it.  It doesn't matter if it's good or not. It is our job, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Right now, you have to have a Nexus 6,  either buy one if you don't have one or have one. And I was intrigued, Ron, that you say there's a  special build for this because they know and nowhere do they mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, sure. You probably should get an OTA. I mean, the Nexus devices.  You think I'll get an OTA? Oh.  Yeah. The Nexus devices have special carrier builds for all sorts of stuff. I've got the  page open. There's okay, there's T-Mobile and then there's all carriers except T-Mobile.  And then there's Project Phi only. So I'm going to guess because they have the special thing for  T-Mobile. It is like Wi-Fi calling or something. I already had it because I was using this with  T-Mobile. Yeah, but there's a different build for Project Phi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should I go out and get it? How do I get it? It would be such a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have to root it in everything, do I? You'd have to unlock your phone and flash

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the new system image. Presumably, they'll send me the new image

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at some point. And we could get the image if we have a Nexus 6. Ron, you have a Nexus, right?  Yeah. But without the SIM,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's kind of useless. The other thing that's kind of scary,  if I go to voice.google.com, it redirects me to Project Phi. So that's it. You're done. See ya.  So don't do that. And now I have to do it again. I have to try again because now I have to see what

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  happens if you don't kill your phone. The actual Google Voice site, the desktop  website is like a horror show now. Half of it is consumed by Hangouts. And it's like,  leave and go try Hangouts. And then the other half of it is Google Voice. And it's a big,  weird mess. It still works if you toggle all your settings right. It's just super ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually up for me right now and it does not redirect me to Project Phi. So,  Leo, I think they voted you off the island. I'm voted off the island. I'm gone. I'm history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because I agreed to have my Google Voice number ported. Now it ported for me in about an  hour. But I've heard from some people that say it hasn't ported for them for days, which means,  well, Alan Tepper, who sent me an email, said it's been several days he hasn't been able to use his  phone for anything but Wi-Fi. So that's something to keep in mind if you're going to... In fact,  don't port your Google Voice number in any respect. It's a bad idea all around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they alluded to that too, but they really haven't been very clear on what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Obviously, we're finding out now. They're stuck though. They can't kill Phi. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people bought phones to use Phi. They're stuck. Yeah, I guess so. I mean, you don't see too many  MVNOs go out of business. They tend to get bought. It's assumed. Yeah, nobody's going to buy it from  Google. They're always going to buy a hybrid network MVNO. Google has announced its second

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  quarter 2015 earning results. This was last Friday. It feels like old news now, but it's been since  we last gathered for this week in Google. And the stock market celebrated on Friday. I saw a huge  bump in the value of Google. I think it went up more than $60 billion, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was the largest, wasn't it like the largest stock market game by any company ever for like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a day? In a single day. Stunning. And it was only an 8% growth. It just shows you how big Google  is. Revenue is $17.7 billion. That's 11% growth year over year.  I guess I should talk about profits if I could figure out where profits are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google profits are so boring because it's always like people either clicked on ads or they didn't.  You do Apple earnings and it's like we sold this many products and that's useful. But this is just  like whether or not people clicked on ads. I think the reason the market was encouraged,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of course, was that it showed that Google just after a long period of decline in the cost per  click and troubles with mobile monetization showed that they were doing okay, that they'd figured it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  out. Yeah, they did better at mobile ads and people are watching a lot more YouTube. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it was basically the YouTube was the big story, right? 40 minutes per viewer per day. And everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  loves video ads. So we can go back to the team format. Can't get enough of them video ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, the other interesting stat was that Google was happy to grow is that YouTube is bigger in the  very valuable 18 to 49 age group than any other cable channel. So  bigger than ESPN, bigger than CNN. It is as big as a big cable channel.  Let's see. Revenues, Google number websites, total advertising revenue is up 11% year over year,  3% quarter to quarter. So that's good. That's what you want to see growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did see a story last week related to this that Google is being more cautious in how many people  it's actually bringing on as new hires. And I'm looking here and it does show the headcount,  obviously went up, but they're trying to do some, it looks like expense management now more so than  they ever did before. I think it was in the New York Times, that article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that would be prudent even when the market's going well, when things are going well,  to not over hire. The current headcount is 57,148. That's up almost 10,000 from this time last year.  So they've been growing at a torrid rate. Other little tidbits. If the euro weren't so damn weak,  they would have made $1.1 billion more. The foreign exchange rate, had foreign exchange  rates remain constant from the second quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015,  our revenues in the second quarter would have been a billion, 1.1 billion higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks, Grease. Thank you, Grease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you get to this size, it's amazing. An 8% growth means $60 billion in market value.  I mean, Grease collapses and billions of dollars it's costing us in exchange rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The $60 billion thing, it's like Uber is like $40 or $50 billion.  Right. It gained more than an Uber, like two Ubers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good way to put it. Are they back down? Because Apple was going up, up, up until Apple  announced that it only made lots of money last quarter and then they were stock tanked.  The stock market is so strange. I presume your employers, certainly my employer, don't allow you  to buy tech stocks. We can just watch on the sidelines. Thank God. Here's a list from Business  Insider of companies complaining to the EU about how well Google is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The sour grape squab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The sour grape squab. We're so angry. AppNexus and OpenX have asked, I don't even know if you've  heard of them, have asked European regulators to investigate Google's dominance according to  the Financial Times. They went to the European Commission and said, well, angry, well mad.  Apparently, they're, I should go to the, unfortunately the FT is behind a paywall.  So I have to read other people's, yeah, see. So these are, these are ad networks over? Yeah,  European ad networks. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Rupert. Can't read the article.  Let's take a break. Come back with more. Google Plus is losing the photos. We can explain what  that all means. They've now got a plugin for Microsoft Office that means you can even be  less dependent on Microsoft than ever before. And Microsoft says, yeah. And we'll talk about  Eddie Stone. Actually, I'm really interested what you guys think about Google's beacons.  We try to, we try to understand a little bit better on Sunday on Twitter, but I want to hear  the experts weigh in on this. Our show today brought to you by a company that'll help you be  expert. Lynda.com. 3,700 on-demand video courses in every area. Things like  um, business skills, like negotiation and resume building, uh, how to use productivity skills,  how to use Word, Office, Excel, photography, Photoshop, your hobby, uh, courses on SEO,  SEO tools, fundamentals, the universal principles of design. See, I'd love to take that.  Google Drive essential training. There's also essential training for Eclipse. If you use that  ID, there's a lot of great stuff at lynda.com. All of Lynda.com's courses are taught by smart people,  people who work in the field, but they're also excellent teachers.  The videos have written transcripts so you can search the transcript for a particular part of  the video. That's kind of nice too. They're kind of broken up in a way that you can do a little bit  at a time or a lot of the time. He goes beginning to end like a, like a traditional course, but it's  better than a traditional course because you can also just read or go through one chapter or one  segment, polish up one skill in Photoshop, lots of programming stuff. This is a, this is a course  on C. Everybody's just for fun. Should learn C, C essential training. I love it. You can download  those tutorials too and watch them on the go on your iOS or Android device. They've got apps for  every platform. Create playlists of courses you want to watch, take notes. They're stored on the  site. So you've got them wherever you go. LYNDA.com. I think the best thing to do, try it free for 10  days. 10 days, the run of the place. Every single one of those videos accessed easily, simply 3,707  courses, more than a hundred thousand tutorials. The price is right when you buy, but this is free  for 10 days. Linda, LYNDA.com slash twig, twig, linda.com. We love them. You will too.  Let's talk beacons. Apple made a lot of, hey, it was more than a year ago when they announced  that all along they'd been building in this beacon technology to iOS. And the fact, every iOS device  was both a sender and a receiver of beacons. And yet nothing really seemed to have happened.  There was a lot of talk about how my people might put iBeacons in stores. I guess some ballparks  have iBeacons. You wrote an article, Ron, on Ars Technica about Google's response to this,  which was just announced. It's an open source version of iBeacon called Eddystone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So Eddystone, I guess you would say is going to do better than iBeacon because it's open source  and a lot more flexible. So when Apple did iBeacon, they wanted to make it like a differentiator for  iOS. But when you're trying to sell this to companies that don't care and just want to reach  everybody, like if you're a store in the mall and you want to send coupons to people, you don't care  about just iOS. You want to reach all of your customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If half of your customers are using Android phones, that's not going to do you any good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. Right. And some people tried to come up with hacks to make this work on Android,  but it's not officially supported. And Apple actually went to some of these people and said,  hey, you're an iBeacon partner, so don't put it on Android or we will cut off your partnership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. So Google had to do this if they wanted to play in this game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, there were like, there's one other open source speaking standard, I think, but you  know, this one's going to have Google's backing. So it's going to be built into Android and they'll  have a version for iOS. So the cross-platform thing is going to be a big deal for all the companies  that you actually need to adopt this for it to be useful. Besides being open, how is Eddystone  different? iBeacon needs an app to work. So basically, you know, Apple's motto has always  been there's an app for that. So in order to use iBeacon, you need it to happen. If you're like  a big Starbucks customer and you go there all the time, that's fine. You'll have the Starbucks app.  But if you walk up to like a Coke machine and just want to buy a Coke or something,  you don't want to have to install an app just to do this one thing. So Eddystone will do the app  stuff and then it adds a couple different other modes to make this more useful for everybody.  So there's one that will work with a website. So basically, you know, the beacon pops out and  says, hey, here's a web link for like this soda machine or parking meter or whatever. And you go  there and you can, you know, pay for stuff or see a coupon or whatever. And there's a lot less  friction there because you don't need to install an app. There's another mode that's really  interesting that's for like personal use, where you'll be able to have a beacon that only you can  read. And you'll be able to like attach it to your keys or your luggage and it'll be able to find  interesting. So it's kind of like the Motorola key link, but like a standardization of that.  And then the fourth mode is for people that have to manage all of these beacons. There'll be a way  for them to just kind of walk around and get battery information and where these things are  and just kind of an easy way to throw together like a status board of what all your beacons are  doing right now. Because that was Google said they went out and talked to a bunch of beacon  ecosystem people. And that was one of the features that they really asked for just an easy way. When  you have 50 million of these things, like an easy way to manage them and see what they're doing.  So with the four different modes, it should be a little more useful and widely adopted than iBeacon.  But the big questions are what happens for spam? Like if you just set one of these things up and  it directs you to like a horrible website full of viruses. For iBeacon, because this was all managed  by applications. If a beacon is doing something bad, you can easily blame it on that app, uninstall  the app, it stops detecting the beacon. But Google's going to build like an operating system level  beacon detector that goes out and finds everything and gives you like a list. And that doesn't have  any traffic control on it that we've heard about. So that's risky. We don't have the full picture  yet. I mean, it's really not totally out yet to play with. But yeah, it'll be weird for somebody,  you know, your phone is just going to pick up all this stuff. It's only when you say, show me.  You have to enable it. Yeah. Yeah. You like kind of, it's kind of like searching for Bluetooth

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  devices. Why would I, what are the benefits to an end user? Why would I enable it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've wanted this for a long time and I can tell you why. Why? Well, because I want presence in my  house. I want to walk into a room and have the lights go on without using some other sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You well, okay. So this is the other use of it, which is your device is a beacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not merely a recipient. It's a sender. Right. Well, it's, you can do that for like a weird  testing mode. But for the most part, no, it's just one way. See, Apple's does do that. That's something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that iBeacon does do. And in fact, that was the kind of the revelation two years ago, when Apple  announced iBeacon is, you know, we've been building this in and oh, by the way, your phone  and your iPad are beacons. So it could, it could do what you want to do, Kevin, which is you walk  into a room and a picture comes up or your music changes or whatever. But that's Apple. It's one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  way, but it serves to kick you out to a two way communication system. So you like, you'll get  booted into an app or a webpage or something, and then you'll be able to, to do the two way talking  because it's a low power Bluetooth device. They don't want the actual device to do too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  communication. So Kevin can have a little beacon in his room, some sort of device that's in his,  in a room. He walks into the room, the beacon says hello to his phone, a conversation begins,  and then the phone can say, I like the Beatles. Yeah, the beacons have, the beacons have IDs,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  basically like big long numbers that are like unique to them. So all the beacons really ever  say is, hi, I'm beacon one, two, three, four, five. And then your phone on Eddie Stone, at least goes  up to the cloud. And Google has a big database up there that says a beacon one, two, three, four,  five is this it's in this location. It wants you to go to this webpage or open this app or do  something. So, so you see the beacon, you go up to the cloud and you get all this like metadata

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  around the beacon that you have to set up. So I understand how it would work at a zoo.  Or a museum, you walk in front of a painting. And then your phone, if you're listening in the  earbuds, we'll start playing it commentary. That makes sense. I can see a store you get near the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Levi's display that can pop up a coupon. Right. I mean, part of it is like, it kind of works like  a QR code would right where, yeah, where it's just here's a way to jump to the internet and get this.  But you know, you don't need a QR code scanner. And you don't need to physically, you know,  know where the QR code is. It's like a QR code that comes to you. And then yeah, just GPS isn't  that accurate. So these give you like a super accurate way to say I am here. I am at this bus  stop. I'm not in the restaurant behind the bus stop or the bus stop on the other side of the street.  I'm right here. And what can you do for me now? It's been out for two years. It doesn't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  maybe I'm just going to the wrong zoos. It doesn't seem like I see a lot of eye beacon stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of the ballparks, I think put it in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Something tells me you could wander

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  into an Apple store and they would have I'm sure they're using it. I'm sure. But that's one of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  problems is unless there's a big sign that says please install this app and turn it on. You would

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  know there's there's a physical app. There's a physical Apple store app now. Right. And I guess  you would need that to get the beacon like you need to know what app you need to get the beacon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on. I beacon. Right. Which is weird. But OK. The other problem I think Apple came up against is  that they announced this two years ago and then like a month later, Edward Snowden's revelations  started trickling out and people said, yeah, maybe this isn't such a good idea.  We don't want to be announced everywhere we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, securities or privacy is weird because the beacons could potentially track your Bluetooth  ID and say, right, do the idea was here. You're broadcasting your unique identifier constantly.  Yeah, I think I'd be can has stuff. I think I'd be can have stuff to stop that. I haven't heard  about it for Eddie Stone. That doesn't mean it doesn't just I haven't heard about it. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't it Qualcomm that tried this right after Apple did was the gimbal platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but gimbal wasn't gimbal compatible with Apple's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was. I thought it was cross platform. I could be wrong with that. Yeah.  But that hasn't gone anywhere either that I know of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like the real problem that everybody wants to do this is facing is this notion of privacy.  And I don't want to announce my presence and the fear that a lot of people have  that this will be solely used to sell them stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, so is the Internet. Welcome to the Internet.  You go to. Yeah, every page you go to is an advertisement. But no, some of it,  just information, you know, mass transit information, bus stop, subways, all that would  be useful, you know, to be able to buy stuff easier, buy a Coke in a stadium without having  to go anywhere and have it delivered to your seat or stuff like that. It's neat. I mean,  it's neat to be able to just kind of get a web page that knows where you are and what you're in  front of. And people can do stuff with that. It's you know, I'm sure it could be used for good or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  evil. You mentioned that one of the resistance resistances companies had to dealing with  Apple's eye beacon is this platform exclusiveness. Are more people interested now in any stone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because it's open? Google launched with a bunch of hardware partners. So I mean,  I it's mostly a question of if businesses will be interested in it. So I don't know,  you'd have to sell it to them. But I talked to some of the hardware guys and they're like,  yeah, we could build beacons that have I beacon and Eddie stone in it. And you can just get this  one little box. It'll do both. They won't do both at the same time. You'd have to like switch modes.  Oh, that's no good. But I mean, I assume businesses would like it now that it's cross platform. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so can I put Eddie Stone on an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As a developer, you can make an iPhone Eddie Stone aware on, you know, Google has access  to the Android operating system. So it will be built into the operating system. They don't have  access to iOS. So it will just be at the app level. I guess it would work in that way. It would work  a little more like how I beacon does where you have this one app that is Eddie Stone aware. And  oh, they they wanted to build it into Chrome, I think the physical web stuff at least,  which is kind of like the web page portion of this. So yeah, if Google goes and like  Trojan horses it into some popular app they have, that could work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Google Now would be the one, right? And certainly on Android, it makes sense. And you  point this out in the article that beacons don't have to buzz or alert you. They could just give

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you a Google Now card. Yeah, yeah. And Google says they have a couple implementations right now of  beacon stuff. So Google Maps will use it to suck down real time transit information of the transit  thing you're standing in front of. And you can use it for better location. And what else? Yeah,  Google Now would use it for better location for cards. So you know, it would know you're in the  restaurant and not at the bus stop and all that. Just super accurate location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I presume the Google app on iOS would take advantage of it as well. I mean, that's  Yeah, Google search. Sure. Yeah. And then now cards show up there. So  in fact, Google Now has cards to show you where you parked but it's using GPS. I think beacons  might be useful for that. If I'm just trying to think of uses. And the thing is, I just haven't  seen a lot of people adopting it. Maybe this will make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I'm ahead of the curve on the smart home thing. So wait a minute, you have beacons in your  house? I would love beacons in my house. But you haven't done it yet. I haven't done it yet. I was  looking at Estimote, I think makes them. I was looking at some beacons, but haven't done it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I see your echo over your left shoulder. You'd have Alexa say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, Kevin. Would you like your news briefing now? Alexa, office on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have. Oh, is that hue you're using for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I'm using the lower costing Wink Hub.  Ah, yeah, Wink's supposed to work well. Alexa, office off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it just turns the light on and off. Doesn't do anything else. The bed doesn't start rotating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get very white music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have Nest and SmartThings and a couple door locks and stuff. And I don't see why they all  can't just use Wi-Fi for my location. Like when I connect to my home Wi-Fi, unlock the doors,  turn the air conditioning on. Like that should tell it that I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quickset uses Bluetooth LA, right? That's how the Quicksets work, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Quicksets? The Quickset locks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or no. I don't know.  They might use Zigbee. No, no, mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They use Zigbee? Yeah, Z-Wave.  Z-Wave. Yeah, the smart home stuff is the SmartThings.  SmartThings will do both, but yeah, I think all my stuff is Z-Wave.  Which is just to communicate to the thing. But you talk to the hub and then it unlocks everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the other use for beaconing is Internet of Things kind of stuff like this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like home automation and so forth. I would hope so. I mean, I think it's more that these  Internet of Things companies aren't very good. Like even Nest, you would think that would use  Wi-Fi. Because I sit in front of this computer and the thermostat's over there, I'll have my  thing kick in the auto away when I'm here, when my phone's here, and it just doesn't use GPS,  it doesn't use Wi-Fi. Why doesn't it do that? Just because they have not decided to implement it and  there's not much competition and it's just not refined, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They either need sensors to be reading where you are in your house or we need a beacon  implementation to be put together with us. So Google had already announced Weave,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is their Internet of Things protocol. Does this integrate with Weave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nope. No. Oh man, there's so many things going on now. There's no way I'm rattling this off the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  top of my head. I'm looking at your article and I still don't understand. You got Weave, you got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thread. Thread is like Zigbee Z-Wave, it's a protocol. Right. Thread is in actual bits through

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the air wireless communication protocol. Eddystone is over Bluetooth, it's a form of communication.  Weave uses, Weave is a, would you call it a protocol? I guess it's a format that goes over  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. So Weave is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, Eddystone is Bluetooth, Thread is a  totally different thing all of its own. The physical web is kind of like the URL portion of  Eddystone. They're just kind of like overlapping. And then there's Brillo, which is an Android-based  Internet of Things operating system that will save like door lock manufacturers. And they wonder why

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nobody is doing this. Yeah, no, it's impossible. Every company though, I mean Microsoft, Apple,  Google, they all want to do this stuff. They've all made big initiatives. There's HomeKit on Apple.  There's all these things from Google. A, why do they want to be in this? Is it that consumers are  demanding it? Why isn't it taking off? It just seems like we've still got that kind of tower of  babble with all these different interactive protocols that don't interoperate. And it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  seems like a mess. I think the best way to think of Google is not as a single company with a  direction, but rather a bunch of different companies that are all under the Google banner.  So like, if you look at that list, Brillo is from the Android team. That's the Android guy's idea  of what the Internet of Things should be like. Weave and Thread are from Nest. That's their idea  of what the Internet of Things should be like. These guys don't really talk to each other all  that often. Google's happy to let them compete and have the best team win. They're never worried

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about unification, really. And see, this goes back to the whole Nest purchase. I mean, $3.2 billion  just to get a smart thermostat and smart smoke detectors. I mean, I would have thought that group  would have brought the platform to get these things to communicate. And they're not even working on  the Brillo and the Weave stuff, as far as I know. Nest bought Revolve, which was a smart home hub  company. They had every radio that you could think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's really the future of smart homes. I think you make a lock that can lock and unlock  over the Internet. That's fine. You're done. You don't need to upgrade that lock. But the smart  home hub is something that you would want to upgrade that would get new software, new interfaces,  things like that. Because right now, the problem with all this is the interface.  Nobody really knows whether it should be like a dashboard full of toggles or something that  happens automatically as you kind of come and go. That's the part that needs to get figured out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a video Adrian gave us in the chat room. I think this is a Dutch commercial of why you  don't really want a smart home. Some bad guys coming up to the gate, which what? Opens? They  were about to climb over it. They're a little puzzled. They go up to the front door and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it unlocks. They walk in. They even as they walk by various items in the house, like a  painting that lights up, they go, oh, I guess I'll take this Rauschenberg there. Just put that in a  bag and there's the automatic vacuum cleaner. The fireplaces come on in the TV.  It turns out that this guy who owns this house is on stage doing a demo of how his home automation  system can. I don't know what even the apple door means, but that's great. Isn't that great?  Little Dutch humor to tell you why home automation isn't all it's cracked up to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Smart things can control my door locks and that uses Google's fuse location provider,  which combines like wifi and GPS and all that to know where you are and unlock the doors when you  show up. But Google's location thing does not know about wifi hotspots. I brought the wifi hotspot  with me to New York City. I'm in New Jersey and connected to the wifi hotspot and it came on and  said, oh, you've arrived at home because you can use and my door's unlocked when I was like,  that ad is not far off. No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a mess. And you know, we're all early adopters, so we play with all this stuff and  smart things is an advertiser. I guess I should give that disclaimer. They seem like though they  have figured out the idea that you've got to have everything, talk to everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, the hubs are definitely necessary. It's cool. It's cool what it does. It's just,  you know, there's bugs to work out and stuff to think about, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do Apple, Microsoft and Google all want to get in this business?  Do they see this as being a very big business at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What kind of data are they really getting? I mean, they can already get location data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, people assumed when they bought Nest that Google was going to kind of watch,  somehow be watching you through your thermostat. They don't think they care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's like you have a smartphone. There is pretty much no worse privacy violating  thing if somebody wanted to be evil. You got Android. We don't need Nest.  But no, I mean, it's software and they just want to jump on it and they make software. That's it.  I guess it's a way to make money. I don't know. Well, I think maybe you hit the nail on the head

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  when you said you can't think of Google as a monolithic company. It's not one company. It's  just a bunch of people doing something they're interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm sure when you work at Google and have tons of money to burn on this stuff, I'm sure you're  like, boy, I sure wish my house would just unlock when I show up and the lights turn on and it plays  me a song. And Google's like, we'll pay you to work on that. Go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think some of this is that people like us geeks and engineers are scratching their own itch,  even though no normal human has any interest in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God. Yeah, this would be impossible to set up for a normal person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More work than it's worth. It's not so hard to stick a key in a door lock and open your door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did a do-it-yourself home automation type system back in 2010 using Insteon,  which at the time I thought was the best solution. I got it working. I mean, I could get my garage  door to remotely open and close. I had webcams that I could access. My lights would go on and  off, you know, time to the daylight, sunrise, sunset, and so on. But, you know, the average  person would have never gone through what I went through to make it all work, nor spent the money

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at that time to build it. It's like building a model railroad. It's a specialty act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And the centralization that they want to push is kind of weird. Like I was looking into a  light switch solution. Like Kevin just, you know, said some command to his Amazon box and his lights  turned off. And I'm like, for real, like my hallway and bathrooms, the best smart light thing is just  a motion detector hooked up to the light switch. You just screw into the wall and it's done.  You walk into the hallway. We've had those for years. Right. And it's like, you don't need an  internet connection or some hub or whatever. And that's like one of the best things that I've  installed because it just works and it's there and it's fine and it's simple. And a normal person

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  could do that. Just get the clapper. My old house had the nest installed. I had Hue lights. I did a  lot of that stuff. And the telling thing is when I moved, I didn't install it again at all. The Hue  light bulbs are in a box. The nest is just in a box. It's just, I did suppose that was nice. It was  fun. You know what I did install? I'm going to do, we're going to do an ad. Are you ready for,  oh, for a smart device? This is kind of like the thing that you mentioned in the bathroom  and that just, you come in, the lights come on. This is really what you need. This is the ring  doorbell. And I love it because it's got a camera. It's very easy to install. In fact,  this is, this is how everything should be. It comes with everything you need to install it,  including drill bits, screws. There's even a level in here and all of this. It's very simple to do.  I installed it myself and I am the farthest thing from a handyman. If you've got a wired doorbell,  you just take the wired leads and it's ready to go. But this also has a lithium-ion battery  that you could charge via USB that lasts a year. So you unclip it, charge it, clip it back on,  and it lasts a year. It's a normal doorbell. It'll ring your doorbell and everything. But when you do  that, the camera comes on and let me show you actually, I have it on my phone. And you can,  I can, I can, now it doesn't unlock the door and I kind of like that.  We're not talking about unlocking the door. We're just merely talking about  seeing who's at the door and talking to them. You can hear them. They can hear you. Here's my ring  doorbell app. You can have multiple doorbells attached to a single door. So here's somebody  rang our doorbell last night at 653. This is the other thing. Now you don't have to do this.  They get a free month or something, but seriously, there's somebody in my doorbell. Oh yeah, he  brought the Chinese food. So, so I could talk to him. He could talk to me, but for a security  point of view, this is also awesome because it has a motion detector. So I can see when motion  happened, not only missed doorbell calls, but when motion happened and go back and look at those  videos, it turns out when bad guys rob your house, they almost always ring the doorbell first to see  if you're there. Right. So it's really kind of amazing what you get. This is ring.  About 95% of all home break-ins happen during the day. And it almost always starts with ringing the  doorbell with the ring doorbell. You can see and talk to anyone at your door from anywhere in the  world. So when somebody rings my doorbell, this has been very useful. The UPS guy comes and I  can say, yeah, just leave it there. I'm in the shower, even though I'm at work. Rings motion  detector will alert you. By the way, you can set it for sensitivity. So initially I had a real  sensitive is picking up all this stuff. I turned it down until it was just right. So it was just  people on my porch. It's kind of like caller ID on your home. It is easy to install. Now I'm a  nitwit and took me about half an hour, but I think anybody knows what they're doing is going to be  able to install it very quickly. Time magazine named the ring video doorbell, one of the top 10  gadgets last year. And I'm going to get you 25 bucks off 174 bucks when you go to ring.com slash  twig. Do not be intimidated. This is easy to install. It uses your wifi. Once the wifi is set  up, there's nothing more to do. It's painless. Having done a bunch of this stuff, as I said,  this is the one that I'm keeping with me. In fact, we're going to put one out on the back door,  on the front door of the office. And you can have multiple rings in a single app on your phone.  Ring.com slash twig. And I've talked to a number of people who have installed it since we started  doing the ads and they to a person say, yeah, it was easy. Yeah, I love it. Ring.com slash twig.  Now that's home automation. It's not really automation, but it's just nice to be able to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  look out and see who's at your door. Yeah, that is definitely a solution I've wanted. Who was  ringing my doorbell and why? Yeah. Yeah. We had a doorbell we'd never hear. So I mean, it would

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ring and I would never know. But now that not only is the doorbell ringing, my phones ring and I have  ring on all of my devices. So you don't miss it. When somebody comes to my doorbell, the house lights  up. That's cool. I know. I love it. Google did hire the execs from Homejoy. Homejoy shuttered  its doors. This is another new business for Google. What is Homejoy? Besides the name,  professional house cleaning services. They closed their doors July 31st and then it was announced  that Google had hired most of the team. So the idea is you use a smartphone app. Oh, Robert  Scoble likes it. It must be good. Use a smartphone app to schedule cleaners. It's an interesting  idea. Google has hired the team. I guess I don't know. They're not taking over the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. What would the sales pitch be Uber for people that will come and clean your house?  Uber for maids. Yeah. I don't know that this is an indication that Google is getting into that  market. They might just be good programmers. Yeah. They do aqua hire sometimes where they buy the  company and the patent and the people behind it and all that. But this is a company that closed  down and went out of business. And yeah, they could have just as easily said, hey, some engineers,  let's hire some engineers and not care at all about the idea. Because I mean,  it doesn't make much sense for them to do this. It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  According to recode, Homejoy went out of business kind of independently. They had classified

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  employees as contract workers. Right. And with all these legal problems, why would you mess with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But Google did hire 20 people from the product and engineering team. So  you got to wonder if there's something similar that Google wants to do. There are other companies  who do this handy and thumbtack. Who was it was having a horrible. Oh, when it was at Christmas  Sina, I think it was Christmas Sina had hired handy and then they didn't show up or something  and he couldn't cancel them very easily. So then he used one of those services you use via text

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  message to cancel handy like TaskRabbit or something. Yeah, it wasn't. It was somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like TaskRabbit. I was watching this all play out on Twitter and I thought, Chris, you live in the  future. It's like what? Anyway, Amazon is also launching an online portal for home services.  So this is maybe this is a business. Speaking of Amazon, have you used jet?  It it's it's here. Just launched. I don't know how this is a business, to be honest with you.  They want to go up against Amazon created by the guy. Tony, was it Tony Lors and his name who  created diapers dot com? You remember the sad saga of diapers dot com? Huh?  Not socks saga of diapers dot com. You wouldn't think I'd have a heckler here, but I guess anyway,  that was that was the diapers serve diapers by mail, you know, Pampers by mail store and Bezos  targeted it, undercut it, put it out of business, then bought it.  Very famously, and Tony Lour, who was the founder, I guess is maybe trying to get back at  Bezos with a new service called Jet. There's been a lot of attention to this. They've raised a lot  of money. Obviously, the market's very interested in an Amazon competitor. They'd like to get in  early on this one. But it's a club. You have to pay 50 bucks ahead of time. So you don't need an  invite now because you know, they just went out of invite yesterday. Okay. Okay. The problem is,  at least during the beta, they don't have any distribution. So they have few distribution  centers and they don't have many distributor deals. So this is going to take forever to ship.  Yes, a big and it's a big money loser because they have to buy the product and then ship it to you.  So I don't know. Seems like Amazon kind of owns this market, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Prime's fast shipping just makes me go. I could go to the store or I could just press this  button and it will just show up. Yes. And you know, when you're a lazy tech journalist who  works from home, you're just kind of, I'll just stay here, be a hermit, click. I find even stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  stuff now. I don't go out and buy. I just have it shipped to me. Yeah. Plus even with, even if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  don't have Prime. Paper clips, staplers. Yeah, little stuff. Little stupid stuff. Even if you  don't have Prime, you can usually get the best price on Amazon. I'm looking here at the Wall  Street Journal's article on Jet and they said. It's not even the best price. Yeah. I mean,  it costs Jet twice as much as it charged the customer for the 12 items in the particular order.  I mean, loss leader is one thing, but you know, how long can you do that? Not very long. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why they keep having to go to the market and getting more money, right? Good luck. Yeah.  Yeah. You know, I would love to see some competition for Amazon, but it's a,  there are some businesses where it's hard to beat an incumbent.  Google's one, right? Search and search ads. And Amazon's another, it seems like Amazon really,  unless you picked an itch and you saw what happened with diapers.com. He thought, oh,  I can beat Amazon because I can beat them on one thing, diapers. And Amazon said not so fast.  Club price savings of pretty much anything you buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I can. More expensive and slower than Amazon. Sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where do I sign up? You got it. Yeah. Somebody did some research and said some of the prices were  lower than Amazon. Some were not. But the real deal is if you've got Prime, and I presume anybody  who would be looking at this service, Jet would be a Prime member. You're just going to use Prime.  Yeah. Pre shipping over 35 bucks, they say free returns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you don't have Prime and you're not an Amazon person, that's fine. But I would think there's  club pricing available through Sam's Club or CostCo and such. And they usually beat other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people's prices as well. Amazon was smart. They didn't call it a club. It was just two day,  free two day shipping. And it's twice as much. It's a hundred bucks now. But they have so many  other features of it. And if you use Amazon, it's such a, it's in hindsight, such a brilliant  thing, Prime, because you get people to pay you to be locked in customers. I give them a hundred  bucks to get locked in. Yeah. But it's better than that because I get something. It's a good  membership card. It's a good membership card. All right. What else? Oh, I haven't got it yet.  Have you got timeline in your, in Google Maps yet? Yeah. Yeah. On the, well, right on the Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  app, you can just download it from, you know. Oh, you have to, you have to download a new,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  okay, Ron, you tell me now, you're this, you're the expert on Android. Cause I've been waiting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for it to be updated in the store. It should come automatically through the store. But no,  Android police runs a lovely site called APK mirror where you can just go and everybody,  it's like crowd sourced uploads of APKs. You can just go there and download it.  It's being staged then. Yeah. It's Google Maps 9.12, which is where you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't have it yet on my Nexus 6, but Jason, my, or Jason Kleanthes, our producer does,  let me, let me go back. Let me, let me go back and show it. So when you hit the hamburger,  you now have an addition to your places and traffic and you know, you pick which map you want  your timeline. Whoops. And it shows you, oh, this is cool. All the places you've been,  you haven't been many places, Jason. So that's today. Oh, I could pick it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Swipe left and right on the card at the bottom. And this is, so I don't know what's happening now.  Just tap on the screen. Okay. Tap on the white part at the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could pick different dates. Oh, this is what was in your dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. The, the desktop site updated to, for me it updated today and it looks,  it looks beautiful. It's, it's really cool. Oh, let me look at that. Is that maps.google.com?  Yeah, there's a URL for it. We'll just search Google location history and it should show up.  There was some fancy URL that got me. I've always loved that. Because it, you could go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  let's see, let me just search it. Google location history. Turn location history offer on maps.google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be the first link. Yeah, it's maps.google.com slash

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  location history is what it is. Yeah, that sounds right.  And then you can play it back too, which is fun. So I just got back from Europe,  which it should show me my whole trip, right? Yeah. So, so there was an old version online

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and there's a new version that kind of looks like material design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, here it is. Trip to Amsterdam. So there's actually a button I can click that says trip to  Amsterdam, Germany, Vienna, and one other country. And I can just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it pulls in your photos. How cool is that? Oh, no, really?  Very nice. Yeah, there you go. There's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my gosh. That's awesome. So let me see. How do I, oh, there's, I flew to the airport  and then I got in the boat. Now. Okay. But it is confused. So this happens to me a lot. So the boat  has Wi-Fi and the boat's Wi-Fi thinks it's in Amsterdam. So you see all these trips back and  forth. I'm making the Amsterdam. I'm going back and forth to Amsterdam in a matter of seconds,  all the time, because every time I switched to the boat's Wi-Fi, it suddenly thinks,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  oh, let's go back to Amsterdam. That's the exact same thing that happened to my smartphone thing,  where you connect to your Wi-Fi and it's like, oh, you're at home. Because Google builds this  database of Wi-Fi hotspots. It tries to find out where the location is, but they don't know about  mobile hotspots. It's just all hotspots are stationary. And last time we had GPS, we pinged  this one and it was here. You got to fix this, Google. This is crazy. But yeah, you'll get like,  and there's assisted GPS and stuff where you'll get like vague location from your cell phone signal,  where it'll just jump all over the map. Oh, there. You broke the speed of light a couple of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I did. Because at 530, I was in Frankfurt and at eight o'clock, I was a thousand miles away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's crazy. Look at this. So if you click on the little thing, you can edit it. I don't know why any  normal person would care about editing their location history in Google Maps, but you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That actually is good. And then there's this button that says, I was here.  I presume that's the one response, which is, yeah, I was here. Yeah. That's a thing where they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like, we're not sure if you were actually at this building. I wasn't here. So can I delete it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remove stuff from there. Yeah, there you go. Okay. Like we talked about with the beacons,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's never quite sure what business you're in because GPS just isn't that accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I also did not go back to Frankfurt. Okay. So yeah, you could sit here and correct it,  but I don't know why. I was here at the museum. This is fun though, that it puts the pictures in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  here. It's really cool. So is this like the old latitude product that they had? Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there was another great product that Google killed. Well, the latitude was like, find your friends,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  where it would tell you where everybody was. Which they're moving to Google Play Services now.  I think it's currently in Google Plus hidden that nobody knows about. And I think they're  going to cut that from Google Plus Next. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. More culling of Google Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  features. So I need to go through this and delete the spurious Wi-Fi locations. And then I would  actually have a useful little map of my travels. Yeah. All right. But my favorite thing that they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  added is you can now name places on the map in the new Google Maps. So if you have a favorite  lake or spot, or my example was my parents' house, you could label a spot on the map.  You could say it's my parents' house. Oh, nice. And it will show up on the map. And you'll see  the text there. Because before all you could do is star stuff. And you would have a bunch of stars  that were like latitude, longitude numbers, which was completely useless because you had no idea  what any individual star was for. But now you can actually tag spots on the map and it will save  them. And hopefully this will end up on all the other Google Maps clients. Because right now,  it's on the Android version. And it might show up in your location history. But I don't think it  shows up on the desktop version of Google Maps yet or iOS. So. You know, and a bad thing, if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  remove a location because it's a Wi-Fi location and there's pictures attached to it. I don't think  it removes pictures from photos, but it takes them out of your timeline. Right. It has those  pictures because you upload them to Google Photos. It thought that I took those pictures in  Amsterdam, but I didn't. But when I took out that stop, it went away. Anyway, play with it.  It's another cool thing. I like that timeline. Here, you can have your phone back.  I think I got years of data on here. That's what's fun. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. And if you do it in the  dashboard, it tells you things like you spent 47% of your time at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It's one of the really like if you're freaked out by the amount of data Google knows about you.  Location history is one of the big ones. The other one is you can have a history of your voice  searches, which is like your phone randomly turning on because it thought you said, OK, Google,  and recording everything you say for like the next five seconds. It's fun to go through and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  see what it screwed up. And a lot of it is not actual, it's just things it heard. Right. It'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  just be murmurs or it's shifting around in my pocket. Or there's a lot of butt dialing going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Big data, baby. Here's my voice and audio activity that it thinks I sent to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My voice is my passport. Yes. Yes. My voice is my passport. OK, Google. Five nights at Freddy's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, there's a search. Yeah, this is see, it's funny. It just shows you this is actually  a test, a litmus test to see if you're a person of the future or a person of the past.  A normal person of the past would get horrified by this. Yeah. Right. Yep. But I think this is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you're brave, the ones you want to play are the ones that say transcript not available.  Yeah, because you don't know where it screwed up and it wasn't a Google search. Yeah. Maybe I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  shouldn't turn those on. Some of this stuff is definitely weird. But that to me, I think that's  cool that Google saved all that. Thank you, Google. Even though you didn't tell me ahead of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You opted in. There were some terms of service that you blew by and just hit next door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I definitely know there was nothing that I signed up for that said,  save everything I say to my phone for the rest of my life. I don't think that was in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was somewhere. It was easy to turn off and easy to delete. It was there. They got there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was there. Does Cortana do that? I think they all have. See, actually, this is what's different  about Google. They all, Siri, everybody, they are all being sent to the company and being stored.  Only Google lets you hear it, though, again, after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And the reason I know you agreed to it is because it's part of the setup when you do an  Android phone. It asks you every single time again and again and again, hey, do you want to give us  location history and all this other stuff? So you do have to set it up every time. But it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be more clear. It could be more clear. It could say, we are going to save these forever.  It could be hidden in something like send data back to Google to improve our services, that kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of thing. I think it's the time frame that probably freaks people out. I just looked and there were  trips to Phoenix and Las Vegas that I took five years ago showing up in timeline. Imagine 50

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  years from now. I mean, we are, I mean, this quantified self is happening whether you like  it or not all the time. As you said, Kevin, you said, or maybe it was Ron said it, this phone is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the perfect spy device. It knows everything. You won't bury time capsules in the future. This

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is your time capsule. Yeah. It turns out I've been saving every picture, every voice dictation,  everything. The AP is doing the same. Apparently the Associated Press has been saving  everything and they have just uploaded half a million newsreel clips to YouTube.  With ads? Well, who cares? I hope I don't care. Yeah. Make some money. That's amazing. These are  British movie tones. Here's the Prince of Wales at the Rio Carnival. I mean, just crazy stuff.  Hmm. Prince Charles came to the Rio Carnival expecting to see beautifully dressed. There's  the ad. Wow. It's a big one, isn't it? Wow. That's all right. I don't mind. I mean, this stuff is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  great. Oh yeah. From a nostalgic point of view, I think it's fantastic. From a history point of view,  too. Yeah. You've got the Hindenburg there and whatnot. Yeah. So let me see the, which account

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is. AP Archive, youtube.com slash AP Archive. Wow. Half a million  videos and they're going to put more up there. And then the movie tone channel has footage from 1895  to 1986. That is pretty cool. We live in an interesting time. I mean, prior to whatever  it was, 1930 or 40, stuff just wasn't recorded. You can't see Abe Lincoln's Gettysburg Address,  but future generations will see everything. They can see everything. I think that's neat.  What are we doing? How are we doing on time here? Is there, I'm going to do another ad,  but is there anything you guys want to talk about before I go to a break? Any story in there that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  grabs your attention? Oh, I don't know. I spent the last week with an Android Auto car.  You did? Tell us about that. The Hyundai Sonata. I guess I have, I turned in my  8,500 word review today. Oh good. And my editors are dealing with that. But there's lots of neat  stuff. You're replacing John Syracusa, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah. No, for real. He's like my idol. I  try to live up to that level of in-depthness. Obsessive detail. So it's like, some of it's  weird, man. It's a Hyundai Sonata and they've kind of passed this car out to everybody. And while you  can run Android Auto on your phone and beam it to the car interface, it's just like CarPlay, I guess.  But the Hyundai Sonata itself runs Android, which I guess nobody else figured out. So like  the stock infotainment system that you get from Hyundai is built on Android. And does anybody  want to guess what version of Android they're using? Oh, it ain't gingerbread, I hope.  No. Good call. It is Android 2.3. No! What? No!  Like one of the reasons we need these CarPlay and Android Auto is just these car companies don't,  they're not any good at making software. It's not even that. They are on a different time frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're on a geologic time scale, not on a Silicon Valley time scale. Top to bottom,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the built-in infotainment system is a 2011 smartphone. It runs gingerbread. The screen  is 480 by 800. The processor is a single core 1 GHz free scale processor. So it's basically  a Motorola Droid. It's like 8 inches across from 2011. And yet it's probably light years ahead of  what Hyundai used last year. Yeah, probably. But like it's a 2015 car. But when you turn on  Android Auto, though, everything just kind of, it's like welcome, welcome back to 2015.  You know, step back into the present. I thought that the goal of both Android Auto and CarPlay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was to take the smarts from my current phone and make that be the system in the car,  as opposed to having the car having its own system. It's basically an app that runs on top  of the existing infotainment system. So I can't use the apps on my current phone. I have to use,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't, I'm confused. No, it uses Android Auto on the car is an application. So you press the  Android Auto icon and you launch into this new interface. It's a lot like Windows 8,  where you have this, you have this old legacy interface, and then you have this new interface  on top of it that isn't as feature complete. So you kind of end up hopping from one to the other.  So Android Auto will do like phone and music and  messaging, maybe. Yeah, messaging. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  quick get out of the house. RoboCop is arriving. What the hell is that?  And fire, smoke alarm? I think your home is too automated now, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you on fire, Kevin? The home has reached sentience. It's coming for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me, now I'm really curious what you're saying, Ron. So, okay, I, in my Mustang,  it was running Microsoft Car. It probably had a really old slow processor, probably had no  memory. It certainly had slow storage. It ran software. You turn on the car, it boots up. And  now I've got maps. I've got different stuff, control the air conditioning. And as we've learned,  I can also cause the car to die or break. This sounds like they're just updating that system

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  with an Android OS. Is that not the case? No, I mean, you have to use in terms of,  so there's two different systems. There's a stock infotainment system that you get with the car.  And then there's Android Auto. And the stock infotainment system needs some kind of operating  system. And it's just coincidence that they used Android. Android Auto runs on your phone and  treats the car dashboard screen as like a computer monitor. And that's what you want,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because that's going to be more up to date. Yes. But it doesn't control lots of things you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  want it to control because it's just on your phone. So you can't adjust the screen brightness.  You can't mess with the air conditioner. There's all sorts of things that you need the stock  infotainment system for that Android Auto can't do. And to me, Google has always with Android,  they've always been in the business of making operating systems. And Android Auto is not an  operating system. It's just like an app that runs other apps that live on your car screen.  So it's weird that they have this like they're already using Android. And I wish Google would  just make a version of Android that would just take over the whole car and wouldn't just be  a thing that runs on top of an existing crusty old operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I could listen though, I could put Pandora on my phone and then using that app on the car system,  listen to my Pandora music from my phone. Right. Pandora specifically. Apps need to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  specifically written to work with Android Auto. Right now there are 17 total apps that you can  download, including Google's. So there's not a ton. But they did, you know, these developers can  all add compatibility. It's pretty easy. You just have to bug them to do so. And then yeah, you can  switch from Pandora to SoundCloud to Google Music to Spotify to whatever you want, assuming all of  those people get their apps updated. Is Waze in there? No, just Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just Google Maps. Yeah. And Google Maps is the first thing you'd want to be able to do, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Google Maps pulls in Waze. Some of Waze information. Some of their data. Yeah. Oh,  the really sad thing is the way developers are locked down. So because of all the safety  restrictions, developers can only make two kinds of apps, messaging apps and music apps. And they  don't even get control of the interface. They can plug into Google's existing interface template.  And that's it. So like a big part of the smartphone revolution was all of this innovation  from third party app developers. And you're never going to see that on Android Auto because it's  all, oh, well, the safety people say that you can only have this. Well, I understand that. You don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want people Facebooking from their center console and things like that. Right. But if you wanted to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do something like a sports car app that shows you lap times and zero to 60 times and stuff like that,  you'll never have that. You'll never have an app that like finds the cheapest gas station and directs.  Really? No, because it's only Google has like an innovation monopoly on the platform. It's apps do  this and this and this and this and third party developers can't add new features. You can plug in  and send us your audio stream and we'll stick it in the music player. But that's it. And that's for  safety reasons. Yeah. Yeah. Because some of it's they worked with the National Highway Safety Institute  and there's all sorts of laws and stuff like that. But the thing safety. So Apple's solution  will probably be similarly hobbled. Yeah. I haven't tried CarPlay yet. I want to. But yeah,  I mean, it's there's a constant debate about what is and isn't safe, I guess, behind the wheel of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  car. And it's like, it's OK, because I can just pull out my smartphone and I can do whatever I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to do while I'm driving. So if you make it too safe, people will just stop using it. Right. So I  mean, you have to strike the balance between functionality and safety. And it's it's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From a security standpoint, I would I would have hoped that they had gone with a newer version of  Android. No kidding. And I bring that up only because just was it earlier this week or last  week? Hackers took over a Jeep Cherokee. There's a big wired article. And yeah, you know, cut the  brakes and cut the transmission when the guy was going 60 miles an hour. And I mean, I know that  this is really a walled off, very sandbox type of that's precisely the problem. And we talked about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this on security now. We've done it several times is that most cars use Canbus as a as a they have a  single can bus in the car that connects everything entertainment system along with the car's own  computer systems. And so because they're all on the same network,  you I mean, it's it's very difficult to keep one from affecting the other. So if you can hack the  media system, which is what happened in this case. In fact, they hacked it in such a way that you  could do it remotely because these cars, these particular cars, and many cars nowadays, were on  the on a cell network, they're on the sprint network. So you can actually you you can hack  the car to know exactly where it is, where its IP address is, and then where it is in location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then you can start messing with it. Yeah, I was shocked when I found out it was Android.  I was sure it would be like QNX or Linux or some car manufacturers are using QNX. I know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audi is but that doesn't solve the problem necessarily, because you still got this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  common bus. So right. So I took a system dump of the car once I found out it was Android. So I  have a copy of this. Did you really? Yeah, and maybe because because what seems like a bad thing  on the face of it. Well, what what people have always wanted to do is run Android Auto on devices  that they have. Because right now you need to either gut your car or or or buy a brand new car.  And since the part of it that lives on the car is called the Android receiver, the Android  Auto receiver library. So somewhere in the system dump is like that file. And I'm hoping  someone smart can figure out what to do with it. And you know how to make it run on a cell phone  or something, which would be neat. Yeah, if you really like gingerbread. No, no, no, it's just  like Android Auto lives on your phone, but there's special code in the car that kicks it over in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android Auto mode. Well, and that raises another issue. How long before somebody's hacked it to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  remove limitations? Yeah, right. And I don't know, maybe maybe that'll be nice. Like the  the text messaging interface is horrible on this. They they don't display any text at all. So you  just get a text message and you you press on the thing that says new text message and it reads it  to you. And when you don't have context for a text message, when you press on it and it's like, okay,  and like that was the entire give a message. You're very helpful. Right. What what was I  talking to this person about? And my favorite thing is if you get a URL, there is no special  handling. HTTP colon slash slash ww period. So it makes you like hesitant to press the message.  But like, oh, God, is it just going to read letters for the next like two hours? Yeah. Wow.  But I mean, car infotainment systems are very, very low bar. So once you get any of the smartphone  era stuff on your dashboard, you're just like, Oh, my God, it's so much better. Yeah, yeah,  it's a little buggy. But as a first gen product, it's, it's really great. It just shows you how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  three or four years ago, Silicon Valley was so far ahead of it. I mean, these I don't know what the  design timeframe is for cars these days, but it could be years, three, four years. Oh, yeah,  between design and release. So of course, you know, gingerbread was probably current when they  designed it. I'm sure it was. Google plus is taking photos out August 1. You will be compelled  to use Google's new photos app or Picasa of all things. It's still around. What is going on with  Google plus? Are we slowly seeing it being torn asunder bit by bit? I think it gets back to what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we were talking about earlier in the show. Google is trying to do a lot of different things. A lot  of people working on ways to make things better. And I just see confusion rather than, than anything  else in the strategy. I mean, I'm disappointed to see this happen. To be quite honest, I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to Google plus. Do you feel like, do you guys feel like Google plus is less than it used to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm probably using it less because it's, there's not, there's not a lot of great tools. So like on  Twitter, I can automatically have my articles posted. And I've got, I keep looking up because  that's where tweet deck is. And there's, you know, 10,000 columns of people saying stuff. And with  Google plus, it's just a webpage. So it's, it's hard to keep track of and use and stuff like that.  It's a less useful because of how close off it is, which is weird for a Google thing. Usually  they're not so kind of insulated and no, don't touch our stuff. Don't have an API. Don't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still find the most engagement, the most valuable engagement there on Google plus,  though, really out of all the networks I do, you know, and everybody's experience is obviously  going to be different, but for the type of things I talk about and share and want to read about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  great engagement. Yeah, the comments are great. It's nice being able to do more than 180 characters  or however much it is, because I'm, I'm wordy, I guess. But it's, it's just harder to use.  And it's, it's nicer. I love the community, but it's, it's, the interface is tough to use.  And it seems like it's only going to get worse as Google abandons it more and more and more as,  as they kind of scale back. Like, I guess they wanted to brute force their way in a social by  building Google plus and everything else. And they decided that's a bad idea. And now they're just  stripping it out of everything slowly. And it's, it's painful. Oh, see what else. Did you see the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the tweets from Erica joy? I know you did, of course, because you follow all of this. She was  an employee was an employee at Google and Erica Baker, I'm sorry, and made a spreadsheet, which she  shared containing salary information. She says it's spread like wildfire that she had a series of  tweets on Twitter a couple of days ago, spread like wildfire before I left. She's now at Slack.  Before I left about 5% of Googlers had shared their salary on that sheet. People asked for and  got equitable pay based on data in the sheet. She wrote the world didn't end everything didn't go  up in flames because salary got shared. However, her manager didn't like it. She had to point out  to her manager that it was illegal for the manager to punish an employee for sharing salary data.  That's protected speech. However, apparently, I didn't know this, but Google has a little  personal bonusing feature you any employee at Google can bonus any other employee 150 bucks.  Just because they did a good job a little good job bonus. Her manager was blocking those  preventing her from receiving she says as many as seven different bonuses from other Googlers.  She said one got through because it was so vaguely worded. Kind of an interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder how big all of those numbers were.  Yeah, the spreadsheet I guess spreadsheet might be public. I don't know if the spreadsheet is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  public if you can. I didn't see it. I could I looked for it briefly when I saw the story. I was  obviously curious. I mean, it wasn't so much to see how big the numbers were, but to see what the  disparity was perhaps between people basically do the same job or have the same title. She said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  other Googlers started creating pivot tables to show how that was in fact happening that some

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  people were not getting paid appropriately. It's Google's unquenchable thirst for data turned on  itself on the management. Just release all of this to your employees. And yeah, I'm sure they had all  sorts of tables and charts and everything else. It was really an interesting thing. She's talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about it now because she no longer works at Google, but she sounds like she was a little  reluctant to be too public about this until after she left.  But the peer bonus is not going through was not so good.  All right, let's see. Congratulations to Jason Howell. He's on vacation by the way. Jason  Client has been producing my shows for the last few days and I think Brian Burnett is  TDing. Yes, he is. That's correct. But Jason managed to nevertheless get into the world's  attention with this post he put on Instagram. Jason's up in the mountains somewhere, but he  posted a picture he found at his parents' house of him in kindergarten wearing apparently a  t-shirt featuring the Playboy logo. And it made it to Awkward Family Photos. Congratulations, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're a winner. That's really cute. I like the picture of Jason. He's a cutie. That's great.

We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Kevin Toffle is here now at ZDNet where he's a contributing writer. Of course,  we've known Kevin for a long time. Love him. His work at Giga Home. You were part of that,  geez, that whole explosion there, the implosion of Giga Home. I was actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm based in Pennsylvania, but I was actually at the office that day. No. Yeah, I was. I was in  San Francisco for the Apple Watch event. Yeah, that was the last story filed, wasn't it? The  Apple Watch event. It was. It was the last story filed. It was mine. It's still there. So  that's kind of nice. So the site didn't go down? No, the site did not go down. And the site has  actually been purchased and is supposed to relaunch in August, knowingly has purchased the company,  or I'm sorry, the assets of the blog, that is. I mean, but they're not going to rehire the  staff. Not to my knowledge. Yeah, not to my knowledge. But everybody seems like they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  landed well. I know a number of folks went, including Matthew Ingram, went to Fortune.  Yes. So I'm glad that I've seen Jankos work in Variety now. And of course, you're at ZDN. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's great. But. Oh, absolutely. I mean, that's the best possible outcome is to see all  of your colleagues, you know, land a job. And it's interesting. We had such a great group that we  still talk almost every day as it is now, and this is three, four months later. So. Well, that's how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitch started. After this, after tech TV fell apart, I still wanted to talk to all my colleagues.  And if you have an organization with great people, it's inevitable that, you know,  it get it. They land on their feet, I think. So and Boyd Gigaum had the best team ever. Just  amazing. It was nice. It was nice. Yeah. Anything you any tip or trick or tool you'd like to share

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with us? Well, the last time I was here, you and I talked a lot about my passion of the Beatles.  Yes, which I share. Yes, which I know you share. So this time around, I didn't bring a tech tip.  I brought a podcast that I hope you have not heard, because if you haven't, you are in for  a treat. So if you or anybody else enjoys the Beatles, I would look at Alphabetical.com. And  it is for gentlemen who do one podcast per Beatles song. Alphabetical order. They are in the L's now.  So they've been doing this for months and months. And just a lot of great insights to what was going  on at the time. And maybe some interesting facts about the about the song. Lady Madonna, there was  only one day of the week that wasn't mentioned. And turns out it was Saturday. I did not know that  until I heard that episode. And, you know, well, I mean, you really have to be a Beatles diehard  obviously, but it's just it's just an interesting approach to a podcast on a topic. And the same  group of guys, they do another podcast about the Star Wars movies where they literally each episode,  they talk about one single minute of the movie. And then the next podcast is the next minute of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that movie. So I was going to say this sounds just like that. But it's the same people. Star Wars minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. It's the same same bunch of folks. Yeah. So there's two good podcasts to to listen to  that you can really learn a lot of cool things and insights about. I I'm willing to say this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is what podcasts were invented to do. Absolutely. Yeah, that is awesome. Just obsessive, passionate  fandom. Nice. Good. Alphabetical a l p h a b e a t i c l e.  Or c l a l. Yes. Oh, yeah, of course. Al like alphabetical with a beat in a B in no alpha B

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with an EA stuck in the middle. Yes.  Yes. Okay, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ron Amadio, ours Technica. We're waiting for your 8500 word review of Android car.  But as I hear that's coming Friday, maybe as we wait, you got anything else to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, not a thing. Huh? I don't know. Jason's off. I would get an email that says, Hey, think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about this. Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to jump you on that. Sorry. I don't know. I'm, I'm,  I'm excited. You gave us one already, which is the cool thing in the maps  that shows your timeline. So I think I'm gonna let you off the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. For that one. There's a Hearthstone expansion they announced while we're on the  air. I don't know. I need to find out what that's. Are you a Hearthstoner? Yeah, I like, I like playing  but more I like watching people on YouTube play and you will wait a minute. That's even worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're you're you're a Hearthstone let's play watcher. But yeah, no, I don't know. I like  it's interesting. I don't understand why you play a card game with a computer to me. I mean,  I feel like don't you want to are there is there is it possibly Hearthstone as a card game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm sure. Yeah, I think people have made physical physical cards, but no man, like you  put a card down and like the whole screen shakes and catches fire. Oh, that's neat.  And you know, they have all sorts of weird mechanics that wouldn't work in a real card  game. That makes sense. Yeah, it's interesting. And you know, they constantly constantly release  new stuff. And it's were you a World of Warcraft fanatic? Yeah, I was just gonna say it's Warcraft,  which I've, which I've always been super addicted to. Yeah. So actually, this is how I would do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is watching YouTube videos. I think you're right. Because I don't want to it's strategically so  complicated. I don't I just want to watch somebody play. Right. Yeah, but you you know,  you learn about it. Yes, you do. Who am I to mock you? I watch chess tournaments on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The worst is they're doing they're going to do a Warcraft movie now live action. Oh,  it's like, you know, humans versus orcs. And they're going to try to film this. And I don't know,  did they never see the Halo movie then? Or video game movies that are going to be so incredibly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  awful? I don't think we've seen the end of this trend either. Frankly. Well, I shared my Google  Fi. So I think I've shared something as well. So I think we can wrap this puppy up is what I think.  I want to thank you both for being here. I appreciate it. Will Jeff be back next week?  I'm sure he'll be back from his travels by then. Yeah. So we'll and maybe we're I think we're  getting close to the time when Gina Trepanney stops by to every month she stops by. So we'll  find out next week. We do this week in Google, of course, every Wednesday right after  Windows Weekly. That's round about one I'm going to say 1 30 p.m. Pacific 430 Eastern time 2030 UTC  Wednesdays on twit.tv. Please watch live. Join us in the chat room if you can. But if you can't,  we can make on demand versions available reluctantly. But OK, audio and video available.  No, I'm just kidding. In fact, that's how most of most of you listen. Twig dot twit dot tv slash  twig or wherever you get your podcasts. Thanks to Brian Burnett for filling in on the board.  Thanks to Jason Clantus for filling in for Jason Howell. Where's your Playboy t-shirt? You need to  have it if you're going to really fill in for Jason. You have to have a Playboy t-shirt and be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  seven years old. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you next time on this week in Google. Bye bye,  everybody.
