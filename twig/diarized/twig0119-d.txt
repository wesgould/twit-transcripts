Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, how's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good.  It's good.  Good.  Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis also here.  Oh, now he's jiggling.  Do you are you?  Yeah.  Are you having an earthquake?  Earthquake.  No, sorry.  Jeff's in his office at the City University of New York where he's a professor of journalism.  He's also an author of a great book called Public Parts and buzzmachine.com is his blog.  And also joining us, the founder of Metafilter, Matt Howey is here.  Hello.  Hey, Matt.  Long time no see.  Good to see you again.  Yeah, nice to see you.  Matt is a Google reader fanatic.  So we thought we'd bring him on so we could see the steam coming out of his ears.  Google's been, it's amazing what Google's, you know, for,  it seemed like for a long time Google didn't do nothing.  And then all of a sudden they're changing everything.  It started with Google+, but Gmail's got a new interface now.  We'll talk about that in a second.  But the one that really has people up in arms is Google Reader.  They took out the shared button.  Is that the, so I use Google Reader, you know, this is my account and I use it.  We are the 1000 plus.  But I more often use it with a client that then logs into it.  You, I take it, use it from the webpage, Matt.  Yeah, yeah.  So what's wrong here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, there's a lot of things wrong like the, it's cool that they are,  Google's finally sort of investing in design.  And, you know, it's weird to complain about a free app that's been free for years and years and years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't let that stop you, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pretty much ad free, you know.  I'm surprised it doesn't have Gmail style ads across the top.  But, you know, I just got used to, I will say that, like, they kind of went overboard in the last year or two.  You know, there was like sharing.  There were too many buttons at the bottom.  Yeah, sharing, sharing, liking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus one, email, keep on rent, send to, edit to, all of this stuff.  Yeah, now, so they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you could share, you could share with a note, you could like something, you could star something.  That was, I mean, they should have just stuck with like two, like share and star maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they've eliminated everything but star and plus one, which unfortunately instead of just plus oneing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to plus one then you can share on plus.  Yeah, but then.  So my problem is slowly I started using the sharing thing when I noticed other friends would comment sometimes on my shares.  And it seems like over the last two or three years, Google kind of eclipsed.  It was just so easy to just press the share button.  And I follow, I don't know, 150 people or so.  It became more important to me than like delicious and pin board and Twitter and blogs for finding new stuff.  It was like new content discovery.  It was amazing.  So I would find just, you know, I was following about 50 prolific people that were sharing five things a day.  And I was just finding the most amazing stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Matt, how do I get out of this share box?  I can't stop it.  I don't want to share this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you escape?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Click away.  Nothing.  There's no close box.  OK, little UI.  There we go.  Click away worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you kind of I mean, even a designer of Google Reader said he couldn't stand this, you know, former designer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he was he was he said they've lost their way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess share is now in the upper right and the like on the top bar away from everything.  And that's what's share whatever item you're looking at.  Which is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is weird.  But that's that's the same as plus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This one has a close box, which is kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My other problem is you could export the people you're following only in JSON format, you know, a JavaScript XML kind of type.  And so I opened it up, you know, in a text form, I was trying to add all these people to circles and I just have their like Google username.  And I don't know their real name.  And sometimes there's five people with the same exact full name.  And then I finally get all my followers on plus and two or three have migrated to plus.  But I'm also getting like pictures of their kids Halloween costume, their Google plus stuff.  So they essentially killed what was I mean, it was a nerdy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got plus in my Google reader.  You got reader in my plus.  Now, two great flavors in one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I said, like, you know, on the second day I woke up, I opened up Google Reader, forgetting about all this.  It was like someone take away, you know, my iPhone and give me a phone from 10 years ago.  It just all the things I loved about were completely gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But kind of I feel like we should get ready because this is just, you know, kind of the beginning of a whole revamp across the board.  All this stuff. I kind of like everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plusification. We're we're we're in the business of change.  But you know what? We kind of don't like change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. You know, nerds hate change more than anybody.  I. Yeah, they cause change more than anybody else.  I mean, you became a nerd because you were excited by all the new stuff.  But then once you got it, it, you know, dialed in, it's like.  And every change is for the worse. Let's just admit that right now.  It's all for the worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It actually kind of reveals an interesting problem with Google circles, which I've I've kind of come into to is that there's no way to say, like,  these are my tech posts, these are my personal posts, these are my MMA posts and, you know, kind of selectively subscribe to people.  Like if there was a way for Matt to say, I just want to subscribe to, you know, shares from Google reader from his friends,  that that would be that would kind of solve the problem. Right.  So you wouldn't get the pictures of people's kids in their Halloween costumes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That I figure they're going to do. I figure that's coming in some form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We need it so badly. Or like just people's plus ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. On the other hand, all that adds complexity.  It's a very it's a great challenge.  Yeah. Because as Matt, as you said, you added all these buttons at the bottom.  Well, that makes people happy. They get attached to that button or this button.  But then you then it's just kind of complex for somebody who's never been there before.  It's like, what's the difference between share star and plus one?  I don't know. Right. I mean, it's not immediately obvious anyway when you look at it.  Right. So you have this. So I can understand why they'd say, well, let's narrow it down and just have a couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense to focus it.  But not if you can't get the same like Matt's saying, I can't I just can't get the same functionality that I had before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, I think that's going to happen, though, sometimes when you focus things, you lose functionality.  I'm not not to diminish your complaints, Matt, I completely understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, well, they took out a major feature, but it was the whole shoe horning into the other new community tool that seemed just really odd.  I mean, I was on Google's campus last month and in this big meeting I was with, people asked me, you know, after I talked about what I was talking about.  So what's your favorite sites or what are the tools you use every day?  And I said, like, pretty much Twitter and Google Reader open all the time.  As soon as people heard Google Reader, they said, oh, what do you think of plus?  Plus. So I sort of I was like, that was weird.  Why did they ask me about plus? But and then I put it together.  Alarm bells came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Answer me, weren't there rumors that Reader was going to disappear entirely, that it was going to be entirely moved over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think I just heard the sharing stuff, like all the social features of everything is going to be pushed to plus.  I also heard about a new plus feature, which was a Facebook clone feature.  And I told them basically stop cloning Facebook, try and make something actually compelling and original.  Are you talking about the what's hot?  No, I don't think this was nobody told me to NDA this.  They said, oh, wait till you hear about this new things coming to plus business pages.  No, I went, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we knew that they were telling brands, don't don't create.  You know, I didn't create a Twitter account because they told me there were going to be brand pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I went, like, that's chasing Facebook again.  Like, you know, nothing new and compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it also answers a need.  I mean, if I'm a brand, see what happened?  You know, remember, in the absence of a brand page, everybody Mashable, everybody created user pages that were really brand pages.  And so I can understand why they might want to separate those out.  I think really the complaint is that Google Plus doesn't have enough.  Is it mature enough yet?  And if you're going to move everybody to Google Plus, you better have all the features that people want.  Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But maybe it's about proactively moving people to Google Plus, you know, whether they realize they're getting there or not.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think eventually Gmail will just be Google Plus messaging.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, yes, actually, you raise an important point.  I had lunch with a Googler.  I'm not sure. Oh, I'm frozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all right. Yeah, I like it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you want to imitate that, Leo?  Hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That always works to unfreeze him, by the way, when you when you imitate him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure.  This was this was on the other side of the NDA wall of Google's.  I'm not sure if I'll quote the person, but if I'm not giving credit only because of that worry.  But he pointed out to me that the essential mistake in email was that the sender has all control, the recipient has no control.  And in Google and that's why email is so bloody broken, because that's why we get messed up with everything.  Whereas Google Plus, Google Plus recipient has control.  And there were only two cases where that wasn't so right.  One was where comments get notifications and second was comments.  So notifications, they changed so that now you can limit notifications to people you actually know,  which is too bad because it limits you to a known world.  But it limits a spam problem.  And, you know, I suspect that was in the comments.  So what happens then?  So then Google circles, Google Plus becomes a place where the recipient has all control.  And basically, you can say, if I know you and you want to communicate with me, communicate with me there,  because there'll be a lower spam environment than my email.  So, Matt, you're not wrong.  I think that Google Plus could well be an architecture for the future of email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you want to replace email or just have it as another perhaps more better way to communicate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think mail is god awful broken.  And I'm not sure what to do about it.  And so and so I think that we probably end up with two worlds, right?  We end up with email as it stands, which is, you know, the same as trying to find somebody in Times Square.  And we have the other extreme, which is complete control, which is like Google Plus could be.  And then in the middle, there's some there's some airlock where someone can knock on the door and say, will you let me in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There has to be because, well, yeah, I mean, I have all this infrastructure around my email,  as many of us do to to filter it, to spamify it.  I mean, I don't want to have to recreate that all in tools at Google Plus tools that may not even be as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I agree. But I think I think you end up with different worlds.  Right. So so so LinkedIn is like one example of that airlock.  Right. Where where you choose whether or not to go through it to meet somebody else on the other side because you have signals that allow you.  So at one level, it's like my students find that getting me on Twitter is sometimes easier than email because my email is just a mess.  That's already happening de facto. Exactly. Right. Right. Right.  So and that's a world where I have to follow you and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think Google's already set this up with these Google messaging that's built in.  If I go to your profile and G plus, I could say send a message to Jeff.  There's a new bite in there. Right. But it's it's email, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's still kind of lands in just pile of crazy.  You know, does it? Yeah, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so if you use Gmail, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but at Google Plus, what you can do is they don't they know they don't make this clear enough.  You can send a message just to what you can you can share with just one person.  Right. So that's right. That's the message that occurs.  The problem with that is when people do that, I don't there's no clear signal.  It says this is private to you. Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and it slows down and you don't see it.  Yeah, that's happened to me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I've had people says, wow, that's an odd thing to announce to the world.  And then I realize, oh, they're not announcing to the world.  They're just saying to me. So what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's this here's the send message button.  This is new on the Google Press profile.  If I press that, it creates a Google Plus private message.  It's not an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, OK, that is that is.  So what happened? Send that to me, Leo.  Or maybe I should say, what is a private message?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can respond to it to you, Jeff and share.  You know, this is something that this is kind of the hidden Google Plus,  because this could be going on all the time.  And we don't even know because nobody sees it.  People may already be in the millions using Google Plus in lieu of email.  We just wouldn't know that.  In fact, I do believe they've said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The two to one, the current number, I think this is public,  is two to one private to public.  It's heading toward three to one. Yeah.  So people are.  So I got the message for you on top.  So now let me show and I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what it looks like to me is that says limited doesn't.  You know, this is we need more signals here.  This is not enough to say limited.  And he's a private to Jeff or something.  Oh, it does. It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it could be limited to two people, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why? Yeah, well, I should have a list of who I sent it to here.  That's one thing that's different than email.  I don't know. Is it just to you?  And now Jeff's responded in real time. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't you click on it?  This is very buzzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I click on it and see who you sent it to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, there you go. So I can see that. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What? Two people.  OK, me and Jeff. Yeah.  The pilgrim and the cowboy.  That's not a cowboy hat. It's a pilgrim hat, by the way.  Oh, excuse me. It's November.  So I don't know.  I think this is this is a in many circumstances,  a suitable replacement for email.  It's a kind of a in between instant messaging and email.  I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My profile, there's a send a message button and a send an email button.  So that that was the that was my confusion.  Yeah, because I've I've enabled that, like, let people send me email.  And actually, I've been using that as my kind of personal email form forever  because I don't want to just hand out my email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and if you go to my profile on Google Plus, you can message Leo.  That's always been part of the profiles thing.  And yes, see here, I could send a message or send an email to myself.  I don't know why I'd want to do that, but I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So if you have a verified identity  in some way or another, the Google does it right.  It starts to become your canonical address in the world.  People can email you, but you have control now gives you more control.  They can only they can message to you only if you allow that.  It is not.  It doesn't require the friend connection that Facebook required for so long.  So it can be I always get trouble on this show when I say it's asynchronous.  I'm supposed to say it's.  Whatever. All right.  I know people, I know you get pissed off.  Asymmetric. Thank you.  Asymmetric is the word you're looking for.  I think it's actually somewhat both.  I hope I'm not freezing like that.  And right.  So that becomes a really interesting new frontier here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, if they open an API, if they need a better API  before they do too much of this, because then we could have tools.  I'm just I'm going to miss the tools I have for filtering,  for processing in my mail clients.  Gina, you could write something if you would.  I would appreciate that. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, sure. I'll just get right to it.  I'll put that up this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of mail, Gmail, of course, now has a new interface.  And I just for the first time saw the opportunity.  If you look in the lower right, I didn't see this earlier.  But now it says, you see, switch to the new look.  You click that and you'll get this.  You'll automatically get upgraded to the new look soon.  But if you don't want to wait, you can switch to the new look today  and then click this button.  I saved this. I didn't do it until you were watching.  And now I'm switching to the new look,  which looks a lot like the template that I was using,  which was the new look.  They have new themes, though they have HD themes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they have some kind of new design guru who's doing all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said they were going to do it.  They did say they were going to do this with the launch of Google Plus,  that they were going to they were going to do all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  It looks a lot like what it used to be,  that the old that theme that you're using, that minimal theme.  But it's got a couple of cool little things to it.  Like it gracefully kind of resizes when you resize your browser window,  window, which is nice.  The gadgets on the side, the sidebar are resizable.  So you can resize your labels, you can resize your, you know, your chat gadget.  It has it takes actually from Honeycomb a little thing.  If you select a message, buttons appear with possible actions  that you can perform on those on those messages at the top on the action bar,  similar to like an Android action bar, which is kind of neat.  So if you select if you select a message, you'll see the the buttons show up.  And the conversations like look a lot nicer, too.  I want to search.  Search is really cool.  If you if you click that down arrow on the in the on the right side of the search box,  you can you can specify like, yeah, from.  Awesome. Yeah, that's really awesome.  I create a filter with this search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's yeah, you create a filter right from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is good.  This is encouraging to me because these are the tools I was talking about  that I need for mail.  If this somehow integrates with plus as well,  then I then I would have the features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So you start to have this world of people I know versus people I don't know.  Email becomes for people I don't know.  Got it. Fancy, Eileen.  Very fancy. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see it for you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The look of fail with the look of that's great.  Right. So so does that work?  People I know, people I don't know. Yeah.  And that works for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, I use Twitter direct messages and I am as my like kind of white  listed conversations, right?  Like these are people who I friended, who I know, who I trust well enough.  Like I am, for example, I only put people on my I am buddy list  who are friends and who are OK to interrupt me.  I don't want a stranger interrupting me.  But like but Matt, I am me yesterday complaining about Google Reader.  And I said, hey, come on, Twig.  And that's how this happened. You know, and you know, are you on her list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo Leo's totally on my list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know. Yes, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? I noticed it no longer says priority inbox is just inbox.  There doesn't seem like there's anything but priority box anymore.  Unless there's it must be setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in the last that that's another layer. Right.  So you have people, you know, on Google Plus, people who want to know you  in the airlock, people who you probably are OK with,  which is priority box and then everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, they call it important now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Important, important and unread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, if you click the gear on the upper right hand side,  you can you can change the density.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know from comfortable to cozy to compact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a cozy fan myself. Cozy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Compact. I like to get a lot jammed in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you like high information density.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like to see this. This is cozy.  This is what Gina now you can get comfortable.  You get to spread the hell all over the place or  or compact where you get thousands of messages into one little tiny page.  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My favorite feature is the collapsing of,  I guess, signatures and replies and that little you get like a little three dot  graphic. And if you click, it expands on the fly.  And I notice people's long SIG files disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, that's how you know, yeah, this is making it more, you know,  I've never really used the I know this is heresy,  but I usually use my own mail client, not the Gmail client.  I use Apple Mail usually.  But this now has gotten so feature laden,  particularly that bar on the right that says who you're talking to  and what others I mean, look at all this here on the right, Eileen.  This is showing a email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you don't want to show your email?  Well, no, not mine.  It's the person that it's a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, we don't want to show that one.  So let me go to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a person, you know, I mean, it's work here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll show my fidelity.  But see, in order to do that, I have to show somebody with women.  I just didn't want this person to Steve Gibson.  No, but see, Steve has no personality, so he doesn't show up.  Doesn't even have a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not my email.  I care about it's the other person on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I understand why, too, because he's somebody that people would love  to meet. Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do I change?  I miss this, Leo.  How do I change my email?  Oh, switch to New York. There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not everybody gets that right now.  See there. OK, so this is short.  I think everybody knows who he is.  So you see how I like this on the right, though,  where it shows like I can follow on Twitter.  See, I wasn't fine. Look, look at that.  It's showing a little. Wow.  So I'm going to follow. Yeah, that's good.  OK, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't want to log in right now.  Oh, I guess I have to.  Isn't that cool?  Log in with Google now.  Oh, my God. Allow allow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is something I've installed.  This is reportive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I was going to say that's that's more than more than.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Return to Gmail.  OK, so but you're getting are you getting this or is this reportive over here?  I'm not getting that. Oh, too bad.  It's fun.  So let me turn off reportive then.  So what are you getting on the right?  You're getting some of this, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm getting the names of the people in the conversation.  OK, that's Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get it. I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matt, you got to unplug your headset and plug it in again.  Here, go off my email for a second.  I'm a turn off reportive.  I don't even know what is reportive.  Connect your so claim your email.  I don't even know what this is.  I installed something I wish I didn't.  I shouldn't do that because then I don't have a normal interface.  But it was kind of cool, wasn't it?  How? Yeah.  Yeah. So maybe that was cool.  I don't even know.  This is the problem.  And this is a real issue in general with adding all the features like this,  is that people get this weird disconnect, like I'm looking at something,  but I don't know where it came from.  I don't know what it is.  And I and to be honest, I have no idea how to turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Matt, this gives you the option to switch to the new look or not switch  to the new look.  Do you just wish that that had been the option for reader A and B?  Do we think that you'll be able to hold on to your old link?  Look, Gmail forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I actually like the new Gmail.  I mean, I was my biggest concern with Google readers.  They just took out like 25, well, 50 percent of why I used it.  This is gone.  Share. You love share.  Yeah. And there is no migration client.  You know, I'm sitting here reading an XML file  and trying to build a new circle, which was crazy.  And then it doesn't even offer the same functionality.  But, you know, Gmail, I really like it this morning.  You know, my first use of about 20 minutes, I didn't like the loss  of text labels of just the little things on the top.  But after 20 minutes, I memorized what archive is.  So, you know, I can hit that like a skinner box.  OK, OK, OK. Yeah.  And I realized today, like Gmail's gotten really good in the last year or two.  Like, I see maybe one or two spam messages.  It's really good, isn't it?  A day, maybe instead of per hour.  Like, you know, a year ago,  it's been fantastic.  It's just getting better.  It's just slowly gotten mildly better to the point where I barely even notice.  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, report of is a OK, I see it.  It's a Chrome add on.  So I'll turn that off.  Now I'm confused. I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did. I do see like a person I was emailing.  I see a nice little icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's something they added. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I see their last Google Plus update that was public.  Right. Only one person I've seen do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm. Let me look at somebody.  So I have to be so careful with my email here.  I always reveal more than I choose.  How about do you mind if I show your vacation email, Eileen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, sure. No, no problem.  Where are you going, Eileen?  I'm going to Hawaii, going to Maui.  Looks like reportive is still there.  Not in a while, though. January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looks like reportive is still there.  So never mind.  I don't know. I thought I turned it off.  Anyway, OK, so good.  Some it's a mixed bag.  Some good, some bad.  But this is just the beginning, I think, of a complete, you know,  redesign of everything Google in order to.  It's the G plusification, right?  That's the goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The classification of everything is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you don't like G plus, you might not be on.  You might not be too happy with it.  You will like G plus.  No choice. You got no choice.  Enjoy everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it sounds like if you want to do anything social on Google,  it's going to be plus.  It's going to be hooked in a plus eventually if it's not already. Right.  Which makes sense for Google. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  Anything else about Reader we want to say?  Do you think, I mean, really truthfully,  this is how Google must be looking at how many people use Reader and say  there's not really a whole bunch of people.  This is kind of a reading a feed reader.  Does that even make sense anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the other question is RSS.  I mean, how many feeds do you have in your reader that you never ever touch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One thousand plus.  It's always one thousand plus on red articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. After Lifehacker, I basically switched to Twitter almost entirely.  And I was in a weird kind of situation at Lifehacker.  I mean, I had to pounce through my RSS reader every single day.  I had to treat it like an inbox.  So it just became equated with work for me.  But I think that switch from reading RSS and blogs,  kind of the old school way, with through a feed reader and switching them more  switching to Facebook or Twitter and getting your links that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a better signaling system. It's just a better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's sharing as the new means of discovery and distribution.  Yeah, it's collaborative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yet, well, Matt, why make a case for newsreaders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's tough because it's like a niche nerd.  I am. And, you know, it makes no money for Google.  Right. Google is strange.  You know, when I visited there last month, I was hanging out with the AdSense teams  and the teams were extremely small.  Like it would boggle your mind that billions of dollars are moving through like,  you know, a small cube farm.  You could see all sides of 30 people are in charge of something  that's bringing in over a billion dollars. It's psychotic.  And then you realize there's 15000 employees.  Only the people in the ad groups are the ones making money from Google.  You know, everyone else is just sort of sucking up resources, making cool tech.  It's really, it's really, it's really strange.  The ad people aren't treated like gods.  The people who are making Google Maps, you know, are respected on the campus.  But, you know, really, it's all about what makes money.  So I know Google Readers is this tiny little niche product.  I know I was using it in a really niche way with other super tech nerds.  But it was very, you know, awesome and compelling and perfect for me.  I cut my feeds down to maybe 250 or 300 blogs  so I could treat it like an inbox, you know, that was to get to zero in a day.  But I noticed that everyone just moved to Twitter for link sharing.  You know, Delicious has sort of been dying out.  Definitely is with the redesign and pin board sort of my network activity  is where I used to watch for interesting stuff.  And now I just sort of watch Twitter.  But Twitter doesn't there's not like aggregation tools to show me,  like, give me the hottest links among the whatever 400 people I follow  that were shared today, like where the two or three collisions there.  You know, I haven't seen anything like that.  Seems like a tool that needs to be built.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's such a moving target.  It's so hard to know how people every, you know, five months,  everything changes about how people consume content on the net.  You know, I'll give you an example.  I'm looking at The Verge, which they've done a beautiful job.  This is Joshua Topolski and Cruz, you know, the guys who left in gadgets.  Next big thing.  And it's a beautiful website with beautifully designed.  And I and I think very modern, you know, kind of Tablidi and all of this.  But I wonder, you know, I don't really go to sites anymore,  even Lifehacker to read stuff.  I replaced that long ago with newsreaders  and now replace newsreaders with Google+, Facebook and Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And look at what Facebook's doing with with the Guardian and  a perfect example.  Right. Yeah.  And, you know, I called the Peter  Butter's Peter Butter strategy, you want your content to be spreadable  and embeddable everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you think of something like this, which is really I mean, this is  you know, you'd asked me a couple of years ago, I said,  this is the future of magazines.  And now I'm wondering if this has a future at all as great as it is.  I mean, it's beautiful.  And there are long form articles and they're, you know, beautifully designed.  Every article has a really strong image associated with it.  And of course, from their point of view, they want you to go hit this  because this is where the ads are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Leo, then that's where the Facebook model works,  is your ads go with you to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And notice they're not as chewing this social sharing.  They've got like tweet plus one stumble upon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like to be able to embed that in a Google Plus post.  Right. These people take the article like a YouTube.  I can embed a YouTube video in Google+.  Why shouldn't I be able to add that article?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's up to them.  And I bet you can because that's up to their the tags, the meta info they put in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In other words, there's no means now to embed a whole article into a Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, not the entire article. I see what you're saying.  I want to embed the whole thing.  I don't know. I don't know.  I mean, remember, there's meta tags that Google uses to find,  you know, and format this data.  I don't know if you can't make it be the entire text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you want one could I just don't think you can today.  Can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody, Matt, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember, there's these old school like I frame, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah, I mean, it should travel with the brand and the revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, what you're saying, Jeff, is if I paste in a link.  For a site, just as I do with.  YouTube.  Shouldn't it, as does with YouTube, be a beautifully formatted Google Plus  article and kind of find this because they're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why should you have to go click off to the other site?  Right. As the I should be able to expand it and see the whole thing right there.  And you'll end up getting more readers because they don't have to travel as far.  And Gina's right.  You know, the only thing you do now is an awkward I frame me thing.  But Facebook has gone one step in that way,  which is toward having an alternate home page for those sites.  The next step is to have an alternate display of a piece of content.  Embedded. And then do you really need the site anymore?  You know, somebody said to me today, well, what about is that where Flipboard is?  And I said, you know, I think about it.  I use Flipboard for the first month that I have my iPad.  I haven't used it in three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do actually still use Flipboard to browse articles.  What's this is the point is that  we're in a very rapidly changing area about how people consume content.  And I mean, it's some people are reader, but I think that's a small number.  A lot of people are doing it on social networks,  using that as a signaling system.  And I think if Google's smart, I agree with you, Jeff.  What they should do is, you know, what right now, if you paste a YouTube  link in, it formats it just right.  You see, it gives you the video, it gives you the title.  It gives you a paragraph.  And I know that as a webmaster, you can put the appropriate meta tags  into your content that will help Google format it properly.  And so, yeah, I know that.  And some people do and some people don't.  What I'm I'm wondering is to see, here's an example.  This this website has has has done that.  And the question is, can you format it in such a way that it's more than just  a paragraph that you have the whole article there and it expands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm not.  I think you can only specify like the summary and the image.  OK, yeah.  I mean, so I worked on Better G reader, which is a Firefox extension for Google  reader, which is now basically doesn't work at all because of the other redesign.  That's another thing. I'll try to update it.  But we had this one script that basically, you know,  let you see the original, which just replaced the item, the RSS item with  the entire page, but inside an I frame. Right.  And people like that because they want to see the original page.  It was kind of it's really clunky because you see all the ads  from the originating site and, you know, it would often spread  beyond the viewport for the item.  So it gets it gets tricky, you know, embedding embedding content like that.  I mean, you know, there's the ads question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I frame is absolutely a hack and not the yeah, it's a terrible, terrible hack.  What you really want and I wish Google would provide is a set of tags  that is not just description, title summary, full article, full article.  And it could have expands. Yes.  And and if they're smart, they'll do that because then Google Plus  becomes your reader and you just like it's just like Flipboard.  You can scan through, but it's Flipboard.  You get all the signals.  I guess if that's what Flipboard does, because it's pulling from Twitter feeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm hearing that that Facebook with its new structure is feeding back  to the publishers better data than their own systems have or new data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what you need to do.  Yeah. And Facebook knows so much about the reader.  They can do that.  And that's where Apple, I think, made a little bit of a mistake.  Apple says, no, we want to hold on to that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, Google could do that with RSS right now, right?  Because of RSS, you know what the full text article is.  In some cases, you have an excerpt.  You know, the headline and the title,  you know, so someone shares something on Google,  Google, the auto detect RSS and do all that for for you.  But right now, I think it's about proving to publishers  that Google plus drives traffic to their sites so that people can see ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but the ads can travel with the content.  That's the future. Right.  YouTube's ads travel with it.  All right. All right. Get your glasses ready, people.  Get your glasses ready. Drinking game about to start.  Oh, boy. For Gutenberg.  You know, Eisenstein says that the scholars had to travel town to town  to the books, and then after the press, the books traveled to the scholars.  Well, in that metaphor, we're still being made to travel site to site, town to town.  The content should come to us.  And as long as the business model and the business rule and revenue is there,  then I've got to believe in the long run, it's valuable for a content brand  to have its content with advertising, with brand, with links, with analytics  embedded all around. That's that's the extension of social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by then you look at something like The Verge,  and they've designed this great landing page.  Beautiful looking, really designed to draw you to the page.  Except that that's not people know.  I don't think people have in years gone to a website to read the contents  on the website. That's not how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you guys you guys are kind of conflating  you yourselves as customers for even The Verge.  And really, The Verge is, I mean, not saying cynical, but they're really  I don't know how to put this.  They're designed for searches two years from now.  Like, have you noticed that there's a product page with like the product title?  Like every story we've ever heard about that product.  Yeah, that's that's a search landing page.  You're talking about you and I looking at ads like we're inconsequential.  We're like a rounding error.  It's really getting those search results.  Yeah, it's like like I mean, that's the business model of even Metafilter.  It's like 80 percent of the traffic to the server is people looking at one page  and they've never looked the site ever. Exactly.  So then that's been going on for a long time.  So I mean, that's a search is the key for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's search and sharing.  You've got three levels of discovery of content, right?  Brand search and sharing now.  So brand is a home page, which is an expression of editorial ego and brand.  Search is exactly what you just said, Matt, people coming in from wherever.  And sharing is embedding it out there where you recommend it at places like G plus.  And you've got to have all three strategies.  But editorially, I know because I is one,  you know, we love the home page because that's the thing we control.  The other two, we don't control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm saying that we account for one to five percent of their revenue.  Random like Gadget Freaks reading the site every day  or not reading the site or reading by RSS.  I'm saying this aid, this silent majority is like 80, 85 percent is like not.  So it's not designed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes, I agree.  But then why do they put so much effort into a beautiful home page?  Yeah, good question.  You know, I almost argue that you shouldn't have a home page, right?  Google doesn't have a home page. Right. It is a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess you do a home page because, I mean, you got to you got to cover the bases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but the way it works inside places, people go berserk about the home page.  This is the math point.  And they don't pay nearly enough attention to the pages that people actually come to  and the only ones people experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is the future something like this?  This is Washington Post social reader embedded in Facebook.  Is that the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's part of the future.  Someone when I was behind the NDA wall at Google kind of made fun of it  because they said, well, that's just an alternative home page.  But I think that, yeah, when you get down to the article level and, you know,  look what Google Plus has done, it's it's mixing news and conversation.  So how do you get your stuff in that mix?  And how do you how are you given formatting abilities to do that?  That's where I think it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and you go back to your Facebook page and then everybody who's reading  the social reader shows up in the ticker on the right as they as it scrolls by saying,  oh, I was, you know, Gareth's reading this.  Daniel's reading that.  Imogenes listening to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now go to something like music, right?  Where both Google and Facebook, like let your friends listen to what you're listening to.  And that's the new radio airplay. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a smart strategy from Facebook's point of view.  And I wonder if it reflects closer to how people consume content  than how we're moving than a home site or or a news reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  Gina, do you still use a news reader per se?  I mean, you say you got rid of it and go to Twitter.  Do you use it at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use it on Wednesday mornings to prepare for Twig. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right.  Well, we're a special case. But but you're right.  But it's part of our beat check.  Yeah. In the old days of radio news reporting, you do a beat check every morning.  You'd call the fire department, the police department.  That's what we do. We're doing our beat check.  But that's a very specialized use.  Yes. Actually, the truth is, I go to tech meme and news.Google.com.  And that's pretty much it.  I go to the technology news on Google and I go to the tech meme  when I need to find out what happened today.  And the tech mean it was all about signals.  Yeah. It's gay Rivera.  But it's you know, I mean, it's it's it's a specialized form of signals.  And then but then I follow day in, day out.  I'm following Twitter and Google.  Actually, Google Plus has become more and more the place I go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I like the the tone of the conversation there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also a great place to find increasingly a great place to find links.  And it seems to be that memes and other things surface faster on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. At least I see things really fast on Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And more legibly, because the problem with Twitter is it's cryptic.  Yes. I can't figure out what the hell I'm reading.  I'm getting old.  I don't understand all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's good for conversation.  Why can't you speak English?  Speak English.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's great for conversation.  I posted a problem I was having with with some think of development  a couple of weeks ago.  I got, you know, I had the privilege of having a lot of being a lot of circles  because Google put me on their suggested list.  I got like 90 comments, all of some great suggestions.  Totally solved my problem.  Posted a follow up thanking everyone.  Like, it's just a really good place to do kind of Q&A, asking for suggestions  and just get, you know, getting into conversations about things.  Not in a way that you just can't do on Twitter.  And because it's, you know, super tech nerds on Google Plus,  it's just conversations you couldn't have on Facebook. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not going to last.  Not if Google has anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, not if. Yeah. If things go Google's way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's audience selection.  That's the same thing with Quora, right?  People say Quora is great.  If you're Silicon Valley startup with problems about your servers,  you get awesome answers in 20 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did you handle that on Metafilter?  Because that's the same exact thing happened with Metafilter. Right.  What? Well, initially, Metafilter was a geek community.  It's still a pretty geeky community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's it's fine.  I mean, we meter sort of the sign up.  So like this, the crowd isn't too big.  So there's like 10 to 12000 people using the site every day and answering questions.  So that's we found that's like a big enough number where chances are two or three  people have experienced whatever you could possibly imagine they're asking about.  But it's not so much.  Yeah, I always think like 10000 people is a good number because everyone's done  everything or had experience with everything.  And then it's not so much that you're like Yahoo Answers  yelling into the void of strangers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's an important moment.  We have the Dunbar number number.  We just got the Howie number, how we number 10000, but you know,  1000 is enough experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm speaking on Tuesday to PubCon, which is a big marketing SEO conference in Vegas.  And one of the things that I want to talk about is we do have it's kind of in in  in the air that you should get bigger.  You should grow your audience.  Your eyes should always get bigger, whether it's media, websites, Metafilter,  Google Plus.  Bigger is always better.  More people means more revenue.  Grow it bigger.  But I think there's a really big question about culture and and focus.  And I think, Matt, you hit the nail on the head.  There's a size.  Maybe it's 10000.  You don't want to get bigger than that because it I think that's right, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it goes with media, too, because it's the old myth of media that we sold was  that every reader saw every ad.  And so we wanted ever more readers.  We could charge ever more for the ads.  Well, that's not the case anymore.  When you the only people who see the ads are the people who look at that page and  that ad is there for a reason.  And so can you become too big?  Yes, I've seen one site that has the pursuit of page views, got them to go crazy on  SEO and got them to bring in all kinds of irrelevant traffic, right?  The cost bandwidth and gives them no revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's what happened to tech TV is what happens to every TV network.  And and that's why Bravo sucks and Discovery sucks.  And it's one of the things that I realized here at Twit and we do not want to grow.  Wow, we are we do not most media.  They say, how can I get more audience?  Well, I do not want more audience.  I want to an audience that I know how to serve.  That's a very specific, unique audience.  I don't want to grow past that.  People say, why don't you do more marketing?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I'm not going to.  Well, but but your new properties, you're going to the Howie rule here, right?  There's I presume the twig still wants to grow some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we don't want it to make it look as more than 10000.  But so our number is not the Howie number.  But but there maybe is another number for broadcast media.  And actually, I think it depends on the niche that you're in.  But I want I want to I only want to grow to the extent that we serve the people  we're you know, if you're the kind of person that would like this, then sure.  But I'm not going to change this to to increase the number of people who like.  Right, right, right. I like that.  That's really interesting.  It's a very different way of looking at media.  I don't think it's typical.  No, not at all. No, I think it's unique.  And I think the number in in podcasting, if I hate that word,  but is more around one hundred fifty to two hundred fifty thousand.  That's the that that's the media number.  And that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting.  I definitely struggle with that at Lifehacker, you know, this constant pressure  to go more mainstream, and I think it really resulted in some, you know,  lower quality content definitely did.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It takes some courage and frankly, some willingness not to become a mogul  to say no.  But but in the long run, you make you do better because you know that audience  to serve that audience well.  Advertisers know what they're getting.  You're getting an engaged audience, not a halfway awake audience.  It just makes sense to me.  And I think this is why I'll never get investors, right?  Yeah, but that's fine. OK.  Yeah. And I don't want investors because I know that one of the things  investors do is say grow.  That's how they that's the whole idea.  Grow our investment.  So that's why we don't want investors.  We've always wanted to just serve that niche properly.  And and now I think the niche grows because there's more and more people  interested in tech, more and more and more of these tech enthusiasts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and more topics based on your platform.  Yeah. But we're going to do a gaming show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's you know, that grows it into a different area.  But it's still aimed at enthusiasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that's the perversion of both media and investment then.  Exactly. I would I would love this is a hint.  I would love to invest in Twitter, right, as an annuity.  Think of it more that way.  Yes, I own a share of it and you keep on making money and I keep on getting checks,  which thank you very much again anyway.  But right. But in terms of an investment structure  that if you're a new media business, like my entrepreneurial students,  you could live that way.  But I had to separate content businesses from platforms or as Reid Hoffman  described it to me, entrepreneurial from free agent nation.  You're more in creating a world of free agent nations where Twitter and Twig  and and Android and so on are all on a platform and all have a model,  but all have a limited size. That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it goes well beyond that to the whole notion of sustainable growth  in general, because we have this crazy notion that progress means growth.  And and we have seven billion people on this planet now.  We you know, there is a limited there's a finite set of resources.  There's a finite set of room.  There's a finite set of water.  There's a finite set of oil and and unlimited continual growth  at an exponential level breaks everything.  And there's actually we had a we did an interview with them.  It was fascinating on I think it was on Dr. Kiki Science Hour.  There's a whole movement.  Not much listened to because no president, no government.  Nobody's going to go with this.  Right. To say, wait a minute, is is unfettered growth the right way to go?  And it isn't in any respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or is it even possible anymore?  It is.  My South by Southwest talk is going to be Honey, we shrunk the economy.  Yeah. That argues that I think we discussed this before,  but the technology leads to efficiency overgrowth.  So you can't wish for growth anymore when things like retail  and media are shrinking by their new architecture. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  South of Southwest might be a good example of something that can grow too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good point. Really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry. I love you, but no, they violated the Howie rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, totally.  Well, we're you know what?  I don't go to it anymore.  Humans are greedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too much. Humans are greedy.  We always want more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But when it when it kind of ruins the experience,  it ruins it. Comic Con is the same thing.  You know, like it's I think, you know, events that get too popular  and they just keep kind of keep upping the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, what do you do then about the exclusivity issue  that people want to participate in this and they can't because na na na.  I mean, because I'm a veteran or I got in early.  That's a problem, too, though, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. I mean, I'm to the point where I just I'm like opting  like very consciously opting to out of those really huge events  and looking for the smaller sort of more up and coming events,  which, you know, are just a better better  just because they're a better experience.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what the solution is for South by.  I don't know if it's live streaming or, you know, doing some remote.  But but I think they would do really well to to maybe focus on a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need a north by east by and a west by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I want to start a business that puts the control of deciding  to do events in the hands of the speakers, organizers, whatever you call it.  Right. And and the people formerly known as the audience and takes it  out of the hands of the conference organizers and takes it out of the hands  of the speakers, bureaus and all that.  And so you could, you know, see if you have critical mass for a north by  in Kickstarter and start an event.  That's your own event.  You know, I looked at Pop.  Pop Tech is going to Iceland and I would die to go to Iceland.  I'd love to go to that.  But then I look at the price of five thousand bucks and I say, Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I think I think just having new events, I think new events can spring out  of frustration from people like myself and Matt, who are just like,  I'm not going to South by Southwest, but I'm going to go to, you know,  I don't know, Max Funcon or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you go to South by this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, you two are the reason why I went last year.  We want to do Twig from there.  I know. We'll talk about this.  Can you just go this year?  And we'll forget it next year.  They're actually for the meat dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they're actually unfortunately fairly arrogant, too,  which adds to the mess of it, because, for instance, they asked me  if I would host, I know there's some, you know, kind of a startup thing  they're doing the two days with the startup stuff.  And we said, yeah, we'd love to if you would get if we could get badges  for our staff to the to the conference and if you could help us  book a room for our event there.  And they said, oh, no, we're not going to give you anything.  We just want you to do two days.  I said, oh, never mind, because I'm not going to do that.  It's like there's a certain like we're South by.  You should just do this.  So anyway, I don't buy that.  That's dirty laundry. I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, Leo, Leo, Leo, you've got to go into the event business.  No, I don't see.  You see what the pressures are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's exactly it. I'm sticking to my knitting, baby.  You know, Steve Jobs came in when when he came back to Apple  and he went up on the whiteboard and he drew a quadrant for things.  Apple had like 20 products.  He said four products, consumer pro portable desktop.  That's it. And it was brilliant. Right.  Simplify, streamline. We don't need to grow.  We just want to serve our audience better.  And if you know, if the problem that South by has, I don't think South by  lost sight of its goals, I think they're still doing it.  It's just that the number of people who wanted to go got out of control.  And that's a normal evolution.  I don't think that that's something you could blame the South by.  I don't know. Maybe you can. I don't know them.  But I don't think that that's something you blame the organizers for.  So there's different kinds of growth.  And I could see us getting too big.  You know, if we had 20 million people with all different constituencies  and different that we couldn't manage it.  Matt. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think South by Southwest, the organizers,  they're serious about it. They could have, you know, they could  have basic economics up the price to five hundred bucks from two hundred  or make it a thousand bucks like a normal tech conference.  Bring the numbers down to something manageable.  I mean, it was just there's lines everywhere.  It's hard to get food. I mean, it's just impossible.  It's just going off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that because that makes it more exclusive.  I don't think being more exclusive is a good idea.  I think, you know, look at Ted.  What is it? Five thousand dollars.  No lines at Ted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And invitation only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You get to sit down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get invited to spend five thousand dollars.  And obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's yeah, that's not that doesn't improve accessibility.  So I think really the way to title South by is exactly what you said,  which is divided into more conferences.  Spread it out. Spread the wealth.  Hey, we got to take a break.  God, we're already like an hour into the show and I haven't done one commercial.  Can I can I do a commercial just quickly and then we'll get on.  There's so much to talk about.  I know we have three and there's a fly.  Where do these flies come from?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tom killed a fly on the air when.  Really? Like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That we wouldn't have a lot to talk about.  Who is the guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who is the guy who was at jobs or was it Bill Gates who just caught a fly  like that in an interview?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was Obama. It was the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we bring him in here to catch these flies?  Tom can do it for you. He's done it.  Surely he has.  He needs something to do right now.  Go to meeting.  No, put it up there. That's good.  That's exactly what I wanted to talk about.  Ladies and gentlemen, our friends at Citrix are give us the wherewithal to do this.  And one of the reasons they don't care, they're not looking for a hundred million people.  They they know that the people who watch this show are their best potential customers  because you're savvy and you use technology to help you get your jobs done,  get on with life.  And this is what GoToMeeting is all about.  It's an online meeting service.  Okay, we know those are great.  It's very fast, very secure, very easy to use Mac or PC completely cross-platform.  You're by the way, the people who do the GoToMeeting, you know, that you go to,  like if you're doing a sales call, they don't have to have it installed ahead of time.  You don't have to support them.  You just give them a link.  We're going to have a meeting at two o'clock on Thursday.  They click the link.  Thirty seconds later, they're seeing your screen.  And now with the new HD faces, they're seeing you and you're seeing them.  GoToMeeting has added video.  So this is this is stuff.  This is as good as the dedicated tele presence systems that are being sold for tens,  twenties, hundreds of thousands of dollars to big businesses.  You got it right now and you got it in your laptop.  You got it in your desktop and you even have it in your iPad.  They can't hold a meeting on your iPad, but you can attend a meeting on your iPad.  You don't even need a phone.  You just plug in your microphone and your earbuds and the sound, the video,  the whole thing is happening on your iPad.  I just think it's just the best way to make your business more efficient,  to get more done, travel less and make your meetings more engaging,  more personal with that video.  I love that.  Try it right now.  Absolutely free on your Mac or your PC.  Visit go to meeting dot com.  Use the offer code twig.  If you decide to buy, you're going to.  Well, you got 30 months free.  And if you decide to buy, I think it's $49 a month.  It's nothing.  Nothing.  It's really affordable.  And I also want to underscore that the iPad app is absolutely free.  So anybody can attend your meeting for free.  Go to meeting on iPad on Mac or PC.  Go to meeting dot com.  Use the offer code twig.  Enough said.  I won't belabor the point.  So there's nothing to talk about, huh?  We talked about Google Reader.  We talked about Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although we should mention the iOS app that came out for G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was out for three seconds.  It came out.  Oh, bye.  God, we'd lost everybody.  Is it just you and me now, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We take over.  I got rid of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're all dead now.  They're all dead to me.  Yeah, the Gmail for iOS for iPhone and iPad.  Apparently, people were raving about it.  I know M.G. C.  It really was gone in a flash.  And it was gone.  And apparently, there's a bug in notifications.  That has to do with iOS 5.  Here's the official Gmail blog.  Earlier today, Matt Isaac writes,  we launched a new Gmail app for iOS.  Unfortunately, it contained a bug which broke notifications  and caused users to see an error message when opening the app.  That's not what you want.  So we removed the app while we correct the problem.  Oh.  And we're with you.  I have a screenshot of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do?  Is it bad?  Yeah.  It was annoying and weird.  Where is that?  Put it on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't believe that Apple didn't catch this.  I'm sorry.  Skype just crashed on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't believe nobody caught it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No one caught it.  It's so crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you excited about it?  We have on Android, all of us who use Android,  have very nice native Gmail apps.  And by the way, they updated both the Gmail app  and the Google Plus app on Android now.  It's really sweet.  You can do a Hangout now on your Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very cool.  Yay.  Yay.  Loving that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  The native app was always one of the reasons  why I really like Gmail or Android.  Excuse me, over iOS.  Even though I have to say, the web app interface on the iPad  is actually quite nice.  So yeah, I'm excited about this, having a native app on iOS.  Although I didn't get to download it  before they pulled it.  So hopefully, it'll show up again soon.  Matt, did you find your screenshot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm uploading to Flickr right now.  What's weird is the Android app feels like just a wrapper  for the web version of it.  And that's definitely what they did with Gmail on the iPhone.  It just feels like a wrapper for the website.  I use the website all the time.  It's a bit nicer.  I don't know why.  I like the Android version so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is ugly.  No valid APS environment entitlement string  found for application.  OK.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course, the APS environment entitlement.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like, did they not check that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How would you not see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't.  Yeah.  Especially this had to be in review for a few days, at least.  It was, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it also reminds me, whenever I powered up  my Android phone, which I only use sporadically,  I'd get some Google Maps XML error,  like the first time I turned it on, always.  I don't know why.  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't want to see that, especially on an iPhone.  So Matt, you're an iPhone user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I sort of have Android stuff for testing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting.  I've been using the iPhone 4S.  I really like Siri, and I'm going to stick with it,  mostly because I use Siri all the time.  But then I pulled out the Galaxy.  I've been using it for a week, and I pulled out the Galaxy S2,  and the screen is so much nicer.  And I compared it to the iPhone.  I know it's not a retina display.  The DPI is not up there.  Better than the retina display.  Yeah.  Blacks are black, much blacker.  The color and the contrast is so much better.  And the size.  I have the Sprint one, so it's 4 and 1 half inches.  I like the size.  Interesting.  It's a little disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We should talk about Google TV, because Matt writes TV.  Google TV, Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to finally make my $300 investment.  Almost worth it.  It's $99 now for the, now Matt has the Sony one.  You and I have the Logitech review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And Matt also has every other DVR that's on the market,  because he writes PVR blogs.  So he knows how Google TV actually compares  to everything else that's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A first sustainable blog.  Yeah, I have like seven devices or something hooked up  to my TV.  But I only use Google TV to play flash video.  That's it.  Like flash online video is the only,  I mean it's like $200 or $300 just to play flash random.  And I mean, I'm like a, I listen to,  I mean I watch a lot of weird niche, you know,  like TV feeds from Europe, you know,  or in this little flash player on some Belgium site.  And that works fine.  Everything works with Google TV.  What is this we're looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the new interface?  Yes, it will be.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  It's that thing along the bottom.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the interface?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's just that screen in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, oh, god.  I'm just going like, I don't want that on my screen.  Now, I think that one of the things I really actually  do like after using every, and I like you, Matt,  I've used every set top box from the Western Digital Live  to the Roku, Plex, Boxee Box.  Of course, it's nice you can get porn on Boxee Box,  so I got to commend them for that.  But the nice thing about the Google TV  is it doesn't use an HDMI port.  It's a pass through.  And I kind of like that.  So you have your cable box goes to the Google TV, which  then goes to your TV.  So it's a little confusing.  And I hope they fix this in 3.1, because when  the screen saver goes on in the Google TV,  suddenly you can't watch your TV.  And my family doesn't understand that, oh, you've  got to get that keyboard out and press a button on the keyboard  before you can watch the TV.  It's all your fault.  Took me like eight weeks to figure it out.  And I actually disconnected it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't pipe my G everything through the Google TV.  I just use it as a different device.  It works OK.  Yeah, it works good.  I mean, I just use it as a Chrome web browser on TV.  It's basically all I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, see, that's the idea is that you don't  have to exit your TV to browse.  You're browsing and watching TV, which of course  is really stupid.  But it was because, and I don't know if Sony does this,  the Logitech, because it's basically a Harmony,  you tell it what your TV is and what your set-top box is,  and you control everything from that keyboard, volume,  on, off, everything, pause.  And so you know what, actually I brought it out  because I'm waiting for the 3.1, and I kind of thought,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this isn't that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At $99, I think it's almost a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be so much better, though.  I mean, I keep thinking about all the apps  that I want on my TV.  Well, won't we get that?  Yeah, I mean, I actually, I haven't had a TV with apps.  I know there are TVs with apps out there now.  Doesn't Sony have a TV with kind of an app store?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I keep thinking about all the apps  I wish that I had on my TV.  There's so many times when I'll be watching a show  and I'll see an actor or an actress and be like,  what was she on before?  I just want to be able to pause and do some magical face  recognition and just bring up the IMDB page  kind of right there on screen.  And also, I am dying to get a good insta paper for my TV.  So whenever I come across a YouTube video  that I want to watch later on my TV,  I want to just be able to send it to something  and have it just show up.  And Plex does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plex does that.  You queue them up, and then you go home and you watch TV.  This is going to be my tool of the week,  is Plex on the Google TV.  But that's what you want to add.  And I think we're, I really thought Apple would do this.  They didn't do it with Apple TV yet.  But I really think that that's where Google has a chance  to really revitalize this is by, look, they've got a market.  And this is on your TV.  You got Twitter, you got Flickster,  you got all this stuff.  And I think there's a, I cannot wait to see 3.1 on here.  I wish it were ice cream sandwich.  But I can't wait to see.  I think there's a potential here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't wait to see it either.  Hopefully.  Hopefully by Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm hoping by next week.  I was hoping we could talk about it this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can watch us on it.  You just can't watch ABC, Fox, Sci-Fi, those bastards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you can watch it live without Twitter TV, right?  That's Flash.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't watch the networks because they  say it's not a browser.  That's a Google TV.  What is wrong with them?  Jeff, you must know.  What the hell is wrong?  Why would ABC say I can watch it on this,  but not on my Google TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell's wrong with them?  So we've got to parse that, right?  They don't want to give Google, well, is it ABC,  or is it the MSO?  It's a bunch of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's ABC.  Because OK, so I could go.  I used to, in the first day, the first day you got your Google  TV a year ago, you would surf to ABC,  and you could watch the shows.  You could go to Hulu and watch the shows.  Because you have a browser with all the capabilities.  Then they started looking at the user agent and saying,  oh, you're coming to us from a Google TV.  X-Nay on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's where it is, right?  It disaggregates the channel.  Because they show you on Google TV, search for a show,  go right to the show.  Who cares what channel is on?  There's no such thing as a channel.  But I'm in the browser.  That's the point.  Oh, I see it.  You're looking at ABC.  I'm looking at the ABC website.  Right, but in the long run, where  Google, the search company will head, is you want to see that actor?  Well, here's where they are.  And I'll take a right to it.  And you'll have less sense of the, I guess that's their fear.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also, ABC is saying, should we hand over full video control  to the largest ad company on the planet,  and just hope for the best that they don't just put text ads  on the bottom of our little ABC streaming video?  I don't know.  I think they didn't like the competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I imagine with the market launched in the new update,  that there will be plenty of apps that can change your user agent string.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you could do that before.  And apparently, they're pretty smart about what they look at.  I don't know how they know, but they could tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they also they announced all these new players.  Look at all the new stars on YouTube.  And it's kind of, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that, the YouTube, 100 YouTube channels.  They overpaid.  And what is the Shaquille O'Neal comedy channel?  What is that going to be?  That's it. It's the Shaq comedy channel.  Laugh.  Laugh, damn you.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We're going to talk about Ford, then we're going to talk some more about other stuff.  Matt Howey's here from Metafilter.  And I didn't know this, the PVR blog, which I've read all the time.  And you're very on the PVR blog, you're very self-effacing.  It doesn't have a big Matt Howey's PVR blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Well, I actually sold it a couple of years ago,  and then I just bought it back like two weeks ago.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was the first, Matt, wasn't it the first revenue sustainable blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  And I wrote it. I was dumb enough to write a big post saying, hey, everybody,  there's how you make money with the blogs.  And then they figured it out.  There are five clones of it.  Like within two months, there are five different like Tivo blogs.  And then the revenue started to go down.  But yeah, like a couple of years ago, I had been posting to it for months.  So I just, yeah, that's what my remote.  Your remotes look like my remotes.  Yeah, I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boxy. I see them all.  These are all the ones I have, except for the Sony piece of crap.  I like it.  I have a keyboard, but it's a little big.  It's crazy to have a keyboard on your coffee table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's just that one's like PlayStation controller size.  Actually feels great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but the keyboard is real.  I mean, you could type easily.  You know, it's just I don't know. I like the keyboard.  Anyway, this is great. Congratulations.  I didn't realize you had reacquired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I sold it to this little  email marketing company.  I knew that was kind of dodgy.  But they they were like, we've never done content before.  It can't be that hard.  I gave them all these tips. I showed my RSS list.  I told them how to I spent two days working with them.  And then they never made a single post for two years.  They just said they said we don't have the time.  So I offered them a fraction of what they paid for it.  And they said, sure. Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, you made money on the deal. Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a profit thing.  By the way, is your health OK?  Did the tumor go? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm told. Yeah, it's shrunk and I'm doing great.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're on the cancer side of the show today.  No, no, no, no, it wasn't.  It wasn't cancer. It wasn't cancer.  All right. So Gina and I are.  That's my exclusive.  The hammer has fallen on you two.  Gina, I've got enough for everybody.  We're just waiting for it to hit us.  Yeah, it's just a matter of time.  We're all dying. It's just how fast.  Exactly.  I know a light's going to fall any day now and hit me in the head.  Hey, this show is brought to you by and thank goodness  because they can because of them, we can afford safety chains on our lights.  So Ford's keeping me alive, ladies and gentlemen,  the great folks at Ford.  They are very proud of the fact that Ford's vehicles  are basically consumer electronics devices.  I mean, until Ford came along, you'd get in a car  and basically you'd be going back to the 19th century.  You know, you have a steering wheel, a stick, a brake, and that's it.  And you turn on the radio and you can hear top 40 radio.  Now, thanks to this amazing stuff, they put the Ford SYNC, the MyFordTouch,  you're driving, you know, Kit, the wonder car.  You know, I've talked before how I could talk to my car.  Now with with AppLink, they've got an API for apps.  Alan Mullally told me he said we cannot our iterative process cannot be as fast  as the smartphone guys.  They really every year they come up or in case Android every five minutes,  they come up with something new and exciting.  So they've got an API.  People can write apps for smartphones, apples or androids  that then you can talk to and communicate with.  So the first three are already out.  Pandora, that was the obvious one.  So you can actually talk to Pandora.  You press the button on your steering wheel.  You don't take your eyes off the road, your hands off the wheels.  It's very safe.  And that's the problem with Siri.  You have to push the button on Siri.  This no, you press the button on the steering wheel.  And you could say things like play my classic rock station  or bookmark this song so I could buy it later or thumbs up or thumbs down.  On Pandora, that's got open beak.  So it'll read you your tweets, your timeline, your replies.  It's got Stitcher Smart Radio.  So you can create an audio magazine of podcasts  so you can listen to this show.  And it's it's absolutely the best way to listen to Twitter.  And it's Leo endorses Stitcher on the app link.  I just think it's fantastic.  But there's all sorts of other things, too.  I mean, what I encourage you to do is go to this website,  Ford.com, technology.  Look at the new engines, the sync, the my Ford touch.  You know, they've got a great thing here.  Where is it? It's my key for teenagers.  That makes you can set a maximum speed and a maximum volume  of the stereo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turn that stereo down, you punk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you need you need paper that supports hyperlink.  Clicking, clicking on links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  So we talked about the YouTube thing.  Who are besides Shaq, Madonna?  They're also bringing networks, right?  Or not. Is it just individuals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's onions that are included.  The onion. See, that'll be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But doesn't the Onion News Network already, like, just have a channel?  I mean, what is it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're just throwing it in there. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's going to be the lean back experience, right?  Or not. The idea.  I don't know. Is this for this is to receive updates  about the new channels joining YouTube as they launch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's evening here at the Twitbrick house.  And now all the lights are out so we can watch the new  Shaquille O'Neal Comedy Hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Starring Shaquille.  You got to wonder, OK, so they said what, 100 million dollars?  You got to wonder how long Madonna, Shaq,  how long are these guys going to do put up with this? Yeah.  I mean, is this going to is this going to be a long term?  Most of this is crap.  I'm looking at it right now.  Most I'm not going to I'm not going to name names.  Because I don't want people to think I think they're crap.  But most of this does not look good.  Yeah, I agree. American Hipster, comedic channel  exploring pop culture through the lens of hipsterism.  Oh, yeah, I'll be watching that a lot.  They've got a channel food named to be determined.  Channel auto named to be determined.  Channel pets and animals named to be determined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm guessing this is out of the purchase of next  to networks and their kind of platform.  A lot of this a lot of this is some of their old shows are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess if I guess it's kind of what I was saying,  if you're super serving a niche audience, like if you're into soccer, kick TV  will be great, except I bet they don't.  Will they have games?  Or will they just be commentary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would just be people talking while you're waiting for a goal

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not a soccer fan.  Which is a long time.  I can tell. Yes.  Wow. It's a little slow for me.  We've added a rim shot and cricket.  Talk about production value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, sad trombone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, I'm not saying I'm mad at YouTube for not including us,  but I think this is the production values.  Look at the circuit board, the production.  This is a high production value program.  You know who's on there? SB Nation, the formerly known as SB Nation.  I guess I have to rename that show.  The people who own The Verge.  Oh, Stan Lee's World of Heroes.  OK, the five people in the audience like Stan Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about Kevin Pollock's chat show?  I always see that show up on every system is sort of the.  Yeah, no, I don't see that on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting.  I think it's clear that there's throwing everything on against the wall  and then what will stick and what won't stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the business deal for these guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think it's I think they're thinking long term  that they basically YouTube wants to be.  I don't even want to broadcast network wants to be a cable network.  Broadcast network wants to be a cable network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right before the channels.  Are they getting payment?  Are they getting a share of bad revenue?  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said one hundred million dollars is one hundred channels.  Each of them get a million dollars.  I don't know.  I think the deal, I mean, YouTube Live, the deal is they it's an ad.  It's an ad network. They put the ads on your show.  Because we talked to YouTube Live and they said, well, you have to take all  the ads out of your show.  And I said, but wait a minute, that's I said, who's going to do this?  CNN is going to take the ads out of CNN  so that they can be on YouTube Live.  I don't think so.  I said, you're going to get all these down market people who don't have any ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Sirius takes the ads out of CNN, in fact, and puts their own trucker ads in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, maybe that's OK.  So CNN does that then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but if that's you know, if that's different because it's a car,  if most if too many CNN listeners switched over to Sirius,  that'd be really bad.  That'd be a problem. Right.  So same for you.  If too many people started watching you on Google, unless they pay you  a lot more higher rates.  Yeah. But this goes back to your do not grow.  Right. So that's why we're not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Maps kind of a whole little fast one.  They pulled the far the pull the rug out from under a couple of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what happens scares me that they've been hanging around with a phone company  too long because they announced that heavy users will now get charged,  which kind of sounds logical, except that Google Maps has been free  for how long with no warning of this.  And that's the that's the monopoly fear that people have about Google,  is they're going to get you addicted to something.  And suddenly, Bing, now they're going to, you know, put down the turnpike on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you're using version three of the JavaScript API or the Static's Map API,  you'll be capped at twenty five thousand a day.  And if you go past twenty five thousand views, you'll have to pay four dollars  per thousand. So if you had  fifty thousand views, that'd be four times  hundred bucks. It wouldn't be that bad.  Hundred bucks. If you had I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you're if you're.  It's it's it's the principle of the thing. Right.  So so that revenue is de minimis to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Matt, your math skills are excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I ask that's why he has the howie.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cap is set to twenty five hundred loads for styled maps  that customize the presentation after twenty five thousand loads.  The overage goes to eight dollars.  If you if you I guess if you modify it in any way per thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a feeling like whenever you release any sort of widget  or JavaScript include of anything, any you get lists like,  you know, ninety nine percent of your audience, it loads five times a day.  A few people loads a couple hundred times a day.  And there's always like two psychotically heavy users. Right.  You know, millions like your servers are dedicated to that one outside service.  So I imagine, yeah, I imagine there's like four or five mapping startups  that were just piggybacking on Google Maps and, you know,  probably had some decent revenue.  And Google's saying, hey, you know, maybe you can scale it back a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did say that this is really for people who are peaking, you know,  it not they're not for people, occasional peaks,  as people who are always over the limit all the time.  So I think that that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like what what what must be like? God, yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good. It's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. People there are people, as you say, who built a business on their maps.  Yeah. Yeah, they should be giving you some money.  I don't I don't think that's unreasonable.  It's just kind of a switcheroo with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's the switcheroo when it happened.  You know, it there was no hint ever they were going to do this.  It's not revenue that's going to matter to Google.  And so but they got you by the neck or another body part.  And and now they do it.  And that's going to I think that's going to backfire on them  when it comes to antitrust discussion.  Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a number of people, we were talking about this on Twitter, comparing  today's Google to Microsoft in 1998.  Yeah, it says and they are and Google today is as arrogant as Microsoft is  and as greedy as Microsoft is.  And they're doing the bait and switch that Microsoft used to do.  Well, it's free, it's free, it's free now.  OK, now that we got you hooked and we've killed all the competition.  Pay up. Now, fortunately, there's open street maps.  There are open maps that I imagine will get some traffic out of this.  I love open street maps.  I think it's great.  And it's free, right? I think it is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it'd be interesting to see what happens with the Google Plus API.  Like right now, there's a courtesy cap of a thousand calls a day.  So I wonder if they're going to start out when they start releasing,  you know, making the API more widely available with limits like this.  You know, if it started out this way, hey, you get twenty five thousand calls free  and then after that, you have to pay.  I mean, that's very common.  You know, Twitter famously sort of throttles there.  You know, you get three fifty requests an hour unless you get whitelisted.  I mean, I think that the API limits are totally reasonable.  But but your point that it's been always free up until now.  And now there's, you know, these huge businesses that use these maps  is a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Survey says many parents lie to get their kids on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm the only one here that's not a parent, so I'm interested to hear  what you all think about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the COPPA, the Child Online Protection Privacy Protection Act says it.  You have to have parental cassette if you let children under 13 use your site.  That's why Facebook says you have to be 13 to use Facebook.  But according to this survey by the wonderful Dana Boyd and Dana Boyd.  Yep.  Lots of parents are just saying, oh, don't worry, I'll sign you up or lie or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But data is going back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I've been there when Flickr went from  when they let you tag people, you know, in photos, kind of like Facebook.  You know, I had all these thousands of photos of my daughter on Flickr.  And I went to try and sign up a Yahoo account for her.  And then it's like, oh, you get to the entire sign up  and then you get to the point of connecting to Flickr and it goes, yeah, no, you got to be 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I think Yahoo says 18, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I backed out of it.  And then a friend whose son, it was like three, is on there as a user.  It's like, what did what did you do?  And she says, I said, you know, I took 10 years off his birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's this debate going on Google Plus right now.  Should Google Plus allow under 18 users?  And they had somebody did a poll and was 61 percent said, no,  we don't want the kiddies on here.  So Dana's research, why parents help their children,  help their children lie to Facebook at age, unintended consequences  of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act found that many parents  knowingly allow their children to lie about their age, in fact, often help them  to do so in order to gain access to age restricted sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the issue of the unexpected consequences of this kind of regulation.  I wrote a piece at Time.com about this, but two weeks ago,  and then new data was coming out with this, which is superb research  because it says that the FTC is trying and the FTC is now going to toughen this.  A site can use information about a child in any way,  only if you get the explicit permission of the parents and only if that comes  and printing out a document and scanning it or faxing it.  Remember that or a video conference with the company and its owners.  And I asked the FTC attorney over this in a call with the Future  Privacy Forum whether they had any research about lying.  They didn't know data because they had no research about how much parents use this.  But my biggest concern is that because of this legislation,  sites do not build anything for anyone under 13, which makes children  the worst served sector of society on the Internet.  And that is a tragedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dana says parents want their kids to have access to public life.  And what public life means is participating even in commercial social  media sites. Listen to this for kids who are under 13 when they signed up,  68% of the parents said, yeah, we helped them sign up among 10 year olds.  95% of the parents were not only aware of their kids using the service, 78% of them  helped them 78% helped them create the account.  So parents now, I don't think it's troubling because I always told my kids  lie all you want to online marketers.  We'll make more. It's not a problem.  If somebody asks you, if a stranger comes up to you on the street and asks you,  where do you live, little girl? It's OK to lie.  If a marketer comes on a website and says, what's your age and demographic?  It's OK to lie. Lie to them. Be my guests. Right.  Is that immoral? Am I wrong? Dana seems to think it's a bad thing.  No, no, no. What Dana is saying is she says is deeply problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The kids and parents are lying because what we're doing is we're training our  kids to lie. We are the what she's talking about is the validity of compa of this  law. Well, I understand saying it's not doing what it's supposed to do.  And I was at a session recently and people, well, what should we do?  And Dana is the one who taught me that you should regulate the use of the data  more than the collection of the data by regulating the collection of the data.  We all lose out. All children lose out by regulating bad guys.  You go after the bad guys. And that's what's happened here.  So so what she's saying is that this legislation, I don't want to put any  words in her mouth, but what I would come out of this with is that this  legislation and the regulation that followed had this doesn't know what the  harm they're trying to protect from is. And parents don't obviously don't want  it. Right. So what are we doing? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only 18 percent of parents surveyed said they thought the government should have  age limits on websites. That's not what they wanted.  They wanted information. They want to control. They didn't want prohibition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's that's the parents.  The other point is the parents job, not the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I still think it's now maybe I'm ethically challenged.  I guess I should say it's never OK in under any circumstances to lie.  But what I told my kids all along is it's OK to lie to bad guys.  Isn't that OK? It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. But is is a media.  But what happens here is that is the media site or the service like Facebook  gets thrown in with the bad guys where you imagine.  Well, that's true. That's a good point.  Here's an example. Let's let's say that you're an educational site and you want  to do a geography game.  You want to deal with the geography that the kid knows.  You start and say, well, what town do you live in?  Loser. Right. Right. You're going to get in big trouble and you have to go through  all kinds of hoops. So what do you do?  You don't do it. You don't ever serve a child that age.  That's the problem. So so that the good guys here are are not motivated  to serve this audience and they stay away.  And they they and so we've expanded stranger danger to make every adult on  Earth evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crucial Act says it right.  It's not lying. It's keeping personal information secret through misinformation.  Yes. How about that?  That's good. That's good. I like that.  Kids do it all the time. They say they're 100 years old all the time on MySpace or  whatever. That's that's just what they do.  I don't think that they see that as lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I wonder how much about this is about online marketers and about sort of  adult content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, I would like to see the comparison of parents who let their under 17 kids see  R-rated movies or play like mature and for mature rated video games as compared to  this number.  I mean, it's not like I wouldn't let my kids do that.  Well, right. And that's interesting, right?  Because you because you you you're you're very experienced on the Internet.  You know what happens on the Internet.  A lot of these parents said, you know, you know, you're not going to be able to  you know, what happens on the Internet.  A lot of these parents said, you know, my computer is in the family room and I'm  friends with my kid and I see everything that I could post to his or her wall.  And I monitor who my friend who my kid is friends with on Facebook.  So and it's my responsibility to do that.  And that's why I feel comfortable lying.  Right. And so in the case of an R-rated movie, maybe, you know, the parent goes in  with the kid or the parent says that that's not OK.  But but but there's this idea, you know, and Jeff knows that connecting on the  Internet is a good thing. Right.  It's not it's not automatically a bad thing.  The predators aren't automatically going to descend upon your kid.  Right. That this is this is about participation in public life in a positive  way. Right. And that's I think Dana's point.  Right. That this law that was made so many years ago has to be revisited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's fix it. Nobody like that law from day one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was always a bad idea. And Facebook is more of a messaging platform anyway now.  So it's like my aunt announced our family reunion on Facebook.  I had no idea. My entire my 10 year old cousins are on Facebook.  They're all there. I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they'd be disenfranchised if they weren't there.  And there's no porn on Facebook.  There's no adult stuff on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Leo, I snuck into The Graduate.  And you ever sneak into a time.  All right. So you want your parents, your kids, not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't let them I don't buy them beer.  No, I don't.  No, I think I knew my I try to discourage that.  But I think my kids probably were sneaking in our rated movies.  I'll tell you what.  The Graduate compared to an R rated movie today is a very different thing.  Oh, yeah.  The Graduate. Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't let my parents live that way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, my parents wouldn't let me see I was in 10th grade.  They wouldn't let me see.  Oh, it was Art Garfunkel was in it.  Oh, I can't remember the name of it.  Chat room.  It was it was an R rated movie.  Jack Nicholson.  That's 22. No, no, Jack Nicholson.  Art Garfunkel and I think Ann Margaret is in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, right, right, right, right, right.  Come on, chat room. You can do it. You can do it. Come on. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Mrs. Robinson, are you carnal knowledge?  Thank you. Very good.  Westphal, you win the prize.  Siri would have known that, by the way.  Did you know just the selling point for Siri?  Because Gina, you said you can say Siri,  who starred in carnal knowledge?  And Siri will look it up for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice. Nice.  Selling point for Siri. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's... Oh, one more thing.  As long as we're talking about Facebook.  The folks at MoG, which is a music service,  and I like it, it's one of my favourite music services,  say that they've been struggling along,  there's a lot of competition with Spotify, RDO, Rhapsody,  on and on and on,  by putting their stuff, by joining the Facebook  friction-free sharing platform,  MoG has grown 246%, like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Power platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Power to platform.  All right, we're going to take a break, come back with Gina's tips.  Jeff's Jarvis.  Gina's Trapani, Jeff's Jarvis and Leo's Laporte.  Coming up, but first, quickly,  because we're running out of time, I'm already nine minutes late.  I know. Don't look at me like that, Tom Merritt.  Quickly, carbonite.com, backup done right.  I don't have to tell you about this.  If you're not backing up, what the hell?  What are you, nuts? What are you, crazy?  So I know why you don't back up. It's a pain in the keister.  And you don't, you know, you've got to remember to do it,  you've got to figure it out.  Look, let me make it simple for you.  Go to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIG.  You could try this free for two weeks, Mac or PC.  It starts backing up, you put it on there.  Whenever you're online, boom, 128-bit SSL.  You can add encryption so you're really private.  It just does it.  They'll give you two weeks free because then that's going to get your first...  And by the way, it even chooses the folders automatically.  You can refine this, but frankly, for most users,  just the default settings, you're done, it's working.  Now, if you have a crash, all your data is safe in the cloud.  Your house could burn down, all the backups next to your computer could be gone,  and you still get all your data.  And it's cloud storage. You can log on to your carbonite account  any time, on your PC, on your Mac, on your smartphone, on your iPad,  and there's your stuff.  So cloud storage, automatic, transparent, easy backup, always safe.  How much would you pay? Less than five bucks a month.  Less than five bucks a month.  For everything on your internal drive, everything on your laptop,  everything on your desktop. You don't even have to count the data.  Pretty good deal. I'll make it even better.  If you use the offer code TWIG when you buy, you get two more months,  so it's 14 months for the price of 12.  I mean, I shouldn't have to... This sells itself.  I shouldn't have to sell this to you. Just do it.  If you're not backing up quickly, carbonite.com, offer code TWIG.  Don't even think about it. Just do it.  That's the way to sell something. Don't even think about it.  Just trust me. It works.  I use it. Actually, I went... I was at my daughter's place yesterday,  and I just checked in to make sure the carbonite was still running.  Beauty. Beauty. It's awesome.  Gina, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is pretty cool. Google's being a lot more transparent,  or a little bit more transparent, about why it serves you the ads that it does.  If you do a search for... So, example search,  if you do a search for Galaxy Nexus, for example,  you'll get a couple of ads at the top, regular, just blue link ads,  but there's a new link that says, why these ads?  If you click on that, you'll get a little explanation.  The ads are based on your current search terms,  which is pretty obvious, right?  But you can go... There's now an ads preferences manager,  where you can say, don't ever show me ads from this advertiser again.  You can block certain advertisers, which is really nice.  So, it's pretty cool. I'd like to see this more...  Sometimes I get wacky ads in my Gmail, and I'm just like, how did they...  Where did they come up with that?  So, I'd like to see this roll out everywhere.  Right now, I'm only seeing it in the search results.  But the ads preferences manager is at...  I have to sign in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just happens if you do the search. You don't have to even worry about it.  Just click why these ads,  and then it'll say, visit Google's ad preferences manager to learn more.  And then it shows you the ads you saw.  In this case, Google Nexus, I saw two.  One for Google, and one for Samsung, Verizon.  And you can literally just block it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, you can block certain advertisers,  and you can opt out as well of personalization,  of ad personalization as well.  So...  I don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? Well, they know it's you.  So, opt out. That is pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody should be doing this. Everyone should be doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, more real opt-in users.  More opted-in users are 40% more likely to click on ads than opted-out users.  This is really good. Good on you, Google.  And you know, this costs them nothing,  because this just gives people control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It gives them more valuable data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's the same thing DigDig did that,  whether you could dig up or down ads.  And advertisers paid for that.  Yes, and that's really useful.  Facebook does it too. Block this ad.  Advertisers actually want that information.  They don't want to advertise to people who aren't interested.  That's a waste of their money.  Cool.  So, you don't see it? Are you logged in, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's... Yeah, I am.  That's weird.  Yeah.  That is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there's a nice new thing on...  that I like. Another way that Google Plus is infiltrated.  If you do a search for a Google Plus artist,  I mean, a blogger, you can circle them now.  Let me see here. I'll do Matt Howey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, from the search results.  Yeah, the plusification of everything.  You can search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I'm already connected to you, Matt,  but if I weren't, I could circle you here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can see people's...  like the number of circles that people are in as well.  It doesn't look like Matt hooked up his...  Oh, you haven't hooked it up yet.  But, yeah, I mean, Leo, I bet it works for you, Leo.  I'm hooked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, here's... Oh, there, yeah. Look, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In 150,000 Google Plus circles, she's in two of my circles.  I could add her to other circles.  I just think this is... This doesn't bother me.  I think this is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's cool, but it really...  I mean, it really makes web publishers compels them  to use Google Plus, right?  Well, Facebook's doing these kinds of things.  It attaches authority.  I feel a little weird about attaching authority  to the number of circles you're in,  because then it becomes this popularity contest,  like kind of the Twitter followers issue.  And also, my number's huge,  because Google put me on the suggested user list  because I do the show. That's not fair.  I appreciate sort of organic numbers a little better.  And I hope they'll use a few other factors  to figure out authority and expertise and that kind of thing.  But it is really interesting the way that Plus is kind of creeping into everything.  There's no reason why a web publisher won't join Plus  and try to get into a lot of circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I didn't want to put the like button on my pages,  but you have to. It's just part of the thing now.  You got to do like Plus, Twitter, whatever.  It's a brave new world, isn't it, Matt Howey?  It's exhausting.  It's exhausting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Matt will use Plus, whether he likes it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God. Yeah, just like Facebook.  You have to. I resisted for a long time.  I deleted my Facebook account on this very show.  I wish I could have kept it that way.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My number is 300,000,  which is how many people signed a petition online  to beat down Bank of America's $5 debit card fee.  Molly Catchpole, 22-year-old woman from Washington,  collected $300,000, has kind of occupied the ATM.  And I just think it's another wonderful sign  of the tools of publicness enabling people,  patchy, clay-shirky, organizing with our organizations,  and us controlling the companies.  And yay!  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And similarly, you saw the White House's We the People  online petitions.  They issued their first response to an online petition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which one, the marijuana one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The...  No, it was the student loan one. I'm trying to find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now there's a petition that the White House pay attention to.  I'll sign that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they did. They actually responded to the petition.  The petition was to forgive all student loan debt.  And the response was not to forgive all student loan debt,  but a new policy that reduces payments.  So, really, first example of an online,  kind of online organizing, changing policy,  which excited me because that's what Expert Labs is all about.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina's ThinkUp app is an Expert Labs.  It was actually used by the White House.  I imagine 2012 will be very exciting for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, the White House is separate from the campaign, but yes.  I understand.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you skeptical, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see that hair? Walk over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's an important hair. Let's not denigrate the hair.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  So my tool is Plex.  Plex is a really great piece of software  based on Xbox Media Center, XBMC.  It's a complete rewrite. Very powerful.  It's a media server. You can run it on Android.  You can run it on iPhone. You can run it on your computer.  You should be, if you're using...  If you want to do a home theater PC,  you should be using Plex.  Now it works with Google TV, and this is very exciting.  If you go to the Plex blog, they'll talk about it.  They've added Google TV compatibility.  Now, I'm unclear. I guess this means...  It's $4.99.  I guess what this means is that you have to have the new 3.1.  I'm not sure, because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has to be in market, right? Because it's an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has to be in the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. This is definitely going to be the first app I buy on my TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely a must.  I just read up on Plex to know what the capabilities are,  but you're going to really love this.  So the minute you're...  All three of you who are watching, and that's Matt, me and Gina,  who have Google TV,  you might want to take a look at getting Plex on that right away.  You'll be able to stream over the Wi-Fi or your Ethernet,  all the media in your house, onto your Google TV.  I mean, it's just going to, I think, make Google TV the...  And the Plex people say,  we're really happy.  We believe that this actually runs very well on Google TV.  There's plenty of horsepower.  It handles a surprisingly large number of media formats.  They're pretty excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Plex is open source, and it kind of grew out of a hacked Xbox,  XMCE, which is also an open source product.  So it's got this great history of like...  It's such a good fit for Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Spotify on there, CNN.  I mean, you're going to get a lot more channels,  Revision 3, Twitter, of course, is on Plex.  So this is a really nice way to take your Google TV and amp it up.  And I think you add this to the new Google TV,  you're going to have a very, very nice home theater PC.  Matt will probably be writing about this on the PVR blog any minute now.  Matt, how are we?  As soon as I get the new version.  We're all waiting for it. PVRblog.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't creep me out. It embarrasses me.  I turn red.  I... I... I... I spritz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff's man crush is so cute, though.
