You flew home early just for this. Thank

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you. Yes. I was supposed to be on a noon flight and I got on an 8 a.m. flight out of Heathrow.  It's okay. I'm neurotic and get to airports wildly early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, in Heathrow, the sooner you get there, the better. You should get there the day before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually Terminal 2 with United is nice now. Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Well, yeah.  The rest of it's hell.  Heathrow is only a nightmare if you have to transit, like if you have to go from one airline  to another. Everybody agrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I've got a bad foot right now in the walking, the distances you have to walk are ungodly.  Fine. I'm home. Okay, we're here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No more problems.  Stacy Higginbotham is also here. Great to have you.  Stacy on IOT, our new star.  Love having you on. And look who else we brought just for you.  Ron Amadio from ours, Technica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great to have you too. Always good to have you, Ron. Always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Always fun to be here. Did you have a good Google I.O., Ron?  We haven't talked to you since. Oh, yeah, it was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google I.O. is always like the most fun thing ever.  I'd have I.O. every week if they left it up to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was an interesting I.O. because on the surface it looked like it wasn't really, you  know, it was just a lot of me too products like catch up products.  But I felt like and I think we talked about this last week, it really was almost a a sea  change for Google, almost kind of a course correction to move into machine learning and  smart bots and things like that, smart assistants.  Do you agree or disagree? What did you think of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've been pushing the machine learning thing for a while, I think.  So it was I thought that was just kind of a continuation.  I did think it was interesting that they moved into into smart home stuff like I'm super  pumped about Google Home just because I love the echo, but it's really kind of dumb.  Like you can't you can't get it to answer a lot of questions or anything.  But the for me, the most fun is always just roaming the I guess this year was roaming the  just wandering around and saying hi to people and meeting everyone and doing demos and stuff.  It's always fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel you know, I can't remember if we talked about this last week, we had Kevin Kelly on  actually his interview on triangulation airs Monday right before WWDC coverage.  We taped it last week. I think I don't think we talked about it because I think it but one  of the things he was talking about is machine learning slash artificial intelligence.  And he said, just as when you had electrification, everybody looked at what they were already  doing and added electricity to it.  A farmer would take a pump and say, you know, that would work a lot better if it were electric.  And similarly, the internet, we applied a thin layer of internet to everything from  travel to hotels.  And it changed everything and spurred a whole era of innovation.  He says that's the next thing is applying a thin layer of machine learning to everything.  And that's that's kind of what Google Home is an echo and is putting some machine learning  on these devices makes them a heck of a lot more useful, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Google has a big list of stuff now that does machine learning.  I think it's like the Google Photos search does all sorts of crazy machine vision stuff.  Inbox has smart replies where it will kind of type most of the message for you.  That's all machine learning.  They are doing, you know, their crazy go thing, which they're going to take on.  They did beat the fourth best go player.  Now they're going to try to be the best go player in the world.  So it's going to be the go Super Bowl.  I'm super excited for that.  I hope they bring back the same the same announcers as last time, because they were great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're I loved watching them.  But do you agree, Stacey, that I mean, I think this is where innovation happens, is you take  existing stuff and you add, in this case, intelligence to it.  Well, look at your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. And well, and you could look at everything.  And I think with what Google was talking about is they started putting the story around it.  They've been investing in machine learning for forever years.  And the stuff that people are trying to do with this is freaking amazing.  And. But we also talk about it like it's better than it actually is.  So if people don't actually understand what's happening, they're like, ah, we get all the  conversations about machines taking over the world, killing off the human race.  But we also have these crazy outs, outsized expectations for what it's going to do.  And we're so not there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, just as in 1995, the Internet coding you applied to the thin candy shell, coding  you applied to magazines wasn't so hot.  Oh, sure. But we've come a long way.  Go ahead, Jesse. No, no, I'll let Jeff go and then then we'll go back to Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the big thing that I see is that in a machine learning world, in a conversational  world where it can anticipate your questions, get you answers, it disambiguates media  so much more. There's no need to go to a destination.  There's no need to go to a place to get something that the machine can get it for you  and can dissipate your needs and bring it to you, which is great.  It'd be wonderful. But where where do we put ourselves, support our brands and all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that? Very unknown. And that's what people are struggling with, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you bet. I think there's like Google now, which is not the smartest thing, but it  is smart. That offers me websites that I visit a lot.  It offers me the topics I'm interested in, like Kim Kardashian.  I keep trying not to click on it, but when it shows it, I'm like, oh, you know, but it's  figured that out and it actually figures out the places I go the most.  So in a way, it helps me stay in touch with brands that I might kind of forget about.  So that's the kind of positive side.  I was going to say, though, what we don't know yet is the big shift in monetization, the  big economic shift that's going to come from AI.  So if you think about the Internet as a distribution model and what that did there and  then the way that that was kind of monetized, I'm very curious to see what changes with  AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, monetization is a big topic right now because of ad blockers.  I'm seeing more and more sites not let me in.  And I just saw a story that The New York Times is about to block the blockers.  And say, you can't read.  The content on The New York Times, if you've got an ad blocker running.  That's this is a very interesting times.  We're struggling. These guys are really struggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but the thing, you know, I was part I have a post up later in the run and I was  at three conferences in Europe this last week and at one of them, three, which is a carrier  in the UK is going to cut all ads for one day on mobile.  Oh, man. And much fear about this much, much.  Man. And there are those that you say, let's let's get all these big players together.  Let's pull a Taylor Swift on them and let's all boycott them.  And somebody start the room and said, do we really want to be in the position of  standing with the advertisers against our users?  Our users are using the ad blockers because they're pissed at us.  We've got to deal with that fact.  And I think it's just simply true.  We have to reinvent, as I said before, we have to reinvent advertising, rethink what  it is, rethink where the value is.  Just irritating people with messages is not going to work.  The thing that struck me from this tour is how much everybody is now agreeing that the  reach business model, just volume for volume sake, is gone.  It's dead. We killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were this trip was three different publisher summits in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, one was the Springer Distributed Content Summit in Berlin.  I talked to you the night before that last show.  And then I went to News Geist, the European version in Bilbao, which was fascinating.  That's a Google event by Google.  Right. Google brings together about 150 news people.  And then I went to Google  News Publishers Day, run by Google Play, full disclosure.  I take no money from Google as a fee.  Google and Springer did pay for my much my travel over.  So, you know, and so it was fascinating.  We can talk about this more later, but it was fascinating to see for me just that to  Stacey's point, there's a recognition happening that we cannot save the old business  models. And what comes next? How we do it is, you know, they're dying for subscription.  I don't think that's going to do it entirely either.  But the idea of just getting more and more ads and throwing more crap in people's eyes,  that's that's not not a not a winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd hate to be in that position of trying to solve this because people aren't going to pay  the risk. The New York Times and everybody else is running and I'm seeing it more and more  is you put up that banner that says either pay us or turn off your blocker.  I turn around and leave.  Yep, that's a risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm working with the Guardian on membership, which is a model that I do believe in.  I think people will pay as but they'll pay for different motives.  They may pay as a patron.  And people pay NPR. They don't pay for access to content.  They pay because they believe the country needs it.  I pay the New York Times and they won't listen to me on this.  I don't pay them for access to content.  I pay them because the New York Times is important.  But then don't abuse me in return.  You know, that's that's the issue.  I'm not saying the New York Times ads are bad.  They're far better than other sites.  Go ahead, Ceci.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this was not this is kind of part of that patronage model or a membership model.  The information, which is a Silicon Valley kind of publication after Tony Fidel on  Friday said he was leaving NEST, they actually within an hour of the news being out,  pushed a subscriber conference call to have the reporters online talking about what this  meant, which I thought was very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't join it. I meant to.  I didn't get around to it.  Did you join it?  I did not join it.  I'm a subscriber.  Yeah, but that was the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's why that happened late on a Friday.  Anyway, that ties to your membership model, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really because paid content isn't just here's our page of what we always  made, get paid content is things like events, buying a book, buying a ticket.  That's paid content, too.  And I'm all for that.  I think that works.  But just the idea that you should suddenly pay for what you can get.  We're a commodity business.  Information is a commodity.  And just because I think my prose is so brilliant, wonderful and special, when I impart  the same information somebody else imparts, doesn't mean you should pay me for it.  I'm sympathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If people blocked our ads, we'd have no way to monetize.  And I couldn't keep doing this period.  I mean, I.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your ads are not irritating.  If you know if you something, you will some do, but not enough.  Yeah.  If you suddenly decided this is why you're very careful about this.  And I was telling you, I quoted you in Europe because I've had this crazy idea  that we should do our own ad blocker as publishers.  What that really means is just we have our standards and you do that.  You have your own ad blocker.  You pre block ads.  Yeah, we do.  We.  Yes, that's a good point.  And again, right.  He says again and again how you you throw you turn away more ads than you take.  And that's really important because it's exactly what you're doing.  You're the pre blocker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mentioned that at the IAB, the Interactive Advertising Bureau,  up front in New York City a couple of months ago, and there was an audible gasp  from the advertisers in the audience because I think that's kind of unheard of.  Don't nobody turns down money and says, well, no, but it is to me, it's a long term  investment, right, because I don't if I if I crap this thing up with ads, I wish  that the other publishers had turned down the belly fat ads, right?  We wouldn't have to use ad blockers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and I mean, exactly.  So there are two things on this.  One is I talked to a publisher who was laughing and he said, you know,  that the secret that nobody wants to say, I never thought of this before.  Was it a lot of the reason for ad blockers is probably not because of the ads  that we have is probably because we want to get rid of them on porn sites.  And it takes off every other ad there is.  You know, that's the problem with ad blockers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does it everywhere.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm sorry, Stacey, Gina could have warned you we somehow went up with sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but but during Fireball, John Gruber has one very minor, you know,  completely unobtrusive ad, but that gets blocked along with everything else  by ad blockers exactly.  Exactly.  And that's why Marco Armentz got he was doing an ad blocker for iPhone.  He decided to get out of that business because he realized it was blocking ads  on that were tolerable.  But then you do things like ad block plus does, which you have the  acceptable ads policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's that's that's that's pure blackmail.  But that's what and then you get accused of shading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it?  Oh, it's awful.  But what what they say and that we interviewed them, they say, well, no, no.  Look, we OK, two things.  And maybe they shouldn't mix the two.  We think that there are some ads that are fine and they should there.  If we have a standard for acceptable ads, we shouldn't block them.  That means that people with unobtrusive, not bad ads,  that's that don't have flash ads that don't give you malware  should be allowed through.  The problem is they ask those companies for money and they say, well,  we got to pay for this service that we're providing.  So that's how we monetize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's where it's clearly a moral hazard.  It's extortion.  But you do see the well, they say, no, it's not extortion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because it has to be an acceptable ad.  We set the standard. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. They take money, makes it extortion.  I mean, if they just said, if they just said, let's make an alliance of like  good ads that treat users respectfully, I think that would be one thing.  But that they did, they block your ads and then come to you as a as a publisher  and say, hey, give us money now.  That sounds like extortion.  Stop taking money away from you is really bad.  And it gets them very hostile reactions from from websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A news guys.  And this is as Chatham House rules, I won't say who said it to whom, but  but well, it's to whom is to be obvious.  And editor there, a top top editor there went after Google  pretty strongly saying, if if these things are evil,  what are you doing, Google paying for the wait list?  You should be you should be leading the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do. They're they're they pay for acceptable ads. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it was very funny moment because the PR guy in the room was kind of like,  well, that's not my choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's somebody else at Google. Yeah. Yeah.  Well, Google's got a response there.  They're they're they're doing AMP.  This is Google's response.  They and this is where I've always to me, I've also had issues with this.  AMP is Google's way of of responding to the the burden that ad tech ads.  And I think ultimately it is an ad standard.  In fact, they're now, as you can see, bringing new ad types, including  some pretty annoying ads.  What they call the flying carpet ads, you know, the ones that's this.  See that over in the right here where you're trying to read something as you scroll,  you scroll through the ad and then this advertisement is scrolled up  and it says, keep on scrolling to read more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the problem when they when they pay sops to the publishing industry.  I was I just wrote a big why is Google any better than

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ad block plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what do you want to see?  Like this is this is something that I think it's worth  instead of just complaining about this, we should talk about, well, what's a  what's a good ad?  What does that look like for precisely, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think that's what it's at the standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, OK, let's see.  Let me read the acceptable ads policy and see if we would agree.  On the one hand, I feel I kind of feel like these guys are getting a bad rap.  That I think they are at block plus is trying to.  They probably shouldn't combine it to money, but no, they should.  It's a bit of a period period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right. You're right, Stacey.  There should be there should be a jury, a council of the public.  Isn't there isn't there an advertisement

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  group at the system?  There is the IAB.  IAB, thank you.  I was like, God, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they have us.  So here's the acceptable ads ads are acceptable  if they do not disrupt the user's natural reading flow, like a flying carpet ad.  OK, they have to place a top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That had definitely disrupted my reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So that would not be considered an acceptable ad,  whether you pay the money or not.  And should always be  recognizable as ads, they shouldn't be mixed in with content  in such a way that they they look like the content.  The side, they have size limitations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold on, hold on, hold on right there.  That's in the moral hazard category.  That's because they don't want native advertising  because ad blockers don't know how to block native advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, come on.  This is this is Google allows to Bula and Outbrain,  which would not be allowed and accept that was another big discussion.  Those are those are the if you like this, you'd like to see more of this.  And they are not they don't say advertisement.  They are not distinguishable.  Well, I absolutely agree.  They send you to other other well, like they do not.  So far, this acceptable ads policy is more rigorous than Google's own  app policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The limitations of independent.  Neither is independent.  And Stacey's point is exactly right.  What you need is some kind of independent body that represents the public  that says we know you have to make money.  We know you're going to have ads.  OK, here is the definition of quality and here is the definition of irritation.  And that only comes if there's some measure of independence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think also it needs to be somebody that understands  the realities of journalists needing to get paid.  So, you know, you could you could make a list, which I don't know if ad block  did this, but you could like make a list of requirements.  And publishers might look at that and say, yeah, there's no way we could operate  with ads like this because we want to earn enough money.  Like, where is the  this is acceptable to users, but is it acceptable to publishers  in that they will make enough money to continue operating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And everyone has to abide by them because this is something I'm discovering is.  I get so many requests for like sponsored content or native ads on my site,  which is, you know, relatively small in niche, but I don't do it because  it's not it's not what I want to I don't want to confuse my users.  And it's very frustrating because enough other people do it.  They're like,  I'm willing to have you use your name to byline something on my stuff,  but I'm not willing to, you know, advertise against your reporting.  And I'm just going to take my money elsewhere, which that's their business.  That's fine. But the fact that there's plenty of even relatively decent brand  names willing to do native advertising is detrimental to journalists who are trying  to actually do what I think of as journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I think if there's I think there's a conflict of interest with this  acceptable ads, then there's a conflict of interest with Google's suggestion.  I am. I Google's an ad company saying, well, here's the thing is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's why that's why AMP is an open standard that it needs to be governed by  an open standards body. That's what I've always said. And it's not.  It's early days. It could become one.  It could and must become one.  Otherwise, it will lose that credibility to add plus credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Acceptable ads is is a policy, not just ad blocks, plus many other ad blockers  adhere to this policy as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you guys think about different ads on mobile versus the Web?  I know it's hard to but I mean, because there's some things I'll tolerate on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Web that I'm just like, well, that that magic carpet doesn't even make sense on  the Web. It only makes sense in a mobile space where you're scrolling with your  finger and unlimited column.  So there are clearly ads that are targeted at mobile that don't show up on  your desktop. So there must be a way to you know, there is a way to distinguish  the two. I think that's not a bad.  I think you make an excellent point.  Certainly, they say, for instance, the size of the ad depends on the size of the  page. So, you know, you can't limit it.  It's got to be a percent, not a pixel number.  Right. Because I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was the other criteria?  Did you go through more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some I think text ads with excessive use of colors and our elements  to grab attention not permitted.  Static images are fine.  But but they don't allow flash ads for ads and lists and feeds like a like a  podcast feed.  There are restrictions.  Search ads.  There are restrictions.  This is I think I would, you know, I understand the potential conflict of  interest here.  On the other hand, I like these acceptable ad standards.  So here's what should happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's what should happen.  If she what Adblock should do, what Google should do is the same.  They need to push into a true open source project, the fundamental underlying  work. If you want to make money on top of that in some way, they do.  Then you can put there.  They're not. They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. The acceptable ads database is used by other blockers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But who sets the standards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there's there's no reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the problem.  No, no, no, no.  Moral hazards.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say by an independent committee.  Who? Who?  Who? Who?  Let me see here.  They had 20 leading publishers, tech companies, journalists, advertisers,  nonprofits and academics.  They're formulating an acceptable ads committee, which will take over the  initiative sometimes next year.  This was OK.  So this group, this was 11 2015.  I I think, you know, I understand why people are.  Assume that this is a conflict of interest and is shady.  I'm not convinced it is after talking to these guys.  I felt like they had they were trying to do the best that they could.  And I think an ad blocking company.  And by the way, you can use their ad blocker and turn it off  so that you don't see any ads acceptable or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's all expensive to run this.  Then run something much cheaper.  Get a grant from some foundation, which they could do and make it a truly open  decent project.  Yes. As long as they're I mean, as long as they're  this profit making operation, which it is, there's another company called Flatterer,  which could make a go of it.  And they're going to work with acceptable ads.  I saw them in a conference in Amsterdam.  I'm just forever dubious the way that set up.  And the way they've acted is extortionate.  That's my problem.  They've they've they've blown it for me lifelong because the way they have acted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, is there evidence that they've gone to somebody like Google and say, hey,  your ads are blocked by our acceptable ad policy,  but we would look the other way if you'd give us money.  Don't the ads still have to?  I think the ads still have to be adhere to the acceptable ad policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if you what if you do an acceptable ad that you don't pay them?  That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's they say 90 percent of the licenses that we grant are granted for free  to smaller entities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. So if you're a larger and if you're larger and you pay a licensing fee  because you can afford it,  afford what afford being being blackmailed?  But the white that's covered for them.  That's pure cover for them.  It's BS. All as Ron said, all these companies that are  employing journalists and have these high expenses, they won't.  They won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they won't whitelist you if your ads are not acceptable.  Right. They won't.  It's not like they whitelist ads that are unacceptable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We won't whitelist you if you're big and don't pay them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how Procter and Gamble wants to run ads.  And they feel like all of their ads are acceptable.  And then this company is like, no.  But if you pay us, we'll whitelist you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's the point Jeff and Ron are trying to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I would say they they charge people some amount of money.  They should be open about how much money they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say it's 30 percent of the additional revenue created by whitelisting.  So the additional revenue you make from those whitelisted ads,  30 percent goes to ad block plus. That's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an insane.  Apple charges if you sell something for an app store, which they host.  And because it's a closed system and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again, that's only the top 10 percent of traffic generators.  They do. They determine who's the top 10 percent based on how much ad  blocking they're doing for those entities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those are entities that in great measure have journalistic costs that are suffering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, no, no, no. They're the no.  Mostly it's like Google. It's it's it's tabula.  It's the it's the big ad tech network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A tabool is so acceptable and so friggin wonderful.  Well, I don't know if they whitelist tabula or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really don't think they would based on their criteria here.  So this does two things.  It pushes people.  First of all, it's only the top 10 percent of traffic generators.  The other 90 percent don't pay anything are still whitelisted.  The top 10 percent, the ad tech companies that make the most money  from advertising, they say if you want to be whitelisted,  you're going to have to give us 30 percent of the additional revenue from whitelisting.  That doesn't seem unreasonable.  Yes, it does. It's crap.  This is like a true.  What's the alternative, which is we'll block everything and then you don't get any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The alternative is that you have a truly independent,  not for profit organization doing this.  I'm all for profit. You know me at every time on the show.  I doing what?  Doing the ad blocking, doing the ad setting or doing setting the standard.  Well, I think that there is a start with and then and then in terms of the actual  blocking, then you can have an open source structure.  You can get any blocker you want.  If it does, that's why I've argued the publishers should create their own ad blocker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's funny is that block plus gets heats on both ends because users say,  Well, this should be acceptable.  It should be turned off by default and we should decide if we want acceptable ads.  Right. And and the and then advertisers and people like you say, well,  this is unacceptable because we don't want to have to pay for people to see our ads.  I think you're if in a war, I think you need to find a solution right now  because you're in a world where people are just going to block ads.  I agree. And by the way, there are a lot of ad blockers that just block everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Period. Yes, I know that, too.  I know that, too. Well, that's why I've written about this.  I've argued that we in publishing is what Stacey said.  We in publishing have to come up with our own standards.  If you look at courts, a great story from courts in the early days,  one of the one of the founders, I don't know which one really kind of hated advertising.  And I said, we're going to have advertising.  God damn it. This is what it's going to be.  Well, I became an editor setting a structure for acceptable ads at courts  and courts does courts as native advertising, but it's good, clearly labeled.  And and and I think they do a good job because editorial took a role of responsibility  in advocating for the public we serve.  The problem with advertising on websites is we we screwed the public.  Right. More crap at their eyes.  Right. It's our own fault.  I don't deny that.  But the solution is not another conflict of interest, which which you're right, Leo.  Both ad block plus and Google are in that conflict of interest.  And Google is talking about having its own acceptable ads policy.  Well, they have a similar conflict of interest.  This needs to be some kind of independent organization.  And it's not the IAB because that press on independent.  They represent advertisers and advertisers.  Right. Right.  It's not the the digital content next formally, the online publishers associations.  That's publishers.  It needs to be somebody independent who also understands, as Ron said,  the other really important point that we need.  We need the eggs to feed the journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you all unblock ads for specific sites like I like Daring Fireball?  So unblock ads on those sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually I don't run an ad blocker unless I'm on my phone.  OK. Well, no, I have in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the best place to do it. But you do do it on your phone.  I do. Yeah.  The irony is you can't do it.  I guess it's not exactly an irony.  You can't do it on Android.  You have to run a separate browser.  Google Chrome, the default browser on Android, does not offer blocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Where you have to root and that's a big mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's there's ad block plus has a browser for Google, for Android and stuff.  But and Google, to their credit, at least doesn't block that from the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Should we mention the other case of pre ad blocking that made news this week?  I put it under numbers. I'm happy.  Free ads blocking.  We have like you like you add blocks in  before you buy your ads before you buy  BuzzFeed turning down one point three million dollars in Trump ads  because they were equivalent in Jonas words to cigarette advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, how? Yeah, that's harsh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they cover all his other stuff anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he doesn't really need to buy this.  Oh, you know, in broadcast, you cannot turn down political ads.  Hmm. So broadcasters are by the FCC prohibited from turning down.  Actually, you have to see what the rules are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think there are some standards you can.  There are standards, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they do is that's why they fairness doctrine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's airtime.  But that's not that doesn't relate to air.  I mean, ads, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, some of them say that we will not do any ads run issues.  So they don't get, you know, abortion ads they don't like or gun ads they don't like.  So they just turn down all ads on issues, which is not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me look at the.  You know, it the industry, the broadcast industry is so heavily regulated.  I have to take regular tests  for Clear Channel because I still do a radio show.  No, I take I take tests every quarter about what the rules are  and what text on on Morris code to know tests on like Paola and the,  you know, Clear Channel got handed a massive fine for playing something,  an ad for like White House down that had  emergency activation system tones in it.  That's right. They had a huge multimillion dollar fine.  And so now I have to take a test every three months on whether what tones I can play.  It's incredible. Let me see what the OK.  Here's the pre-election political advertising compliance checklist.  This is from the Radio Advertising Bureau.  So this is not from the government, but it is.  OK, so you have to on your public file  contain all requests for freed and paid political time and their disposition.  So, you know, clearly they want you to disclose, as BuzzFeed did,  whether you turn something down.  I don't know what the rules you can't you have to charge.  You have you the lowest.  You can't give them a deal. Right.  So you end up charging the top rate, the rack rate for the ads.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to find the rule, but  I'm pretty sure it's, you know, as you as you might imagine,  if you hold a license from the government to broadcast TV or radio  that they don't want you to turn down ads for people you don't agree with.  They want everybody have access to those channels. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was also the argument of public airwaves and such.  But that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, you know, BuzzFeed's not, you know, doesn't have that.  Nor do I have those restrictions.  So or does a cable network. Right.  Cable does cables. FCC regulated. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they regulated on that? They may be.  Are they regulated from because the FCC stuff is over the public airwaves,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is broadcast. Oh, I think FCC has some.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cable industry does do local and municipal franchise grants.  Yeah, there's state levels.  So maybe there's something there.  I'm not a telecommunications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why you can say I can say dirty words on cable.  And that's why Howard Stern can say, well, yeah, no, but I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the FCC is not completely I know people think they're stupid,  but they might have different rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, they just don't have a legal right to.  OK, maybe they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Yeah, I think they do.  But because remember, the cable companies have a monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because the FCC says that's a locally granted monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They. So when the FCC approves  mergers like big cable mergers, they can put conditions on things,  but those conditions don't necessarily.  I read through the time Warner Cable in charter conditions,  and then there may have been something in NBCU in Comcast.  So Comcast buying NBC Universal, they did make some  conditions around content like minority  owned stations and some things like that.  But that falls apart after a certain time frame.  I can't remember if it's seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do regulate the prices for advertising on cable television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a political operation with local franchising authorities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in the FCC rules, Title 47 of the Federal Communications Commission  Communications Act 1934.  They have they have to maintain a political file.  They do all a lot of the same things.  I think there are different rules perhaps for broadcasting cable,  but they are absolutely regulated.  Even satellite. OK.  So when it comes to speech.  Well, like I said, you can have different rules.  You know, there's also the the Children's Hour, you know,  they allow you to say certain things after 11 p.m.  There's stuff like that.  Legal, you know, who is a legally qualified candidate for office?  The equal opportunity access to advertising and to interviews and on cable.  Yeah, this is the political file.  I mean, you got me.  Well, I, you know, relevant sections of the FCC's rules  dealing with cable television systems.  It's not the same.  But there's definitely I mean, these are all this is cable rules  like we're looking at as scrolling by. Yeah.  I'm helping rates and classes of time sponsorship identification.  This makes sense.  I know. I think it should be regulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I'm never in favor of regulating speech.  Anyway, let's put it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  BuzzFeed is not regulated.  We know that.  And so they could turn down Donald Trump.  But I wonder, is that a good thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they're transparent about it, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I want to Facebook said we will not allow a Donald Trump  page or any Donald Trump commentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a story on that about the whole rape thing, right?  Your users revolt and then presumably you either modify your position  or you just stick to it.  So BuzzFeed can get away from this because they're not dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they can get away with it because they were transparent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're pure media.  The argument is that Facebook's not.  But let's push this.  What if Donald Trump or a pack for Donald Trump  tried to put an ad up saying that Mexicans are all rapists and murderers?  That's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're turning down all advertising by the Republican candidate  for president of the United States.  Yeah, it's very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, because he has said that all Mexicans are rapists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because they disagree with him politically.  Oh, they're saying I think it's unprecedented.  This is unprecedented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure it's about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if what if what if Vice said we're not going to take  last election cycle, we're not going to any ads for Barack Obama.  We'll take all the ads from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Romney, I think what would happen is Stacy's point.  I think I think the users of Vice would probably have a proper fit.  But at some point, this only if somebody's got a reaction  and insanity that we have in Donald Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the difference is that very dangerous is a platform.  And when you claim to be a platform, you a certain amount of neutrality  is expected where BuzzFeed is just a news outlet  and they can have a point of view.  But it's a powerful disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm going to disagree.  So I think Facebook doesn't they can do what they want.  And I think it's important for people to remember this.  So if Facebook says we don't want to run Donald Trump ads  or we don't want to run Hillary Clinton ads.  I mean, in D.C., Facebook's lobbyists are mostly Republicans.  So let's take it Hillary Clinton ads.  They can in, you know, as long as I feel like as long as they say something  to people say, hey, you're never going to see this here  because we don't agree with it.  I'm actually OK with it.  And if your users are mad, your users are going to tell you.  And then we can have a really interesting conversation about  the power of platforms and having one monopolistic,  like one set of monopolistic tech platforms on the Internet.  And that could be really good for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you're right, Stacy.  I think I think for if you consider a platform,  you know, if we argue it's media, I actually I'm not sure it is.  But fine.  If this discussion argue that it is then for government to tell them  what they have to take, I find great problems with that.  Just as when you disagree, though, with the FCC requiring the cable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and broadcast television, except ads from Donald Trump.  Do you disagree with that? Yes. Yes.  You don't think the government should be in that level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have responsibility.  If somebody puts up a Nazi ad, even if you're running for president.  Well, there are rules. You absolutely should not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yet there are rules about like lying and payola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if it just says something that you find absolutely important  and offensive, it's it's it's why should you be different from another media  outlet? Because this is about free speech and free speech includes  what you don't say, what you do edit, which is I've gotten some hot water  about that recently.  And the fact that when this when this, I think, BS Gawker story  about the supposed  anti-conservative stuff at Facebook, trends went on  that a member of Congress called him on carpet and they went we and we  and press media should have been rallying behind Facebook and said,  Don't you dare go to Congress?  You do not answer to Congress for what you say and don't say.  That's that's the First Amendment.  That is exactly what the First Amendment is about, is that Congress shall not  pass laws regulating the press and speech.  Shall not period. Very simple.  That's what that's the essence of the First Amendment.  You can't tell me what to say.  You can't tell me what not to say.  And at the end, I'm answerable to my public and my customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But clearly, I understand what you're saying, but clearly that is not  how we've been doing business up to now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's been and I hate the FCC for it. OK.  I've written cover stories about about and this is why Howard Stern got driven.  And I argued that I'm going to say a word now.  Watch out, put it in the rundown.  Bullshit is political speech.  Now, the fact that you're going to have to knock that out there  because in this case, you're dealing with the private argument, which is  which is why I just choose to you choose to.  But Apple Apple could do it.  That's nothing to do with Apple. I just choose to.  You were on broadcast. We were on broadcast.  Right. And B.S. I'll be OK now is political speech.  If you can't call B.S., what is more political speech than that?  How is it that we decide that that's nasty?  Who decided that's nasty? Who set that standard?  Government should have nothing, not a zero to do with that.  Nothing. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in these FCC rules, because I've been looking at them  because I think we're a little confused and I'm not ready to be like,  I am the authority because I've read a couple of these pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love having you on the show, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they have under the broadcast rules in this.  This is kind of interesting broadcasting.  They have a prohibition against broadcasting false information.  And it says you can't broadcast false information.  Oh, but it's only during a crime or catastrophe.  If the licensee knows the information is false,  which in a lot of ways would exclude a lot of ads are different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People I think people always thought that ads had to be true.  That's the FTC.  And they don't really they're not that stringent.  Generally truthiness, general truthiness.  But this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't I don't actually see under the cable and satellite  specific stuff about political ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's that's what I keep going, because there is a whole section  that talks about what is who is a who is a candidate who's not a candidate.  They have to maintain what's called a political file, which shows to the public  what they've turned down, what they've accepted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that's great.  I mean, that's kind of a bare minimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I don't know is what the rules are on.  You must accept political advertising.  I know broadcasters are required to accept.  I believe actually, I shouldn't say I know.  I believe broadcasters are required to accept political advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they quite like getting political advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it? Yeah, that's why I don't know, because they because they would never turn it down.  By the way, BuzzFeed turned out one point three million dollars from Trump.  This was not a small buy.  And I love it.  Jake Barube, who's a senior advertising executive at the Daily Caller, said,  hey, I'd name in which is a conservative news website.  I'd literally name my first born Bernie Clinton for one point three million dollars.  I can't imagine turning down that kind of money for any reason.  So I guess you could say it's a principled stand, but it worries me.  A little bit, but it would only worry me if there were other  sources of news than BuzzFeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but but but there's there's a point.  And I want you know, I'm not going to get you in trouble with your audience  and gotten political stuff.  So so folks, I'm just going to do this for the sake of the argument.  OK, OK, let me do that, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, just flip it.  Just use the other candidate.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to say that if Hitler ran for president  at some point, what's the line of responsibility?  And the platform is the Jews are evil.  Yeah, I understand.  But at the point, if the Republican Party nominated him,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess you'd have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, even then, what if the Republican Party has gone crack?  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should be able to say I'm not going to take ads from this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right.  I agree. Yeah, I think you can be selective.  Yeah. And also, what if you are doing another way?  What if you're Fox and Hillary Clinton wants to run an ad saying all  all Republicans are or Donald Trump is this or that? Right.  I think Fox has the right not to run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. No, good. We're done.  All right. I think you made an excellent point.  Well, I don't want to I don't want to belabor it.  We will talk about the Supreme Court specialty.  Leo, that's what I do is belabor.  We will talk about the Supreme Court  and the Google class action lawsuit, which the Supreme Court has agreed  can continue in just a bit.  Lots more to talk about.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  Professor Jarvis from the City University of New York,  where he's a widely respected liberal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know how we end up in Tennessee Williams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I think I'm strong.  But anyway.  Also, Ron Amadio from Ars Technica was wisely,  wisely just stepping back a little bit, just take a little step back.  We'll get we'll get to the geek stuff.  The geek stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we will also continue with Stacey Higginbotham,  our newest member of the crew.  So glad to have Stacey on IOT and Giga Stacey  joining us for the show today.  I will be soon.  I will be standing up as I do my show.  I like to stand up.  I always did the TV standing up and I often did radio standing up.  A standing desk is awesome because it kind of keeps the blood going and stuff.  But sometimes you want to sit down.  Sometimes you're tired. You don't want to stand up.  Wouldn't it be nice to have a desk that could do both?  Well, Veridesk can.  That's where the name comes from.  It's variable. Veridesk.  If you spend a lot of time sitting at your computer,  you should know that being sedentary is widely agreed.  Being sedentary is not good for you.  Mayo Clinic says sitting puts you at a greater risk for obesity,  increased blood pressure, high blood sugar.  It's nice. It's just nice for your energy to be able to stand and sit and move around.  Veridesk is so great because it sits on top of your existing desk or cubicle.  It means no boss approval required.  There's no installation or assembly either.  It just comes in a box.  You take it out. You put it on your desk.  And suddenly, you put your gear on it, your monitors on it.  You can raise and lower it.  Veridesks are adjustable.  From 11 different height settings,  you just put your fingers on handles on either side.  It's spring loaded so you don't have to effed it up.  It just goes up and down no matter, even if you have a couple of monitors on there.  And it's affordable too.  Prices start as low as $175 with free shipping in the continental United States.  Lifehacker called Veridesk one of their five best standing desks.  It's been featured on Product Hunt, Gear Patrol,  and we are very happy to have Veridesks in our new studio,  much as Pied Piper did in their new offices in Silicon Valley.  Of course, they got kicked out of those offices after about four episodes,  but we're going to have them for a little longer than that, I hope.  We just love the Veridesk.  All our new desks in the new studio are going to be Veridesks.  Veridesk.com, if you want to learn more,  check out their wide range of height adjustable desks.  Your desk, your cubicle, no boss approval required.  In fact, in all likelihood, the boss will come over and say,  where did you get that? I want one.  And make sure you tell them you heard about it on Twitter.  V-A-R-I-V-E-R-A-D-E-S-K.com.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Android M, the name is going to be unveiled in a few weeks.  What do you think, panel? Nut roll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Woo.  Nougat? Nutella?  Nutella.  It's amazing how much they've turned the name into a,  into like a news cycle thing where it's like,  man, whatever, just call it something.  And yeah, it's just a code name for Crying Out Loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know, I mean, it's Android 7, right?  I mean, it's just a code name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's beyond 6.  Yeah, who knows what the actual 8 could be 6.1, I guess.  Yeah, or five or I don't know.  They go they go crazy with version.  But I wonder if that means like releases coming in a few weeks or or what?  It's supposed to be no, it's supposed to be Q3.  Right. Yeah. Is that in a few weeks?  I don't know. No.  OK, I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, they tweeted, thanks for your submissions.  We'll reveal the new name in a few weeks.  And they did that today. So  with a little, little pretty little video.  You know, I just want to say  the problem with Nutella, of course, is it's commercial,  but you can make your own Nutella.  I was at Whole Foods the other day.  And you know how they have the peanut grinder and the almond grinder  and you make fresh peanut butter, almond butter in the middle?  They had hazelnuts and chocolate chips.  And you grind it and it goes in together to make a delicious treat.  Wow. Make your own Nutella.  Not until a trademark. It's not Nutella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it called? Nutella Nutella. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. I should have looked carefully to see what the sign is.  Maybe there is such a thing as a non Nutella Nutella.  It was so good, by the way, much better than that plastic stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hazelnut chocolate spread. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android hazelnut chocolate spread. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's got to start with the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Got to start with chocolate hazelnut spread is what they call it.  Oh, you looked it up. Jeff's looking it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get it makes sense.  You would emphasize the chocolate first as opposed to the healthier.  It looks a little like baby poop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But it's and they have they have a recipe and ingredients online.  Whole Foods. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what is it? Just hazelnuts and dark chocolate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Third whole one third cup almonds, one third cup nuts.  One I'm sorry. One and one third compels one and one third cups.  Sweetened plain almond milk.  One cup pitted dates.  No, this is not what unsweetened cocoa powder.  One tablespoon pure vanilla extract. No, no, no.  That's not what I'm. That's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was just kind of healthy.  No, this was hazelnuts and dark chocolate chips in a thing.  You turn the knob and it and again, it has this kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that that's a spread.  When when does tweet do a cooking show?  This would be a good podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to be on the cooking show.  I'll tell you what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, in the kitchen making some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's no news and asparagus is a wise friend of mine once said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why did you were pitching an asparagus story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was those were my friend, Joan, when we worked on Epicurious?  If oh, I'm sorry to do a news section because there's no news in asparagus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  But we found the news in Nutella or nut roll or new getter, nutty buddy or nerds or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's not that many options.  I can't believe they made like a submission thing.  Like there's probably only 10 names you could come up with.  It actually worked.  It's got to be Nutella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's got to be an end pie of some sort, right?  Or cake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm really having Nilla vanilla wafer pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said it didn't have to be a dessert.  Are they going to break?  What? They said that all the other said it could be anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nutella really isn't a dessert.  Let's be honest. It's a breakfast spread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that is a dessert in my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is no food or a low food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you have a you have a classification system, Stacey.  Tell us more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, whoa, slow and go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God, I need this.  Oh, that's amazing. You have colored stickers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, that's that's crazy talk.  This is that's insane.  That's great. No, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoa or slow.  What does whoa mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, whoa, slow or go.  So no is absolutely not like jello shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You cannot have no that's go.  Well, age age dependent.  Our classification is always like.  It's like cakes or pies or so a little bit.  A little bit's good for you.  Slow is Nutella would be a whoa.  Nutella is a whoa.  Or maybe a hotel. Yeah, Nutella is a whoa.  And then slow is things like, I don't know, mac and cheese.  And then go veggies.  I have got to adopt this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that your invention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. My daughter came home from school with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is awesome.  Really? Oh, no. Go.  Whoa or slow. Do you add?  I was strictly viewed here to this.  And where does Chipotle fall on the scale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me, that's a go.  That's pretty.  For a lot of people, that's a go, go, go, go, go, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I make is it a go.  Was it was it was it a stop for a while?  Was it a whoa for a while? Yeah.  Not for me.  Depends how you feel about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would just be, you know, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm from Texas. We.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But like, actually, there's strong evidence now.  What did I read?  I read a study of children in Finland and then across the border in Russia.  And the children in Finland had a much higher incidence of asthma  and other autoimmune diseases than the children in Russia,  even though they grew up in almost identical climates.  The only difference was the Finnish were very clean.  They were even genetically similar because, you know, the cross border pollination.  But the Finns were too clean.  And so the kids were not exposed to the flora and fauna.  And they actually think it comes down to gut to the gut flora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, like your bio? Yeah.  I can believe it. Like more diversity in your gut flora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They what they did is they examined the gut flora  and they found a significant difference in those two groups.  And and then they were able to.  I have should find this study because it's fascinating.  And then we're able to kind of look at other groups  and see that, in fact, this might be well related to the to the immune issues  and and asthma and other things. So. OK.  If you're in Finland, whoa, if you're in Russia, go.  Poor Rod's thinking, what am I doing here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like, well, no, I'm getting tweeted that there's a you know, Apple announced that  they rearranged their app store split.  So it's oh, what is it? It's not 30 percent anymore.  No, is it 1585? Yeah.  They re-announced the app stores, the app store split to 8515.  Like share with that huge.  And yeah. And Google was just like, yeah, we're going to do that, too.  It's cool. That's just happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Four hours ago, Apple details, app store changes,  including new subscription revenue split and search result ads.  Oh, this is Phil Schiller's doing.  He added to the app store to his role at Apple just six months ago.  Apple is going to start showing search ads for apps in its iOS app store  search results for the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I was at a Google Play event in London just yesterday,  and they said that the average number of users has 16 apps they use per month.  Are apps trailing?  Is that the problem here? Apps are people who start using apps as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, remember, that's that's a normal person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I know. But then when you get to scale, that's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if but on your front page, on your iPhone, how many icons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't matter. I mean, do you use I've got tons of icons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But on the front page, which is the stuff that you use most.  Yeah, most even there. That's not that's like 20. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depends on we have there.  We've talked about this before.  I'm willing to bet most people do not add many apps.  They just use the apps the phone comes with most normal people. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  And those that like I've got Duolingo still sitting there, which is great.  I'm trying to get myself to use it because I want to learn my Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I know I have 200 apps on my Android device, but I guarantee you I don't use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have Kindle there, but I don't read Kindle every month.  I read books other ways.  You know, I have all the there.  Does that count? I mean, it's just so.  So so is the app business just not as good as we thought?  And they're trying to encourage more. Maybe maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there's no lack of apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And don't forget, here's the other thing.  I think I think I met with the P.A., the program, whatever, called  product manager for  instant apps in London.  Really, really good guy.  And I found it, you know, really fascinating to keep thinking  about the impact of instant apps.  I also talked to another guy who was giving this talk at this event.  I wanted to learn more.  And their presumption is that people, you know, they recognize huge friction  to download the rubber to use an app, huge friction.  Every publisher says those are our most valuable users, but there's so few of them.  And it's really hard to get them to go.  So if you can pull a chunk of an app into the web, what's going to happen?  Are is this going to act as marketing for the apps where people will download it?  Maybe in some cases.  But in a lot of cases, they'll never use the app.  This is the way you'll get an engagement with your app is by chunking it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I love this.  Oh, this instant app thing is great.  By the way, just to clarify, the new deal that Apple is offering is not for app purchases.  That will continue to be 70 30.  This is for subscription apps where there is a regular subscription.  And I'm going to tell you exactly why they did this subscription based apps.  We'll see that models changed to 85 15.  If. The customer subscription has been active for at least one year,  so the first year will be 70 30 subsequent years will be 85 15.  Oh, is this to address issues from like Spotify and publishers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what this is.  Yeah, publishers have been saying, screw you, I'm going to take it out.  That's exactly what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I bet you there's significant pressure from not just Spotify, but Amazon,  Washington Post, Washington Post,  The Economist, FT, all the publishers.  Less so Amazon Amazon, because those are individual purchases, aren't they?  So it wouldn't be Amazon.  I you know, I feel like Apple really wants to get the Amazon app on the Apple TV.  And Amazon is saying and I think they've said this publicly.  We got to have a better deal.  We can't do this 70 30 thing when you when people buy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so Apple, I think, is changing the split after the first year of the subscription.  Right. Where Google's doing it right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interest. Oh, we a little.  Hey, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They had to jump in and one up competition, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Free market, baby.  Can you say capitalism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry. On on Android, last I saw the average number of apps  installed was ninety five, which sounds insanely high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe, though, that only 16 are being used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say installed. I totally would buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google will offer app developers  same revenue sharing terms that Apple just announced, except that it starts instantly.  Wow. Now, wait a minute, though.  Let me look at that because Apple did not change the rev share.  This is only on subscriptions.  So it's only subscription.  Is this for all of the Google Play Store or just subscriptions?  New pricing plan.  It'll be a strategy to find a revenue.  Giving app developers the ability scroll up a little more other way.  Other way, let's go.  And yeah, I don't want to see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it says the second paragraph, it says it will move from a 70  for subscriptions for subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so not for in-app purchases and not for app buys, but for renewing subscriptions.  So, yeah, that is I mean, what are your subscriptions?  It's mostly music and newspapers, right?  Publications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might have like a smart home kind of device, like a camera subscription,  but you're not going to buy that through that app.  These language learning things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's lots of OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there are lots of them.  Yeah, head a headspace, our advertiser headspace, the meditation program.  That's a that's a subscription.  Yeah, it's just a straight up API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can use it for whatever you want, I would assume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just wondering how people use it.  Yeah. Is the UPS guy there again?  Stacy, you want to run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's either UPS or my husband's home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry. Don't confuse the two, Stacy.  I've been you can get a lot of trouble.  Just warning you there's go and there's woe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's a no.  That's a no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ron Amati, I'm sure you're watching Lenovo's  Lenovo, Motorola's feed this morning.  What did what did they announce?  That's tomorrow.  Oh, I thought they were doing it today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was tomorrow.  The motors did not watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, neither did I.  But I guess if it's tomorrow, that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Tech World is the ninth.  It's not the ninth.  Right. OK, I'm sorry.  Yeah, it's weird.  Lenovo wants to host like a I don't know.  It's like kind of a developer conference.  Like it's clearly that they they want to emulate like Google I.O.  and WBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung does that too. But who goes right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's like Lenovo doesn't have any platforms.  At least Samsung makes like Tizen and there are some APIs.  But Lenovo only ships like windows and Android devices.  So I don't know what people are going to do at this at this thing.  But yet it's tomorrow in San Francisco.  We're expecting to see like a new Motorola phone, either the new  the new like Motorola flagship, I would assume,  which is going to be called the Z or the X maybe.  And then there's going to be a Project Tango  show going on to which Lenovo is making the first Project Tango device,  which is which if you don't know, Project Tango is kind of like  imagine like an Xbox Kinect slapped onto the back of a smartphone like you.  It's computer vision.  So like you point it at a at a scene and it can take like a 3D map of it  and kind of pass it off to developers.  And that'll do things like indoor mapping or funky  augmented reality video games, stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really not a consumer product is Tango.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, this is the first consumer.  Yeah, but what?  I think Tango device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What am I going to use that for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's going to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could superimpose things like I look at something like that  for like assembling IKEA furniture, right?  You could superimpose.  All right. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or so it's like augmented reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's an AR component.  It's not just that.  There's also I mean, the mapping stuff is actually kind of cool.  But again, it doesn't it?  It relies on you looking through the world through your phone,  which is kind of a lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really seems like one day they're going to strap this to like a funky version  of Google Glass.  And, you know, you just need to get all the programming done.  And then you kind of replace the camera part with like a transparent sheet.  I still think you can do all the augmented reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Blind people.  I think I think that that that yeah, that if you could use it with audio cues  and and buzzing, you have to be knowing a space.  Yes, haptic feedback to say, don't go that.  Whoa, go slow.  You know, you that that or you say this is where I want to go  and it helps you find something.  Um, knowing the space and then also knowing objects in the space.  Where the hell did I put my blank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh. Tracker has that they got in July.  They're going to launch their Atlas plug in tracker is that device thing.  Actually, I think they're an advertiser on this show.  The it what it does is you can actually ties into the Amazon Echo  and you can say echo, where are my keys?  And she'll be able to say in the living room.  So that it's an outlet plus the trackers,  like the individual tracking units that are going to create this.  So if you think about that, plus, you know, for haptic feedback  on like a phone or something, communicate that same like hot or cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you know how it gets its location?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does. I do.  It's Bluetooth and Wi-Fi triangulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How does it know what the living room is versus Wi-Fi triangulation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. The problem with Wi-Fi triangulation, I understand,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because there's a lot of Wi-Fi access points.  But are there a lot of Bluetooth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you you'd have to go to be a lot more Bluetooth  and the next gen Bluetooth standard is going to have Bluetooth mesh.  Yeah. And I've talked to the SIG and they want to do.  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then you have indoor location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean, it's not here today, but it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but I think now that I think of it, when I pair,  you know, turn on pairing on my phone, I do see a lot of things.  I see the Roku. I see remotes.  There are other things.  Normally, normally you don't want your Bluetooth to be visible.  I mean, that's a big deal.  You don't leave your phone or your Bluetooth device.  You're in constant pairing mode because you don't want to be visible and be snarfed.  But maybe these new devices, especially with Ellie and whatever  they're coming along with Bluetooth eight.  They'll be always or two or four or something.  They'll always be kind of saying, hey, I'm over here. I'm over here.  And you can't you know, with Wi-Fi, you could triangulate the signal  and by signal strength, you can try you could actually do pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, yeah. And so I don't know.  I think it's neat when they come out.  I'm totally going to get one so I can.  It's actually three of them for sitting throughout my house.  And then I'm going to play with this because I'm so psyched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great IOT story. Yes.  Yeah, that would be awesome.  It is. Can I can I just since Stacey brought up this topic,  I just want to do this most amusing thing I learned when I was gone for this week.  What she mentioned, she mentioned Ikea chair.  Yeah, that was off topic. But I got to say this.  I heard a speech at a news guys from the holder  of the only Ikea chair at a university in Sweden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that just too great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's an endowment I'd want.  Is that great? Yeah.  The Ikea chair.  Do they have to assemble it himself or did it come up?  Yeah, it's actually known as who?  Google did an interesting.  Well, I guess we should take a break.  I'm just looking at the time.  You let me take a break and then we'll come back  and talk about a new app from Google for iOS, not Android.  They're doing more of this lately. I'm worried.  You know, this is like Microsoft, right?  Microsoft stuff, not for their phone, but for everybody else's phone.  But Google, really?  First, a word from Atlassian, if you're a programmer, a developer,  if you work on a team, you probably use Atlassian.  I use Atlassian. We use Atlassian all the time.  We first got introduced to Atlassian's Jira,  which is an incredible project management tool  for agile teams, for teams working on a project, even really complex projects.  It lets you keep track of issues, keep track of who's doing what,  what the assignments are.  We used it for designing our new website.  That's my first with my first introduction to it.  We use it all the time now.  Our developers for our new apps are using it.  So you can you can it's great.  In fact, we use it for maintenance to our maintenance contract on our website  so we can put up problems and have them solved and have them prioritized,  assign, track and manage tasks no matter how complex the project is.  Jira is awesome.  And then there's Confluence,  which lets you create and share content, organize results,  bring team members up to speed.  We use Confluence kind of as a ticket,  you know, issue ticket in within the enterprise.  Russell uses this.  We are hip chat. We live on hip chat.  Hip chat's awesome. In fact, I get hip chat notifications all the time.  I was just showing my notifications on Windows weekly  because we're working on the new studio.  And of course, we when we, you know, when you're working on a new studio,  we've got architects, contractors, engineers, lighting and camera guys,  wiring guys is a big team involved.  And we have chat.  Everybody puts everything into hip chat.  We actually train some of the people who've never used it before  because they send emails.  No, no, put it in hip chat.  And then it's all in one place.  It's both synchronous and asynchronous.  So you can have real time conversations.  It's kind of like an instant messenger that way.  But everything is there is always there's this great history.  So you can go back. You can see Ryan's putting his designs in there  because it handles images just fine.  It handles all sorts of integrations with all sorts of devices.  We have it integrated with Panopta, for instance.  And now I get alerts if our server goes down or there's issues with the mail.  It is amazing.  And then Bitbucket, which lets you test, review and manage code in real time.  This is a company doing solid tools for people who are getting things done.  We love all the Atlassian programs, and I think you will, too.  If you aren't using Atlassian yet, go to Atlassian.com  and see how Jira and Confluence and HipChat and Bitbucket  can give your team everything you need to organize, discuss and complete.  That's really important.  Great artists ship, complete shared work.  Atlassian helping teams everywhere team up  to create what's next.  I love Atlassian.  I have to say we live on HipChat.  And Jira is amazing if you've never used Jira and you get the board  and then you get the burn down and it shows you graphs.  And it's just really incredible.  I've never seen it anything like it.  Let's talk about the Google Motion Steals app.  I don't have an iPhone with me, so I wasn't able to try it today.  Have you tried it yet, Ron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I have not.  I have an iPhone somewhere around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like I can I can already make gifts, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have to tell you, so this takes those great live photos  that the iPhone does.  That was something Apple added with the iPhone 6S, I guess.  The idea is you take a picture kind of like what HTC did with their Zoe's.  So you're taking a still and the key and it takes a while to train yourself  is to put the camera up.  Wait a moment, take the picture and then leave the camera up  because you're going to get not only the still, but a three second video  around the still.  And then when you press and hold the image, it comes to life.  It's very cool. It's a Harry Potter kind of a thing.  But it's the way Apple does it is incompatible with everybody.  I'm sure Google did this because people were uploading these live images  to Google Photos and saying what happened to the live?  Because really what it is is a still, a JPEG still and an MOV file,  a kind of a low res MOV file shot at the same time.  So Google's put out an app.  This is iPhone only that will take those photos  and turn them into animated GIFs.  And by the way, do some smoothing.  This is Paul Thurotte has been using it.  So I'm going to steal some stuff from his site, Thurotte.com.  So the animated GIF is great because that works everywhere.  And then the smoothing is important because, as you probably know,  if you've ever used the automated GIFs from the Google Photos,  you know, if you take a burst, it will say, hey, I could animate that.  But there's often very jerky.  So the smoothing is kind of neat.  Only negative is this stupid logo.  See this in this little that's on all your pictures.  I don't know.  Maybe just on your gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And Google had said they plan on building this into Google Photos  at some point. Good.  So it will actually make it to Android eventually.  The HTC thing is interesting because when they when they did the whole Zoe thing,  I love Zoe's.  They had these three second videos and they had nowhere to put them.  Because if you upload them to YouTube or something, that that really sucks.  So HTC's response was to build an entire social network into the Zoe app.  And you could like share Zoe's with your friends who are also HTC customers.  It was totally ridiculous.  Yeah. But turning them into GIFs is a good solution for getting that  that content out to actual social networks that people use.  Yeah. You need a standard, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm just I'm going to look at my assistant here because what's fun.  Let me see if I have any animations.  What's fun is the way.  It will take burst mode photos and and animate them.  Oh, I guess this is asking if I want to create an animation.  That's no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There should be a section called assistant that would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm in it. I'm just saying it has a lot of because my son  graduated from high school a year ago, so three years ago.  So I have a lot of a lot of pictures.  Here we go. Here's an animated picture of our kickies.  Now, see, if they put this,  if they put see this, the reason that looks like that is because it was  it was three photos shot close in time, but not with the intent of animating them.  But if they had some smoothing and interpolation and stuff,  that could make it more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I kind of like the kind of glitchiness of it.  It's a little bit like a flipbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is like a flipbook. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like the Internet loves stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we're getting used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The demo on this is from like the Google research,  which is pretty crazy.  And the the demo of it is like the stabilization wasn't just the weird  YouTube stabilization where everything kind of turns into jello.  Yeah, they had like it looked like they were getting some kind of point cloud,  like out of your your video, like they had they showed little dots  on everything in the background, like it was getting kind of like  a real 3D look at things and then could use that to stabilize the camera.  It seems like the stabilization would be really good and advanced,  especially coming out of the research section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say, I just love Google Photos,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the fact that they made a photo album out of my son's graduation.  I, you know, I forgot this was 2013.  It's just really great to have, you know, in fact, I sent a link.  I saw this in my photos and I said a link to my son.  I said, remember this day three years ago?  Isn't that cool just that it does that for you?  I love that.  So you said they're putting more AI, they're going to do more with the photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, photos already uses AI for all of the search stuff.  Like you can type in amazing cars and it will like recognize  that there's cars in your your thing and show them.  And it sounds like this thing uses a good amount of machine  learning to to get the kind of to train the video stabilization software.  I guess. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it when companies take the stuff that's in the labs  and just put them out as not necessarily a complete product or  just do it because it's fun. It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Facebook has done a similar image search on like  if you search horses, it will show you pictures of horses, for example.  So they're doing a similar thing with their AI or machine learning efforts.  And then I'm just I'm just offering this is what everybody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, oh, I can do that. Oh, yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, we got that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're using actual.  But they're there.  If they haven't applied it, they're starting.  They're starting to apply it in different parts of their business.  So they used machine learning for images to do their maps  for showing where Internet connectivity wasn't that they took it.  They took the machine learning bottle that they trained to recognize  geophysical,  geophysical things.  They took satellite maps of the world,  and then they used their machine learning model to figure out where people lived  so they could figure out where to try to fly their drones or  they're doing the drones, right?  Their lasers, their balloons, their everybody's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All the same stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And then Shutterstock actually uses  a similar machine learning algorithm to show you.  And this is kind of interesting.  The best possible outcome or the best possible  photograph to purchase if you search for like horses.  And they said that they saw I think it was an 80 percent increase  in their sales in the first week, which is pretty cool.  And that's actually it's worth saying that they optimized for a different.  No, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I was like, did you all lose?  But they optimized for sales versus like accuracy of the image  or something you might like more, which I think is cool.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One thing I don't want Google to do is is compose music.  Oh, that was terrible.  For they calling it Project Magenta, which, by the way, is not just for music.  Magenta is machine intelligence in the arts.  So it's going to do music. It's going to do arts, going to do stories.  I was asking Carson if he could if he could find the magenta music to play for us.  This is the first machine made song  from Google's magenta.  Now I have to point out that it only is using four notes C, C, G and G,  which sounds like two notes to me.  But I guess music people know that there's differences.  I don't know.  Carson's looking for the song to play.  Yeah, I mean, but again, we're in the infancy and these are two year olds.  Basically, this is the very beginning of machine learning.  They haven't learned much yet.  Yeah, I don't see how generated music is particularly interesting, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The art thing is really weird.  Look at this. This is kind of psychedelic, isn't it?  It's very Geiger, HR Geiger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll wait.  Hold on a sec. There you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It sounds like a three year old at a piano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just do four notes.  I don't know, because it's a brain that's not so smart.  I was going to say, it's probably limiting.  Here comes the drum.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Is it boring?  It's dopey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, not impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, now listen to this and look at the psychedelic art that I've got on my screen.  Now, what would you say?  I would say it's a little bit more like a  Now, what would you say?  That's the art magenta made.  That's at least weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like beyond something any person would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of like this.  This is very, like I said, HR Geiger.  OK, enough of the googly CCGG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're totally different.  One is very cheerful and happy and innocent sounding, because it sounds like a kid's playing it.  And then that art is like, ugh.  The dark underbelly of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the art is also like extremely complex, which is what this stuff is good at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like the music is not, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think anybody could pound away on four notes and come up with something like that.  But if you if you handed me a pencil, I could definitely not draw whatever that that weird black thing was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a video.  This is not working.  I don't know what's going on there.  A video based on Deep Dream, which is that Google A.I.  you know, that that looks at stuff and then does it looks like an LSD trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of this does, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's probably some something to be derived from that observation, but I'm not sure what.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say so for creativity, I have to say this is actually way more compelling than IBM's Watson creativity efforts, which were around cooking.  I mean, the results of that are awesome.  Have you had any of Watson's cooking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Is it whoa or go or slow or no?  It's delicious.  Different really different.  Where have you had it?  And tell us about it.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was South by Southwest.  I think it was what year is it?  OK, 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A human did it right?  I mean, the recipe was from Watson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watson Watson takes like a bunch of different things, like including like what flavors are paired in different regions.  And then it's got a thing that says like these are the types of things people are most attracted to sweet and salty.  And right. Yeah.  So then it takes those things and it spits out random recipe pairings and then someone from I think it's like maybe it's the court on blue school.  Maybe it's somebody else.  They actually cook it.  So they did this awesome dinner at South by in the coolest and most delicious pairing was like these olives and cherries like top and odd kind of thing.  And it was delicious.  But some of olives and cherries, top and odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was that sounds like food only a computer could generate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think a human would think of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's I thought it was really exciting because sweet and salty.  Yeah.  I mean, you wouldn't think of it in there.  You go and they have the cookbook and I've seen the cookbook, but I've not made anything out of the cookbook.  So I can't tell you about that.  We can put that on our kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to get. Yeah, I'm going to get that cookbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a go.  IBM will send it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not sold in stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is sold in stores, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think.  Sold in stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  U.S. Supreme Court is going to let the Google advertising class action suit go forward.  They let stand a lower court's decision to allow a class action lawsuit.  So that doesn't mean it's going to the Supreme Court, but they didn't block the lower court from having the trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a fairly limited.  I think there's a case here, too.  It's from 2004, 2008, and Google was putting ads on junk pages that were paid for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It accused Google of violating the California fair advertising laws because it told advertisers, it misled advertisers about where the ads are going to go.  They they the ad words, of course, puts ads next to search results.  But Google should also have told the advertisers it would also appear their ads would also appear in undesirable places like error pages and parks domains.  But I don't think Google did that on purpose.  Right. Isn't that AdWords?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, people are free to put AdWord blocks on anything they want.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think Google has some measure of standards they need to set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, if I if I because it's just an embed, if I have an AdWords account and I put AdWords on my 404 page, I mean, it's very it was very common practice to do that with it was at the time.  Yes. Yeah.  With search errors or with parking domains.  A lot of you see a lot of park domains that would just have a whole three columns ads.  I don't know if you buy Google AdWords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't this in early days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just going to say I would think this is fixed today.  And this is just a really old lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what that's what I'm saying is that I think it was an issue and it was fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they want damages, which is, you know, apparently you can you can think Scalia for the Supreme Court not getting involved in this.  Normally, the Supreme Court does did not like to take class action suits.  But Scalia loved him.  I don't know.  And so he didn't love him in the sense he loved class action suits, but he would take them in order to overturn them.  He didn't like him, but he but he loved to take them.  If that makes any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just put something on the run.  I think it'll interest you.  Yes.  So Zuckerberg just hired college humor co-founder Ricky Van Veen to become the the head of global creative strategy for Facebook.  And in our constant discussion of whether the platforms have their own content, this looks like an interesting turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's hiring a content guy, right?  Yeah.  Got to have a Facebook original series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's going to be focused on getting more interesting stuff into Facebook's live video as well as 360 video format.  Note, of course, they're paying some celebrities and media companies, including Vox, to which which writes about the story to make video.  That's interesting.  I'll be working with all types of creators and organizations to figure out how best to use the biggest network in the world to better connect people with engaging and meaningful content.  He wrote in a Facebook post.  Reporting to VP of Content Nick Gruden.  Nick is a good guy who also works with a lot of works with news at a very high level in the company.  So I so this is I thought this really interesting move.  My friend Fred Graver, who's now a Twitter ex big TV guy of his own sort, just tweeted about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And from the chat room.  This is cool.  Bon Appetit has a website IBM Chef Watson dot com.  There you go.  Where you can get help from Watson.  So pick an ingredient.  And here let me start.  Let me go back to the beginning because this is kind of cool.  So it's empty.  You can look for ingredients.  So let's say what goes well with aged rum and pumpkin, strawberry and clove would be good.  So here's aged rum stuffing pudding.  Here's an age room sandwich featuring ground chuck honey aged rum, French bread, carrot, pumpkin, green beef, olive oil, strawberry and clove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that there's no picture for that one.  Yum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yum.  Nobody ever made that one.  Here's aged rum fish dish aged rum.  So this is how about a Chini di Pepe and aged rum.  I don't know, but it makes a great linguine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, pick an ingredient, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can actually see I'm mixing and matching here.  Now I've got aged rum lasagna featuring an impossible ingredient.  I would have thought I OK, you can't add an almond macaroon to aged rum, a Chini di Pepe and Aleppo pepper.  Can you?  Nope.  No recipe with this makes sense at all.  Let's take out a few of these.  And orange juice, chicken, pineapple and red wine, celeriac, apple and coffee bean.  And you're going to get...  Oh, that's weird.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I can see how that would help.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about a red wine spritzer?  This sounds horrible.  Red wine, soda water, celeriac, lime juice, apple and coffee beans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only a computer could create that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although apparently somebody has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's that horrible black goo that Brits like?  Marmite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Marmite?  Should I see what we can do with marmite?  Yeah, see what we can do with marmite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But nothing goes with marmite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nothing goes with marmite.  Marmalade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't have marmite.  They have marmalade.  That's a brand name though.  Search.  Oh, you're so smart.  This is why you get the big bucks at ours, Technica.  No, those are brand names.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  This is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Brussels sprouts are inedible myself.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People love Brussels sprouts.  I'm trying to think of...  Sunchokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those are pretty impossible.  I like sunchokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about if you take a little Brussels sprouts, onion powder, grape and cranberry, and you  can make Brussels sprouts spaghetti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lisa doesn't like Brussels sprouts and I have been trying endlessly.  Oh, they are cabbages that were at Three Mile Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're delicious.  I love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're definitely a go in my house.  Like go throw those out right now.  What did you say that you can't cook with anything with, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sunchokes.  Sunchokes.  What are sunchokes?  Are they like artichokes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jerusalem artichoke.  Oh, that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Jerusalem artichokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a watery kind of thing.  So, a little Fresno pepper, a little sunchoke, some chive and onion, you've got sunchoke

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  casserole.  Sunchoke to stada.  Oh, that's weird.  Sunchoke to stada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, add a little chicken egg yolk, egg, onion, Fresno pepper, goat cheese, chive, salt, milk  and buttermilk and you got a sunchoke casserole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do they get the picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody must have made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Bon appetit.  I mean, IBM probably paid Bon Appetit a lot of money to run some of these through their  test kitchen.  But it's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's brilliant.  I love this.  This is a great page.  IBM Chef Watson dot com.  I am thank you chat room for coming up with this.  They call it cognitive cooking.  Let's get cooking.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can also choose a dish or pick a style.  It's an anniversary.  Let's have the computer cook.  Tomatoes, strawberry, coriander and sweet paprika.  Happy anniversary tomato break.  Happy anniversary tomato pasta salad.  How about honey?  I made you an anniversary tomato tomato sandwich with egg, champagne, vinegar, green peas,  tomato, strawberry, pita, kosher salt, soy sauce, hot sauce, collard greens, coriander,  sea sweet paprika and a ground clove for flavor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what's his name?  Who's the Washington Post columnist who said that if Trump became the nominee, he would  eat his column.  Yeah.  You see all that?  And he and so he had favorite chefs come in and they cooked his column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's not fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of brilliant.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why I like working on the web.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I know what the so the Russian River every year has a slug festival trying to turn  the bad into a that's right up the right up the road from us.  What about slugs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slugs are not on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't cook.  You could try snails.  I had to be a judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had to be a judge at the slug festival.  There was there was a slugaroni, the Russian River treat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a spam festival in Austin, but I prefer that to slugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the trick with snails, if you want to turn snails into escargot is and we used to do  You got to get a big barrel of cornmeal and you put the snail in the cornmeal and it eats  its way out and it gets rid all the slime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, the snails eat their way out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK.  Hey, we got to talk about Ness, don't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Ron.  Thank you, Ron.  So Tony Fidel leaving the nest and I loved the story after this is let me see if I can  find this story after this is Ron Amadio.  I love his stuff.  After Nest was acquired and also love your illustration, Ron.  After Nest was acquired by Google, they had they were offered unlimited funds and basically  told and it doesn't matter if you have anything, you know, make anything an unlimited budget,  no results, quadrupled its employees.  It sounds like a mess.  Was this all Tony Fidel's fault?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, he he's from the Apple School of Thinking like he used to work at Apple.  So he wanted to make himself the center of everything at the company.  So it's it's kind of hard to blame anybody other than him.  And I feel like it definitely went down like a firing because they announced they announced  he was leaving on like a Friday afternoon, which he said, I've been thinking about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  since last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, sure.  The Verge reported that he actually told them in December, he told.  So I'm not saying that that's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, I'm thinking of having a heart attack in December.  I'm thinking just write this all down, firing myself in December.  And then when it happens, you can just say, you know, I told you in May, June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the Verge story actually talked about and it ties to what Ron's story did, which was  he came on at his vision, visionary guy, and he thought he was going to have like YouTube  runway.  Yeah.  And now with Alphabet, the Alphabet rejiggering last year, he suddenly was like going to be  held accountable for sales and product deliveries and less vision.  So no wonder.  I mean, I can see how someone like Tony Fidel would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I feel like I feel like Nest was the kind of inspiration for Alphabet, where they  he ran his own company just inside Google and they they kind of came up with the Alphabet  thing.  Yes.  But remember, this was the first Alphabet company part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there were it was kind of a double edged sword or maybe a carrot and a stick because  partly they wanted to give CEOs more control over their company and be able to say to somebody,  oh, no, no, you're not just an employee at Google.  You're the CEO of Nest.  But at the same time, because of accounting reporting, their results would be public.  So there was some accountability as well.  So yeah, you're going to get more autonomy, but also we're going to pay more attention  to how you're doing.  And you did feel like the heat was being turned up on Nest, like that, that Larry and the  others are kind of starting to look over there and saying, I don't like what's going on over

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there.  How do I think they go ahead?  No, you go ahead.  Oh, they they had what I was just going to say.  They had like a four times increase in their employees and they are they already had the  smoke detector and the thermostat before they joined Google.  And under Google, all they did is buy DropCam and like rebrand it.  And when you're alphabet, you've got to say like, hey, you need to deliver more than than  just these tiny little minor updates.  And and they couldn't.  And there's all sorts of stories about the stuff that they were working on that just  was never good enough to see release or that they never wanted to release.  And they just sucked up a ton of resources and sat there and spun their wheels.  And yeah, it seems like he got fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you want to devil's advocate perspective?  Sure.  I think they did a lot of things.  And if you look at it as a long term vision, works with Nest took a lot of resources and  they were trying.  They did not succeed utterly with that.  But that was a really good program for pushing interoperability in the smart home on the  Nest platform.  So I would say that I mean, they went from nothing to more than 80 partners.  So and that was all individual efforts.  And then the other thing is they created the thread protocol.  Again, these are not things that you can sell.  So if you think of Nest as a hardware company, you're like, oh, you guys, you're sucking  wind.  If you think of them as pushing forth a vision for the connected home, they were actually  doing that.  It's just you can't monetize that, which is a big problem.  It feels like at some point, I think that's true, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only question I think that the story is pointed out is what have they done for you  lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I feel like at some point, Google soured on Nest, like they were high on Nest.  They were excited.  They gave them half a billion dollars to buy Dropcam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then at some point, Google made them by Dropcam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google made them by Dropcam.  They had started that acquisition before they bought Nest.  Okay.  I mean, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they gave them Dropcam.  Yes, they gave them.  But you can see their writing on the wall.  When Rich Osterloh, who came to Google from Motorola, then left and went to Lenovo, but  came back to Google, to Google, by the way, not to Alphabet or Nest, to Google and was  put in charge of hardware, that maybe the original plan was Nest is going to be our  hardware home division.  And then maybe not.  Like there was a flip at some point.  I love this paragraph from Ron's article.  He says, in 2015, Nest posted job listings for its Nest audio team.  The team would be responsible for quote, developing an audio roadmap for Nest products,  end quote.  Industry observers suspected the audio team was building a smart Bluetooth speaker, but  Google beat Nest to the punch with Google Home.  According to the report from the information, when Nest found out about Google Home, it  asked to work on the project with Google.  Nest's request was turned down.  Corporate politics.  Yeah.  Somebody soured on him.  I'm sure that Tony Fadal's personality didn't help.  Oh, yeah.  Because he's kind of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think, yeah, and I think it's clear Google was staying away from smart home stuff  and now they're not.  Right.  Which I think definitely means Nest, they felt like Nest was some kind of failure and  they just needed to go off and do their own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nest had something called Project Flintstone that they had been working on for three years.  It had been killed or changed so many times.  You report that one former employee called it Tombstone.  Flintstone was a home security system.  You say Flintstone seems like another case of Nest being too slow for Google.  Google's on-hub router performed some of the functions that Nest's Flintstone was at one  time meant to perform.  In other words, Google once again looked over the wall, looked over the transom and said,  you know, let's do it ourselves.  These guys are never going to finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing about the Works with Nest program is it's like, why is my thermostat  the hub of my household?  It's the last place.  It doesn't seem like it's a cohesive vision that they tried to build.  They're just like, well, this is what we have, so let's build it into the thermostat.  When really it should be in some kind of a box that's kind of separate from everything  and that's what Flintstone sounded like it was going to be, but it just hasn't happened yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually a big contentious point in the smart home is where that stuff should  live and a lot of there's a huge number of people who are like, screw the hub.  You know, this stuff shouldn't live there.  Samsung's putting it in televisions because they're like, it's a device that people already  have.  You don't want to buy another thing.  That's why they threw it into Nest and the idea with their weave protocol, the Nest weave,  which does a lot of the same things, but is different because they're not friends, was  that it wouldn't eventually live in just the Nest or the thermostat.  It would live in everything.  It's a mesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a mesh protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, I mean, there's again, I think what happened is the smart home looked really awesome for  a little while and people were like, yes, yes, go, go.  And then they're like, oh, whoa, this is confusing.  Nothing's interoperable.  Do we lose her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we didn't lose her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She just stopped for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You weren't interoperable there for a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the first day when it's really hot and when it gets really hot, the beginning  of every season summer, I have to call Time Warner because my cable, like the frequencies  get messed up.  It's too hot, man.  It's really weird.  I know they have to come out to the box and fix it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How telling was it when Brad Fitzpatrick, who created Live Journal is now at Google,  created a video in February saying, do not buy a smoke alarm.  They false alarm and are unhushable pieces of crap.  But I mean, this is not a good ad from somebody who ostensibly works under the same corporate  umbrella.  Now, admittedly, Brad Fitzpatrick probably gets to do whatever he wants at Google.  But I think that's a sign that Google had set out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, the hate internally from Googlers was pretty crazy.  You can see some of the pictures down there that they made and the YouTube video.  That was probably a big part of it.  The employees kind of like, rised up and started to complain about the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They put these on internal message boards at Google.  Yeah.  It's just alphabet goodwill.  It's a wedge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In terms of what you build a hub into, though, I don't really want it built into anything  at this point because smart homes are so kind of new and flaky that I just want to be able  to take the hub and throw it in the trash when something better comes out.  Like, I don't want to build into my television because I'm going to keep the TV for years  and years where the smart home stuff knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most people don't want to deal with that.  I mean, like I'm that way, too.  I've got four hubs because why not?  But most people are like, they don't want a hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think most people are content with standalone devices that have their own apps.  My sprinkler has its own app.  My lights, the outdoor lights have their own app.  My doorbell has its own app.  My hue lights have their own app.  That's easier, I think, for most normal people than getting a hub working with a single app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it totally is.  If you want to tell me what you've got, I can totally recommend hubs and things that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  work.  I have the latest SmartThings and I just never said that a lot.  No?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you like?  SmartThings, it's open and awesome, but it's not as reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that's my point exactly, which is you spend all this energy getting everything working  and it's a house of cards.  Right.  Yeah, it really is.  And so I agree with you, Ron.  I'm going to wait and maybe this will all shake out, maybe it won't, but at least I  can still sell it when my doorbell rings and I can turn off my sprinkler.  And I'm just going to leave it at that.  I don't mind.  That's why I have 200 apps on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think the question is, Next, is what does Nest do next now that they have a new  CEO?  The CEO, I'm not going to get his name off the top of my head.  It's like Fawwans or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Marwan Fawzi Bear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He used to work at Google.  He was in charge of when they had Motorola, he was in charge of the Motorola Home Division.  Marwan Fawaz.  Fawaz, yeah.  And all he really did with the Home Division was ship it out the door.  He sold it for like some billion dollars to Aris like six months after he took it over.  Nice job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's what he's like.  He's a spinoff guy, right?  He's a sell.  He's an M&A guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, in the article, I kind of speculated that he was like the Grim Reaper at Google  where he just kind of shows up and pounce on the sales arm.  But during the show, an article came out at The Verge, I think it was, where they found  Nest released like an internal memo that said, we're not going to sell the company.  We're totally going to get all those products that we were working on.  We're totally going to make those and like release those as real products.  And they're very much at like stay the course right now.  Yes, that, which is insane to me.  Like I can't imagine Nest being any good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I were Fawaz, I would tell the employees that until we got the sale done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was going to say I saw your story and I started thinking about Nest and what  it has to offer.  And because it has such rigorous terms of service and privacy kind of standards, if  it were sold as a standalone company, what you're selling is the millions of Nest customers  with a device that don't pay a subscription.  So you're getting the data.  You're going to have to support this device for like 10 years.  So you're buying an obligation basically to support this in the cloud.  And it's unclear if you can change the TOS or not.  I mean, you could always try it, but the FTC is kind of like keeping an eye on stuff like  that.  And I guarantee they would look at this.  So then what is the business value of Nest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And while I'm looking at Nest, like what is left for Alphabet to use and like when you  set up a company where you are the Steve Jobs in this company, where every minor decision  runs through you and then you leave, like what is left of that company for Alphabet  to salvage?  And we've already heard about employee exodus is there and people like crying in the bathrooms  and how it's a bad place to work.  I can't imagine many of the good people still hung around.  So I don't know what Google thinks they're going to salvage from Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they could just like I think there's a huge opportunity to sell these devices.  I think it's probably going to be more interesting to sell them through different channels.  So not direct to consumers because most people have purchased a Nest if they're going to  purchase it, I feel like in the smart home is totally stagnated.  So I would look for him to do deals with Comcast, with AT&T, with anybody who's doing those  kind of sales to customers like the mainstream America.  And then also, you know, Nest did some deals with ADT.  It was like a promotional deal.  You got ADT Pulse.  You got a Nest along with it.  ADT Pulse is their security plus home automation product and the deals with insurance companies.  And this guy is he's got the experience to do that kind of thing and ship.  He's on the ADT board, right?  He was.  And he actually was on the technical advisory board when they started doing their smart  home efforts.  So he's not I mean, he's aware of this space.  So I tried to talk to him.  They were like, nope, not going to talk to you, Stacey.  So we'll see.  I'm hopeful because I think it's a different it's a strategy shift.  And I'm not sure if in the long term, Alphabet's going to want this.  But I don't think they're going to be ready to let it go just yet.  Because it's still a space that is going to do something.  It will be useful.  It's just we're not sure how yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the most valuable part of Nest is the devices that they have made and the install  base that they do have.  But that's all in the past.  I think it's the future of Nest.  The future of Nest is the least valuable part.  Like I don't think there's a serious company there in place that can do great things in  the future anymore.  I think all that kind of got dismantled or quit or left.  What do they pay for it?  Three point two billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm.  Plus another half a billion or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not as bad as Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  True.  And at the time Nest was selling about 40,000 thermostats a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  What are they selling now?  Has it gone down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They will not tell you.  Yeah.  No, they said 50% year over year, every year.  So if you know what year they were selling that amount, you can do some math, right?  When was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They bought them in January 2014.  Are they announced?  Did they announce the deal then?  Or did they?  Let me find the 40,000 number because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, anyway, if they're growing 50% every year, that's good.  That's what they told you, Ron, after your article got published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, my PR letter.  But supposedly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll have you know, we're growing 50% a year.  Ecobee's growing 100% a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know who else is growing 50% a year?  Axel Rose.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.  He's real upset about it.  He's coming off the top of his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the last two weeks, Axel Rose has filed 11 DMCA takedown requests to Google saying,  I want those pictures of me from this 2010 Winnipeg concert where I'm really fat and  it's become a meme.  I want them taken down.  That's going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that always works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's going to work.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a website.  Best fat Axel Rose memes on the internet.  I think actually he should probably contact Tumblr.  Get this taken down.  Was it a DMCA takedown?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a DMCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I own those pictures of the fat Axel Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He needs to move to Europe and do a Right to be Forgotten.  Yeah, Right to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, is his claim that he owns the pictures because he's in them?  Like that's not how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Were they taken by his concert photographer or something?  And someone got...  I mean, because Beyonce tried that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did that work?  Did that work for Beyonce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually, I think she may have like...  I think she banned photographers that weren't certified or something from her concert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what she ended up doing, right?  That's dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Beyonce is...  She can't do no wrong.  In fact, I didn't say that.  Everyone, I did not say anything bad about Beyonce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you in the...  What do they call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The beehive?  The beehive?  The beehive?  I think it's beehive.  I am not.  You're not in the beehive?  They're going to be mad at me.  I'm in the beehive.  I mean, I love Beyonce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But...  Yeah.  When we went to the Super Bowl, we saw Beyonce.  When you sat in your seats, this was in New Orleans about three or four years ago when  the Niners were there, they had a little package.  You always get a little something to hold up or show.  And they were finger, LED finger rings.  And the instructions said when Beyonce sings, put a ring on it, you all have to go with  your finger ring.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Taylor Swift does that at her concert.  She helps everybody get synchronized light sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cool, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, it would have been more cool if we'd won the game.  Yeah.  Anything else?  I'm just looking here.  I don't see anything really worth...  We've had a good show.  Let's end on a high note.  The fat Axl Rose meme.  I'm going to say Beyonce.  Beyonce is a high note.  We're going to come back after this break and get your number, Jeff, if you've still  got one.  We didn't use it up.  Oh yeah, I got one there.  And any tips or recommendations?  Our guests are on Amadeo from Mars Technica and our regular, I'm pleased to say, co-host  Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IoT have for us.  But first a word from texture.  I know I still love magazines.  I know journalism's in trouble, but there's still great long form journalism being done  in some of the best magazines in the world.  Every week there's something in The New Yorker I want to read.  Every month there's something in Rolling Stone or Vanity Fair, you know, Wired that I want  to read.  But if I were to subscribe to all those magazines, my coffee table would break under the load  and I'm certainly not going to buy individual editions in the newsstand.  That'd be hundreds of dollars a month.  That's why texture is so cool.  It's like Netflix, but for magazines, instead of binge watching, you can binge read and  this is what you need for your summer, man.  Read all the magazines that you love on your iPad or your phone or your Android tablet.  Read them.  It's every page is in the newsstand edition plus back issues plus bonus features you can't  get on print like videos, National Geographic's in there, Interview Magazine, Men's Health  and stuff maybe you wouldn't subscribe to like, I don't know, I like every once in a  while I like to flip through Vogue or Sports Illustrated or Esquire.  There's something in there I want to read.  It's all there.  The world's most popular magazines and if you don't know what to read, their editors  have top stories and new and noteworthy sections plus curated sections with specific topics  so you can dive deep into interviews and stories in an area that you're interested in and sometimes  you know you want to know, so what's happening with Beyoncé?  How's that Jay-Z thing working out?  You can read your People magazine or your Entertainment Weekly or you know, it's all  in there.  I love it.  Texture.com slash twig.  You try it free, really get a sense of it.  Texture.com slash twig.  You'll gain immediate entry to all the top magazines including back issues, bonus video  content and it's free right now for a limited time at Texture, T-E-X-T like texture.com  slash twig.  They've reimagined the magazine experience and I think they're keeping magazines alive.  I love it.  I really love it.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Before I start, I want to just mention one thing that I mentioned earlier briefly but  I went to, I use a three, I'm making a three.  Three's good.  Love three.  I went to a Altschulspringer session, summit on distributed content with 25 publishers,  then Newsgeist with 150 people in the business, then 100 people at a Google Play event and  I wrote a piece on Medium about this just before the show.  I dashed it out.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would have never, man you're good because this is a nice piece.  I would never have thought you just dashed it out.  The airplane helped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The airplane helped.  Yes.  Though I slept on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Getting Google and publishers to share love and data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So just the quick thing here is that I found that publishers have been saying, we want  data.  Google, give us data.  Google says, well you don't know what you want and you won't know what to do with it.  So I went to these conferences saying we've got to get more specific about what our desires  and goals are and by God it kind of worked.  People had ideas about how, for example, Google could help improve the recommendations we make  to our readers, maybe eliminating something called tabula in our brain, I don't know.  Also if Google knew that you were a subscriber to the New York Times, when you search on  a topic, shouldn't New York Times topic content come up because you subscribe and pay for  it?  Maybe to protect privacy we need to have a framework to categorize users and content  in ways that Google could share with us, Facebook publishers could share with each other.  So the only point is that I have a constant quest for peace in the kingdom and trying  to bring publishers and platforms together to do things rather than just fighting and  presuming evil of the other or stupidity of the other as the case may be.  And it was a heartwarming productive week, I think.  We'll see, I'm an optimist, but I think it was a week of jet lag well spent.  So I just wanted to kind of plug Google and Springer and all the publishers and editors  who came all in good faith and a lot of good discussion and good efforts and so that's it.  I saw that picture of you and Richard Gingras.  Yeah, it was funny.  Yeah, because we're soon to be double gangers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you both got the beard and the black and I think so he's still in charge of Google  News and promoting AMP and listening to publishers.  Was he the listener in chief?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, for news guys, he's kind of the emcee.  News guys does an unconference so you went up with like 60 different sessions on a lot  of fascinating topics.  It's great.  I love that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, what are you liking these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I have to first correct myself from last week when I said that Kevin worked for  Kevin Toffle.  Kevin Toffle worked for the Chromecast team.  That was wrong.  I was I was I was all excited.  Half right.  Chromecast.  I was blinded by the Chrome.  He works for the Chrome at work and the Android at work teams.  So keep that in mind, y'all.  And here is my recommendation.  This is only it's not only for parents, but with summer coming up, this is a game.  You can play with your kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want a game.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a Forbidden Island.  Forbidden Island.  And okay, y'all, this is like the most complicated game you will ever encounter.  I'm buying it right now.  But it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a I love board games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a collaborative play game.  So you play all together as a team and your goal is to catch all of those four little  pieces before your island sinks.  And there's limitations on how you can play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it that as a cooperative game.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My daughter hates playing things that are super competitive.  So she loves this game.  And it's like I said, it's complex for I mean, it's complex to learn.  It's not actually that complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your daughter's a little young for this age 10 and up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's going to be 10 in August.  August is close enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2010 Mensa favorite Brainy Games winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's fun.  It's a strategy game.  So I totally recommend it for if you're bored this summer and you want to hang out with  your kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you ever played the resistance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  Oh, no, I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this is not for your kid.  This is for 13.  I think teenagers love this because it's really some people are spies.  Some people are resistance is kind of werewolf with us with a kind of a Hunger Games feel  to it.  It's really good.  It's really fun.  And there's a lot of strategy.  Oh, it's like it.  It's challenging.  Yeah, it's a kind of a I like you know what board games summertime and board games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They go to 100 degrees here.  So I'm going outside.

Transcript:  Wow.  Ron Amadea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you doing these days?  What are you excited about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well my I was going to recommend a YouTube channel to everybody.  It's called Captain Christian and it's a don't worry about the name.  It's like a video essay kind of thing on like geek culture.  So a lot of it has to do with superheroes lately for some reason.  But there's there's one about like the X-Men where they're the movies are like ashamed  of the X-Men costumes and and how important color kind of is to the design of the X-Men  and how in the movies everybody just wears black leather and it's and it's super lame.  But it's a the videos are all like incredibly well done and well edited and narrated and  everything and the channel only has like 80,000 subscriptions.  It's pretty new, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it's only like two months old.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it started.  It started about two months ago, but the content is excellent and definitely something I would  recommend people subscribe to if they're into kind of fun little dissertations on whatever  the geeky topic of the month is.  Captain Christian with K's.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so this is nerd culture, baby.  Nerd culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very nice.  But again, in terms of tech stuff next week, we've got or know what tomorrow we've got  the Lenovo tech world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you said the Moto Z.  Is that going to be like a Moto X like plus two or it's the new Motorola flagship is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's at least what the rumor mill says, regardless of what the name turns out to be.  Who cares?  It's going to be this really weird thing that has like modules again, like the G5.  Like there's a set of like Pogo pins on the back where you can clip stuff into it.  Is the G5 even out yet?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People have it?  Somewhere here.  This.  All right.  See any phone you ask is within arms reach.  And then what else?  There's something else going on that I was going to.  I don't remember.  Well, there's going to be project Tango at Tech World.  And and that's all I can think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess if I think about it, they couldn't really follow the Moto X with the Moto Y.  It's like Moto X is every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see this year.  Lenovo is really taking over Motorola and ruining them.  So it's going to be some fun.  It'll be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gonna be a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, kids.  What fun this was.  It's been a pleasure.  And we got some good stuff going here.  Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York and BuzzMachine.com, his blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we're still.  I think we took your good advice and Lisa's good advice.  And what we're trying to do is kind of get our act together and figure out what it is  first.  And then do it every day.  Yeah, well, not every day.  Every week.  So, yeah.  Also, you're traveling a lot soon, right?  That's actually, I think I'm through the worst of it.  Oh, good.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's climate appropriate.  All right.  Well, that would be a go or a whoa.  I think a whoa for sure.  I'm not swimming in that.
