It's time for Twig this week in Google.  We're going to do a show where we talk about Google, the Google sometimes as I like to call them the goog, the cloud.  Sometimes we venture off into different directions, Facebook, social media, all sorts of topics.  But you know, we've got a lot of Google stuff to talk about today.  So I have a feeling we're going to be mostly on point.  I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo Laporte, who is I think he's in Anaheim, right?  He's traveling to Anaheim for the podcast movement.  There we go.  So he's not here this afternoon.  I'm joining you.  I'm super thrilled to be back.  Joined as always by Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com, professor at the CUNY School of Journalism.  How you doing, Jeff?  Hey, so is it L-Google, La-Google, Gator-Google?  I think well, you know what?  Based on the success of a trademark story that we're going to be talking about a little bit later, it might be all over the place.  It might have the change and it might stay Google.  It might be lowercase Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google might be the new Kleenex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think they're going to lose that, but we'll talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll definitely talk about that.  It's good to see you, man.  Also joining us as usual, Stacy Higginbotham, creator of the IoT Podcast at IoTPodcast.com and the Internet of Things newsletter at stacy on IoT.com.  How you doing, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am super, super well.  Super well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Super good.  I'm excited to be here today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've had a lot of coffee.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes for the best show.  I think we're all super confident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everyone be alert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you have you have kind of some things happening in the background behind the scenes.  Your Google Home is booting up because you're going to maybe if we can get it to work, you're going to maybe test out the making a phone call with your Google Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We love doing these raw demos where we don't actually know what's going to happen.  We troubleshoot so you don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  We make telephone calls because no one makes telephone calls.  So you might as well see someone making telephone calls.  I don't know.  I guess I don't make very many telephone calls in my life anymore.  It's all text.  It's all messaging.  But it's nice to have this feature.  It hit my Google Home a couple of days ago.  And then I promptly made a telephone call to myself because I didn't want to bother anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, because you have no friends because that's how I felt when I alerted my Amazon Echo to its calling features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, oh, I don't have any friends.  Wow. Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to message my phone from my Echo.  Exactly.  I was like, someone go in the room.  We'll try it from here.  I mean, do you know?  I mean, I'm sure you know people who do have the Echo.  Have you ever thought about like giving them a call on their Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the only person I've ever called on the Echo.  Well, I called my daughter in her room.  So we use it like an intercom.  Actually, that's been useful the last couple of days.  But mostly I call Kevin Toffle just to like freak him out in the middle of the day.  Do you have drop in privileges with Kevin?  So we don't have Kevin doesn't have a show.  So, I mean, so no, I just make the formal phone call because he and like,  I think one other person are the only people I have that are my Echo friends.  But Google, since it uses your phone number, you could have real friends with phone privileges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true.  I mean, it's a real phone.  Whatever. If you've got Google Voice, if you've got Project Fi,  your phone number is going to show up and otherwise they're not going to pick up the phone because it's an unknown call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But does it do the predicted spam color?  Like, I love that Google does that.  That is the greatest thing.  I love it so much.  Although I doubted it once and I learned it's like the Waze lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never, ever, ever disagree with the Waze lady.  You don't disagree with the Google spam notification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true. You just got to give your trust.  Give your trust to Google on this.  Same thing with navigation.  I completely agree.  It's any of those times when I'm like, why are you taking me down there?  That couldn't possibly save me time is when I end up screwing myself.  So just put all your faith in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To save like a minute or two, my husband will sit in a parking lot or in our driveway plotting the best route.  And I'm kind of like, you know what?  It's not worth it.  Like, let's just go.  Let's just move.  He's like, no, I see the best route.  It's a little freaky.  It's a little OCD-ish, it feels like sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Toggling the best route within the app or trying to come up with the best route himself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just like we'll be at Target or something.  And he's like, oh, we should go home.  And there are not that many ways to get home from Target.  We don't have to optimize quite so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He'll spend a minute looking that stuff up in the parking lot while someone's waiting for the spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite tweet this week, my favorite tweet this week was someone's it was a guy saying that 20, 20 years of wonderful marriage, the secret of success, GPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  GPS is pretty magical.  It takes it takes it takes the power out of everyone's hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It saves you from the argument, the worst arguments of all.  I don't know.  I don't know how I live my life without you.  But what Stacey has a whole new thing in is obsessing over routes.  I like that. I would I would do that, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think as we get more technology in our lives, we're like kind of like it's the same thing.  It's like Yelp paralysis when you're trying to pick a restaurant.  Yes. And you're like, oh, let's look at all the reviews.  This is really the best restaurant.  So I tease my husband.  This is a really profound issue, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meanwhile, I mean, if you if you saved a minute in the app and you spend a minute up at the top, it doesn't matter, right?  Trying to find the best route.  So you might as well just dive right in and hit the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So so we actually had real things to talk about.  OK, complaining about.  I wait laid that we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's important, though.  I think this gets to everybody.  Hopefully all of you have a Google Home and you wonder whether you should make calls with it.  So not to mention, you'll also be able to connect your device to your Google Home via Bluetooth.  That's another thing that's coming to Google Home.  I think right now I haven't tested that out myself, but apparently Google is pushing out Bluetooth capability to Google Home.  So you have a couple of new things to try from this year's Google I.O.  Still a few things not here yet.  They had mentioned proactive assistance, which was things like if you've got a calendar event that Google Home is tracking or that you can use.  If you've got a calendar event that Google Home is tracking or that assistant is tracking, it will tell you in advance like, hey, we just noticed that there's a five minute slowdown on your route to that calendar event.  So you better hit the road right now.  So proactively, it'll it'll give you information to hopefully improve your life.  Not complicated.  And then also, what was the other one?  It was the view of of your information on other screens.  It's called visual responses.  It's the other function that we haven't seen yet.  I don't know what we're going to get to.  Christmas.  Possibly so.  Do you want to try and call someone real quick before we move on?  Because, I mean, we're already talking about Google Home.  Do you think it's all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I have.  I actually don't know.  That's what I'm like sitting here going.  I think it's set up, but it doesn't look like now.  Now, when you do it, everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when you do it for the first time, it actually gives you like before I make the call, let me tell you a few things about calling with Google Home.  So it'll probably do that the very first time you try.  But so I just need to tell it to make the call.  Yeah, you say call so and so or you can say call business.  OK, call what a business name and then it taps into the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it doesn't it doesn't say my phone, my Google account is linked.  Well, let's see what happens.  So I'm going to call a business or can I call someone from my contacts?  You can do that, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have, I think if you've shared your contacts with a system, which you probably already have, I don't know exactly on that one.  You can call from your contacts.  I just don't know if it's going to let you do that without explicit permission.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's call my husband.  I'm going to tell him he's at the same place.  Leo is.  Oh, let me let me let me wait.  Let me let me warn him really fast because warning Leo's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm telling him not to answer if you don't want to be on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably smart.  You're right.  Probably smart. We don't want to push him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I just ask it to call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you say OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, guys, I have to actually activate it.  So sorry about that.  Avert your ears.  Phones mute.  Hey, call Andrew.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is your first call with Google Home.  Here's a couple of notes.  First, emergency numbers are not available.  At the end of your call, tell me to hang up or tap the top of the Google Home.  Calling Andrew Alamon mobile.  At least it didn't read out the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was quick.  Yeah, it gives you that the very first time and then he's in the conference call after the tone and Google Voice will try to connect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so I just hung up on him because he was like he's he's confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not answering.  But there you go.  See, it works.  One thing I noticed is like if you need to if you connect to a system that requires dial presses in order, you know, the number presses in order to navigate.  I don't think you can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, IVR systems.  OK.  I can call my pharmacy and we could try an IVR system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just don't know how you enter a number like I don't.  You can't say call H.E.B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pharmacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just as a reminder, emergency calls aren't available.  Oh, God, she says it every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you're calling the pharmacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, now let's get started.  Yes.  Calling have pharmacy.  OK, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seb is H.E.B.  Good afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you for calling your H.E.B.  Pharmacy located at Village Center Drive and Far West Boulevard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do we want to order?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're calling from a physician's office, press one.  If you're a pharmacy customer, press two.  Two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's masquerade as a dumb physician.  Two.  Tap the microphone two times to do two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was an option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, runs with scissors who said you triggered my home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bound to happen.  We'll mute it in the downloaded version.  Yeah, so I don't know if there's any way to do that.  What's the advantage of this?  Of phone calls?  It's the same thing that you would do, I guess, if you had your phone next to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So, yeah, is there an advantage?  Oh, I have one.  This is actually a good use case.  If you have one in your home and your kid wants to get in touch with you, they can call  you.  They can call you.  They can call you.  Right.  Which it really should, let's be honest.  It should be able to do that, but I guess I kind of understand why it didn't launch  with it.  Hopefully they get that eventually.  That's a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The kids could just reach you no matter what if they don't have a phone.  Or your babysitter.  You could just be like, call, you know, Stacey and she'll call you.  And then you can just call her.  And then you can just call her.  And then you can just call her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you can just call her.  And then you can just call Stacey.  And I'm totally going to tell my babysitters about this.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So now it does work with multiple accounts.  Right.  So if you've set up multiple accounts, then it's going to determine who's talking and  therefore whose contact list that query is hitting.  If your babysitter tries to call you, is it going to recognize that you are you because  your babysitter is different from you?  You know what I mean?  Like your babysitter doesn't have a contact list.  Maybe your babysitter would need your number in order to do that.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we could have.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have I have a babysitter coming in, you know, 15 minutes or so.  Bring the babysitter in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll talk to the babysitter and get to the bottom of this.  Hi, welcome to your job with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you come this way, please?  I need to set you up and have your voice recorded forever on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and we're going to release it in the form of a podcast.  Are you OK with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So her house has a Google home.  So her voice is already in Google's cloud.  How crazy would it be if she walked in and Google like tracked into her contacts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that would be freaky.  That would that would venture into the weird, creepy area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We would all be like, oh, that would be big news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyways, there you go.  You know, I mean, I could see myself like in the kitchen taking care of stuff.  I need to call my parents just to check in, say hi.  Like I would use that totally.  Hopefully it sounds good on the other end.  I haven't tested that out to know what it actually sounds like when you're calling for that microphone across the room.  You know how roomy it is probably going to sound kind of echoey, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this the room I'm in sounds echoey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So sounds great through this microphone.  We need a high microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is a what's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I think this is a high.  It is a high. Yeah, the PR 40s.  Excellent. All right. So Google Home.  There we go. We started off with that news today.  Kind of along this this tip is that Wal-Mart and Google are getting into a partnership.  They're partnering up on product sales via Google Home, which is the first time that Wal-Mart has offered its products online outside of its own site.  So kind of a big deal for Wal-Mart.  Google, of course, doesn't have, you know, up until this deal doesn't have what Amazon obviously has as a feature of the Echo, which is its tight integration with its own services for selling products.  So now they do.  Wal-Mart, I mean, by many accounts, would be kind of the closest competitor in the space with with Amazon as far as the, you know, the sales aspect, although a distant second, I would say.  But you guys going to buy anything with your voice?  Is this is something that you're going to going to want to use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think? I buy very few things via voice.  Yeah, it's mostly music because it's definitive or it's reordering things I've already ordered from Amazon.  So I guess I could buy something from Wal-Mart, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have an echo, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're probably going to. I'm also. Yeah, and I'm also a snob.  I'm sorry. I just I don't I don't shop at Wal-Mart.  Yeah, yeah. I know it's out.  It's out. It's out. You elitist you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am very I'm not I'm not great about this unless I'm in a small town and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see. I couldn't agree more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I go in there. I get hives.  See, yeah, I feel that way about TGMX, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's all the bad.  We're learning so much about worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay. Oh, Stacey. Yeah, I would rather shop a Target.  She's soon going to be putting up Instagrams with hashtags and say Armani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to say Armani, Valentino and AirMaze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that AirMaze? AirMaze. Yeah, I believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyways, was it? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I buy my ammunition at Academy or Cabela's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, that's good. This is not okay.  All right. This is gone off the off the edge here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're armed. I am not armed.  I mean, I have arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not in this room anyways.  So, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not until you get the thing that punches Leo's head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not until I get that. Yeah.  But so, yeah, Walmart.  The choices are too many and it's Walmart.  And that's all I'm going to say.  So I probably won't use it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure there are.  I mean, there are obviously there are a lot of people that do shop at Walmart.  I wonder how much that Venn diagram of Walmart shoppers and Google Home owners crosses.  But maybe, I mean, you know, obviously the goal here is to is for Walmart to increase online purchases.  So maybe exposing it to new markets, new audiences or new customers through that.  And Google wants people to think of Google Home in the same way that people think of the Echo as a shopping device.  I just don't know how many people are actually shopping with their voice.  But maybe that's because I only have a Google Home and I haven't done that yet.  And I don't know the amazing aspects of it firsthand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, it'd be really awesome is if someone built a service that like scans barcodes and you could scan it and it would actually tie into both the Amazon and Google with Walmart and then get you like the best price.  Like if we were truly talking about competition, that's the sort of fulfillment that would happen.  And then these guys just turn into like fulfillment homes, houses.  But that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. Look at that. Me thinking about consumer value as opposed to vertical integration and corporate value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quit thinking about the consumer.  Haven't we learned by now?  This is going to happen late September.  Google is dropping its $95 Google Express fee.  So Google Express is kind of a way that it ties in not only to Walmart, but to Target and Costco, I think, and other brands to deliver their products.  They're dropping the $95 fee for that.  And still charging on per delivery.  So from what I understand, they're chart there.  It's going to be free delivery as long as it qualifies per merchant.  So Walmart, for example, offers free two day shipping on purchases over $35.  And so if you pay more than $35 for the products that you're buying from Walmart through Google Home, then you will pay no shipping.  It's basically passed through from the merchant on the other end.  So kind of analogous in some ways to what Amazon is offering with Prime, although Prime you have to pay upfront and then you get free shipping for the entire year.  You also get a bunch of other services along with that.  So the value proposition is a little different as far as that's concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you also get a history.  And that'll be kind of interesting because, again, like I said, I use my voice ordering only for reorders because I know what I'm going to get.  Right.  So if it keeps your history for you.  So like if I can order Tide detergent from Walmart and always get the same kind of Tide, that actually might be cool.  And they do, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do.  Easy reorder, which is a feature of Walmart that they announced earlier this year, I think that essentially tracks both your in-store purchases and your online purchases.  So you can sync that account up with Google Express to do exactly what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, the FTC just moments ago approved the Amazon Whole Foods purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, really? That just must have happened.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so just did.  So this all becomes really meaty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is so exciting to me because I and this is something I've been thinking about is how I want to order my groceries.  And I really I don't want to sit there and tell Amazon or Google Apples.  I don't want to read a list to it. Right.  Nor do I actually think I want to do the dash wand.  So I think what would be really awesome is if Amazon and Walmart got a step above and started creating like.  Did a tie in with like a recipe site so you could click, you know, I want to make this, this and this this week.  It generates shopping lists based on that, plus your staples.  And then it's there.  So I think there's still a missing piece to make this really easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Way back when my children way back when I was part of the founding team for Epicurious, we worked on just that.  I was way too early.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm excited because like I feel like this is not a crazy thing to want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But maybe we worked. We worked on this for Epicurious.  It was way too early because there was no mechanism to actually buy it.  So what would you get? You make a kind of, you know, a shopping list on your phone.  But that was the idea, as you could say.  But the complication often is it always comes down to digital inventory.  What's your inventory in your house? What do you actually have?  Do you really need that ingredient? You don't need to buy every ingredient and everything you make.  So how does your house know what it has?  It's an interesting challenge.  It's also a challenge.  Well, you assume you're organized, Stacey.  Look at my office. I'm not organized.  I also don't cook with a sorry, with a damn darn.  But the second problem is if you're if you're if you're Wal-Mart and if you're Whole Foods, fine, there's digital inventory.  But I years ago talked to PayPal and eBay when they were together about trying to get local advertisers involved.  The problem, they said, was that local merchants don't have their inventory digitized.  And I wrote up a whole business plan for basically the the open table of local merchants that if you handled your inventory anyway,  it would then make it available online.  And then you start to bring in new development mechanisms, delivery mechanisms, because the U.S.  Post Office, if it has any sense, is going to fight for this, too.  They're going to compete in this space as well.  There's going to be tons of local merchants and tons of local delivery options.  So you get to a world where you say, I want chili quiles and you should be presented with choices as to where and how to get them.  That's what is best for you as the consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. I also like chili quiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say also the best choice for the consumer is a chili quile.  Yeah, very chili quile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it quile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've always said chili quiles.  I didn't put on the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The most important thing to talk about, Stacey.  I don't want to get it.  No, no, no, no, no.  I put up I put up a tweet just for Stacey this week.  I was in Trader Joe's.  I was in Trader Joe's.  You bought it.  I bought it. I have it.  Yes, I haven't eaten it.  I bought I looked at this at this jar of queso and the nutrition was like zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.  I said, how is this possible?  It's cheese.  And so I tweeted Leo and Stacey and Stacey came back and very condescendingly but correctly said, it's cheese, Jeff.  It's supposed to be cheese.  It's can't be possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's supposed to have milk in protein and fat and it had milk whey that has protein.  But your ingredients that I think you should eat it and we should watch you for the rest of the show just to see if you peel over.  Anyway, I didn't mean to go off on a tangent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You disintegrate before our very eyes thanks to the chili kale is in.  Right there it is.  There it is.  Trader Joe's queso.  There's a picture.  That's right.  There it is.  There's the ingredients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So cheese dip and but but but what we're seeing in the in the nutritional facts there is different than what you saw.  It is different.  Very different.  All right.  Let's try to figure it out.  That's weird.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you think about like I'm curious why Amazon didn't buy something like Trader Joe's as opposed to Whole Foods to be honest because their models.  Well, your model is just right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The models is right because it's unique properties and all that.  But I think I think they want to compete on on a commodity level too.  If you need it, we got it.  You want bananas.  We got bananas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I guess I don't know what Trader Joe's physical footprint is versus Whole Foods.  Um.  But we just got a Trader Joe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many Trader Joe's stores are there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trader Joe has the number of locations.  Four hundred sixty five.  Four hundred sixty five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to turn them down the volume again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Whole Foods has like four hundred and forty five.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Summary from the website in.  The three hundred and sixty five store offer rewards.  Three hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trader Joe's has more.  That was wow.  You're right, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was that was as of last year.  Yeah.  Three hundred sixty five.  Whole Foods.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  According to four sixty five versus three sixty five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually.  Wait.  Actually four hundred sixty eight stores in North America.  That's from their company info page.  So now it's four hundred sixty eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trader Joe's.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whole Foods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whole Foods.  Four hundred sixty eight.  They're even.  They're as good as even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like I'm like I've got nothing else to say about this I guess.  Other than I can't wait for automation to come to my grocery shopping and meal planning  because it is currently the bane of my week.  My life is really easy.  I'll be honest.  That's like one of the more challenging things I do during the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are they exactly the same?  Something's weird here.  How is whole trades and Trader Joe's saying we have the same exact amount of stores.  That's strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're both kind of ritzy elitist places.  There's a lot more.  Like we only have and we just got three Trader Joe's in Austin or maybe there's only two.  But I feel like in California there's like a Trader Joe everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New York loves them too.  But you know I go there and I come home late from work.  I have stuff in the freezer that I can just throw on and cook.  Like they have the most amazing paella.  Trader Joe's?  Yes.  Really?  You get a frying pan.  You turn up the heat high.  That's all you do to it.  You open the bag.  You pour it in and it and these little flavor things all go like crazy.  And three minutes later you have paella.  I love paella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great.  Trader Joe's paella is great.  Yeah.  I'm a fan of Trader Joe's.  I love the tangents we go on by the way.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The audience is going nuts right now.  Hey, hey audience.  You know what?  It's better than me doing politics, isn't it?  Okay.  So you got a choice.  We can talk Trader Joe's queso or we can talk Trump.  Which would you prefer?  Just tell us because we're going to go on tangents.  It's what we do.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got it.  So maybe Google should just buy Trader Joe's.  Let's think about that.  Just to counter the Walmart.  Sorry.  To counter the Amazon Whole Foods threat.  Trader Joe's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that.  And then you also get the Google chefs recipes in Trader Joe's frozen food section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google chef is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.  Okay.  No, no, no.  I mean the Google chefs, the commissary Google chefs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you were talking about their little car thing that tries to help you cook.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is.  No, no, no.  I mean the food at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got it.  I don't even know about the other Google chef thing that you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I see it because I'm a woman.  It's constantly telling me.  It's constantly giving me a card called culinary inspiration.  And it's the crappiest recipes.  Like it just, they're so random.  They're like Bloody Marys, cauliflower bread, roasted watermelon.  And it's.  I don't understand.  Google is so good at everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, okay, here are my culinary recipes for the day.  I guess.  Is this in Google now, Stacey?  It's in Google now.  It's just a card that pops up.  Literally.  I've told it so many times.  I'm not interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My recipes.  I never get it.  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never.  Try something new.  Sour cream coffee cake.  Banana egg pancakes.  Mold wine.  Balsamic Brussels sprouts.  Mung doll.  Garbanzo beans.  Cinnamon roll pancakes.  Minestrone.  And treacle tart.  Sounds pretty good to me, Stacey.  It's just weird.  These are not like things.  I don't make desserts.  I don't have a.  Not very often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're no fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I'm terrible.  And then I actually do search a lot of recipes on Google, but it doesn't show me any of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not even finding that section when I check Google now.  Which, by the way, they redesigned Google now.  I don't know if you guys have gotten the new design of it.  I'm still getting used to it.  But it's very colorful and very icon filled.  I don't know.  Adjusting.  But yeah, I can't find the recipe portion here.  Carson has it.  He's flying over here.  Oh, wait a minute.  If I went into all, if I went into more stuff, I'm sure it would be in there somewhere, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm going through that myself, but I never.  I don't.  Google knows me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine shows me the weather updates and then stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, see recipes for you.  Get ideas.  I get dinner recipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I search for.  Oh, Stacey, you're so right.  First thing for me is Pillsbury taco skillet dinner.  It thinks I shop at Walmart.  It knows you so well, Jeff.  Then there's Traeger Grills roasted hobo dinners.  Who wants to eat hobos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's just the beard it's talking to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See recipes for you cooking.  Here we go.  Try something new.  OK, got it.  Baked mac and cheese.  It knows Karsten well.  I bet I would make a lot of those recipes.  Hamburger meat recipe.  This is probably what you were talking about, right?  It's it's like, yeah, that sounds OK.  Those are actually dinners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those those make so much more sense than mine.  Although foie gras.  Wow.  Foie gras for those nights you decide to make foie gras at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  How many times have I decided I'm going to make foie gras for dinner tonight?  That's some liver lying around.  Make it again.  See cooking related articles you viewed recently.  So there's at least a little bit of a history there.  There is.  But it's it's really random.  That's what I don't get.  It it picks like a topic and it's like this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't go by most recent even or the most often ones like there's some recipes I always  look up.  Yeah.  I I would feel like Google because I'm Googling for it.  I would feel like Google is a great place to look.  I would feel like Google because I'm Googling for it.  Oh, that'll that's a good segue into like it should just show me those.  It knows I want those.  But instead it's oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Foie gras lollipops.  I think I think I've seen enough Internet for the day.  I've had enough Internet.  That's it.  I'm done.  I'm pretty sure I would not like foie gras lollipops.  Just saying.  Not a big fan of foie gras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think this wins the tangent award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, we we brought it back around to Google somehow, right?  We showed off a feature.  Boy, apparently, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're just we're just we're just glancing on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, did you hear me?  Did you hear me say I was just going to Google that meaning search?  OK, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go to follow that tangent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's talk about Stacey.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about a is trademark is trademark.  Right.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  What is it?  Let me let me let me find that this is this is the Supreme Court is basically so OK.  All right.  It's taking a step back is Google to generic.  That's what this is all about.  Should it have trademark protection?  Google, as we know, is very commonly used as synonymous with search.  Let me Google that for you.  I went home and I Googled this thing.  Whatever.  Instead of search, we've just gotten so used to saying that.  Back in 2012, there's a guy, Chris Gillespie, who registered 363 domains with the word Google in it.  Google sued and they won forfeiture of those domains.  Chris Gillespie then sued to invalidate that trademark because to him, his case is Google means to search.  It doesn't necessarily mean Google is a trademark as a company, whatever appeals panel ruled in Google's favor.  Saying Google means more than just search because Google has a lot of other products anyways.  Also critical to this is that it would have to prove Gillespie would have to prove that Google is an exclusive term that competitors must use in order to describe their own product, which I think is absolutely not the case.  I doubt that I could see Microsoft doing that for spite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hey, Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Totally.  Google this on Bing.  Bing that on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can totally see it.  You broke up my home, Stacey.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He appealed his court loss to the high court, now petitioning the Supreme Court to review the lower court's ruling.  And yeah, that's kind of where we're at right now.  We do not know what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's not going to happen.  We don't know what's going to happen.  We don't know what's going to happen.  We don't know what's going to happen.  We don't know what's going to happen.  We don't know what's going to happen.  We do not know what's going to happen.  I mean, it's not going to happen.  Right.  Google's going to retain this.  I don't see how that doesn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't that have Kleenex, Xerox?  Where else?  Because Kleenex is Kleenex generic now.  Where's my AP style book?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that?  Escalator is.  Thermos.  Aspirin.  Video tape.  These were all trademarked.  And video tape was a trademark?  That's what the Ars Technica article said.  Were once trademarked.  And what was the term that they used?  Genericide.  Genericide.  Genericide.  Genericide, which is when a name becomes too generic.  When your name is just too synonymous for this thing,  it experiences genericide.  And ultimately that trademark can be revoked.  That's not going to happen with Google though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could.  I didn't know.  Heroin.  Who was fighting for heroin?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ScooterX is listing all these crazy ones.  And I'm like, oh, OK.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A Bayer trademark?  Uh-huh.  Heroin was a Bayer trademark?  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Gosh.  We're all sorts of information today.  The more you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  OK.  So do we think this happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what Twig is good for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the danger for Google then is, A, it can't control these domains.  B, it can't control what people do with the word Google.  Word Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be a horrendous decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is so clearly a trademark.  And Google defends it.  Google had to sue this guy.  That's how you defend the trademark.  I can't see the Supreme Court taking this case.  If somebody is appealing to the Supreme Court, I can't see them taking the case.  So I think it's a bit of an overblown headline.  The Supreme Court could decide.  Well, yeah.  I can go and appeal my parking ticket to the Supreme Court.  Anything is possible.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I couldn't see that happening either.  But this day and age, you just never know.  Even the impossible, even the seemingly impossible is possible, I suppose.  I don't know.  Google's just got so many other things going on.  Oh, geez.  Google as a search term, like Google as being synonymous for search, yes, but Google means  so many more things other than just search.  It's just, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting that that's a factor in the case, that it is not synonymous merely with search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that helps keep its company name for, I mean, that is an important aspect of the case.  So that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm also wondering whether, does the fact that tweet is a variant on Twitter, is that helpful to the corporation Twitter?  Because the verb became a different word.  You know, if I say, I'm going to go, I'm going to go Google that.  As opposed to Google, that would that be helpful that we used a different word, but it still was associated with Google.  I thought it was kind of funny.  People said, I'm going to tweet that.  I got the joke, of course, but I would Twitter that would be more sensible.  The problem here is how many how many company names like this are turned into verbs in the Internet age?  You don't Microsoft anything.  You don't Yahoo anything.  You don't AOL anything.  You don't.  You do.  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You Uber places, but you take an Uber.  So it's both for that.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Now you consult wave or ways.  Do you slack things?  Slack me.  Slack me.  Really?  We have we have said, yeah, you know, slack me or set.  I mean, we use other phrases to like send it to slack or whatever.  Let's see.  Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I'm running through my apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, what else might I say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Skype.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Oh, yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, let's Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Google is but Google is generally different in that case where it is a brand turned into a verb.  But still, it's a rotten case.  Yeah.  Oh, Venmo is another one.  Yeah, Venmo me.  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not obscure to like anybody under the age of 30.  Oh, I'm not.  I'm not just a just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if you hang out with people who like are young staffers, you're you're college kids.  Oh, come on.  OK.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  You know the story I want to talk about.  Yes.  You know the story I want to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the story?  And we'll come back to it after the break.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do a break.  What is the story, though?  Give it a tease.  My fondest hopes for a replacement.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to talk about that because I completely agree.  The Pixel might have a successor.  It's a might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody and people wrote the story.  But we'll talk about that.  We're going to talk about that first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a minute.  Thank the sponsor of today's episode of This Week in Google.  And that is Felix Gray.  We spend so much time looking at screens.  It's our job.  We do it day in, day out.  We do it even when we're not working.  Right.  Think of how often you look at screens and you might be looking at it.  I mean, obviously, if you're watching this, you're looking at a screen now.  You might be listening to this podcast to get away from a screen, to distract yourself from a screen.  And we've all experienced the eye rub moment where our eyes just kind of feel dry.  They feel fatigued.  They're tired.  You have a headache.  Your vision goes a little blurry.  It's not fun.  You can give your eyes a break with a pair of computer glasses from Felix Gray.  Felix Gray's lenses are specially designed to filter blue light and eliminate glare, which many of us know are the two culprits behind digital eye strain.  Too much blue light from your computer and phone screen can lead to eye strain and make it difficult to focus on things, especially over time.  Hour after hour, it all adds up.  Felix Gray glasses have blue light filtering material embedded into the lenses.  So they remain effective without that ugly yellow tint or color distortion that you find with other computer glasses.  Be sure to visit FelixGrayGlasses.com slash twig.  You can find more information on the dangers of blue light.  Felix Gray eyewear is beautiful.  It's crafted with premium handmade Italian acetate.  Their glasses look great, so you can feel confident in any work environment.  You can keep it at work.  These glasses are not my glasses, but it doesn't matter.  I'll wear them anyway.  What do you think?  Anyways, I've been wearing them all morning.  I've been using them to work.  And, you know, I feel like I stare at screens all the time and I'm so incredibly used to my eyes being sore.  I've looked at a lot of screens today in preparation for this show, the no date announcement, which we'll talk about a little bit later.  And my eyes feel great.  They feel awesome.  Non prescription and reading lenses are currently available and prescription glasses are coming soon.  Reading prescription ranges from plus one point oh two plus two point five or you can add plus point two five magnification if you're fixated to your screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, my eyes.  OK.  Yeah, I know.  Sorry to clue you in on how uncomfortable your eyes are right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But hey, we got to do what we got to do.  All right.  So this is the first.  I'm going to do my presidential impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you see after staring at the sun for so long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I want to know.  I'm very, very curious.  We can talk about that here a little bit.  But before we do, this is the second one.  I'm sorry.  Not not.  I.  Your tongue, how I.  Your tongue.  Chromebook Pixel.  That's what I meant to say.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a Samsung announcement this morning.  I'm all messed up in the head.  Jeff, help me.  I've been I've been waiting to replace this with whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a first or a second?  This is the first generation.  I didn't get the second generation.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I have two second generation here, but but it's still a wonderful machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it dearly.  Love, love, love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  I'm sure at this point, like, I still have a hard time like thinking about why I need  to replace this other than that.  It is as old as it is.  What's that?  Twenty fourteen was when it came out.  Google does a great job with what I use it for.  But rumors say that Google's hardware event in the fall, it might actually have a new  Chromebook Pixel.  Finally, possibly with a two in one design.  And that would actually be really cool considering the fact that Chrome OS now has great support  for Android apps.  So having a two in one design transferred into tablet mode Android apps, you know, it  kind of might make a little more sense with some of the apps that you're using.  There's also a weird patent that that was that was posted about that hints at a keyboard  track pad hinged cover sort of thing.  The if you look at the patent, it kind of hinges up and it's kind of surface.  Yeah.  Well, some are wondering if this is to hinge up as a cover as it transfers into tablet  mode or maybe it's a stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is a case of overplaying a patent.  You think this is just like I don't see this coming to market immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just I don't understand what that what that flap would even be used for.  I don't get it.  I think the problem is hiding your Scrabble tiles.  Yes.  There you figured it out.  I feel stupid for not realizing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bullion cubes.  When you turn the thing around, the problem is that you put on your lap, the keyboard  is exposed.  Could just be a protector.  OK.  Or for a hinged convertible.  I think it'd be a little much, but.  OK, I guess it's one of those I think this is one of those cases when somebody had an  idea and they said, oh, sure, but we want more patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, we might not actually see that with with whatever this laptop is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does look like it covers the keyboard in this bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the OK, I get what you're saying.  The idea being you transfer it into the two one tablet mode and instead of having a weird  looking keyboard just hanging off the back of the of the other side of the tablet,  you cover it up with this elegant cover.  But then look at the proportions there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that this is drawn to scale.  Right. But that means there's a there's a really tiny keyboard or one  huge honking laptop.  Yeah. Because if you fold that thing down, it doesn't even go halfway.  Now, you're right. You got to get a whole keyboard in that little space there and the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  proportion. Yeah, I don't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because what this necessarily means is the flap has to be at least as big as a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yep.  And that's kind of what that alludes to.  But yeah, you're right. That and it also it also means that your keys might not have as  much travel. Right.  True, too. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which should be bothersome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. What do you mean by travel?  Like up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, how far up and down they go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like I can't get into the keyboards with the keys that have very, very little  travel. My wife has the the Mac Book Pro, the latest.  Yeah, I don't I don't like it.  I have a hard time typing on that thing.  I just don't. I do, too. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say my Mac book has very shallow keys and I love they still click  like I get too loud.  Oh, I know. Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But anyways, Jeff, I'm sure you're excited, although it doesn't say whether  there would be mobile network support.  Because I know that's always priority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm never going to get LTE on it.  Not going to happen. No, it's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got a dongle you could buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We will also possibly see a smaller Google Home like like an echo dot sort of  miniature Google Home device at this event.  That's what rumors are pointing to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyways, the thing I'm excited about.  Are we going to talk about the earbuds with?  Yeah, go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go for it. Because I thought that was very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was also I love that kind of sleuthing when you when you when you pull back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  those builds and find the stuff in it that the not Bistro Bistro, it's it true.  Beast Bistro Bistro.  That's it. Bistro.  It's like it's not a word that's real, but it sounds disturbingly real.  So I would I would love something like that because assistant is actually super useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, Bistro Bistro is a well-known brand of traditional British foods.  The United Kingdom, most famous for its gravy products.  So I just I just want to make sure we stayed on our theme here before we go too far off of a  ridiculous food things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Bistro Bistro from Wal-Mart using your Google Home.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So this is this is this is kind of this is this is gravy on the story here.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's that's I see on the cake or it's just gravy gravy gravy gravy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't that sound wonderful?  The nation's favorite, not this nation, fellas.  Just add boiling water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just I just found out you can buy a whole chicken in a can.  So I'm not going to mock people for putting gravy in a can.  Just whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I apologize, Stacey.  So now Bistro keep going.  Go back. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no. So the code basically they broke down the APK and they discovered references to Bistro,  which looks like Google Assistant and headphones, which exciting.  That's all I know about it.  But to me, that's neat is how you can see the functionality they're building in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can turn it off, how it's going to respond to you and things like that, which was kind of  nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'm guessing I mean, obviously it would it would connect to the phone via  Bluetooth. It has a button, a hardware button that you could use to summon assistant.  And because it's connected via Bluetooth, I'm sure all this is passing through to the phone.  So, you know, when you need to ask it to tell you something, you just hit the button and ask  it and you get your answer in your ear.  You also get notifications in your ear.  You hear the reply to your queries, all that kind of stuff channeled into your ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, it doesn't you can I assume you'll be able to choose your notifications because let's like  there's a huge backlash again about notifications.  And I'll be honest, they are going bonkers.  Yeah, but can you imagine like just think that's no.  So do you do separate in ear notifications but your headset gets more?  But I'm really curious, like as a developer, how you're going to have to start thinking about  notifications at different levels for different UIs.  And you may never know what someone's going to be on at any point in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it could also depend on which version of the OS that you're on.  We haven't even talked about Oreo.  We could talk about that next.  But one of the features of Oreo is notification channels, which is like grouping  notifications and it's all customizable on the user side.  So I could say all of my messaging notifications go into a single notification channel so it can be  collapsed. It's a way of organizing your notifications.  Maybe you add priorities based on that and you say, actually, when I'm out and about, I do want to hear  all of my notifications that come from messaging apps.  I don't want to hear notifications that come from Google Photos when it says it created me a collage.  Like, I don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't ever need that.  The fear, of course, is I've got things now that Android is on my Chromebook.  There are certain things that like the New York Times opens up when I click on a New York Times link, it  opens up the New York Times app rather than New York Times on the Web.  And I don't want that. And I have no idea how to go fix that.  No idea. Oh, interesting.  So I'm stuck with this forever.  I've gone through every setting that I can possibly figure out.  I've tried to search for it because it's too hard to search for somebody in the chat room, I'm sure will be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you just delete the New York Times app from your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I want the New York Times app.  I just want to click on a link.  I wanted to go to the Web so I can then share it and do the other things I do with it.  Oh, so the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I hate that with Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, this happened to me, actually, because some awesome book was on sale.  So I tweeted out that it was on sale and I wanted to give a link to the Amazon link.  But it kept opening in the Amazon app and I couldn't share the link and I was very angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's a there's a little link on top that says to get link.  And if you have the affiliate thing, when I get a link, it includes my affiliate in it.  So it makes three cents.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Grr, grr, stupid apps breaking the open web.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And even if you didn't have the app installed, it's possible that it would serve up the  instant app of the New York Times page anyways.  Speaking of segues.  Is there something in here on instant apps?  I may have missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in the sense I sense something in Oreo, I think they sounded like instant apps to  me. There was one of the descriptions of the Oreo functions was that you could open an  app even without downloading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, oh, yeah, that was that was promised so much longer ago or so long ago.  And I was so excited about it.  And then like this was not even last Google.  Oh, but it was before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, you're talking.  OK, so you are talking about instant apps.  That is instant apps.  Same thing. OK.  Yeah. And you know what? I have yet to really see that appear organically.  Like I think I've I've forced it to happen, knowing like one of the apps that if I did a  search for that particular service, it would probably come up.  And it did. And it was kind of neat.  But I haven't just like stumbled upon it in my in my searching on Google for things on  my mobile device. But but it's out there.  It's definitely rolling out more and more.  But I don't I don't think it's I don't think there's a lot of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't it designed to be part of assistant?  Because the idea was assistant might say, oh, do you want a table for you know, you went  reservations and then it would instead of opening up open table, it just like make that  happen. I always thought it was part of that kind of.  Because if you have an AI doing stuff for you, why the hell heck, heck does it need to  open up apps and give you choices that you're just going to have to deal with later?  It should just do it, which means you would need something like instant app.  It would start doing those negotiations for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that's my hope.  I wonder how they're how they are how they are interrelated between what you could do  through assistant and what you can do through search.  I know you can get to it through search, though, if you do a search for like what is one of the  services? It's been a while since I tried it.  But, you know, one of the like like Kayak or something like that, a a travel assistant  service like that, sometimes it'll pull up the actual app experience, even though you don't  have it downloaded. And that's instant apps in effect, working through search, not necessarily  through assistant. But that so I haven't heard that as much around Android.  Oh, I think it's just like coinciding with it.  Like you said, that was announced a couple of years ago at Google I.O.  And now they're finally starting to roll that out.  But we do have Android.  Oh, it's a thing now.  And this is my third day eating Oreos.  I'm not sick of them at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, you know, this was life changing.  You know that there are peanut butter filled Oreos, peanut butter, cream Oreos.  This was life changing for me.  Are they good? Absolutely life changing.  Oh, it sounds like it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it might be life ending.  They're so good. Be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Be careful. Yeah, they've got a ton of flavors of Oreo now.  So it's not just this is food day.  Yes. Every story we will tie into some sort of food product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Peanut butter, cream and there I can see the first link is they're available at Wal-Mart.  So I could ask my Google home to send me Oreo sandwich cookies, peanut butter, cream.  At the end of September. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So don't rush out and try it yet.  Wow. Seriously, all Oreo flavors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's Japan and China. Oh, my green green tea Oreo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They went a little crazy here.  I think they have pumpkin spice Oreos, strawberry milkshake Oreo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brownie Oreos are nasty.  Oh, brownie batter is delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you do that, Jay?  Candy corn Oreo.  Oh, we got those at our house. Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my husband tested those and yet not good.  But I don't like Oreo, so I'm really the wrong person to talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, jeez. Stacy, Stacy, Stacy, we are finding out you don't shop at TJ Maxx.  You won't shop at Wal-Mart. You don't like Oreos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, jeez. A lot about you today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I grew up on Hamburger Helper. So. Oh, I don't believe it now.  No, I don't believe that. No, no, no, no, no.  Or you're trying to deny your true history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it's true.  I did grow up on pumpkin spice on Hamburger Helper.  I had a working mom.  That's what that's what working moms feed their kids or fed their kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had my fair share of Hamburger Helper as well.  I feel delicious.  Yeah. And then I went back to it as a grownup.  I was like, I never like it. This is a kid. No.  I think it was better as a kid and vegetables in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, oh, this will be better. I'll put some frozen peas in. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spruce it up.  Make it a little healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But fans, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I think I've done this.  I brought it back a lot.  I've enjoyed myself in a perverse way.  I'm sorry. I apologize to you.  But again, I'm going to repeat.  Would you rather food or Trump just decide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fair enough. I think this is a wonderful tangent.  I'm going to take some food.  I mean, Carson took the camera.  I feel like I'm compelled to eat an Oreo.  This is double stuff, by the way.  There's enough flavors of Oreo.  It's always a thing on all about Android, by the way, that every time  there's a new dessert, we bring in the dessert and we eat it.  Usually it lasts a couple of weeks.  There's enough different flavors of Oreo that we could probably do this  at the beginning of the show for the entire year that Oreo is a thing.  We could be powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to get that horrible Oreo mouth.  It looks like you're a little kid who just ate dirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It happens. I'm probably going to wait until I'm not talking anymore.  Android O is Android Oreo.  If you haven't figured that out by now, they had an event.  Was it yesterday morning or Monday morning?  It was. It was Monday morning.  And it was the it was Monday morning.  The unveiling of a statue, it's basically the the Android  Oreo figure emerged out of this statue.  This is in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do I not get invited to these things?  This is pissing me off. I would kill to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really needed to be there for this.  Let me tell you, this is a spectacle to be seen.  It rises out of the cookie.  All right, Google did it.  I'm not sure what it is, but a pictorial.  And yeah, I don't know what we expected out of that event.  It was literally an event that was just a here's a statue.  But hey, it was fun.  They have a new superhero.  The Android mascot this time around is a female superhero, by the way.  Body of the Oreo cookie.  It's a total co branding partnership.  You remember you probably remember.  Google did this a few years ago with Kit Kat.  They had a co branding relationship with that.  And I just didn't think they were going to do that again.  Everybody was pointing to Oreos being the next version of Android.  I didn't think they were going to go there again.  But apparently I was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry. This is a girl.  Yes. Oreo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She is. Yes, she she is a girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how do we know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cookies have no gender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  No, the cookie.  Well, the cookie might not be a girl, but the Android mascot with a cookie.  This is what would be a joke calling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how do we know?  We see we can do without that.  We'll skip right over that happening.  It's going to be awesome.  But how how do we know the statue and the Android is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's the cape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody can wear a cape.  Yeah, no, that well, the adage had an article about this adage kind of covered  the the lead up to this and reading two tone socks mean girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what. I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they said.  I trusted them.  Not sure if I should have trusted them, but I did.  Actually, Google also said this in their announcement.  What did they say? They said combines  Oreo combines the the intelligence of Android and the like the the playfulness of  Oreo. And you mentioned I don't know.  Yeah, it's all marketing speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what? Hey, let's talk about project trouble, because that actually is really  possibly pretty cool.  And I'm never going to understand the concept of a female Android cookie.  So I'm just going to give up.  My brain is just going to go away from that and into  updates and modular architectures and how this could be in better support.  So, yeah, let's let's talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, project trouble is a big deal.  I think project trouble, in my understanding of it, is the beginning of Google.  Finally, Google's known for a long time that Android has a has an Achilles heel,  which is its update situation.  You know, on on Apple's iOS, they control everything.  Right. So when a new version of iOS comes out,  you're talking like 95 percent of iOS users have it within like a week on Android.  We are a year away from Nougat being officially released.  And I think it's at 13 percent of all devices.  Now, Android also has an insane amount of users.  So 13 percent is actually a lot of people.  But in comparison with the overall pool of Android users, it's a small percentage.  And obviously, and Google would like that to be higher.  That improves the security for a lot of, you know, for its users.  And that's just good overall for its brand.  Project trouble is a kind of the beginning components of separating the underlying  architecture, separating the hardware stack that vendors have access to from away from  the updatable elements of Android, the code itself.  So hopefully what that means is that over time, this in combination with more work that  I'm sure they're going to do to kind of separate things further means that Google can  put eventually push out an update to Android and not have to worry about a lot of this kind  of time that it takes to for hardware vendors to check the code against their hardware and  and carriers, you know, check the code to make sure that it qualifies to run on their network.  They're kind of separating these things into two separate camps so that Google can do its  thing and hardware vendors can do it's their thing and project troubles the start of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what does that mean, though, if you want to update like the software element like,  oh, here's Bluetooth, Bluetooth actually with mesh that will update if you have the  appropriate hardware all the way back to Bluetooth 4.1 or BLE 4.1.  So I'm curious if you wanted to support that in the OS too, would you have I'm trying to  understand how things like radio support would change with trouble.  And if you would have access to that, if the OS person has to do it, if you'd have to wait  for your chip supplier to do it and what that means for the application developers who want  to use something like mesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a great question.  I'm not even entirely sure that project trouble would involve changes to something like  Bluetooth or if it's, you know, targeting something entirely differently.  They we talked with the Google engineers at Google I.O. just a few months ago, Florence Iona and  I did, and we sat down with them and they were very, you know, they made sure to let us know  how much work went into re-architecturing Android from the ground up.  They said it was probably the most significant kind of rebuilding of Android code since Android  launched. So it's significant.  But I don't think which version of this version for this version.  Yes, yes. Because of project trouble, which because of that, oh, wow, because of that, that was  that was at the core of why they went.  They've spent so much time working on this stuff.  And I kind of got the impression that like it by no means solves all the problems like you're  talking about and figures out who does what.  But it's a starting point for it.  The other really big challenge that they're going to face with this and this happens a lot with  what Google puts into Android and how slow things roll out is what do OEMs,  hardware manufacturers, what do they actually spend their time adopting?  It might be part of the US, but they might have to make changes on their end.  I don't think that that is the case with project trouble.  I think trouble kind of comes over if you're creating a device from scratch with Oreo.  It's trouble-ized, as they call it.  But there are other efforts that suffer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it actually looks like the OEMs would be in charge of like their hardware firmware  updates that would change your like networking functions.  The difference is the Android stuff and everything running independent on those, they now run,  like you said, independently.  So if Android, if I'm redoing Android, I don't have to check every version of Android  against the current hardware regime, which would make it faster.  OK, I see now.  Yeah, I know that was that was a long way to get me there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So no, no, no, no.  Well, I mean, I'm still somewhat confused around trouble either.  I'm just I'm very happy to see Google taking this so seriously and being creative about  realizing that they needed to rebuild something in order to make this happen.  And I really hope it leads to even better things as far as the update situation that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me understand the impact of this.  You'd have to get to the to the O level to then have more rapid Google updates under  Google's control, not the OEMs control to the Google portion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Potentially. Now, here's where it gets a little tricky, right?  They did say months ago when they first started talking about this, that legacy Android devices  that are updated to Oreo would not be trouble.  I see that it would only be new devices launching with Oreo.  The only the only legacy device that would be trouble is would be its own pixel devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  from last year. However, because the underlying device hardware would also have to be  modularized as part of this.  So that makes sense, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. No, that makes sense.  They did say, though, there was a podcast, I think just yesterday with a with a number of Android  engineers on it. Chet Haase was there, a few other folks where they basically they hinted at  the fact that they are working with, they said, some companies to update their flagships to  Oreo while trouble, eizing them at the same time.  So we don't know who we don't know what devices, but they're hinting now more than what they  said a few months ago, which is that trouble could be coming to more devices that are that are  just merely being updated to Oreo.  And that's good news.  Now I see why you're confused.  It's a little confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, but you know what?  When things break, you can call it trouble damages.  Ooh, there's a copyright joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trouble and trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too much too much caffeine.  Trouble and trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm backing off the trouble with troubles.  The trouble with trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the trouble with trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are also there are also some folks complaining about Bluetooth issues with Android 8.  And actually this Sam Abuel, submit of the Will Bearings podcast, we have him on Tech  News Today every once in a while to talk about autonomous vehicle technology and stuff.  He had told me that, oh, prior to this update had broken his Bluetooth auto connectability  with Android Auto a few weeks ago.  And he was wondering if this new update had fixed that.  But apparently a lot of people who are updating to Oreo are finding that their devices  won't connect to Android Auto when they get in, has trouble connecting to headphones,  might connect, but then drop out intermittently.  I have a little bit of that on my Pixel.  And your Pixel is updated at this point.  Are you on the?  Updated to what? Oh, no.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe it's just not a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if this is the same or a different problem.  By the way, if you want to get in on Oreo, because it's the official release at this  point, sign up for the beta and you'll get a push to you'll get a notification right  now that you can update to Oreo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, what was that?  I was saying I was out of the beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were on the beta program, you can have access to Oreo right now.  I thought I was.  Check your system update and see if it'll if it'll trigger it.  I did about an hour ago.  Oh, and nothing.  Nothing.  And strangely, you'll know you're on Oreo if when you go to settings, A, it says Oreo  and B, when you do the the Easter egg tap, you know, where you tap on on the version  number and it pulls up the letter or whatever.  If you go through that whole process, it'll pull up an octopus.  Doesn't pull up an Oreo.  It pulls up an octopus.  Go figure. Confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe there is a limit to the trademark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, so maybe there is.  Yeah, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did did you get the essential phone or I know, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo's waiting for it.  We have not gotten the essential phone.  I asked him the other day if he got a shipping notice for it, and he says he hasn't even  gotten that, even though he got his order in very early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I'm still in the market for a phone, so I'm like, oh, it's a good time.  Note eight. I know.  That's why I'm like, I'm very eager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the essential I mean, Ron Richards, all about Android, he went to  he went to the essential event in New York on Monday and we talked about it and showed  video that he captured while he was there.  He got to play around with the essential phone.  We talked about that on yesterday's all about Android.  So you can check that out if you want.  But he was very impressed.  Everything that he saw, he said that the device just felt significant.  You know what I mean? Like it had a nice weight to it.  It was super elegant.  He was incredibly impressed.  So.  Seems like a good option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One thousand dollar note eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll talk about that next. Let's talk about that next.  We definitely need to dive into Samsung.  I want to hear your perspective on that, sir.

And we thank LegalZoom for their support of this week in Google.  All right. So early this morning, about 8 a.m.  Pacific, 11 a.m.  Eastern, Samsung held its Unpacked event and showed off the next note, the Note 8.  Samsung hopes that you will forget everything you thought you knew about the Note 7  and you will embrace the Note 8.  They actually started the event.  I wasn't sure if they were going to address it directly, but they started with a  promotional kind of video about, you know, basically addressing specifically like  we let you down, you put your trust in us.  Oh, really?  We'll let you down.  And, you know, but but then showing all the people who, you know, stuck with Samsung  and hey, thank you for sticking with us and all that kind of stuff.  So they addressed it first and foremost.  Smart, smart. Good.  Yeah. Yeah.  But they showed off the Note 8 design similar to the S8.  I have the S8 Plus here.  Let me get the fingerprints off it because it is a magnet for fingerprints.  But I have the S8 Plus here.  So it's very similar to this in the kind of what they call the infinity display, the edges  on the side on the Note 8.  Of course, you'll have the S Pen that pops out of the corner down there.  Very similar. It's basically the same design language as what you have with the S8 and  the S8 Plus right now.  But a little bit larger, six point three inch infinity display.  The infinity display, of course, means that it's a little bit less.  Well, almost bezel less on the side because it drops over the side.  But reduced bezels on the top and bottom really kind of makes it feel like a smaller device.  Nice Snapdragon 835, which is pretty standard for the premium smartphones this year.  Six gigs of RAM, most RAM that they offer.  S Pen, like I said, live message gist.  So you can draw these.  You could draw a message with your S Pen and then it animates that drawing in the picture  that you send to whoever you're sending it to.  So when they look at it, it like shows it drawing on screen.  Samsung likes the splashy things like that.  You can do live translation of text.  You can write on the lock screen.  Google used to do that with Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you drew something in Hangouts, it would show the drawing happening in Hangouts.  Oh, really? I don't remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's cool.  It went when Hangouts was a web interface where you could put on the mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would draw it with like your mouse, you know, on the web interface, not not actually in the.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm old.  No, no, no. I've used that web interface a lot.  And you can put on the masks and everything.  Yeah. All that stuff.  This is the first Samsung phone with dual camera support.  So it has dual rear facing cameras, a wide angle, 12 megapixel with an F 1.7  aperture and a 12 megapixel telephoto camera.  Same aperture, two times optical zoom, live focus mode for getting kind of like  the Bokeh foreground background kind of blur.  And that's done in real time.  So this is kind of cool.  When you take a picture like that, it pops in and you can take the picture, you know, with  and preview how things in the background look blurred compared to things in the front of  the foreground being sharp.  But what you end up with after the fact is you end up with a full res image as well as the  combination image that you can then tweak after the fact and say, I want the background to be  more blurry, less blurry, whatever.  So it gives you just everything, which is kind of nice.  And launching with Nougat, not launching with Oreo.  Sorry about that. And yeah, I know.  Are you are either of you like note aficionados?  Did you like the large room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My parents, my parents loved the note so much that they didn't get rid of theirs even when  they were exploding. They stuck it at Pyrex dishes at night to charge the Note 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they did not give back their Note 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They finally gave it back when I think Verizon started cutting people off.  But up until then, they wow, they did not give them up.  They don't fly. But so, yeah, they are definitely like my mom was looking at this and she's  like, oh, but then she saw the price tag and she's like, oh, yeah, it's a little pricey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we're we are right on the cusp of a thousand dollar smartphone.  They can get a break with this as they see this.  Yes. Now we found that out after the fact.  So, OK, so the price without the break, nine hundred thirty dollars on T-Mobile, nine  fifty on AT&T, nine sixty on Verizon and Sprint.  If you preorder, you can take your pick of either a Gear 360 thrown in or a 128 gig  flash micro SD card along with a wireless charger.  So you can take your pick of either of those if you preorder.  If you buy through Best Buy, they'll also knock off one hundred fifty dollars.  However, if you have if you bought and whether you returned it or whether you still have  it or whatever, I'm curious to see how they handle this.  The Note 7, you get up to what is it up to one hundred and no, sorry, up to four hundred  twenty five dollars of a discount off of the Note 7, which is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Significant. Yeah, that is well in Samsung.  I swear they gave my mom a Gear 2, which, you know, but they gave they gave her a watch.  They gave them the VR headset.  What was that? Yeah, the Gear VR.  Yep. There we go.  OK, the Gear VR. So they got all this stuff just the longer they held on.  Less alert. Yeah.  So a discount. Yay.  Yeah, maybe they'll do it.  And they kind of feel more loyal now.  They're like, well, you know, yeah, they did exploding phones, but ours didn't explode.  And look at all this free stuff we got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, isn't that the interesting story here?  That's that's what kind of fascinates me is that when all the Note 7 stuff,  maybe it was overblown, but people really reacted to it, the press certainly reacted  to it. You know, you could you did not stop hearing about it.  And I'm guilty of that.  We talked about it so much on this network and on the shows that I was doing.  It just seemed like a really big deal.  And I think the reason I was concerned  about it is that Samsung was near, near, if not at the top of the heap.  At the time, I was like, man, they can only go down based on this experience.  Like, this is bad for the company.  Turns out Samsung has had record breaking sale, record breaking revenue.  The past few earnings calls,  people who were Note 7 fans are just as dedicated to this next note as they were  to that one. It really did very little, I think, to damage their their brand loyalty,  their brand reputation. And that's just a really, I don't know.  That's pretty significant for that company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they did. I mean, they OK, so they didn't tell us what exactly was happening.  But when they realized that there were phones that were unexplainedly and  unexpectedly exploding, they took care of it.  They didn't. I mean, that's that goes a long way, I think, to fixing it.  I think, though, at the beginning, they may have been less chatty.  But they they once they realized the scope of the problem,  they changed their tune really quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they did. It was it was it was existential for that part of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it seems to have worked for them,  although nearly a thousand dollar phone, this is not an inexpensive device by any  stretch. And I don't know, I think I think once Apple has their  announcement of the next iPhone, I think we're probably we don't know the price  yet, but one could one could expect that it's probably in the same price range as  this for the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When do we expect the new Pixel announcement?  When do they usually announce Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the last time they had an announcement was sometime early October,  I believe, and then it released in October.  So, you know, those leaks are probably going to start happening pretty, pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rapidly. You're not willing to wait that long, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I can wait that long.  And I think that, yeah, that's that's not crazy.  And I mean,  my phone is actually it's getting kind of wacky.  I feel it. It feels aged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you have right now? What is your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the 5X.  So the Nexus 5X.  Yeah, it's going to be two years old in October, September, whenever  I know what five years I know.  It feels like forever, but it's not.  It is not forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's crazy how fast time flies with that kind of stuff.  Feels like it anyways.  So, hey, oh, yeah, we don't talk about this.  Sure. Sure. What do you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to talk about Sonos and the updates and get your opinions about  kind of this concept of services.  Are we buying devices? Are we buying services?  Because I don't know if you saw this,  but Sonos changed its terms of service in preparation for the Amazon Echo  integration, and as part of that, it said it wanted to collect data from people  that we can go into what data.  But it also said that if you don't agree to the change in service,  eventually some of your Sonos products may stop working.  So did you guys not see this?  I did not see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Including Sonos products you bought previously?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. So that's what's so interesting.  So let's put this on the run.  It's a ZDNet story.  Sonos says users must accept new privacy policy or devices may, quote, cease to function.  What does that do with privacy?  So it's supporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it'd be like a copyright  licensing or something like that. Privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK.  I'm trying to remember.  Oh, this is probably just to protect their rights.  So the privacy policy is to get data from the devices.  So when you take data from devices, so they want what's called is they call it  functional data, including your email address, IP addresses, account info,  device data, information about Wi-Fi antennas, your room names and error data.  So.  There's apparently users can opt out of some kinds of data, personal information,  but not that data.  And if you don't agree to that, then some of your devices over time may cease to  function.  Is what they're saying.  So it's their privacy, but it's also the privacy party is part of their terms of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're saying that their service requires these pieces of information.  They say you can opt out of submitting certain types of personal information  to the company, like additional usage data, performance, activity information.  But, yeah, once you switch off that data  that they feel is necessary for all of those devices to perform basic functions,  things aren't going to work the way they used to.  Man, I don't know how to feel about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So last I think it was last week, Plex, the digital media.  Company player thing,  I never know what to call Plex.  That works. A media server, a media server.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they change their terms of service and it's remarkably similar.  So I just wanted to bring this up because I think this is an issue that  there's actually a good reason for this.  But I think it's an issue that we're probably going to encounter more often  as we buy more connected devices, but it's also an issue where I think companies  can handle it a little bit better.  So like Sonos, if like I have six Sonos's and one of them I bought all the way back  in like 2008, and, you know, if that guy, if I decided not to update my Sonos's  and that guy stopped working next year, I would still have had 10 years.  So when I feel asked that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You bought it with the presumption it was yours forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And is there any functional?  There is. So there's two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, if you do the, sorry, if you do the Madam A integration,  they're going to be responsible for quality of service.  So the idea is they need this information to determine like room information so they  can build a skill where you tell the echo, you know, play it in this room.  Right. So they need that for functionality.  But they also need it to say, oh, the reason this isn't working is because you  don't have Wi-Fi service or it's really crappy in this area.  Right. The challenge is you could build all of that functionality,  but you still have to support your older users who are on this older version that  doesn't that didn't agree to that.  Right. So then what you've got is a bifurcation of your platform.  My hunch is, and I don't know this for sure, is that they wanted at some point in time,  they're prepping to avoid that bifurcation.  They're not saying it's stopping right now.  They're saying they may cease to function.  So like in 10 years, they may be like, you know what?  We've got, you know, a thousand people left on these old systems.  Let's take them off.  It's not worth paying a developer, you know,  $150,000 a year just to keep this old ratty, you know, system running.  So that's that's probably what's behind the legalese.  But it's really crappy that they're not explaining this well.  And yeah, sorry, I just talked a whole lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm kind of taking it in and reading over Plex's thing.  The EFF is saying,  you know, obviously they're they're critical of this decision on Sonos's part,  saying we understand that there are there are things that you need in order for this  to work, but companies like Sonos can do a better job of of kind of compartmentalizing  the things, you know, the information that's needed and how it interplays  with the device to provide those functions.  Maybe it doesn't transmit it.  Maybe it stores it locally instead and it can kind of be the best of both worlds.  I don't know the reality of that in integration, but I know when I buy  something, I expect it to work for a long time at the same time.  You know, I expected to work forever.  But at the same time, we're buying a lot of things that are dependent on some sort  of a service in the cloud.  And I guess those rules are being rewritten because, you know,  this is like that could never last forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, there's two different angles here.  One is that  like like Tesla saying you can't use my car and my software to start your own  taxi company.  That's that's ridiculous.  That's I bought the thing.  I can use it however I wish.  I have the right to use that.  It goes back to the doctrine of when I bought a videotape, I could choose to  rent it or sell it if I chose because that was the idea that I bought it and it was  mine. That's one issue.  So I find that offensive to try to limit my use and turn a physical good into a  licensed good.  On the other hand, there are cases where to operate functionally  there may be a need to be able to know some data and you've got to have a privacy  policy policy.  And if we can't know that data to make this thing operate functionally well,  then you can't blame us for not operating function properly.  I'm a little more sympathetic to that, but that's awfully obscure and difficult.  And it just doesn't sound I'm not a solo sky, but doesn't sound like they did a  good job of explaining whatever the heck it is they're doing and why it's a  benefit to the consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think as we get into this area, we need much more transparent policies about  how our data is being used.  And if Sonos explains itself, it would help.  And also, if they came up with a date,  they may cease to function is pretty vague.  But people, of course, are going to flip out.  They're like, yeah, I mean, I spent two thousand dollars a couple years ago  adding more Sonos to my system.  That's I mean, I may shop at Target,  but that's still a lot of money.  That's an investment. Yeah, right.  Yeah. And, you know, it's not seeing Macy's to function.  Well, yeah, it's not.  Apparently, it's not because it might not work.  So  that that's kind of but oh, so here's the here's the next wrench in this.  And I don't know if you saw this, but Uber,  I think it was the second, second, second district appeals court of New York.  Basically, someone had sued Uber for some surge pricing stuff,  but also sued them because their terms of service were like too long and difficult  to read on the screen, and the judge was like, oh, that's not true.  So what that's done is it said that Uber's arbitration clause that you accept  when you click on the TOS, the terms of service is just fine and dandy.  In this case, because this guy was like, you don't have to send me through  arbitration, I still have a court case because that, you know,  because their terms of service were so long and I couldn't read it.  The judge was like, no.  So now what we're actually going to have happen is a lot of our.  Our terms of service disagreements and things like this,  they might actually get fought in arbitration and not in the public courts,  which I think is a huge problem, because if someone's going to take Sonos  to like a class action suit for this and we're going to see a lot of explanation  and what's happening here, that's great.  But if they do it behind the curtain, that's terrible.  We're not going to have any sense of what's happening to our digital rights  as we move more of our economy and property and ownership to these places.  And that was my second freak out of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How can we how can we tie this into food, though, is the question?  We have tied the story into any sort of.  I have a connected oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if one day it doesn't work or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  now it refuses to make Kso?  There we got there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't make Kso in an oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says, well, I don't know.  Well, I'm going to make mine because all I have to do is microwave mine.  Creator Jones.  So, yes, and it's going to say in your oven would say we don't shop at Walmart.  We don't shop at TJ Maxx and we will not microwave Kso.  Can't do it. We won't do it against the terms of service.  Not happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't microwave Kso.  That doesn't have any nutritional value whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, yeah, so so I was going to say maybe maybe my oven company signs a deal with,  you know, Trader Joe's or Amazon, and so suddenly it will not make any recipes.  Suddenly all the recipes that I have grown to love would change.  So I love the way it cooks chicken today,  but maybe in the future it gets a licensing deal with Tyson and changes the way  it cooks chicken.  And then suddenly I'm like, wait, no, ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you like it roasted, Stacey.  But you like it this way now.  Yep.  Any any kind of final stories from the rundown before we take a break and then  get to numbers and tips and picks and everything or have we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was kind of fascinated with I was I was told by this the where was it  under Google?  The service that's trying to it was confusing civility with decency.  There it is.  Google's anti bullying AI mistakes civility for decency.  And.  I think civility is a key need right now,  trying to recapture civility, recapture decency and respect among people.  But I think trying to automate it is not going to be totally successful.  So the New York Times stopped using the  coral projects online, commenting stuff that they were using to use this instead  from Google's  jigsaw, which is an effort to have a learning system that understands how to be  taught, how to recognize in civility.  But this points out that if it unfortunately, what it recognizes is so  called decency.  So if you say that's awesome, then oh, yeah, that's fine.  If you say that's awesome.  Oh, that's horrible because you used F.  Right.  The subtlety of dog whistles, the subtlety  of insults, the subtlety of of T.  Of trolling and tweeting and harassing.  I don't know that a system can ever be taught this.  Granted, Tay was taught pretty easily how to be that, how to be awful.  But but it's fascinating to me that as we try to recapture civility,  that some would say the Internet ruined.  I don't think the technology, I don't think technology is fully at fault for  causing this, I think it exposed it.  In any case, I don't think technology is going to be the answer for for putting it  back in the gene, back in that bottle. Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And no, well, I was going to say this is kind of an inverse of the problem that  censors have. So if you look at China and their censorship efforts, how people will  automate even even kids around parents, they come up with new ways to say,  to to be in in censorship, it's to say things they want to talk about  without actually saying the words. Right.  So language is so fluid and flexible.  It feels like any sort of AI is going to be at somewhat of a disadvantage,  because if you I mean, if you ban the word Nazi from your forum,  people are just going to use, I don't know, Pepe the Frog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you can't condemn Nazis then, too.  You can't say those people are Nazis. Right.  Right. With with with good purpose.  That's an excellent example, actually. Right.  So Nazi is the Godwin rule, the Godwin law, Godwin's law,  that by the time it descends to that, but we just have a time in the news right now  when literally Nazis and deciding who are Nazis and what we say about Nazis is  a critical, I would say, litmus test of civility, leadership responsibility.  So these efforts to say that we're going to just put everybody that the machines  are going to make us OK, the machines made us all uncivilized and the machines  can make us all civilized again is wrong on both ends.  I reminded of the time that Nick Milton,  then of the New York Times freaked out because Robert Scobel walked  into the men's room at Moscone Center during an I.O. with his Google class on.  Right. I remember that.  And and and Milton called me about this.  And I said a couple of things. One, one, one.  I said, Nick, nobody wants a picture of your junk.  Just relax.  And number two, don't presume that the  technology made us into uncivilized louts that we were not already.  It may have exposed it, made it easier, but it may do other things.  But don't don't assume that just the technology makes us do this.  That is a technological deterministic view.  And even I, the technological optimist, don't believe that.  So I just found this really, really interesting.  I think I think recapturing civility to me in this whole fake news thing that I  concentrate on a lot these days, I think that civility respect is a precondition  for openness to facts, which is a precondition for openness to people's  perspectives. So recapturing civility is absolutely critical.  But if we think that an algorithm is going to do it, no matter how smart the  algorithm, no matter how well trained, we are fooling ourselves.  I just found it interesting. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Maybe at some point these algorithms,  AI gets, you know, there's some sort of breakthrough where nuance, you know,  where it takes it to a new level in this, like understanding nuance and understanding  context of subtle ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perfect translation of languages.  Yeah. Right.  Because that's the that's the that's the  unemotional level where you get nuance. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the nuance varies by people and by culture.  That's also, I mean, I pity the computer.  I mean, people suck at it.  We just try to be graceful mostly when it happens.  So, yeah, I don't know how I don't know how a computer is going to handle that  and how people will handle computers handling that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wrote a piece some years ago for The Guardian, which I won't spell the word out.  But I said that BS spelled out is political speech.  If you cannot call BS on things, then then you are restricted from political speech.  So when the FCC and others will allow you to say that word on the air or for that  matter, YouTube in this context, which is why I'm not saying it,  it restricts political speech, not just profane speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I just say that's horse poop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, thanks a lot, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just saying that, you know,  or as my daughter, I pointed out something to her.  I came in because I do tend to swear and she is very judgmental of me.  She I told her I had seen a survey that said people who swear are more like honest  and more authentic, they are more authentic than other people.  And she looked at me and she said, Mom, that's garbage.  And the way she said it, she might as well have said BS.  Yes, she had just so much scorn.  Just garbage.  I was like, it's interesting that your daughter is the is the puritan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She had the age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think when I was when I was nine, I was a puritan or nine and ten.  I was very judgy. Yeah, yeah, that's true.  She just heard eleven.  So we'll see how long that lasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That ends the day she turns eleven.  That's how we're still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still got to look this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, OK, we're going to take a break and then we're going to come back and do tips,  tricks and whatever else we got there at the end of the show.  I've got really quite your numbers, all sorts of things.  We've got lots of stuff for you left over for the show.  But before that, let's thank the sponsor.

All right, Stacey, why don't we start with you?  What's what's what's on your mind?  What's the thing this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I didn't I got a bum light with my Ikea light.  So and I haven't gone out to replace it.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the Ikea smart light, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the I'll show you I'll show you the broken version, which is this guy,  the tradfi. Oh, OK.  So stay tuned for that, you guys.  But  I was going to.  So my alternate pick is the prepared dot org.  This is a newsletter I subscribe to.  And I think because of the audience overlap, this is about hardware  manufacturing, engineering and just nerdy tech stuff.  So like it's not necessarily it's a weekly newsletter.  There's also a podcast.  But it's like the physical world around you and how it's made.  And it's everything from a profile that James Hamilton over at Amazon wrote,  like several months ago about his trip to a fiber link ship.  So like how that process works to things like really geeky stuff on tear downs,  like Arduinos and chips and fun stuff.  So I like it.  I think a lot of you guys might like it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The prepared I thought you said be prepared.  And that took me to the scouting website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. Not the not the Scouts.  They're lovely, too. But the prepared, the prepared is OK.  Gotcha.  Yeah. Well, that's that's just the  tool guide for people who do stuff.  Oh, it's a rip hammer. I don't even know.  But the news letter, I get the off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like siding and things,  I don't know.  Do you need food to be prepared?  Stacey, are you going to work this back to the theme of the day or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can take you back to the theme of the day.  I can give you a great recipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has surfaced a wonderful foie gras  recipe for me that I can share with you guys, if you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like mulled wine in August.  How do we feel about that?  Or I could tell you, you know, the Instapot, everyone should have one.  That is all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The rip hammer is generally used for framing and ripping construction tasks,  while a curved claw hammer is a double ended hammer that is used for hammering  and pulling out of nails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, that is Jeff's number.  No, that's not Jeff's number.  No, no, but I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I imagine it was Karsten  was funny putting in the case.  So nutritional numbers under my number.  Nice.  Fifteen calories, fifteen.  What?  Fifteen calories, calories from fat zero total fat zero point five saturated fat  zero. This is cheese.  It's supposed to be trans fat zero cholesterol zero.  As somebody said in Twitter and put this up with the sodium is going to kill you  at one hundred seventy megs, yeah, kilograms.  Wow. Look at that.  Carbohydrates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I was like two tablespoons.  Never mind. I was like, that's not that bad, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is queso.  Just it's not taste.  If it tastes decent, I'm bathing in it.  Carson says it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Carson's had it.  That's yeah, he's he's freaking out over it right now.  He's jumping up and down.  He's yeah, hands in the air.  He says it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's another number.  You'll remember that Facebook was paying media companies for Facebook live when  they thought that live was going to take over the world.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah. So now Facebook has watch, which, by the way, I can't seem to get to.  I don't do. Do you guys get watch?  Do you have watch? Do you see watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have not logged into Facebook since December.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I click on the video tab on on.  Facebook, I get nothing but the, you know, the videos I always got.  Watch is going to promote episodic serial video shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is their content. Yes, there is.  This is their new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're paying media companies to make shows.  And when they did it before, they said, hey, we're just doing this temporarily  in lieu of the money we plan to make and share with you  when it comes time to monetize live.  Well, now I don't know if they're saying that or not, but they're  paying 10,000 to 25,000 per episode for shows.  And the producers will also receive  55 percent of the ad revenue while Facebook takes the rest.  And the shows could be anywhere from two to 240 minutes an episode.  Most are making them five to 10 minutes.  And this is Facebook's effort to spawn loyalty in video to become habitual,  to get you to subscribe to things, to get you to like things.  Right. So it's it's it's what YouTube did better socially in terms of video.  Now the social company Facebook wants to do.  And this is what they're paying for.  This is what they're expecting.  So that's the numbers, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're all getting into this, like  dumping crazy amounts of money for original content.  I'm really curious to see how this plays out in the scope of like five years.  I think it'd be really interesting.  Right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we really Leo would yell at me now, but he's not here.  So what the heck?  I think it would be interesting for the  Twitter network to make a an episodic five or 10 minute show.  I mean, you've done them in the past.  You've done these new shows, things like that.  Why not make one of those things again?  Put it on Facebook, see what you make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who would like episodic like like scripted content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't have to be, but it has to be cereal.  It has to be that you're going to come back time and time again.  This is the sort, you know, it's a podcast to the reason it couldn't be that.  It's just that, you know, people know twig and they come back to twig.  It's more episodic or cereal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, got it.  So like I could make a cooking show.  There we go.  With Gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we I think that's what it has to be, actually.  It is thinking the tech bachelor.  But I'd have to do some thinking around that and figure out what that is.  I don't think we should do that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  That's my free advice to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good. I'm happy you talked me down off the ledge.  I appreciate it.

Transcript:  Mine's really quick here.  If you use Google inbox and you have multiple accounts,  they added a new feature to Google inbox that allows you to combine all of your  email accounts, all of your inboxes into one feed, which is as noisy as you could  possibly expect it to be.  When I go into mine, you can safely take mind.  I'll show you.  It's it's nothing but spam and everything from the folders that I never look at at  all. So it would be nice to be able to come in here and do some.  I mean, there's there's some legitimate stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samuels, this is inboxes from two accounts or inboxes within one account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is so this is all inboxes from any  account that I'm saying any of the all or all of the accounts that I'm signed in  inbox with plural accounts.  Yes. So I've got my work email.  I've got my personal email and all of the inboxes within both of those combined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You respond to one from your work email that will send back to work versus  personal to personal. I imagine so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. When you tap through, it's as if you tapped into it from a particular account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you like, this isn't in Gmail.  This is an inbox. This is an inbox.  That's OK.  I was like, I got this for a long time.  And then I'm like, because it's inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. This is a feature in Gmail for a while.  Now, now you've got it in inbox.  I would never use it personally, but apparently some people would.  It just seems so noisy to me.  Like it would be nice to have controls  and be able to say these are all the because I would use it if I could  personalize a little bit and say these are all the inboxes that I want to be  shown just here and that would be what I would use to manage my email.  But anyways, if that's your thing, there you go.  The more you know, which could be the title today, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll have to figure that out. No, no, it's got to be a food thing.  It's got to be a food trouble with the chat room.  I know you'd only do this after the show, but I think I think we need a food thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've the chat room will work on that.  And as they do, I will say we will begin our farewells.  We'll say Bon Appetit, everyone.  Yes, exactly. We hope that you've enjoyed your entree.
