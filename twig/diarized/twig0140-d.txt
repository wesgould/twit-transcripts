Hello Gina. How's it going? Good to see you. It's going great. It's also welcome Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York. He's back and he wishes he were Sweden still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had great hearing. The hearing and the bandwidth. Excellent. The bandwidth was magnificent and the bandwidth here in New York City at my university. Your text dollars at work sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well a lot more people are using it. That's really the reason. BuzzMachine.com has his blog and his book Public Parts is available everywhere.  Joining us now also from searchengineland.com. Danny Sullivan. It's good to have you Danny. Good to be back. Always good to talk. And actually it's very timely because you wrote I thought a very good article responding to Matt Honan's article on Gizmodo about Google.  So let's kick it off. Matt Honan wrote an article in which he said Google is now finally evil. In fact I've been talking about it. I talked about it yesterday. I talked about it today on Security Now.  He I don't know if it's you or he who talk about the genesis of this. Paul Buhite when he was at Google. I think he was employee like 24.  Did not want to have the traditional. I think it's you. It's in it's in it comes from Stephen Levy's book in the prides of his book. Yeah.  He did. He really hated all those traditional.  Mission statements.  And there was this get together Google in which they were trying to come up with a mission statement. So I this is quoting Paul from Stephen's book. So I suggested something that would make people feel uncomfortable but also be interesting. It popped into my mind.  That don't be evil would be a catchy and interesting statement and people laughed. But I said no really.  The slogan made Stacey Sullivan uncomfortable was so negative. Can we phrase it do the right thing or something more positive she asked Marissa and Salar agreed with her but the geeks Buhite and Patel wouldn't budge.  Don't be evil pretty much says it all as far as they were concerned they fought off every attempt to drop it from the list. They liked it the way it was.  Sullivan would say later with a sigh it was very important to engineering that they would not be like Microsoft. They weren't going to be an evil company. But then  The New York Times quoted you Danny.  In which you said I don't think they ever were not evil.  So I think the first question is what does don't be evil even mean. I mean it is in a typical mission statement because it's a negative.  It doesn't say what to do just what not to do.  And it's not clear what evil means in this context. I mean I think you brought up that well when they were saying this these they were competing against search engines that were putting paid results into the search. So that's certainly one thing that was evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that  I think that they've I think that Google and what I would try to explain in my piece had also kind of defined themselves against companies that they did consider to be evil. And I think Microsoft to them was  Was especially the big evil that they looked at that as a company that was going to try to lock people in that was going to try to pre keep competitors out and that was going to do things that was in the company's own interest rather than  In say the user's own interest and for a long time it really did feel like Google thought they were fighting the good fight against the evil being Microsoft.  But you know as you say that the problem is when you say don't be evil it's such a binary thing either you're good or either you're evil.  As I when the the New York Times piece when they quoted me it was like I started getting these messages from people saying do you really think Google's evil and I was quoted as saying.  I don't think they were ever not evil. What I meant was I don't think they were ever not evil. I don't think they're ever not good. I think those are are are way to not allowing any kind of nuances out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Typical engineers they like they see as black and white right and and unlike engineers there's no definition you know usually you'd have a spec for evil. We need a spec for evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You would and and and one of the things I talked about in my piece was how when Google decided if they were going to go into China that Eric Schmidt talked about them having to come up with an evil scale to try to decide just how.  To go into China or not right.  Which was my response to anybody at Google who was like how could you you know say something like that it's like well your own CEO right you know says that you guys apparently are evil because.  You had to figure out an evil scale to decide how evil this or not your thing was and that's how ludicrous the whole thing was if they said try to do the right thing or do by right by the user they gone with something else you can appreciate I think.  The sentiment that they had or the desire that they had to be doing right but at this point Google is such a big normal company, if you will, that it's impossible for them to do things that are not going to impact somebody adversely and.  Then, and then you just have that binary that binary switch and that's why you get what happened say this weekend when mad does a post and it's just been one of any number of posts.  Where people have been saying oh now Google's evil because they said they didn't want to be evil so I guess the switches flipped that's that's what we're down to in the discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think you're right and then the risk is that I'm going to come off like fanboy as usual, but I come down to it, I think your view of it Danny was was nuanced and matt's wasn't at all nuanced.  And it had statements like you know people don't trust Google now I just saw something today that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That well that but he but he came from the pew internet study that said three quarters of people don't want search.  But the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There there are rhetorical statements in there that suddenly just no one trusts Google anymore right and and the way that Pew survey was written.  didn't mention I asked in my view yeah and and it's all in the whole tracking witchcraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like do you how would you feel if somebody were following you around yes or no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right exactly a little it's a little weighted and then to come out of this and say well suddenly now to declare that all people don't trust Google.  lacks all nuance and and it's you know he's just discovered that that that Google needs to personalize to give us a better service and that's what the entire piece comes down to in my mind.  Gina also had a far more nuanced view of this, which is that you know, whereas Danny saying they were never purely good and Gina saying we shouldn't give them.  You know assume that they're not going to be worth watching of this we watched over and I think that's all true, but at the same time, one more point.  I'm sorry for his name, but my friend whose book is up there and I'll remember the second.  says that that the cost of doing evil the cost of doing bad by your customers your public goat rises as people could talk about you.  And part of the problem, Danny's absolutely right is this is by setting the pedestal very high anytime Google makes a mistake.  But doesn't do something evil necessarily what makes mistakes screws up does something wrong somebody in the company in this gigantic company does something wrong does that overnight make the entire company evil that's just absurd on its face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it doesn't it doesn't like that, you know the Kenya fraud and the click that the you know the hidden form trickery, but you can say okay a team within the company screwed up.  And I mean the great thing about Google is that they come out and say we're sorry we shouldn't we shouldn't have done that you know is evil is not a Boolean variable right it's not true or false, I think we can all agree to that.  And and you know, but that's post is bringing up the question, I think the question is worth asking people were not asking this question before and I don't think that this is biased pollsters or sensationalist media journalists.  I think that this is a reasonable question to ask, and I think we all kind of gave Google.  A pass, because it seemed like you know, because they they they are a company they're acting more like a company and less like just a proponent of the open web, which is always how they kind of.  That's Danny's point you always work on.  Right they always work company and that's that's why I really like you know I like Danny's point.  As for how we define don't be evil I always define that as the company acts in the interest of the users first instead of the interests of the company with the understanding.  That in the end in the long term acting in the interest of the users only is beneficial to the company can we all agree that that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that definition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's of course it's also difficult, because in the interest of users is not black or white either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No there's different users and Siva Siva but not the would argue that that and I disagree with him here but but he says that every company must be evil in the sense that they must operate in they have a legal responsibility to operate in the benefits to do sure fiduciary benefits of the shareholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I disagree with that I'm with.  Gino on this one that in the long term benefiting the user is good fiduciary early but it's not it's in the short term it may not be obvious to me long term it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the.  Sorry I can't see you very well so I'm interrupting I can't sorry go ahead Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can say the you know what two things one to what Gina was saying also that that has all these little things that have happened I think it really.  Arose gone to the bigger bigger issue of this where before you would no question Google you go ahead all these sorts of crazy things they'd be accused of.  But then when you have like what did you do in Kenya and what did you do with the Safari thing suddenly things that you might have dismissed or you might have you know said OK that's a one off.  They can be added up into something bigger and I don't think that they really are I don't think they suddenly the company said we're going to be evil I do think the company become more aggressive in a lot of things that they've been doing.  And not as hesitant to go out and stuff but I don't think it was like Larry called them all out said all right now we're going to be evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's two things go ahead Jeff and then I'll talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to disagree one way and then agree with you another way and I think that the things that were listed in Matt's post things you just posted our actions of one person one small department often were screw ups.  Often didn't see the unintended consequences was not corporate policy so in that sense I'm going to say they don't add up to any.  Indictment of evil what I do think does add up to indictment of evil that is a corporate policy that does reflect on the entire company is Google's devils deal with Verizon.  Against a neutral web you know it's screwing up on the safari thing screwing up in Kenya even screwing up here and that's some bozo did something wrong just like the data that was captured in Street View.  Yes you need a culture that tries to stop people from doing that but you know what is inevitably going to happen people will screw up or they won't get the culture or whatever that to me doesn't add up.  But the Verizon deal is the corporation as a whole saying you know what screw you whole Internet screw you net neutrality and that wasn't even listed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I and I think but I think that's where I go to the question of you just do right by the user can also fall apart because I don't think Google thinks that doing that Verizon deal was doing wrong by the user I think that they were convinced that this was a corporate move that they were making that ultimately is in the users right interest.  And where I think they sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a lot of argument about that Danny wasn't there on campus that there was a lot of people on Google who said no this is this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are but I don't think that I don't people will disagree about all sorts of things within Google about what Google ultimately does but I don't think when you finally make the decision that the people go forward those decisions think.  This is better for us than the users we're going to do it.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you justify that decision though how do you justify that decision and that'll be to go back you know six months now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would you can do it you can do it the same way that they did it like when they went to China.  Well you know maybe we got to do this thing first but we can't get we can't make changes with the mobile networks that are constantly frightening.  So we throw Verizon in them this bone and then down the line and you know five years we're able to do like what we did with sprint and now we can have the porting numbers or we can do other stuff.  But I think that where they tend to go wrong is not understanding that I think that Google gets a corporate view what they think is right for the user and they cannot be shaken from it.  And you'll have other people who will say I'm sorry if we don't necessarily agree with you and it's like oh you're just wrong.  It's like no it's much more nuanced than that and it's actually not that everybody's necessarily wrong it could be that both people are right.  Both people are wrong or maybe you really are wrong on this sort of front and that's what I don't tend to get from Google sometimes is the sense of yeah we we made a mistake here in our corporate decision when they make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also think that they do a bad job and in defending themselves when they need defense that the we've had this discussion on the show many times but all in all I think that the consolidated privacy policy is simplified privacy policy is all in all good.  But the press against it is extreme not just press but but also government action and and they didn't explain it well they didn't say it well they didn't realize what people are going to think about this.  It's still the problem I've said on the show before that that some see them as Godzilla and they see themselves as snuffle up against but in either case you can you can crush the hamster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a thanks to ohm's law.  In our chat room great name ohm's law there is a Wikipedia page in which all of the criticisms of Google have been encapsulated if you would like to go through what people are complaining about.  It strikes me that there's there's there's two different kind of schools one is that moral panic that you and I have talked about Jeff where we say Google's tracking us oh my God.  And all of this was really I think a lot of this conversation comes to the fact that on March 1st only a few weeks ago Google changed unified all the data from all of its sites and forced people to read the privacy policy which I think most would agree forcing people to read the privacy is not evil.  You know to have a privacy policy unified privacy policy is a good thing.  And then so some people just hate tracking cookies but then it is hard not it is hard to forget these kind of consistent starting I think with the street view incident where where they were gathering access point information from open access points which I think we agree really was.  Just an error in engineering it wasn't useful but I think that's where I would say it began certainly China Kenya iOS Safari and then you talk about it and I think Matt talks about it particularly.  What bothers me more is Google's fundamental business which is the search business being corrupted by desire to and I'll quote Matt deliver in trying to deliver personalized results Google polluted the page with its own inferior products.  Google plus instead of Twitter Google places instead of Yelp while banishing competitors to lower listings and their results and I that's to me that was search plus your world that was to me when it really started to you know I can maybe we could maybe get make excuses for engineering errors rogue teams.  I'm moral panic in the case of tracking cookies but I care about Google search results and when they start promoting their own products above other products in search results that's to me when it's demonstrably.  I want to say evil because that's not evil it's no more evil as you point out Danny than Amazon Apple Microsoft and everybody else but that's when it kind of started to put its own interests ahead of its customers interest if you would you agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes I mean if Google's products were returning this as good or better search results than other products then I would say fine it's OK but you know if you focus on the user dot org we talked about this you know Google's you know Google plus search plus your world which is the default setting if you're signed into Google.  Is is just not better and you don't Google say that their data shows that it is better that people people are you know that the behavioral data that they kept they've captured shows that search plus your world results get better response then then without it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't like this in the black bar this new this is really to me reprehensible they're forcing everybody who uses any Google device page to see this Google bar and now I've got an ad what is essentially an ad for good play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In my business this is where I split off and I don't I don't necessarily like it either and I think that the search results are one could argue that they were badly done but I don't think that I keep coming back to the media example Yahoo doesn't promote.  Google the New York Times doesn't promote the New York Post it is a company and a product and it actually uses its own space far far less than other companies promote things you know go from that page and then you go to the Yahoo page you tell me who's.  Who's thinking of the user first still number two is that yeah they do go off the data they do insist that their search results are improved by social.  You know that the area what that that I all think search is dead by any means but I think what what Google has done is proved Mark Zuckerberg right that every company must become social including Google.  And yes they are going for signals and no it doesn't violate our privacy to know that we search for pizza and they give us pizza for God's sakes that's the moral panic thing.  So so what you have here is two things going on one is Google going to promote its own products yes does it do that in the core search not really in the search results does it put in social stuff yes do they believe that that's going to improve search in the long run for each of us.  Yes I think they do believe that.  Okay yeah I believe that it's a do believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really complicated also because some of the things that Matt's talking about he's mixing things up right.  Search plus your world didn't put Yelp into things versus Google places and in fact we still have Yelp within Google and we're actually talking about things like Google Maps which in some cases getting the map is a far better search experience.  Then when you do a search and you wouldn't get it however it was coming up so there's there's that confusion that's beginning with there's also confusion between the idea of personalizing search results based on social signals which has a lot of advantages and has a lot of potential to it because goodness knows using the link signals that we have out there is becoming more and more archaic.  But there's also the issue of then also just trying to get people to use Google Plus itself by taking part of your search results page and shoving this here or doing too much of what I call Google Plusifying everything and it's all in your face.  But the core stuff that they're doing isn't different than what you do at Bing.  I mean you go over the Bing it's personalized based on your Facebook data and it's just going to happen.  And if you want to turn it off just like Google you got to deliberately log out you got to prevent it from happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if a Twitter if a Twitter result is a better result or you know if I search for Lady Gaga and the Twitter result is a better result than the Google Plus result but the Google Plus result shows up first to me that's modifying search results to benefit yourself.  No it's not about social signals it's about.  Tell me what company doesn't do that.  Well I'm not saying no and I made this point and you made this point that Amazon Microsoft everybody does this but but that's what Google was saying don't be evil we won't be like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a definition of evil is that evil or is that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's one of the key things I think they get into when you come back to what do we do for the user.  The way they have promoted Google Plus has been very very in your face and it has made me and a number of people scratch our heads and think what on earth is going on that you guys have done this.  And at the same time you go back to Matt's piece where he's saying well you know Google's they really Eric Schmidt screwed up by not cutting a deal.  It's like yes it is a screw up that they don't have a deal with Facebook and Twitter.  And then on the flip side they did have a deal with Twitter and maybe they were never going to get a deal with Facebook.  And maybe part of the issue here is not just that they didn't get a deal but that Twitter and Facebook have data that is actually belonging to us.  The people who created it and if we want our data to be in our friggin Google search results they should be there whether or not Facebook and Google decide they want to do a deal or not.  If I want to go through on Google and search through and find all of my tweets I want to be able to do it from Google.  But I don't want to be prevented from being able to do that because whatever it is that Twitter has is a problem with Google.  Whatever it is Google I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's preventing that.  And the problem is Twitter.  And you know God knows for years I've been bitching about that and that Twitter is a silo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google is getting flamed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think in that kind of climate you look at Google saying well if I did this interview with Amit Singhal who runs Google search right.  And this was two weeks after search plus your world came out and he finally started talking about look we built all this stuff around Twitter.  We built all these things into Google which a lot of people have forgotten used to exist right.  You could go into Google News and see the number of people who tweeted things you could see people who had tweeted stuff associated with story.  He's saying that basically the deal expired.  We couldn't get it to keep going and we had to take apart all this stuff stuff that we had lots of engineers working on.  And I think Google's lesson from that was we can't depend on somebody else.  We'll have to build something our own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that they're they told me Matt Cutts was on this show and said that I agree.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I was with the Google plus engineers were very upset when they lost that stuff.  They wanted that stuff.  It's not because they're trying to screw Twitter Twitter screwed them and us because again you're right Danny it's our stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well and I did a different piece that was called something I think it was like social to taunt or something like that.  I'll look it up later.  But what I was trying to suggest is that that maybe there is a way that we can get to having having it so that it was called a proposal for social network to taunt.  And what I was saying was that things like the actual content that we create on Twitter or Facebook ought to be public and ought to be crawlable by anybody.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jean Gina I don't mean to get ahead of us but but is that what think about is can help fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is one of the things that the think of can help fix.  But the way we get around it is that everyone kind of creates their own.  You're not getting the fire holes.  Gets their own API using their own they're basically using their own API access.  So the issues of the Google bot can't crawl.  I mean Twitter creates open web pages public web pages right.  Facebook doesn't.  So at least Twitter's a little ahead of Facebook in that it's creating a bunch of web pages and you think well why can't the Google bot just go retrieve all those pages.  It would be incredibly inefficient but also it's just subject to limits right.  So so Google has to have the fire hose which is the stream of up to the minute tweets and that's and that's part of I think what they what they lost.  Although I'm sure that that deal that they had involved lots of other tech.  Yeah.  But yeah one of the things that think up is trying to is trying to solve is to make this decentralized to not have one search engine crawl you know just crawling on Twitter but to have your own installation that uses your own API calls and captures your data and makes it searchable and retrievable.  It's a tough problem though and it's not the most efficient solution for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  We'll talk.  I want to talk more about that think up reboot because that's that's a definite hot topic.  Google I.O. and somebody suggested that your number this week Jeff should be one the number of elephants who use Galaxy Note phones will show you that video.  It's coming up just but first let's talk about go to my PC from Citrix the best way to get remote access on your Mac or your PC.  Absolutely.  Bar none.

So what is the.  We wrote an article on Smarterware dot org Think Up reboot and a special request.  Gina why don't you fill us in on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We are Neil and I had Neil Dash and I have applied for to the Knight Foundation's News Challenge which is a media contest that awards grants to its winners.  So we entered Think Up into the into the contest.  So the special request is that you like our application on Tumblr because that'll help us advance to the next round that the number of likes and reblogs on Tumblr helps the Knight Foundation choose choose finalists to get on to the next round because they got like a thousand applications and then they're only going to be about five winners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a great contest and and what is it what is it what do they do.  The Knight Foundation is the key funder of journalism projects and education in the US.  I am the director of the Tau Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism and thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those two foundations for making it possible and we should point out that gives Gina no advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No whatsoever nor me I've applied for it and lost.  Oh OK.  Doesn't even help you.  They run and they run a lot of different things they do community stuff and I'm helping some people in New Jersey do a proposal right now.  But the Knight News Challenge is an effort to get people to create new technology new ways to do journalism all kinds of new things and get innovation going.  And God bless Knight you think they'd be kind of sticking the muddish being the foundation or the opposite.  They're kicking the industry in the ass saying you've got to change you've got to do new things.  So they just change the Knight News Challenge used to be once a year.  Now it's three times a year with a theme and this theme is networks.  And one of the great things about what makes me so delighted is if suddenly now for the first time the mainstream news industry can get Gina Trapani's brains and smarts involved in what we do and vice versa.  I think that's a great cross pollination and so necessary.  And so that alone is one of the great benefits of the Knight News Challenge.  My friend John Bracken is one of the people running it and yeah he's overloaded with a thousand applications.  They have a jury of unnamed people who will go through this with some meticulous care and then they'll be further rounds.  But I would suggest Gina that no matter what happens with this one keep going with Knight because they're smart people that recognize your smarts and they'll know how much we need you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And let me show everybody what Gina is asking you to do step by step.  You could go to Smarterware.org and you can just click a link there or you can go to newschallenge.tumblr.com and click the search entries and enter think up and search.  And the very first result will be your application to think up.  And then there's a heart.  You've already got 293 but let's see if we can get that number up.  I'm going to add one.  Oh watch out the power of.  I can't imagine that anyone could conceivably even come close to the number we can get right now if each and every one of you watching live and those of you listening after the fact and watching the video go to the Knight Foundation.  Wow challenge that Tumblr.com and click that heart next to think up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are very few things that I would want to throw the power of twig behind.  This is this is something that's important enough to me to ask.  And Jeff I just wanted to thank you very much for your kind words and from your lips to John Bracken's ears.  I'm really excited about this.  You know our chances are really slim.  Chances are we won't make it.  This is a super prestigious contest.  There are some amazing entries but we're hoping that they'll consider it.  We're actually converting expert labs which was the nonprofit funding organization for think up into a commercial entity.  So Neil and I are co-founding a new think up company and this is kind of a baby.  Yeah I know I know that's it.  I'm going for it.  I really really am a capitalist.  I think I said that a couple of a couple of shows ago that I've been converted.  But this is one of the initial kind of avenues of funding that we're that we're looking at.  We want to get some kind of smart good good money behind us and night and night is what we'd be on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's important to night doesn't just give to not for profits which is very unusual for a foundation.  They also will give to for profit ventures.  I don't know how it's structured as a loan or a grant or whatever.  And they're going to do some investments too.  So they you know they've funded a center for entrepreneurial journalism.  They want to fund entrepreneurs and that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes in fact on the application they ask you how do you intend to run this you know make money from this business or continue this business after after the grant is up.  So we really like that.  So we're given a chance.  You know the whole idea about think up for us is you know the pendulum swings right from centralized to decentralized and back right.  So we used to be mainframes and dumb terminals and then you know it was the web and you push push the computing power out to the edges.  And now we're kind of getting back to centralized again right.  We have these big giant behemoths hosting all of our data and doing all our computer computing for us.  And you know you saw the same thing with smartphones right.  Like at first there were no apps but now there are apps where that you know we're all walking around with a computer in our pocket which is something that seemed insane years ago.  I think and I believe that you know setting up people people who have their own webs who run their own web services can can capture and archive data and analyze it in ways that are just never going to happen in the centralized model that we have now.  So it's a really ambitious goal to kind of set decentralized social network to create a peer to peer way to capture and archive your data and exchange between those those peers.  But we're going to give it our best shot.  So this is just the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina one question if if I and I am waiting for the hosted solution because I'm an idiot.  But when that when that day comes and I have my page of all my blatherings.  Google Google at that point and going back to Leo's version question with Google can obviously scrape that with my with my greatest sense.  And there you go.  That's the stuff that can there's no reason that it can't appear in search.  But I have the most authoritative.  Well no wait that's what I'm asking.  No that it's not a Twitter feed so much.  It's it's it's Jeff's think up app social page that happens to have the most authoritative Lady Gaga tweets on it.  Now you get out of that Twitter deal and now you become just plain content again right.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it is true if I search for Jeff Jarvis I find your number one result is your blog.  And number two results your blog then Wikipedia then Twitter then Google Plus.  So you know I don't they're not being evil in that regard.  They would I'm sure put it up there.  Although we do do find a page for you but you have to sign up to follow Jeff Jarvis on Twitter and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I even signed up for their author program.  So that's why I get the little logos there.  You little little bug.  No you're getting the geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good.  You're getting Gutenberg the geek.  I floated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  You know features like that you know the author byline in search results that little link that says ask your friends on Google Plus.  That seems like reasonable promotion of Google Plus to me.  That doesn't bother me.  But let me show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me show you the auto complete on Jeff Jarvis.  And this is this is where I get a little bit buggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well right.  And that's the default right.  Yeah.  That's the default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you have to turn off turn off personal personalize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the problem with the author thing is that when they rolled out the author they pulled out the author tag last year before we had Google Plus.  And it was the way that you could have a by link to really whatever you wanted to as a verified author.  It didn't have to go to your Google Plus page.  It could be going to your Facebook page if you wanted to.  And then after Google Plus came out it morphed into basically being you have to have a Google Plus account.  If you want that to be happening.  And that's actually a really bad example of where you're like why did you do it that way.  Because you really want us to use Google Plus and you've made it much more easier for people to have a buy offline.  Where I have an author page at Search engine land.  Why can't I point people to that page.  Why do I have to point them to this one.  And that's because that's the way they changed how authorship was supposed to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I'm not somebody's friend on Google Plus will it still do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes I'm logged out right now completely and I'm in Cognito mode and I get that by Jeff Jarvis.  And if I click on the by Jeff.  Terry Grant's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who has a Google Plus page that I'm not following.  That's what I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes there's actually I think I am following him unfortunately.  Yes.  Good try but no.  It's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I mean Google Google argue that the reason that they've done that also is they're trying to help verify people's identities that they think that they can improve search results if they know who Jeff Jarvis really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true I was bitching when I made a Google profile and it wasn't the first thing on my Google search results so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right they should be but I did part of what Danny's saying implicitly is they're not explaining this well enough.  There is a rationale behind what they're doing but they always remain so mysterious about it we don't say what we're doing and why we're doing it.  And that's not just Google I've argued that the media industries and the advertising industries and other technology companies are just so bad about not just putting out legal.  Documents but also letting us into the tent and they're thinking about why they're doing it and what they're trying to accomplish for the users and then the users have a different view.  And again I keep on going back to Amazon.  Why did we give this recommendation.  Here's why.  That's all we want.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may be just a feeling it may not really be logical but here's what it feels like it feels like Google plus is already starting to look like another buzz another failed product from Google.  I have to say that's the feeling I get anyway and that they're still trying to force it down people's throats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not it's not anything like buzz.  It's better than buzz buzz was a really horrible.  It's far better than I'm going to do a post I've been trying to write this maybe I'll finally get it done this weekend but it basically says something like you know Google plus is Google's Apple Store.  So number one is succeeded in the fact that it has allowed a bunch of Google to some degree fanboys and fangirls if you want to go in there and have a place that they can conglomerate.  And there are people who like Google who want to talk about Google want to be happy with Google who simply do not want to do that over Facebook and they have found a home there.  Believe me I think that's all Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If all Google plus is a place to talk about Google I don't talk about just Google there I talk about lots of things there.  I'm not saying that's the only place it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not saying that's the only thing it is but I'm saying that is one thing that they have never had before that is useful for them.  Some ways it's almost there is almost better support forums that people who use this product all the time can go in there and interact with it.  And that alone I think kind of makes it successful for them.  But it's more than that.  There are people in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Photographers for instance it's a great place if you're a photographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are people in there who are commenting.  There are people in there who who who do post the content there.  It is not the activity level that I see anywhere near like what you see on a Facebook or a Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm going to disagree.  Danny not for me and part of it's because I have a lot of followers.  But I find that the quality of conversation is better in Google Plus than I find certainly on my blog.  And that's probably my fault.  And to some extent depends on the day it depends on the mood of the universe and Twitter.  I find the conversation there just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll agree with you on that even on Facebook.  Facebook's a lot of spam and there's garbage.  Yeah it is not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Still kind of a geek salon.  That's why.  You know it's still very sent you know kind of nerd centric like tech journalist centric right.  And that's what we are.  So those are kind of our people.  So it seems like the conversation is a little bit better.  But you know you've got almost a million followers don't you.  I do I do.  And you know well I have to clean out a lot of spam on almost every post.  And you know it's funny I wrote my response to Matt Honan's piece on Gizmodo against Google on Google Plus because I knew that it was the best chances I had for Google.  Like the most Google employees would see it if I if I posted it there instead of on my on my blog.  That was a pretty pretty mindful decision.  But but Google Plus is way better than then then buzz a way far better than wave.  And I think it's going to be around a lot longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah because they're putting all their their horses behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well right.  Yeah I don't think that they're forcing it down our throats.  Yeah they are.  But it's not going away.  I don't think that's an option.  I don't think that's an option in the company.  I think the company has made this decision that this is their core product that this is just Google from.  That's what kind of bothers me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Using their clout as a search company to promote products like Google Plus.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But one on their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They haven't won on their own merit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're using their clout as a phone company to promote their maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's difficult because on the one hand you can say that and on the other hand you can say OK we know that we need to have social signal to improve our search quality.  We also know that we cannot get the social signals.  That's their argument.  Twitter.  I understand.  So what.  And that's what this is like.  What do you want them to do.  Right.  At that point it's like there is no there's no argument against them having this in many ways.  I think that there is an argument that they should have a system for people who want to favor content or share content or indicate that in a way that could interact with their Google search results to be able to do that directly.  That that is one guaranteed way for them to go forward to have better signals unless people really enjoy content farms and link spam.  Unless we think that is somehow get better.  Right.  We've got to have something else.  Amen.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But they are all in and then they're borrowing chips and throwing it all over there.  And that's where you kind of want to say really did you have to do the people and pages thing up over here.  Did you have to throw in every single possible thing you could do and then also get Lady Gaga to do it as well.  A little bit.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that was that's my feeling.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's execution though.  That that to me is not that that's that's not.  Evil execution.  That's what we discussed last week.  That's why you hope someone like you know Kevin Rose brought in says says exactly what Danny just said.  Come on.  Do you have to do that.  Right.  And they need more of that in the company.  But that to me is not going to go back to the thesis of the day.  Evil or good.  That's good or good or bad execution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I guess I mean to wrap it up and move on.  People are saying in the chat room well every company does this.  You do this.  Leo does this to promote he promotes other podcasts.  But I I didn't say we're going to set ourselves up as I mean I guess we're asking of Google is if you're going to be the company that indexes the Internet.  If you want to be the guardian of that that you kind of have to recuse yourself from the normal promotional hurly burly of the day to day world.  That's what you don't be able to means.  No but that's what don't be evil means is we're going to be above that because we are the keepers of the search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but but but but I think you're limiting the web in that.  This is where Danny was headed to I think they are.  And Matt as well.  They want to be the answer company and the way to be the right answer company is to be able to know enough about you so that they can anticipate your intent and feed it.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so be it.  And if you do that get ready because you're going to get these conversations about are you.  Yes yes I agree.  That's the that's the consequence.  Fine.  You want to make that pivot and be the answer company fine.  And people like me and you and everybody else are going to say well that sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's getting there.  They have a Google has always had a balancing act and has gotten more and more harder for them to do as they compete with the same things that they list the balancing act is people trust your search results that they're supposed to be giving them the best information.  And for a long time Google's delivered that and delivered it even in some cases where you know they would have conflicts.  One of the biggest conflicts is any page that carries adsense is potentially something that Google would want to favor over another page.  You really haven't had people say over the years that every time I do a search result I only get the pages that have adsense on it.  And so they seem to have gotten that balance right with these inherent conflict.  But now when you start having these things where you're like OK I'm doing these searches and I'm also getting all this Google stuff but it might have been better if actually you had suggested a Facebook link to me or Twitter link to me.  Why are you not doing that.  That's where people start to go to do I still trust these search results.  And that's the balancing act that they need to get right so that we continue to trust the search engine to be the search engine as we want it.  But that they're also able to go out here and build out these other things that may help the search engine as well as advance their other business goals.  That and that's just between us the user and Google.  There's a whole nother argument when you get onto the antitrust aspect which is if you have a dominant if you have a dominant stance in search.  And you decide that you want to start pushing a social network.  Have you used your your dominant stance in a way that violates antitrust laws.  And that's part of what we'll see that's going to be happening.  But what I will say is that same kind of argument can come back to then haunt say Facebook because if you have a dominant data situation at Facebook and you're only providing that data to one search engine that being being because they're the underdogs and we think the underdogs will do better.  And you're not cutting any kind of a deal at all with Google then potentially you're going to find yourself in four or five years having another antitrust argument being pointed at you saying you need to open all that stuff up and you need to figure out a way that there's a fire hose that anybody can get to that data if it's public data without it feeling like you're having some kind of favorite nations thing going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What we really see going on is an effort to negotiate new norms.  I keep on saying this I just read a magnificent book and this ain't going to appeal to everybody called the institutional revolution.  That goes back to why did we move from things like patronage to run the army and run the Navy and paid positions and all these odd things back in the early period of UK to these new systems as an economist in the Argos well because we could measure things and we could thus measure performance and trust came out of measurement rather than out of patronage.  And the institutions of society had a change to catch up with they're always behind the technology.  What we're seeing here is this idea what already we've turned Google into this institution of saying well they're the search engine thus that what that that that well they don't even know what they are yet they're not finished being what they are yet I think.  And so we're seeing constant birthing pains going on here in what's around us not only for the old institutions retail companies government universities but also for the new institutions Google is already a new institution.  And and it's a painful process because the change is just going to keep on having an impact on what we expect of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to take a break come back with more.  It's a great panel I got to tell you when you have Danny Sullivan Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani.  On one panel you know we're going to get some heavy duty conversation right now on Google the cloud and more.  Let's talk a little bit about cell phone companies when you when you think of cell phone companies to the words fair honest clear usable bleep to mind no.  That's why Ting is trying to reinvent cell phone service this year if these when Elliot Nass of to cast came and showed us ting last fall I was so excited I said I cannot wait to tell people about ting T I N G.  Dot com it's built on the sprint network so if you've got great sprint service where you live ting will be a great choice for you.  But what I love about saying first of all and I'm really pleased now ting is offering some very nice top of the line Android phones they are primarily an Android company so you're going to get a smartphone.  For G yes on the sprint network but what you've really got to look at is how they price it.  Because essentially what you decide is how many phones you're going to have.  Let's say we're going to have a family plan so that's six dollars per phone 24 bucks up front then you choose.  And this is separated by the way minutes text messages and megabytes some people use a lot of minutes and not many megabytes most of us geeks.  Use few minutes a lot of text messages and a ton of megabytes but you're not stuck with these plans okay now what I just set out for four phones be $92 a month total.  $92 a month I get free voicemail picture and video messaging through a calling caller ID tethering hotspot and more four phones a family 100 bucks less than 100 bucks a month but here's the beauty part if I don't use all this.  They give it back to me at the end of the month.  And if I use more there's no penalty they just charge me at the same rate for what I use so you pay for what you use and no more save a lot of money.  I mean I'm talking a lot of money here's a tweet from a user new customer February 19th my ting FTW it's at ting FTW on Twitter phone bill was $22 last month $22 that's exactly $100 less than with AT&T.  Family of four actual usage across our four phones last month 2387 minutes 4000 this is obviously teenagers 227 messages 429 megabytes of data.  AT&T $244 Ting $103 a month you can find out how much you'll save if you've got your usage go to ting.com slash twig and run the savings calculator and you can figure out exactly how much ting will save you.  There are other reasons to go with ting the best customer support i've ever seen in a cell phone company a no hold policy when you call their 800 number during regular business hours.  Once you get a service rep on the line they will they will work through the problem and solve it no wait customer support email support you could blog you can they've got a blog you can tweet them.  it's run by geeks frankly and they've got some great new devices that i'm very pleased including the Samsung galaxy to.  The 4G and the Motorola photon it says I love this if it's the top of the line you'd be wanted look no further than the photon.  The Motorola photon the world phone your mom would ask for if she was awesome and at a taste for the top of the line to core and so forth now notice the price it's it's a less subsidized price, although if you use the twig offer code will save you $50 off on the phone.  But this is one of the ways they do it you pay a fair price for the phone and then you only pay for what you use it just makes a lot of sense you want less expensive phones, they have a variety of android phones.  Just simple the online management of your account is fantastic you'll know exactly where you stand at all times.  TING.com visit them today and just run that calculator at ting.com slash twig and see what you would save.  Integrity honesty clarity usability yes there is a cell phone company that offers that ting.  Who would think you could have an unevil phone company.  I was gonna say they're de-evilizing an industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was what Elliot said to me he said you know we gotta fix this it's broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And because by the way no ETF penalties your month to month that's why the phone costs a little bit more because your month to month there's no early termination yeah.  That's that's a good fight to be in.  I like it don't you I said Elliot I will do these for free no I didn't.  I almost did though I said I would do these for free.  I said Elliot I will do these for free no I didn't.  I almost did though I said Elliot I'm I said if even if you don't buy it I will ads I will absolutely talk about this because this is a revolution.  Google I.O. did you did you sign up Jeff.  Yes I did.  It's good things sold out in 20 minutes size in there and everything.  We don't know what fancy free stuff you're going to get but the tickets sold out in 20 minutes you got to think Gina that the fact that.  Last two I.O.s people have received all this stuff you know phones and tablets and that that has something to do with how fast because they raised the price they doubled it didn't they this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes it's 900 bucks swag is definitely part of it yeah you know and there's a surprise of it it's the possibility that you're going to get a device that isn't out yet or that's a special edition that's happened.  And you know it's a great event though that they expanded it I think it's three days this this year right or it's one day more yeah and it really is a great event great parties great sessions and just you know really fun place to be but also the gadgets are really cool.  In it doesn't surprise me at all they may decide the swag is evil this year though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know that's fine it's still a great event June 27th 28th 29th but you know we shouldn't really sell it you know because nobody else if you don't have a ticket you can go to the extended ones it's like the Ted extended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah okay you can set up your own swag list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little I up that's all right then that's all right 90 days to sell out in 2009 50 days in 2010 59 minutes in 2011 20 minutes in 2012 at this rate next year it's already sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well next year they'll be already since they know so much about you they'll know whether you want to come or not you signed up I'll just send you a ticket Google knows.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And as a Neil said last year free browser under every seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not Jeff's number the number one I this is definitely a Samsung viral ad about Peter the elephant.  So Peter the elephant now I have to say so there's a galaxy note which is the phone I use is a ginormous phone.  And there's Peter the elephant who is clearly a trained elephant but this looks does not look like a synthetic.  Make a point saying below that there's no there's no video trickery is real that's this is I didn't know elephants were looking at the drum a guitar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a germaphobe's nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No it's not slimy.  Look at this he swipes through pictures with his little it looks like a little finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look how good he is some elephant is not going on there's no snot this is a trunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And look you can even draw the I didn't know elephants had opposable trunks but apparently they do he can hold an S pen actually I don't think that's an S pen.  Maybe this I don't know this is my favorite he takes a picture snap.  Okay.

Transcript:  You know what it works for me.  I got elephant time fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Every time I look at the note I wanted even though I don't want to carry the thing around.  I like hate the fact that phones have gotten larger and larger than first is my iPhone.  And then but then I look at the note and I think but that's smaller than something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway I I'm very happy with it.  And I even I even bulked it up more by putting it in a like kind of fancy leather case but it slides in my pocket.  The case kind of impedes it a little bit.  That's pretty.  That's pretty.  I mean I'm totally.  No wait a minute let me take it off if I take it out of the case it's very slim.  And beautiful.  It's very nice and it slides in pockets very easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is where I really wish that I could just more easily turn my phones into accessories where I could just slide one into the other into the other because I want a small one.  Big one.  The Matryoshka phone.  Different devices.  I love it.  Matryoshka phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No I'm I couldn't be happier with it and I just love that ad it just makes it makes me right.  Here is a post from blog dot intercom dot I.  That might help you choose your next Android phone.  Is it a condom or is it an Android.  I love this.  It's great.

Transcript:  Both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to think this advantage here people I do not.  I.  Know use for these.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anybody that you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No use for them at all.  All right.  That's fine.  We'll move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a pretty it's pretty clever actually.  That's all right.  Very.  You had those different names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it just shows you that there is a certain commonality in the people who who name condoms and name smartphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next it'll be Android versus stripper names.  Oh.  Tiffany the phone.  Tiffany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you we mentioned this.  What do you think of this play and new in the in the Google bar.  Does that bother you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The new is a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you take the new off Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah the new really draws attention.  I mean that's the point that it draws your attention to it but it just.  Yeah.  I know.  Hopefully the new won't be there much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That the thing that no I think is there for the duration.  They changed the bar.  There were a couple of things that you might not have spotted like for example that bar used to have.  You have to be video up there and they changed it to YouTube.  Oh.  You want to go down below.  Oh interesting.  And so.  And there's a difference right.  There's a difference between using YouTube and using video but that really seemed to be part of we're turning this bar into being where you get from Google product to product to product.  Right.  Because those things up there are Google products not necessarily search products.  Google search Google images.  But see the images is interesting too because really if you're going to put YouTube there then why isn't images because.  Right.  No maybe it will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah so it gets I don't think anyone knows what because of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  House doesn't have a brand where where play really stood out for me is it is the first time I've seen Google put into its navigation a place where you can transact.  Right.  That's because play is really telling content.  Right.  You still have people who are confused to think oh that's just for Android and it's not.  It is basically Google's iTunes where you can go and buy TV you can go buy video you can go buy books whatever you want to do.  And that is sort of the equivalent of them putting like you know Amazon up there.  And that's a weird.  It's again that weird balancing act.  Now of course if I go over to Bing and I look at their navigation bar then up at the top I'm going to get shopping and news and maps and travel and entertainment and the entertainment entertainment from.  World it's going to be you know being entertainment or whatever so it kind of falls back to that.  Yeah you promote yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe maybe we just have maybe I just have to give this idea notion up that Google is somehow some monastic.  You know keeper of you know the flame up in the heights and they just send their company like anybody else.  They're promoting their products.  Gina you're right.  We don't give them we don't need to give them a free pass anymore.  They're just no more free pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah but that makes you have to rethink everything you do on the web because everything you do on the web has something to do with Google.  I mean even you know web even with AdSense and analytics sites that have nothing to do with Google have something to do with Google and YouTube and that's I mean it changes the way that you think about.  Being online if you decide that they that they aren't they don't have good intentions that they aren't about keeping the open web open.  I'm having a hard time with it because it's made me I switched to duck duck go about a month ago I think we talked about it.  It's been fine.  I mean it's been great.  You know duck duck duck has these bang searches we could do like an exclamation point PHP to search the PHP docs you know shortcuts to other places to search Wikipedia and things like that.  I've got I've took me a little bit to learn those but I really like it.  I haven't really missed Google very much at all.  I searched I still search Google for maps and images and on my phone I use the iPhone.  You can't change your search engine and mobile Safari to anything other than Google you know that then their presets inducted go is it in there.  So I am still using Google search occasionally but honestly I changed the default Chrome and didn't didn't really notice it.  So I use an Android phone.  I have an Android handset that I test my apps you know I develop apps on.  Do you use an iPhone normally.  But I'm carrying an iPhone at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean I feel like since I'm carrying an Android phone Google already knows everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  I mean yes.  But that's not the every truth because you don't if you really want to have Android and you don't want it to be tied into Google you can do that.  You change ROMs.  Well no you don't even have to do that you need to have a Google account so open a generic Google account you're done.  That Google account doesn't have to be linked into your main Google.  You don't use map quest.  You want this.  I see what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So create a dummy account.  Well that would work on the web to just have a have an account that you don't use Gmail.  You don't use.  But I mean that there that dummy account now is starting to aggregate information about everything you do doesn't need your name in it to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well it's going to.  But I mean when you do a search on your phone on Android I don't believe it's going to log that stuff unless you let it do that.  OK.  But you're right.  I mean I suppose the dummy account could do that but I'm pretty sure you're not scared of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I'm not.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because we take our phones everywhere.  What's the harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't worry about tracking to be honest.  That's what I was talking.  That's why I was making a distinction between this kind of moral panic over tracking and this I think more legitimate to me anyway.  This is my concern.  That's stupid to say it's more legitimate.  My concern is not is not tracking.  My concern is that the beautiful pristine search results are now sullied by economic interest.  That's the monk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the monkish.  Yeah.  And sir.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted a pure as the driven snow search result but that's fine.  Who cares.  There'll be better search results.  I'll acknowledge that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But here's here's the irony is like at one point Yahoo rolled out this page you can still find it is at search dot Yahoo dot com and they called it their  search pure search page and they did that because Google started becoming more and more popular because it was pure search and then people would be like well we don't want to have all this junk on Yahoo and they couldn't get away from being a portal.  Now interestingly Google's home page continues to remain pure but Google search results don't feel pure.  There are people who are like could I just have the search results if I want them without the more by this without the faces without all this stuff that in 2005 Marissa Mayer said would never ever ever.  No good.  Search.  It's just ironic.  You wonder how do you do this.  How do you become the search engine that you are on the backs of people who forgot what search was all about and then still cause people saying how do I get back to old Google search.  How do you open up that opportunity for somebody like duck which that incredibly stupid name which nobody using it.  And yet it's not going to it's not going to take Google down.  Blacko is not going to take Google down but you have it you have it appealing to some people who are influencers or what not who are looking at saying wow you know this is satisfying what I want.  Google should be doing that themselves.  We should have Google duck duck go already.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hashtag geek problem.  Yeah of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And but if we don't discuss it who's going to.  Yes because mom's not talking about it but if we don't discuss this who is going to and this is our job.  I know right.  I see this as our job to surface these issues and I know the chat room is going oh I'm sick of this.  Let's talk about games and hangouts.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want Google to have competitors.  That's why I'm I do too.  I'm excited that duck duck go has been fine for me.  I'm excited that they may not probably will not take Google down but I also don't like the idea that Google so far ahead of anyone can do whatever they want.  And that doesn't seem like there's a viable alternative.  I think that there are and Google maintains that its users can leave and that there are plenty of viable alternatives.  So I think it's I think it's kind of incumbent on us to say hey you know that there are alternatives and here's here's what they are and here's what the tradeoffs are.  And duck duck go isn't a great name but you get used to it.  It kind of grows on you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there is in a discussion in duck duck go about how to change your your your browser to make sure that it uses it instead of Google right.  Well it does a lot of stuff to look at this.  I'm going to I'm going to do that.  Gina I'm going to duck duck go.  I'm going to try it.  I'm going to go duck.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's good to see what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you use Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Enjoy being because that's part of what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's a good point.  The results are being results.  Is that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean that's the other thing is that duck duck go duck duck go depends on having being in black go largely for its web search.  So that if it really did get big then you have to have them go through and try to negotiate a deal to kind of keep all those search results coming there.  But yeah it's you know it's nice.  There's there's things to like about it.  If you're missing that pure search experience there's there's things to play with.  And if you're worried about privacy goodness knows that's one of the things that they've been pushing at which is you know we don't we don't have this personalization stuff happening.  How are they going to make money.  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's the thing here is we have to admit that this is a capitalistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I'm not thinking free and Google spends money on search as does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google may mess up its whole business.  Google may in fact this is this is the risk.  This is the huge risk.  They could lose our trust.  They could become ugly they could become cluttered.  You see Yahoo they become a pain in the butt.  All of those things can happen so the ex on execution.  They could absolutely mess up no doubt about it.  But they're running a business and so they're going to do what the business needs.  And and Gina you were right when you said earlier we're going back over the same territory.  You said right.  The wise way to run the business is to put the user first.  They've always said that.  Let's hope that's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just wish this weren't on my Google search page because I can't stop staring at it.  I'm scared.  So let's talk about Hangouts.  There are games now in Hangouts right.  Is that what is that what I hear.  How do I do it.  I want to do it.  I want to play.  You could put things on people's faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can know that I know about but there's like actual games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like they've added more stuff now.  So how do I how do I do this.  Does anybody know.  So I'm making a Hangout.  Go to the store.  I hang out.  Is it not from the Hangouts.  No I just.  We're at the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't like Hangouts Danny.  No.  I can't talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going to be dressed.  It's like oh look Leo's doing a Hangout.  I should go join that.  Yeah why don't you join my Hangout.  You could play a game with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the world will collapse if we all end up in your Hangout that's being broadcast on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We did that.  Actually we did.  We did.  We did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did that.  Actually it worked really well for the iPad announcement.  We had a great and I invited tech journalists.  So they've got screen sharing.  We knew about that.  That's that's not brand new.  I mean you're hanging out playing poker together.  I could play poker now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this becomes the the Zynga edification of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have the Clubhouse challenge which is a trivia contest.  You have a framing.  Do I add these or I have to add them.  Is that it.  Slide shares in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo where'd your Hangout go.  You're like gone.  Oh fatal server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This by the way Google has clearly decided that I'm persona non grata.  Not only am I off the suggested user list but most of the time when I do a Hangout I get a dead robot.  That's why my Hangout went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all right.  I don't care.  So just we can't demonstrate it because I don't know why.  Women come hang with us play the WWHL Google Hangout Clubhouse challenge.  Just click on that play button and then and then and then now I'm in Bravo territory and this has.  Oh I see you have to.  OK you have to go through Bravo.  And then go into a Bravo.  Hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hangout.  I don't understand how it works.  Hello.  How are you.  Good to see you.

Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That one is here right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  While we're on Hangouts can I do a plug.  Would you please do something.  Trey Harris was a wonderful wonderful guy in the New York office of Google.  Loose is not under his Google.  I like Trey a lot.  Trey is just a great great guy and he wants to play with Hangouts because he says that in his view and I agree with him the conversation on Google plus is good.  But Hangouts are awkward.  They're they're often people to sit there saying so we talk about doing it.  You button up your pajamas there Danny.  So he wants to have some kind of content around that.  So I'm very flattered that he's using as the first subject matter Gutenberg the geek have a drink.  Oh good.  When's that going to be.  If you go it'll be Sunday.  And if you go to at four o'clock Eastern if you go to Google plus and search for plus T3W that's plus T3W you'll see Trey's post about it.  It's an experiment.  And he wants to have the best most intriguing commenters in the comments.  He will then invite in to the Hangout.  So it's not just kind of random who's coming in and he'll manage it just enough and have a topic and content and see how it goes.  I'm going to give you a promo for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sunday Sunday Sunday.  Join Trey Harris as he talks about Gutenberg as he goes around 4 p.m.  Sunday Sunday Sunday.  The amazing Google Hangout and their nitro fueled funny cars.  Sunday Sunday Sunday.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sounds fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next time you come over take a look at this.  Somebody take away his credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This looks like paraphernalia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is paraphernalia baby.  And you know they start you it's 200 bucks which is expensive but I but look  that's just the beginning.  But I like the brass fittings and stuff.  Doesn't that look like a way to make coffee.  Oh yeah.  Before that you get coffee out of that.  Oh yeah.  13 hours later you get coffee out of that.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just need to heat the coffee up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't be yeah you can't be in a hurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Slow coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then Sunday Sunday Sunday.  Watch Leo's head explode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Long as we got Danny here.  Was an expert on search at search engine land dot com.  Let's ask him about Panda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh God.  Let's not.  OK.  Yeah.  Google rolled out.  I'm easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm nothing if not easy.  What is it.  What is Panda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to talk about something you got to talk about the new over optimization  penalty that's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did talk about that a couple of weeks ago.  Yeah.  Because Matt mentioned that you optimize too much.  You're going to get in trouble.  What do you think of that.  I think it's bull.  Really.  But you're in this.  Come on Danny you're in the pocket of search engine optimizers everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No I did a post on Tuesday and it was like have they jumped the sharp with over  optimization because I feel like oh we need to have yet another penalty.  You don't even enforce the penalties you have.  Go do a search and go do a search for SEO and look for any company that comes up.  Usually it's like SEO India or SEO you know some geography then go do a backlink  lookup and all you'll see are these links that are dropped in forums or blogs or  templates or all these things that Google will tell you do not work.  And they do work.  They do work.  And they do work and not only do they work but they work for something like SEO  which you think Google would be watching like a hawk.  The first thing they'd fix.  Right.  So if.  But they can't fix that which is a long standing penalty a long standing no no  that they said you shouldn't be doing this blah blah blah blah blah.  But you know what we should do.  We should have a super penalty because there's nothing better than when Google in  November tells people that SEO isn't spam and SEO is actually something you should  be doing.  And there is actually stuff that you ought to be thinking about on your webpages  good general best practices good general things not trying to screw with anybody's  you know rankings like that.  You're just can the search you can find your content is it well structured is it  all these kinds of things then say but if you do too much of that you'll get a  penalty but we won't tell you what too much of it is.  And actually what they're talking about is the idea that really you're just being  spammy.  That's the core of what I don't like about it.  They've been fairly clear to explain that there's SEO and that there's spam and  that there are two different things just like there's email marketing and there's  spam mail and they're not necessarily the same thing.  So then when you come out with this they're well we may be coming up with an  over optimization penalty you confuse the two things together and it feels felt to  me much more like it was a nice PR thing to toss out because I guess maybe they've  been feeling heat that people think oh I did this search result and all I get is  this SEO garbage that comes up and it's not SEO garbage necessarily it could just  be spam that Google didn't catch.  So what you really need are better spam filters.  But yeah so I got some gripes with with with Matt on that particular subject.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Start him up.  It's a nitro fuel Danny Sullivan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That makes sense though Danny.  I'm with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I agree 100 percent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So and I I think that Matt and I didn't hear him talk about it on the show.  I he talked about it briefly.  It was on the panel we were doing it South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually what we talked about.  We have not had Matt on to talk about it.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think really what happens is what he is probably really talking about is if we  see that you're spamming in multiple areas we may be able to use that as a better  thing. And I think he probably needs to think about a better way of of of saying it.  But yeah.  As for Panda by the way yeah they made another update that's designed to try to catch  content that they think is you know of low quality.  And this is an ongoing process.  It doesn't end.  I keep I keep trying to describe that Panda is like taking a strainer and you take all  the content from the web you dump it into the strainer and you shake it all up and you  see what comes out.  And that's the good stuff and the stuff that it catches.  That's the stuff that you go oh we don't we want we don't want this to do as well.  And then you realize when you get done that there were things that got through some of  the holes in the strainer you like OK we're going to make a new strainer we're going to  change it so that these things that are getting through don't get through and some of the  stuff that was getting caught that shouldn't have get caught will will will fix it.  And so you kind of change that filter in your strainer and you switch it around.  So every three or four weeks they change the filter and they just did that again.  So you know if you were getting caught by mistake there's a chance you're going to be  out. If you fix the things that were probably wrong maybe you'll get out.  And if you were getting by and you should have been caught then maybe you'll get caught  for more with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Couple of quickies some new services from Google.  I use a third party.  I use a couple of third party commenting systems on Leoville.  I use JS kits echo.  We use discuss I think on one of our blogs.  Google according to the next web is going into the business.  They're going to create a third party commenting platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess it's going to be based on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a surprise.  Yes it is.  You cannot escape Google Plus.  And yet you know what there's a I'll tell you why.  And this is what bugs me there really is a lot of the same reason Lady Gaga joined Google  Plus. There's a lot of incentive now to.  Use Google tools.  And I feel bad for discuss and live fire and all the other third party commenting  systems because discuss is very good.  I don't know. I love discuss.  Yeah. Yeah.  But of course Facebook's been in this for a little while.  You Facebook has a third party platform.  Do they not or they're going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes they do.  Oh yeah. You can you can use Facebook comments and then your comments can appear on  Facebook and all that. But I like discuss better because you can sign in.  Right. Many identities like Facebook Twitter and such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. That's why I use both jazz kit and echo.  And then the other thing is that they kind of capture social media commenting outside  of your blog and bring it back into the blog which is always to me been the serious  advantage of that.  Also I keep hearing about Google Drive according to a giga ohm.  It's coming next month.  Google Drive their competitor for I guess I don't know Dropbox.  Oh Malik writing a couple of days ago says G Drive is coming April first week of  April 2012 according to his sources.  Google's not talking.  That's next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the story has come up I feel like every six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I almost didn't. If it weren't ohm I wouldn't say it.  But ohm is ohm.  Ohm is ohm. Ohm sweet ohm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's amazing is that they haven't rolled it out yet but maybe they need to rename it  Google Drive and take some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go. That's what's missing.  Supposedly according to the details from my sources says ohm a gigabyte of storage for  free which is not much.  Dropbox offers to SkyDrive 25 local client and web interface that will look like Google  Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to bet it's going to be more awkward than Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I'm going to bet you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I try to think of what I use.  I use.  What's the thing I use.  They will have a third party.  Oh live mesh.  Live mesh. Yeah.  Nobody ever talks about live mesh which I think is awesome.  I think I get five gigabytes on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because I believe it's been folded into.  It's so confusing.  I think it's been folded into SkyDrive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah it's weird.  It's it's weird but it's awesome.  I mean I got one folder on my computer and anything I throw in that folder meshes.  And it's cross platform it's Mac and PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No I like mesh.  Yeah it's really beautiful.  I'm using it for a while but I think it's SkyDrive and it's got to have is 25 gigs which  is nice.  Supposedly Google will have a third party API right up front for its Google Drive which  would be good.  You know the reason I think I keep using Dropbox despite lots of reasons to use something else.  It's expensive.  You know there's the issue of you know there's no there's no real privacy on it but it works  with everything all these third party apps.  Does I bet to do text works with Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah to do text is integrated Dropbox.  That's right.  This is what everybody can do.  It's what everybody uses.  It's what everybody wanted you know first.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I presume that if Google did something that you would it had a good API you'd probably  add that as a feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  Yeah we want to make it so you can choose your cloud provider right now or just do Dropbox.  But yeah I'm excited to see Google Drive but I still don't believe it.  I mean I believe home but I'm still I feel like it's supposed to come for a long time  but it's supposed to be next week.  So I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Pinterest the president is now on Pinterest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's real.  It's mainstream baby.  I found a lovely rock today.

Transcript:  There is a great photo of the president with a lightsaber on the White House lawn on  Pinterest.  I don't know if it was his account.  It's it's it's the it's the president's campaign or it's the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Pinteresting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a plug from Jeff for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way we just put to the story out on marketing land because they they commented on  it on the spam for us now formally and they said yes we're actively working to fight spam  and it's a tremendous priority.  Of course it is tremendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Couldn't we've extended an offer to Matt cuts and as soon as he joins our team we will  be fighting spam.  Matt McGee writing that article at marketing land dot com.  No I made up the part about Matt cuts.  But not the actively working.  It's a tremendous priority.  That's true.  This is what Pinterest spam looks like.  This is the problem.  How can you tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't.  It's he's spending with affiliate links basically right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like that dress.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would buy I would buy this.  So there you go.  Because that that'll fit guys of all sizes.  But it's nicer than a black number like that.  Yeah.  Oh you're looking at the little black number.  Oh yeah.  Always always.  I'm a classical you know classic.  Yeah.  Little string of pearls.  Here is Kickstarter a web series project that you wanted to plug.  Let's give you your chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah they came to me out of nowhere.  They're big twig fans so they'll be all cheering right now.  They're making a web series fictional about a bad regulation and law that gets passed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh I like it.  H.R.  92 81.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Real interviews with folks like me as part of it.  And it looks very good.  And we as they said Hollywood will never do this story because Hollywood wrote sopa and  people.  So I would I would urge folks to go.  I like this.  Up free and open and I think it's very very neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're trying to raise a 52000 they're up to 6127.  As you know on Kickstarter that they have to raise their amount before your pledge is  real.  Twenty seven days to go.  I think it's a good web season.  This is such a really an interesting way.  And I kind of wish kick Kickstarter been around when I started to it because this would be  a much better way to launch shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I was going to ask you earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I'll give you an example.  Game on which is a gaming show that we launched we try to give it some high production  values costs us about five to seven thousand dollars an episode.  We've done 12 episodes or we're at seventy four thousand dollars in.  We'd have loved to have had that funded because it's it's risky.  The problem is and I don't I'm not sure I really like this.  What is what is your reward for giving us money.  You get a show right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well but but there's various yes that's why I gave you this this thing is I get a show  but I also get a t shirt.  You know you can.  And the other thing is what am I doing right now.  I'm the real advantage they get isn't just the money that's the key advantage but it's  also the promotion because if you want it made you're going to go tell friends and try  to mal mal them into into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No I understand the benefit to the producer is huge.  I just think it seems a little bit.  I mean you're not you're giving them money but you're not really getting anything for  your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what I'm saying is that I feel as if I'm well if you give twenty five hundred dollars  to this thing you get a co-executive producer credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah you have to come up with credits or you burn it to DVD and have a sign you know have  Veronica whoever sign it.  You have to kind of get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this market is going to collapse because ultimately people are going to realize I've  bought several things on Kickstarter and I've never seen anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this market is going to collapse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you but I think that's that's where the next question comes is the law that's  passing in Congress going through now to allow you to instead get equity at a low level  thousand price.  That's the new job thing and I can't remember the name of the company.  There's a company that in the UK where it is legal and encouraged under tax law for  people to invest at a low level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin Kevin Mark says I'm dead wrong that Kickstarter is and there's a lot of good  stuff being done by Kickstarter.  I just I just feel like there is this impression people are getting that they're getting  something for their money and really they're just giving people money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know I guess you get something early you get a discount on things.  The first thing I did was the Obama design book.  I bought it for 50 bucks.  It was then sold for 80 bucks.  So I got something very real tangible.  I got a discount.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bought the watch band and you know I just was pre-buying it at a discount and I got  it and I was pleased with it and I felt part of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I guess it's my fault.  I supported things that I you know like some gaming dice I still haven't seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not your fault.  I have funded projects that I've also still kind of waiting to get get the thing that  they promised and I'm kind of hoping that there's just a delay and I might not see it.  That's part of the risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a game startup fever with parts and boards and everything that I got from my  entrepreneurial students but I thought it was really cool to turn starting businesses  into a game and by God they've got it made and here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that I understand.  I'm just saying for start for investing in television shows.  I mean I want free and open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's but then it was 20 percent of Sundance funding.  No no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I mean it's just the idea.  Look I buy TV show.  I bought Mad Men.  I bought the whole series.  Right. I'm so excited.  Right. And I guess if I knew Mad Men were going to be that good before they produced  it I would have said hey here's 100 bucks.  That's great.  But I didn't know.  How do you know.  No you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well Twitter hasn't established.  I mean I bagged Zay Frank's you know the show.  Yeah that was good.  I would support that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Zay's great.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Twitter has a track record for shipping great shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you if you put something on Kickstarter I think you know people would know.  I mean it works much better for people who are well known who have done great work and  have proved that they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We tried to get the we actually tried to kick started.  We tried to get on.  They said no.  Really.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's a commercial.  There are some rules around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We wanted to do the bricks.  You know we wanted to do the bricks sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see if somebody gave if you're going to start a new show just give you an example  and you want to come you got to come up with the benefits.  Let's say that somebody gave two grand.  Would you let them in the official show hang out that you would agree the way you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course I could think of premiums.  Can't.  OK.  I don't know.  Let's take a break and we're going to stick with our model which is I read a  commercial.  God bless.  Thank goodness we got great advertisers who do believe in our product you know and  it is in a similar way.  But I mean they get something for it.  They get an ad for a product and presume and they don't buy ads if if if they don't  get a return on their investment.  So it's kind of it just feels to me like a clean transaction is like yeah I've got  this great audience.  You've got something that they might be interested in.  Let me tell them about it.  And if they are interested in it and they and they and they buy it in sufficient  numbers then you will continue to buy ads.  It's very straightforward.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is a good example Stamps.com which I've been a user most of almost all  of our advertisers I think.  In fact I think all of them I use.  That's part of the criteria for being an advertiser on our shows is I got to I  got to use it and I've been using stamps since I think 2004.  Stamps the whole idea Stamps.com is you don't have to go to the post office  anymore.  If that's really all I should have to say you don't have to go to the post office  anymore.  That's good.  Now how much would you pay.  You bring the post office to your desk and and that means you can print any  postage for anything even international from your computer and your printer.  No special link.  You don't need a postage meter.  You're using a postage meter.  Why go to Stamps.com right now and print your postage as needed.  In fact I've got to expect now see there's a special offer.  Don't do that.  Click the microphone.  I don't know that old fashioned microphone and use the offer code T W I G.  And look what happens to that $80 special offer.  It becomes a $110 special offer.  How do you like that.  Fifty five dollars in free postage this USB scale and a four week trial of  Stamps.com.  All you have to do is pay shipping and handling and I got to tell you for  international they fill out the forms for you.  You know going mailing something internationally like is a real chore.  You got to go to the post office figure it all out.  If you're an Amazon seller an eBay seller this is a boon.  Just if you're a small business is how we use it.  I mean it's just incredible.  Stamps.com $110 bonus offer.  All you have to do is go to Stamps.com and use the offer code twig.  Over two billion two billion letters and packages have been mailed to date  from Stamps.com.  They also do you know they work with QuickBooks so they can import your your  QuickBooks address book things like that makes it very easy to do invoices.  It's just really nice.  Stamps.com use the offer code twig.  See I don't to me that's like I like that.  It's a clean transaction.  They like us.  We like them.  You might like them.  You would use them if not no big deal.  All right it's time for our tip number and tool of the week.  Let's start with as we always do.  Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google added a new beta feature to the accounts area of your Google account.  It's called account activity and it gives you stats about what you do using Google  services.  So this is pretty cool.  I checked it out.  You turn it on you go to it's Google dot com slash settings slash activity I think  and you have to opt into this.  You have to opt into it right.  And it's beta.  And basically what they do is it generates reports about your activity.  So for example I just opted into this earlier today and I got my first report.  It told me that I received 2100 emails in the past month and I wrote 114.  Oh wow.  The people who I contact the most and how many messages I sent them next to it.  So it's a kind of a neat you know kind of this quantified self kind of thing but based  on your online activity.  So it's similar to the dashboard.  You know here's the only information we have about you but showing you stats and  analytics.  So it's I really like this.  I use a rescue time.  I think I've mentioned this before which kind of monitors what you do in your  computer.  And this is kind of similar.  I mean it doesn't give you a productivity score or anything but it kind of lets you  see like OK you know I sent an average of four emails a day and I received 71.  You know that's something I didn't realize before.  And it's got stats on your Web history.  Picasso Web Albums where you sign in from your accounts and using what products.  I signed in from Android iPhone and Mac on mobile and Chrome.  What locations what countries and locations.  It's really interesting.  So not only is it kind of like interesting information about yourself but it's also  kind of a good account security thing because you can kind of review you know where  are people logging into my account.  Is there anything here that looks unusual as well as you can say you know maybe I  should spend a little less time writing email or a little more time writing email  as it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Either way let's compare Gina.  I received four thousand two hundred thirty one emails and sent seven hundred three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whoa.  You're way ahead of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Way ahead of it should have like an email to incoming to outgoing ratio.  Yeah that's what I'm looking for in a goal like your goal.  I want a seven point three ratio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean you know if you sign up to a bunch of mailing lists you automatically archive  and label them which I which I do.  You know it's not really representative of every email that's just sent just to you.  But the email sent stats are pretty good.  So you sent seven hundred emails last month.  Jeff that's a lot.  He spent a lot of time emailing email and I'm really bad at it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go.  I want stats about how linked the email like I want even more.  You know it's like how many words that I type into the Gmail compose box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You sent Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to tell us how many you sent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I sent one hundred and fourteen in the past month so not very many.  She's a slacker.  Yeah I mean an average of like four day.  A few unprincipled words.  Yeah I mean part of my job is answering messages on a mailing list.  I run an open source project so I thought that it would be a lot more than that.  Apparently I'm a big slacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love you know we're data nerds and I think everything you know I can't wait to find out my body metrics and everything.  I just want it all in one big dashboard.  It's true.  You know your heart beats per email sent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah right.  I want to hook up an Arduino board.  Measure my heart rate and my breathing.  You know Linda Stone does that thing about how you don't breathe when you're on your computer.  I want to know my my blood pressure my heart beats my breathing.  I'm stressed out I am.  So when I'm you know rage emailing I'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God I was doing that today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't we all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rage email.  Wow.  I know you have another tip Gina save it.  You're an overachiever.  Just save it.  OK.  Because we got it we're running out of time and I want to get Jeff Jarvis's number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  That's pretty neat.  I'm all for autonomous vehicles.  I can't wait.  I am too.  It will be safer.  The carrying capacity of the highways will be better.  Efficiency.  You know I was just thinking about this.  Think of all the gas will save.  How many times do you drive around the block looking for a  parking spot.  You don't have to do that anymore.  You just get out of the car and say go home.  And I like that.  Right.  Yeah.  In fact you don't even personal ownership of cars which is a  huge environmental impact.  Way ridiculous goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Car.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come here.  There's no more personal ownership of cars.  It was a reference no one would get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A horse or something.  A dog.  Rogers horse he's stuffed.  Right.  A horse.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right next to Dale.  So my.  My my tool of the week is something that I'm going to  bring down.  I brought I tweeted about it this morning and I already  brought their server down once.  Let's do it again.  What do you say.  A lot of people feel jealousy.  It's on the Android phone.  A lot of people feel jealousy over the fact that Instagram is  only available on an iOS and it will they say soon be  available as they've been saying for months on Android.  But you know what.  Good news.  There is now something better than Instagram.  It is both iOS and Android and the web which is one reason  it's better because Instagram has never had a good web  interface is called I am E Y E M dot com.  Do you have an over the shoulder.  There it is.  And so this the whole idea of Instagram and other programs  like this is you take a picture effect.  Let me do one.  I'll do one right now of you Gina.  Let's just take a picture of Gina and I'll show you the UI  is so so slick.  So I've taken a picture of Gina.  Now one of the things that Instagram became famous for was  all its filters.  There are some really great filters and look at this.  You swipe to change filters which Instagram does not do.  So pick a filter that you like.  That's a little blown out.  Let's see.  They've got a couple of really good black and white filters.  So you see that's a nice one.  How about that.  Cool.  And I can also I can also pick a frame.  Same thing.  Swipe to change frames.  So let's actually let me let me just do this fast.  OK.  There's a frame.  Let's say hello to that.  And now this is the fun part.  Now I can say I can tag it.  It already knows I'm at the Brickhouse Studios so I'll keep  that.  But if I if I tip that tick this I can go through other things  Chad realm.  Here's all the locations.  These are all four square style locations.  I'll go back to the tweet Brickhouse Studios.  This is what I like.  These are activities so I can great performance watching  interesting exhibition.  I'm watching Gina but I could have other other I can type in  something and these become albums.  So I'm now I'm watching at the Twit Brickhouse Studio Facebook  Twitter Tumblr Flickr and four square uploads.  I'll do four square and Facebook upload.  And what I love is now there is a watching folder and this will  join the watching folder for other people who are watching.  And I can also see this place is delicious of life.  Yeah.  So this is happening near you.  This place is near you.  So I'm seeing all the pictures in the Twit Brickhouse Studio and  these are some albums green Petaluma.  I favorited a few on the road breakfast dreaming.  So this is I think this is very elegant and I think they have a  very nice web page that also supports this.  It does of course support friends but nobody's using it  yet.  So I thought I'd tell you about it.  It has popular which is very much like Instagram.  This is called I am E Y E M and it frankly is now giving us  parody on Android to Instagram which has been iOS only.  It is also on iOS so I think it's going to do very well.  And no there's no Google Plus integration.  Another great feature.  No I'm not bitter.  I'm not bitter.  I'm really not.  I'm not.  In fact I'm surprised it doesn't have Google Plus integration but  I'm sure if it had a right API it would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now I can make ordinary photos look like terrible Polaroid  photos.  Yes on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Finally actually there's about 14 very nice filters and you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  change history and fictionalized reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah and it has features of color highlight and other other  things so you can see who's taking pictures near you.  What's happening near you.  You know I have a folder that's Petaluma.  These are all pictures been taken in Petaluma.  This is it says this is my city.  So this is fun.  I just think they've done a nice job with that.  Black and white photos are really spectacular.  And oh by the way when you're looking at a photo they use the  you.  This is a I would look at this gene as a developer because they  use the UI I think very nicely when you're looking at a photo  you can swipe and it starts doing a slideshow.  So that's very nice.  Yeah it's now you see how slow it is.  We've brought it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I'm installing this right now.  Yeah.  Looks like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because we're all using it at the same time.  It is normally fairly snappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you waited to say the name until you were done.  I did.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I like it.  We broke the system.  It has a web interface that's good to E Y E M dot com.  There we go.  That's it.  We are out of time.  It's three o'clock.  Perfect.  I want to thank Danny Sullivan search engine land dot com and  marketing land dot com.  Any other lands you want to specify.  To two lands.  Two lands is enough.
