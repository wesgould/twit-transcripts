Glad to have you.  Glad to be here.  Love the show.  Our news director.  Well, we love having you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You are a Google plus head.  I'm a Google freak generally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Me too, but I try to hide that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know why I like Google?  Because I have to write a lot about news.  And Google makes news every single day.  Apple makes news twice a year.  But Google is such a newsworthy company.  They do all these crazy projects.  They're always, you know, they have their hands in every cookie jar.  It's just a great company to cover because they just do so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, this is a red-letter day.  For the first time in a long time, somebody's handed me a brush saying, could you brush  your hair?  Whoa.  Jeff Jarvis is here from London.  Londonium.  I should throw him the brush across the pond.  It's late at night.  Oh, is it?  Oh, I like it.  It's, you know, both of us look like crazy professors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm the only person on the show who combed his hair.  Until just now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You are a crazy professor, though.  That's the difference, Jeff.  What are you doing in London?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in Perugia, Italy last week for the International Journalism Festival.  And then I came on to work at The Guardian for four days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am so jealous.  I've been watching Matthew Ingram's posts from Perugia last year.  Oh, Malik and Matthew.  Is this your first time at that conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was.  It is.  And Matthew, poor Matthew, I don't think this is any secret, he got his backpack stolen  from under his train seat.  He was sitting in it.  But the hotel took pity on him, apparently, and he got the royal suite.  Nice.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I want my backpack stolen.  Well, good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Matthew ate very well and enjoyed his time in Perugia with his wonderful wife, Wendy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And is he happy?  Because he was picked up like six, I think five or six other former Giga-omers.  He was hired by...  Who?  Fortune.  Fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That ain't bad.  Yeah.  He was one of the six.  No, it's great.  Giga-omers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Alumni.  Good for him.  And he's...  And did you ask him about it?  Is he happy about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's happy.  Yeah, he starts pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad he got to go to Perugia, and I'm glad you got to go to Perugia, one of  the most beautiful medieval cities in Italy.  Just stunning.  Indeed.  And is where many American students go to learn Italian before they do their exchange  program.  My sister went there to get ready for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they going to Italy to learn Italian, or are they learning Italian to go to Italy?  These kids, you got to wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chicken and egg.  I don't know which came first.  Also with us, we're really glad to have Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land, one of the  most astute observers of Google and search in general.  And I got a lot of questions for you.  This is a Danny Sullivan-jammed week.  Got no answers.  I'll try.  I got to start with a breaking story, though.  Google finally announced its wireless carrier business.  We're going way back to the 700 megahertz auctions that the FCC did.  For so long, we've been saying, if Google would just get into the cell carrier business,  they could just destroy it, reconstitute it.  That's not exactly what they're doing this time.  It's called Google PHY.  Faux Fum.  Faux Fum.  And it is, PHY does not stand for Finland.  It is what we expected from Google, which is a new project PHY, a new wireless carrier  based on, frankly, Sprint and T-Mobile.  So they're really an MVNO.  It's just a fancy MVNO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  PHY stands for, finally, Google is an MVNO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it is going to be different.  For one thing, a flat rate, $20 a month, that gives you talk, text.  By the way, unlimited international as well as US text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It turns out, though, that despite rumors, international will cost extra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let me explain what's going on here.  So for $20 a month, you get unlimited domestic talk and text, unlimited international texts,  low cost international calls.  This is through T-Mobile.  This is what T-Mobile probably is doing.  Wi-Fi tethering is included in the $20, and it's 120 plus countries.  But then there's the data component, and that starts, you pick a package, 10, 20, 30 gigabytes a month.  You pay $10 per gigabyte flat rate.  If you use more, you pay more.  If you use less, they refund it.  So it's a little like Ting in that regard.  This would easily be the least expensive mobile system.  Here's the catch.  You got to have a Nexus 6 phone.  It's the only phone that works with it.  But here's why I love this.  Of course, we all have Nexus 6 phones, right?  I don't.  You don't?  I don't.  Jason does.  Jason Howell does.  That's your daily driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is, and I've requested an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Phones go missing, though, Jason.  So if yours goes missing, it's probably an accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just don't leave it under the seat on a French train.  Jeff, you still carry the Nexus 6 as your daily driver, don't you?  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Danny, what do you use for a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have, I actually use the iPhone 6 mostly if I had to go out with one phone.  Usually I go out with two, and I would have the Nexus 6, but then the Galaxy S6 just came in.  So I flip flopped them for the time being.  Yeah, I actually really love the S6.  Yeah.  And although my key feature is that I can put a wallet case on both the S6 and the end.  You can't do that with the Nexus 6.  And so I was like, if I want to have a single phone, then I want to go out,  and I want to have all my credit cards and everything in it, then I need the wallet case.  So next time, make it a flat back.  But it's a nice phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just big, 6-inch phone, and it's not cheap.  It's not a traditionally inexpensive Nexus phone.  Starts at $650 for the 32GB, and then I think it's $700 for the 64GB.  But I guess, I would guess that there's some sort of...  Well, for one thing, it out of the box does work on both Sprint and T-Mobile,  so that's one thing going for it.  LTE.  So what are the international costs?  That's a good question.  I don't know what the international cost is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't seen those numbers.  But to me, the thing that is the big, big news here is the fact that you have two carriers  and Wi-Fi, and calls go seamlessly between them.  So if you're indoors, and you have your home Wi-Fi, and you're talking on the phone,  and then you leave to go to work, it will switch over to one of the mobile carriers  without dropping the call.  Now imagine this extended beyond the Nexus 6 and beyond the two carriers.  Imagine if you could have three or four carriers.  Imagine if you could have all the carriers.  You just always have the best possible coverage.  You would have amazing coverage.  And then the other innovation here is the clarity of the plan, because what carriers  do is they play a shell game.  They hide fees.  Right.  Oh, sure, we'll subsidize your phone, and then you end up paying $1,200 for your iPhone  because they just fold it into the wireless charges, and who knows what you're paying for.  In this case, you get what you pay for, you pay for what you get, and it's very clear.  And I think that's the threatening thing to the carrier model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alan Tepper in the chat room says that if you want to buy the Nexus 6 from Fi, as part  of the Fi experience, you can amortize the cost over 24 months.  So that's not so bad.  No.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry, Jeff, I stepped on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I'm lagging here.  I also ordered a Karma, and met with the founder of Karma, and that is also a pay for the data  that you use on a MiFi or not.  And I think I'm delighted that there are now two pressures to get rid of this wasted data  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also month to month, there's no annual contract.  So really, I think this is probably what Google's interested in, is kind of a shot across the  bow on mobile carriers who've really made this a horrific experience.  Yes, they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so I just think it's, look what they've done with Fiber.  Fiber involves digging trenches and things like that, getting massive regulatory approval.  With something like an MVNO, they should be able to grow this and expand it and sort of  get better deals for international coverage and all that kind of stuff much more quickly  than they've been able to grow.  And of course, the Fiber project started out as a project, nobody really believed it.  People thought it was some future thing, and then all of a sudden it was upon us.  All of a sudden they were digging trenches.  Suddenly, cities are actually going online with this thing.  So I think that this, they're coy about it and they say, oh, this is just an experiment,  we're just trying it out, it's very limited.  But I think within a year or two, this is going to be a pretty significant option for  people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll also have to get a new SIM card, the particular Project Phi SIM card, which if  you think about it, a SIM card is traditionally tied to one carrier.  This SIM card will allow you to go back and forth between Sprint and T-Mobile.  We've seen Wi-Fi calling.  In fact, T-Mobile on the S6 and other phones has Wi-Fi calling, which I think works pretty  well.  What's your experience with it been, Danny?  Have you played with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I haven't.  I usually, it's one way or the other.  So the most that I've been dealing with, say, Wi-Fi stuff has been if I have been sending  text from my desktop because I use Google Voice.  So I'd go and I would connect that way, which is beautiful because I can be in another country  and I'm still getting the same sort of stuff.  And times I've made calls that way, so I haven't used it.  What I am curious is, typically you turn to Wi-Fi because you don't want to use up your  data, right?  So I want to watch a bunch of movies and everything.  So you hook up to Wi-Fi and you don't even think about whatever the data is if it's open  and you're free to use it.  So I'm wondering when they say it's one gigabyte, is that one gigabyte if I'm on an open Wi-Fi  thing or is it one gigabyte regardless of how the data I'm using?  You can actually start racking up more data usage that costs you money with this plan  if you count your Wi-Fi usage.  And I can't find anything in the back on that.  Oh, that's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That can't be.  No, they can't charge you for your own data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it can be, but you know, I don't think it can be, but it'd be nice  if they clarified that.  I mean, I keep going through the fact trying to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, I'm not looking at the fact, but I am looking at the well, and I guess they  don't spell it out specifically, but they do say this technology connecting to the Wi-Fi  hotspots helps keep your speed high and your data bill low.  So if connecting to that Wi-Fi would increase your bill, actually, then they might not make  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My assumption is probably not counted into it.  I would guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would immediately drop it if it did.  Yeah, that would be a big bummer.  Here's in the FAQ, it says, does it cost extra to use my phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot?  Project Fi does not charge any extra monthly fees to use your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot.  It's included.  You can use your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot to share your data with any Wi-Fi compatible  device.  The data you share will count towards your monthly usage data, but that's because when  you're doing that as a Wi-Fi hotspot, you can only use LTE.  So that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will say that, you know, I use prepaid for both Verizon in the US and T-Mobile in the  US, and I think a lot of people overlook that the prepaid plans actually can be very good.  I think I'm paying $45 a month, and that's giving me, I think, a gigabyte and a half  of data, and then you buy additional data and three gigabyte things for $20 at last  90 days, but it's actually a really, really good deal, especially when you compare it  to their regular paid plans.  On T-Mobile, I have a plan that's costing me $45 a month, and that includes five gigabytes  of data and unlimited call and text.  But you only know how to get that plan.  If you go past all the stuff they put up at the top and you go at the bottom and go,  I'll take one of those things down here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the best, in my opinion, T-Mobile plan.  It's a prepaid also.  $30 a month, unlimited web.  That's the one I have.  Unlimited text.  That's my secret plan.  100 minutes talk.  And since most people don't talk anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Until you want to activate your hotspot, and then they're like, oh yeah, we're going to  tack on another $15, but it's still a pretty good plan.  You get your first five gigs.  But you're right.  That is the secret plan.  That's the thing that gets me when John, I can never say his last name, Laguerre, but  whenever he goes off about how, hey, look, we're so great.  We're the uncarrier.  We're breaking all the stuff.  And it's like, you never mentioned that awesome plan that you have down there.  And only if people know the secret plan exists, I wish you would just embrace it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to go to the prepaid plans on T-Mobile.com and you'll see it down at the bottom.  But you're right.  And that's comparable to what we're talking about with Google.  In no cases do these plans talk about federal and state taxes, which can be significant,  maybe as much as $8 a month.  So just consider that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the international thing, man, I just came back from Iceland, right?  And so when I ended up there, I in the airport bought the local SIM card, put it into my  phone, and then I'm pretty good, right?  It's not like I'm trying to get phone calls and I still have Google Voice on the phone  so I can see if I'm getting any calls coming into me that way.  But it's still like, I don't get the local card or whatever, and I don't want to turn  on the phone until I have it or whatever.  And this will be awesome because this means, you know, you get your SIM from Google, you  go abroad.  Yes, it's going to be limited to 3G speeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't mention that.  That's the T-Mobile deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got to read the fact.  You got to read the fact.  It says it in the fact.  OK.  Yeah.  Data speeds are limited to 3G.  Oh, and then they call 3G.  Ready for this?  256 KPS, which to me is not 3G.  No, it's really edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really 2G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's edge.  So, all right.  But still, you know, get your buy, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to be going to Europe in June.  I hope I can get my SIM and my invite before then because I would love to take that Nexus  6 with me and give you a real world experience.  Jeff's traveling all the time.  I'm sure you would be a good person for them to give this to.  We get, it's interesting, and I don't know if this is true all over the country, sprint  is terrible in Petaluma.  T-Mobile is amazing in Petaluma.  But that might be exactly what this does for you is, you know, Sprint's great in Vegas.  T-Mobile's terrible.  Right.  Go to Vegas.  You've got a choice.  And my experience with Wi-Fi handoff is actually pretty good.  Republic Wireless does this.  And I had a Moto X on Republic Wireless.  It was pretty amazing.  I was making a call on the Wi-Fi at home and intentionally got in the car and drove off  as I'm talking.  I think I did this in my before you buy review.  I was leaving myself a voicemail message.  It was seamless.  At no point did you suddenly say, oh, now he's on the cell service.  It was just seamless.  So this is totally doable.  Phones can do this very well now, I think.  So that's exciting.  We've been waiting for this.  Why is Google doing this, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just trying to put the big guys in a vice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are they trying, are they the shaming company?  Is that their job?  Let's shame the other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to shame you into mobile now.  What's the business purpose for this?  It's always very simple.  Google's business model could be simpler.  The more people use the Internet, the more money Google makes.  Full stop.  Right, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I agree with you entirely.  This is like make it easier for people to get online, stay online, always be online  so that we can always be there for them, figuring out ways to make money from them while they're  online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this a cost service or is Google subsidizing this with revenues from search?  I bet it's at cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't, I think this may be, because this is comparable pricing to Karma.  And Karma is just going to pay one big data bill a month to sprint.  Right.  It's the way they described it to me.  But it's pretty comparable.  I forget what the Karma prices are, but it's comparable.  I'll bet it's not a loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll bet it is very close to break even, and this is the kind of thing Google does.  They launch something, they see if it catches on, and then they wait for the monetization.  It didn't even occur to Google to, for example, put advertising in Gmail until much later.  They've had it for a while, and a lot of people are using it, and they thought, huh, we could  do this.  So I wouldn't be surprised if this is another sort of experiment to see if it goes anywhere.  Regarding their business model, yeah, they probably have a secret bunker somewhere where  they have a committee of geniuses sitting around going, what is it that causes people  to hesitate to use the internet more?  And they probably have a long list of reasons.  One of them is people are confused about their data plans.  They really don't know how much it costs, and so they sort of hold back.  And then what happens is the average person wastes $23 a month on data they didn't use.  And so they see this situation where people are holding back on using the internet, and  then they're holding back too much, and they're not even using the plans that they have, and  this is because of confusion.  So I think by creating all this clarity and by creating a situation where you're never  out of range of a good signal, they're just making it friction-free in terms of using  data on a mobile device.  I think that's sort of the grand scheme, just to get people to use more data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is there a phone number on here?  Where is that?  Because there's a phone number somewhere on this website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Under experience, if you go to the experience tab and then scroll down at the bottom, you  see there's a number there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Keep going right there.  What is that?  Is that so...  Let's call that.  It's a 404.  That's Atlanta, I think.  404-978.  You getting this, Jason?  Are they paying Lionel Richie for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's answering every call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He and his band are answering every call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is hysterical.  So Google's actually giving out this number, and when you call it, you get Lionel Richie.  404-978-9316.  Does a pitch come on at some point, or is it just Lionel singing the whole time?  It just stops suddenly.  There's such a puckish sense of humor there over at the Google Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dave Chappelle has hilarious routine on something like this.  He explains the reason why they always have 555 something something something on movies.  It's because someone will call.  Any phone.  You put a phone number somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  55309 in every area code is unusable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Google's solution wasn't to use a fake number.  It was to use a number that actually Lionel Richie answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's probably a Google Voice number.  Wouldn't be that hard to set up with Google Voice.  Wow.  No other tighter integration though into Google.  Wouldn't that be interesting?  I guess because it's a Nexus 6, it's already pretty tightly integrated.  But you'd think that they'd do a tie in a Google Voice or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There actually is some degree of integration.  The calls, texts, and voicemails can all be sent to Google Hangouts.  No matter what device you're using.  So there is some attempt at integration with Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, WumperMill says, see you do get a human when you call a Google number.  It's not always a Python script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think I'll get it and I'll use it.  But I'm not sure when I'll give up my AT&T because I'm grandfathered in unlimited data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At some point AT&T is going to shake you out of that tree.  They do not like you.  They just can't figure out a way to get to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm in that tree with Jeff hanging on for dear life.  They better shake pretty hard.  I love that unlimited data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I gave it up about a year and a half ago and I haven't missed it now.  Because actually it turned out to be cheaper just to go to one of their share everything with your family plans.  I think you use it less than you think, don't you?  Well, when I went to the plan, then it was like, OK, you've got 15.  Yeah, you do use it less.  But then they added the 15 gigabyte and then they said, OK, and by the way, we're doing the special promotions.  And now we're doubling everybody's data, which got me into that.  And then they keep rolling over the data.  So it's like, you know, I was in the car the other day and I told the kids, yeah, go nuts.  Stream the YouTube while we drive up there.  I don't care.  Use it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lisa Lisa's son is on a shared data plan with Lisa, my wife, and Lisa gets I think nine or ten gigabytes a month.  But Michael has no compunction about getting on the YouTube and running a playlist and it just runs all day.  He will blow through all 10 gigabytes literally in a week or two.  And it drives Lisa crazy because she's got no more data.  So it is it is not impossible to blow through 10 gigabytes on a mobile device.  I can't wait. We all hope we get an invite.  I don't know what Google's criteria are.  I imagine they do ask for your zip code that some of it will be coverage.  Yeah, obviously, it'll have to be people with an extra six, although I they don't vet that.  But I presume it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, by the way, of course, I couldn't use my Google Apps account.  Really?  Nope, has to be a Google Apps Google Apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was already logged in.  That sucks so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lionel Richie is the secret ambassador.  We're going to take a break when we come back.  I'm glad Danny Sullivan is here because yesterday was mobile.  We'll get and I want to know what the what the upshot with the body count, the butchers phones are raining down in the sky.  Yeah, is.  But first, a word.  Let's talk about shaving.  Shall we?  I didn't shave this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there you have a shaving kit right there.  I looked up this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should shave.  I looked up this morning and I and it was late and I said, oh, my gosh.  And I ran out the door.  You know what?  I was writing code when you're coding.  It started to look like a developer.  This is why developers look this way.  You just forget, you know, about grooming and time and all of this.  Fortunately, when I go home, I've got a fabulous Harry's shave awaiting for me.  You know, we're big fans of Harry's.  H.A.R.R.Y.S. dot com.  They when they started it just a couple of years ago, they said, we want to make shaving a better experience.  It's something we all have to do, something few of us love.  And having a dull or bad blade is just going to exacerbate it.  So Harry said, let's make sure we can make the best possible blades at a very fair price, about half the drugstore blade, about two dollars a blade.  And the way they do it, they bought the factory.  There are two factories in the world, both in Germany, that make great blades.  So they bought the factory and they and they designed the blades to their specs for sharpness, high performance, for comfort.  You know, there's knobs you could turn on that factory line to say, oh, yeah, we're going to make the disposable blades now.  Turn it down.  But they've turned them all the way up to 11 on sharpness and performance.  And you get a great shave.  And better yet, Harry's delivers these blades to your door for free.  Well, not the blades, but the shipping's free.  And because they're more efficient, they make themselves the prices right.  Take a look at a Harry's kit.  In fact, if you go to Harry's dot com right now, they've got two big kits.  This is the Winston.  The Winston kit is about what is it?  Thirty five dollars.  And then there's a Truman.  Twenty five dollars.  Twenty five.  Less than I thought.  Then there's a Truman, which is fifteen.  In both cases, you're going to get a handle.  The Harry's Winston set is a metal handle.  The Truman set has a plastic handle.  You're going to get three blades.  This is all for fifteen bucks.  You're going to get a bottle of the incredible Harry's foaming shave gel, which not only smells great, it works great.  Although they also have cream.  If you prefer cream, I use the cream.  Oh, look, he's got his Harry's.  Is that a Harry's?  That's a Harry's.  That's the Truman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know I'm nuts.  You know I'm nuts, but I try.  Because all I do is shave my neck.  I don't even use anything with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would you?  You don't need to.  It's a beautiful sharp blade.  Very little pull.  Very little tug.  Yeah, I'm going to do the same thing.  Who needs razor cream, shave cream?  H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com.  And by the way, fifteen bucks I said for the Truman.  Make it ten.  We're going to take five dollars off your first purchase if you use the offer code TWIG.  So that's a great, this is a great gift for the guy.  Father's Day is coming up.  Maybe dad would like a set of Harry's.  And for the developer in your life.  And for the developer who forgets to shave.  Because he's in the middle of a coding binge.  Just hand it to him.  Put it on his desk.  With a bottle of mouthwash.  A tube of toothpaste.  You got it.  Harry's.  H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com.  And get five dollars off, but you got to use the offer code TWIG at checkout Harry's.  We love Harry's.  Thank you Harry's for making shaving.  Something I do every morning.  A much nicer ritual.  You know it's funny I used to shave in the shower.  Once we got Harry's I started shaving the sink.  Both to save water because we're in a drought here.  But also because I like kind of the ritual of it.  Yeah.  And so it just kind of became a more aesthetic experience for me.  I care more about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The water situation is so bad I switched to wine for all the water.  I bathed in it.  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more plentiful in this area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's more wine than water here in the Sonoma County.  So Danny what is it?  There were some Prague.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were beer spas where you could bathe in beer.  The Prague.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Czech Republic.  They love there.  But they make great great pilsners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sounding like that show last man on earth when he had his margarita pool or whatever.  So Danny what is mobile Gettin?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mobile Gettin.  Well so yesterday was mobile Gettin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what happened was back in February Google said hey everybody you know.  We think mobile results.  We think mobile is very important.  And in fact when we are driving people from our search results to pages if those pages don't render well in their mobile devices we think that that's an issue.  And so we're going to use one of the big levers we have here at Google to help change the web out there by saying that when someone does a search in mobile on Google we are going to give preference to sites that we deem to be mobile friendly.  And if your site isn't mobile friendly then you might not rank as well as you're going to be doing in the past.  And so the idea is that Google wanted people to correct sites where you know you can read them but you may have to do the double tap or you may have to switch the phone sideways and kind of stretch it out a bit or you kind of hard to click on links or sometimes you go to the page and like the flash doesn't load and everything.  All those things are things that Google thinks are not considered mobile friendly.  So they made this announcement in February that on April 21st we are going to roll out what we call our mobile friendly update and that will start to reward pages that are mobile friendly from that point onward.  And that mobile friendly test page that you have up there is a way anybody can check individual pages on their website to find out if they're mobile friendly.  If it comes up and it says yes you're good for that page if it says no you got problems and it gives you some advice on how to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this unprecedented A that Google would announce so far ahead of time that they're changing their algorithm and being very specific about what changes are being made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah and in fact I'll get to that let me say also in addition to that test that you're showing there if you log into Google Webmaster Tools it gives you an analysis for your entire site rather than page by page.  So you're absolutely right this was unprecedented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey our page is mobile friendly!  Excellent!  That's why we're redesigning it at great expense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some people might recall that Google had these updates like Panda or Penguin and you might even recall that people were hit by these things and they lost a lot of traffic like a demand media or whatever.  Those were updates or changes to Google's algorithm that were designed to go after spam or low quality content.  This isn't going after necessarily low content quality this is akin to things like Google has said where they are going to reward sites that are speedy or they're going to reward sites that are secure.  But it's of a nature and of a scale to the degree that Google says it will be like the anti-spam fighting algorithms where it has an impact on many many more pages in the mobile results.  And it is absolutely unprecedented that they have announced so far in advance that on this particular day we're flipping the switch.  Which is why MobileGeddon came about because we've never had that we've never had like oh my god get prepared it's going to be this day.  And so I don't know who coined MobileGeddon we certainly have been using it at Search Engine Land a lot of other people have been using it as well and that's what happened yesterday.  They flipped the switch and if anything happened nobody knows yet because there's been there's been no big reports of people saying oh my site dropped out of the results or this hasn't been a huge thing.  So we think that actually they may have been a bit slow in flipping it.  We also know it's going to take about a week until that it fully rolls out.  But we're watching to see if we get a sense of any brands or any changes that happen where people weren't prepared and they actually lose noticeable ranking and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anybody who's done a redesign in the last few years will probably pass this test.  I'm actually stunned because Twit.TV did pass the test so did Live.Twit.TV.  It's not too demanding let me put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the good news is by the way it is a page by page type of thing.  So if part of your site isn't mobile friendly they're onto the site might be OK.  And also it's ongoing. So there's no well MobileGeddon happened now I got to wait until MobileGeddon 2.  They're constantly crawling the web.  They're a great movie.  It would be when you see it on a sci-fi channel or something like that.  So there's no waiting for that.  It's ongoing.  So if you make the changes today and Google comes back tomorrow to your website and sees that they're there then you should see some of your rankings get restored if they really were impacted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It may be a bigger problem than some people think because the research firm Portent said that they tested the 25,000 top sites what they consider the top sites and 10,000 of them failed the test.  Almost half.  Yeah and including the Department of Homeland Security.  Well they expect a lot of government sites to fail actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But commercial sites are always being updated and redesigned and mobile this mobile friendly doesn't mean mobile responsive right Danny.  It doesn't have to go that far.  It doesn't have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It has to render in a way that people wouldn't feel uncomfortable reading on a mobile device.  But Google is recommending responsive.  You know they've definitely taken that side.  They understand that it's not always going to be the right case in some some situations.  And it isn't in some situations but they really are on the side of responsive and they recommend that people go that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We know so there's mobile friendly and there's mobile friendly in other words in the old days the way you would do it.  And I think my site Leoville still does that.  I have a template for mobile and supposedly when you come in on a mobile device it will give you a very different looking site.  That's the old way of doing it.  And now kind of not preferred the new way of doing it is having the site design in such a way Squarespace does this that when you on any size screen it adapts sensibly so that it gives you good results on any size screen.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And that's our new site will be mobile responsive.  I don't think our existing site is mobile responsive.  So but I'm glad to see that that's not a requirement at this point.  Did you imply that it might get tougher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It could but I mean it's already kind of kind of tough to begin with.  It's not hard to look at some of these sites that like our our my editor in chief Matt McGee runs a site about you too is a long running fan site.  He's had it for 20 years and he actually did a case study that he wrote on searching Gillian saying hey my site is probably going to get hit because this is a hobby that we do.  It's very proprietary with a lot of our databases and we literally don't have time to go through and resources right now to try to make it mobile friendly.  So potentially he's going to get hit even though if you go to the site you can read it.  It's not like you can't do it.  You just have to do a bit more work.  And so it is I think quite a step to say well mobile friendly doesn't mean I can use it on the mobile device but that I can I can use it without extra steps that that is a that's sort of a big check check already I think it was kind of funny when we when we did the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  story on tech news today 10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern 1800 UTC at live.tv we we had a chat room full of people saying who does Google think they are.  Yeah. And you know so this is the philosophical segment of this of this part of the show where this is exactly what Google should be doing.  Is it absolutely is the reason the biggest product.  Well but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well yeah but that that means that should they should they start being a bully as well.  But Google does this in a lot of respect.  Those decisions doing this with HTTPS.  They've been doing this with shot shot one.  They've been doing this in a lot of respects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have the product use and they push that when they want to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what Google search is that's the secret sauce they.  Get the user experience.  So if they're if they're not penalizing sites that are horrible on mobile when you use a mobile device then it's kind of a dereliction of duty and then user experience is lower.  When I want to go to the top resource on a mobile device I want them to give me a good experience when I get there.  And that's I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Question do they deprecate you if you're searching on the web.  No only on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Only on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so OK that's interesting.  So you can't really search on the web and expect to see your result.  You have to do it from a mobile device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have to do it on a mobile device or there's simulators you can use it better if you use a mobile device.  And by the way it's not the only thing that happens.  So if someone were to search for say twig and you weren't mobile friendly because that's so brand oriented and it's pretty obvious that you're the right answer.  You probably would still come up and if you really did have the right answer over other things even if you weren't mobile friendly you still might come up even if it wasn't a brand slash navigation thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny worked for me.  My blog is not mobile friendly.  I'll have my son fix it this summer.  And by the way told me I guess you're on WordPress.  Here's what you do here's go there and do this.  But if I search for Jeff Jarvis my site comes up first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that should continue to happen.  It really is an impact where you have generic searches that are happening where if there are 11 possible answers and one of them is not mobile friendly that that that site the one that's likely to lose out in this sort of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy Jeff your site sucks.  I know.  Page appears not mobile friendly text too small to read mobile viewport not set.  I don't know what that means links too close together content wider than screen.  Jeff Jeff Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is all with you people I want people to sit in their chairs on their ass and read me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The heck with you mobile folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo can you send that page to Jeff son.  This is going to get on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does that mean Danny mobile viewport not set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's the where you define the size of the the screen and how it's shaped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I remember correctly you could say on a screen of this size of you pork right this size.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're on the right where it says you're you're how to make this friendly you're on WordPress.  Yeah it's very very it's very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact there's some very straightforward stuff.  And I think I suspect the problem is the theme that you're using and you just you'll just change to a more mobile friendly theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm on my Leo village on WordPress and it's not the worry Jack because if I search for you on mobile for Jeff Jarvis I just get this big huge.  Big thing I get a Jeff head courtesy of Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That image looks like it's from this week in Google.  I don't even need to horrible picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even need to go to your website.  You've been scottish for Gina Trapani and Leo Lepore.  Yeah that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we're associated with Jeff now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah you are.  And then there's Buzz Machine number number one after you get past all the other Google stuff.  Yeah there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah that's fair.  What's this Google doodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah you got to click on it.  This is the animal thing I was telling you earlier.  So this is Earth Day today.  Earth Day.  So just click on the logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which animal are you Earth Day quiz.  What are you up to on a typical Friday night alone in my borough rarely seen out strutting my stuff following the herd.  I'm not alone in my borough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm in my borough with my honey.  But I'll click alone in my borough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you've got honey.  So that's you're probably a bear.  I'm a honey badger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You and your best friend show up to a party wearing the same outfit.  No big deal.  How embarrassing.  Fight.  Fight.  I'm going to fight if you wear the same outfit.  Choose a snack.  Seafood fruit and or insects meat or salad.  What do you look for in a partner bright colors loud grunting sounds a complex system of glands.  Or old fashioned values.  Feats of strength your hobby feats of strength work around the house swimming.  None of the above.  I think feats of strength.  I'm a honey badger.  I know it.  I know it.  I know it.  I know it.  Your true friends know they can always call on you to scare away lions or fight a king cobra.  So I should share this right.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I was checking there's been about like.  And you're a wooly mammoth.  Wooly mammoth.  Five or ten people sharing them for a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a honey badger.  Honey badger don't care.  And I don't care.  Share.  But it doesn't share my honey badger picture.  Just the.  This is the picture I want to share.  That's fun.  Today they pretty much have a Google Doodle every day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's getting that point.  I mean there's always a thirty seventh or one hundred and twenty fifth third or thirty  third anniversary to be celebrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've taken the fun out of the Google Doodle.  Yeah.  Let's make it something special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It should generate cash that spills out on your desk.  Oh yeah.  Impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me I'm going to tweet it.  Maybe if I tweet it I'll get my honey badger picture.  Wouldn't that be so.  What is Google Plus.  What's going on with with with Google Plus.  It's I just read some stats that show that it is not exactly a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well there was a guy on Forbes wrote a piece talking about how it's dead again.  I don't like the dead thing.  But he had he trotted out those stats which were giant.  No it is absolutely not giant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And which isn't by the way a bad thing.  I often like social networks where it is an exclusive group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Well it's interesting because it's probably similar in size to Twitter in terms of the  number of active users.  But Twitter has every single journalist lots of famous people and the people you're going  to find on Google Plus are often very very smart and engaged but they're less likely  to be Lady Gaga or you know Jeff Jarvis.  Well Jeff is a bad example because Jeff is on Google.  He's one of the people who's on Google Plus.  But yeah but we had this you know we over the weekend we had this big whoopty doo where  this guy posted this thing and said oh it's you know it's dead.  And then he just got hammered with traffic from Google Plus from people passionately  arguing in favor of Google Plus.  And this happens every time.  That doesn't mean that they've got huge a huge audience but super passionate users.  And so that's essentially where it the dust is settled now and Google Plus is the place  where people who are passionate about something usually technology oftentimes but every other  thing go and we love it.  But it's not sort of like a site for the masses and it's not a site for celebrities and  journalists and it's not the site for everybody which is what Facebook is.  So everybody sucks compared to Facebook in terms of numbers and engagement.  And Google Plus is you know it's good for the people that's good for but it's it's just  not everybody's cup of tea.  You know the truth is that some people want to interact with people they already know  and some people want to find new people.  And Google Plus is the place to find new people.  Facebook is the place to interact with people you already know.  And Twitter is the place where you don't really interact so much as get information and swap

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know.  Twitter is not about conversation by any means.  Yeah it's funny because every time somebody does a threaded conversation thing like Google  Plus like Jaiku like I can go on and on friend feed.  They fail.  Yeah.  People don't want to spend that much time.  No but the people who do I think of the people that you and I kind of are interested in terms  of engagement I would say that's probably true of you too Jeff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what I'm talking about was a Google Plus post.  No Google hasn't released any information about their stats but somebody did some deep  some sort of deep data mining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well Stone Temple did a huge huge report last week.  Yeah.  Which I mean I don't even think we ended up covering in the end because we're sort of like  who cares at this point.  I mean that's the saddest kind of call of all.  Well I know but you know I think when you go back to Google Plus in my view it is it is  the it is the Google online store or it is it's the place for Google fandom.  If you like Google products Google products and services or whatever that is your home  for a lot of people that are there in the way that you know you can go to an Apple store  sometimes you see a lot of Apple fanatics or whatever.  But you know I think the fact that sometimes the posts that get the most engagements are  the posts about whether or not Google Plus is dead or not is both tiresome and indicative  of how little traction the services had broadly because you never ever see that happening  on Facebook.  Nobody says Facebook's dead.  Nobody says Facebook is dead and then the entire Facebook community turns out to try  to say oh no it isn't.  You're just not using it right.  You haven't done this.  And even on Twitter you all see sometimes people would debate whether or not Twitter  is going to get be dead or whatever and people will argue it a bit among a small select group  of people.  Meanwhile everybody else is all busy tweeting you know their their stuff.  So I mean I I'm still on Google Plus.  I found that personally the engagement is down even though I haven't done anything different  from day one.  You know it it sends traffic it does but it just well I actually think that the Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus is not a good place to it's not a good way to send traffic.  Yeah there's a lot of engaged people and you can send a lot of traffic but people on Google  Plus don't want to leave Google Plus which is the opposite of Twitter.  Twitter is almost always a link to somewhere else.  On Google Plus it's very difficult to drive.  It's more it's easier to get people to comment and engage and share than it is to get them  to watch a video or just click on a link.  And one of the reasons there I think there are two reasons why nobody has these arguments  on Facebook.  One of them is that on Facebook it's like oxygen is kind of there.  People don't care about Facebook itself.  Their people are there and that's why they're there.  And secondly nobody you know nobody loves Facebook like the people who love Google Plus  really love it.  So they're always championing the bid to have that argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so you're missing the main reason it doesn't happen because it's patently not dead.  Yeah right.  Well that's the main reason.  Whenever I hear people protesting we're not dead yet.  That's in a way an acknowledgement that it well it kind of looks dead.  Yeah.  Here's a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a question for you.  When was the last time either either Danny or Mike.  When was the last time that they added a new feature to Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's dead from Google's point of view right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's gone.  It's in hibernation.  They're not going to do anything more with it and they're going to actually keep breaking  out parts of it and spinning them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kind of like friend feed was in hibernation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It won't die.  I mean like in five years from now they might eventually say hey by the way that stream  thing that we've been doing that's the remaining part.  Right.  It's being sunsetted into you know Google Reader News whatever with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And just to put this in perspective the kind of the bottom line of the Stone Temple analysis  they took a little more than half a million posts just at random and analyze them and  came up with a number that about the monthly active users which is a number you could argue  its value that both Twitter Facebook Instagram and others use to kind of say this is how  big we are.  The monthly active users somewhere around 23 million people on Google plus which sounds  like a lot until you say 200 million at Twitter 300 million at Instagram over a billion at  Facebook monthly active users 23 million.  It's not dead.  It's not dead.  That's a lot of people.  That's 23 million.  That's more people than watch our show.  But and we're not dead.  But it's yeah it's just not a scale of a Twitter or Facebook or even an Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now those are public posts right.  Now Google plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well he talks about that too this idea that maybe a lot of people are posting behind the  scenes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google plus is a place of stage fright.  When you post something on Google plus it's some I don't know why but it seems really  consequential.  People are timid about it.  Part of the reason is that people will jump on.  It's a very critical critical criticism oriented community.  And so anything you put time you post any anything you can say you know the sky is pretty  and people will jump on you to disagree about it.  So a lot of people are shy and I imagine that the vast majority of of engagement is not  public.  And there's no way for anybody to measure that unless you go through and take a poll  or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it also then doesn't matter.  And I mean that was the argument Google made when they launched which was oh well you can't  see there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes or whatever.  It's like fine.  For the most part if someone is trying to consider Google plus alongside other social  networks as a social media manager they don't see the value there.  And that's been demonstrated even from the height of Google doing everything they could  do to get you on to it.  And at this point Google doesn't even seem to be trying to convince the social media  managers that they should be doing stuff on Google plus.  I mean they really just really don't.  I mean it's not you know Beyonce is getting a free Google plus to wear on her wrist or  anything like that.  It's just you know it's it's whatever it's it's there and the tools are being spun out  or whatever.  And it's almost like we don't even want to talk about the Google plus as all streams  and photos or whatever and stuff like that.  From a consumer point of view I guess they still try to get you to sign up for it when  you when you get things.  But usually I see that stuff is like because you want your photos or you want this other  stuff and things like that.  And so the you know in the past and then the lastly the big lever that they really had  to let Google plus push beyond its weight had been the search results where they said  well you know authorship is all hooked up.  We're doing all these things and that got a lot of publishers to say all right I guess  it really is worth my time to do it when they took all that stuff away even though the Google  plus connection is still very strong for personalized search results.  And you know there's a there's a reason why people are connected with you.  You may do better with it.  Even that doesn't even seem to be working for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you know I'm actually I always come across like this you know Google plus can do no wrong  but that is not the case at all.  I think there's tons of room for criticism of Google plus.  But I think people criticize the wrong thing.  If you have any sort of hobby or enthusiasm I guarantee you go there and search for that  enthusiasm whether it's macrame or basket weaving or you know robot building or beer  brewing or whatever it is.  I don't care how obscure your enthusiasm is.  You're going to find a teaming community of active people passionate about it knowledgeable.  And by the way you can search Google plus.  Like hardly anybody criticizes Facebook which you can't even search.  You can't even search the social network and nobody says a word about it.  The problem with Google plus is that they're they're out ironically the algorithms are  horrible.  You go to the notifications and you're getting stuff in other languages like Google doesn't  even know I speak English.  Like how is that even possible.  I go in there and I get all this engagement and there's this thing at the top that says  show comments removed as spam.  They have an algorithm.  Right.  Twitter's in the news this week for introducing something like this that an algorithmically  based way.  Do you notice that's pretty accurate.  It's not accurate at all.  It's terrible.  They take they take in every post I have.  I see a lot of comments that are removed for no good reason.  Great comments from good people are flagged as spam.  Yeah.  And I have to spend a huge amount of time slogging through there and and re you know  deflagging or whatever you call it.  Yeah.  How is it possible that Google can't get that right after all these years.  These are the kinds of things that Google deserves massive criticism for.  But if you're a user who cares if social media managers use it or not if you have an  enthusiasm you want it and you're looking for a community to engage with over your  enthusiasm Google Plus is untouchable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that makes me sad because I go back to the well.  Yeah.  I've always wanted a place where people like me could get elites tech elite and talk and  not be flamed and not be trolled and have a great conversation.  Friend feed for that.  You know the well was briefly friend feed was that for me briefly.  Jaiqu was that for me briefly.  Google Plus had that promise.  Maybe there isn't going to be a place like that.  Maybe we don't need maybe you should just have regular friends in real life.  It's a concept I'm not sure I'm ready to absorb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I think I think Mike has an important point that if Google had seen it it is a very  good platform for communities as opposed to individual relationships.  And they didn't really take advantage of it.  They saw early days on with photography and they didn't do the right thing by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is Google Groups still here or is that gone?  Because that's really what is that's what Google Groups is.  Yeah they still have Google Groups.  They should have replaced Google Groups with Google Plus maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But give it a shot like search for anything search for a cup cake.  I know you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like there's a Baker's Group that you and I are both members of.  The art of bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The art of bread. It's phenomenal.  But that's a community.  But even if you don't use it like communities I think are a mixed bag.  But just just every every stream is a search result.  Yeah like the elegance of that is is there there's there's our cupcakes.  But I mean this is this is the cupcake community on Google Plus is just foaming in the mouth with enthusiasm.  It's like a really vibrant enthusiastic engaged community around anything.  And it's like it's not about good.  It's not about here's another cat photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it doesn't have to be exactly.  It's about your cupcakes.  Unlikely to see cats or are you you'll see cat cupcakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's my cupcake post there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What cupcakes with what?  Cupcakes that look like nachos.  Nacho cupcakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the hell?  Anyway 234 plus ones from my nacho cross in the streams and 43 reshares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not bad.  Yeah.  So I you know I have a full of chicken Super Bowl cupcakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No I think not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway so I think each of the social networks has something for you know there's there's a social network for you're going to get this exact argument for people who are Pinterest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's very Pinterest like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The difference though I mean and I agree with you.  If you whatever is your home that's good.  And if you're finding a place that's there that's wonderful.  You know but no one questions whether or not Pinterest sends lots of traffic.  And I mean they just don't not not not the people who are in charge of say doing social media because that's their profession and trying to reach out to audiences.  And I get that that's going to be different from necessarily the people who are trying to use it.  But they just don't question it.  You know Pinterest is a huge powerhouse with communities and with all this stuff as well.  So it's you know ultimately Google wanted despite whatever they want to talk about saying Google Plus was just a layer and all this stuff.  They wanted it to be a Facebook challenger.  They wanted to be a social destination and it's just not stepped up to being that kind of a challenger to these other things.  And so either they're out of that space or it's going to be some time until they figure out another way to approach it.  I don't know which those are.  That's not again to take away from the people who are there and that are active and doing everything.  But you know we got Facebook earnings going right now.  Facebook is making oodles and oodles of money off of social based advertising.  That's not money Google is making and that's Google money that they money that Google wants and they don't have a product to get it.  Yeah and I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean Google's rolled out all kinds of really.  Go ahead Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry I'm sorry for the lag here.  I think it's not.  I've been thinking about this lately.  Your reaction to this.  I don't think it's just social.  I think what Twitter has.  I mean what's what what Twitter has but what Facebook has is a street and getting somebody's attention for a time of the stream to keep strolling along and the chat communities and Twitter and all that.  But Facebook above all has the street.  That's where we want to get our content into it and our advertising into it.  And that's the value.  And Google doesn't have a stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well and that's what I was writing about.  This is what I did in March.  I wrote this thing called the Web of Streams and I was talking about how when we got that new name that suddenly was photos and streams and it was like yeah you're right.  You have an Instagram stream.  You got a Facebook stream.  You got a Facebook stream.  You know you can argue to some degree that Snapchat when you go through it you have a stream that's kind of going there and Yahoo's trying to do stream and it's like what's the Google stream.  Well you know I think Google's best stream actually is YouTube and going back to what you said Leo where the kids my kids will do the same thing.  They load up YouTube and it just goes boom boom boom boom boom.  But then I think where Google misses is that that's not the case when you're on say mobile where you know they might not I think just let the mobile let you to keep playing on the mobile device.  I just haven't seen that kind of behavior.  Maybe it's going off.  But what I kind of wonder is that they couldn't roll out what I called YouTube gram or something like that.  Basically you know you're flipping through and it's all short form form video.  Google had the technology and just didn't years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was incredible.  And they could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's that's different than the short form videos that are popular with Vine or that are popular with Instagram where I can consume this video on a mobile device.  And it's 15 seconds and I'm done.  And when you do it in those small amounts it also means it's very easy for advertisers to come along and say oh by the way we're going to insert this as well.  And they don't have that sort of thing for YouTube because there's just no division of it.  And there's no there's no strong thing I think on mobile to go I'm bored.  I just want to flip through YouTube stuff and be entertained and I need to keep channel swapping or whatever.  I think that's an opportunity for them if they get it together.  But well they're going the wrong direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean originally Google Plus used to auto update.  You could set up any sort of stream any sort of search any sort of any of your circles and it would just sit there and every time you go to YouTube.  It would just sit there and every time there's a new item would just chunk through.  I used to have Google Plus take up one third of my screen and it would just sit there full time and then they did a redesign and it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the late lamented track feature from Twitter going back maybe seven years.  Twitter used to have this thing where you track a topic.  Yeah.  And when they took it out was actually was early in the days of Twitter.  We were very much involved in the in the in the Steve Gilmore's bear hug movement to get track back in Twitter movement that was ill fated because they never did bring it back.  Yeah.  There is something about that kind of thing.  I don't know why it seems like that's something Google would embrace.  But yeah.  What.  So what is clearly if you're a company like Google you don't want to say we're going to chase after the app of the moment.  That's crazy.  And but maybe you don't have the people that can create the next big gap.  Maybe that's not where those people end up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I personally think the problem with Google Plus is that all the vision left with Vic and Dottra.  I think what happened was there was a massive bloody world war within Google between Sundar Pichai and Vic and Dottra and Sundar Pichai won and Vic and Dottra left.  And so now they're grinding salt in Vic and Dottra's fields.  What is Vic doing these days.  He is living off the fat of the land as far as I can tell.  He's still active on Google Plus.  But as far as I know he hasn't hasn't taken a new gig.  Right.  Even as a VC.  But I mean Vic and Dottra was on this and backed by Larry Page was on this this sort of crusade to integrate every single Google property into Google Plus.  And it was the it was the internal politics that enabled him to start to achieve that.  And there was so much pushback internally.  And someday somebody should write a book Jeff Jarvis about what happened.  But basically he ended up losing that battle and they've been since just decoupling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way almost exactly a year ago April 24th 2014.  So almost to the day one year ago that Vic and Dottra left Google Plus.  And I think it has been at least a year since there was any change to Google Plus at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There have been changes here and there.  Pretty small stuff.  And some of them not good.  For example they they they they have on the real name policy and that kind of that kind of combination of that.  First they did.  Yeah.  The combination of continuing to be integrated with YouTube and also having real real names made Google Plus a lot more like YouTube in terms of crap comments.  And so the comments you have to be more vigilant in order to weed out the lousy nonsensical comments nowadays because of those two changes.  Those are not necessarily a change for the better.  I think if Google Plus had started out with no real names policy you know when when when when people were clamoring for it they should have done it.  They didn't.  And they waited till nobody cared anymore.  And then they enacted the real names policy.  It's just the timing was just way off.  And so anyway I just think it has a lot more to do with what's happening internally at Google and less to do with Google's true strategic objectives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's Kremlin ology looking at what the result is to figure out what's going on inside a black box.  Apparently according to Bloomberg Businessweek Elon Musk had a deal to sell Tesla to Google in 2013.  I don't know if it was it widely known that Tesla and this is from Ashley Vance's book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the quest for a fantastic future.  Was it widely known that in 2013 Tesla was almost bankrupt.  I don't think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not to my knowledge it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to the book.  Danny Sullivan would know if anybody did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If they were going to do Tesla.  I would know that they were going to be bankrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had a profit in May 8th 2013.  That was their first profit announcement and weeks before according to Ashley Vance they had been on the verge of bankruptcy struggling to turn pre-orders into actual sales.  Musk put his staff on a crisis footing to save Tesla and began negotiating with Larry Page a deal to sell the company to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now it's possible that more is being made of this than the events merit.  How so?  Well Ashley Vance is selling a book and this is an excerpt from the book.  And essentially as he says in the excerpt Elon Musk and Larry Page are personal friends.  Right.  Could have been over a drink.  They said you know what let's get together and see if there's anything here.  Obviously the deal didn't happen.  So you don't know if they were in negotiations and they were on the brink of buying Tesla.  Or if they chit-chatted and said no no it will pass.  Those are two very different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The story says that Musk wanted 6 billion plus a commitment for 5 billion in capital to expand factories.  Probably would have been in hindsight would have been I don't know would have been a good deal.  $11 billion I don't know if Tesla's justified that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it will be eventually.  Yeah.  I mean I called two years ago for Apple to buy it.  I think that would be a cool purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there were a lot of rumors that that was about to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they've never ceased but I just want to own an Apple Tesla somehow.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to take a break come back with more.  How about building your own Apple Tesla with little bits.  Could you do that.  I don't know.  I have the little bit.  It's deluxe kit.  It sure does a lot.  Five million possible circuit combinations 15 projects in a box.  You know in triangulation on Monday we talked to the producer and director of a new film called coding debugging the gender gap in technology.  And one of the things she said and I completely agree with her is part of the solution is to give kids boys and girls access to things like little bits.  Get them.  She actually mentioned little bits by name because little bits is so accessible and so much fun that it can get your kid into electronics projects.  The little bits deluxe kit comes with a great book and a description of all the different pieces.  The pulse the sound trigger the time out the fork.  What's neat about these is you can't put them together wrong.  There's no soldering.  So you get you kind of have immediate gratification even for a doofus like me.  When you're when you're putting them together right they snap together but the magnets in here will prevent you from putting them together wrong.  And so it's easy enough to come up with just a kid of your own or to follow the instructions.  I think what will happen is and by the way color coding tells you what each part does.  So pink modules affect the modules after them.  The blue modules of the power.  There's a power module.  The green modules are activities.  They do something.  So for instance this green module is a speaker.  This is the pulse.  I think I've just invented something incredible.  We'll just plug it in and see what happens.  You all it's so cool.  I want you to try these out.  A great gift for kids whether they're yours nephews or nieces even parents coders hardware hackers makers artists and designers love little bits.  You can get your dog to text.  Yes you can.  Or make a robotic snack server.  Why buy electronic toys or gadgets when you can build your own invent them yourself.  There are over 60 modules that can be used in a virtually limitless creative combinations.  I just think the idea whether your kids going to become a maker or not the idea that the kid understands a little bit better how things fit together.  You just can't go wrong with this and you may be lucky because you may get a kid who goes wow I think I've got an idea for something.  I'm going to call the hyper loop the base and deluxe kits great way to get started space kit was worked on in partnership with NASA.  So it's a great way to explore earth and space science.  There is an Arduino coding kit for kids who are ready to start programming.  We love the Arduino.  Now the deluxe kit that I've got has 18 modules they snap together with billions of circuits no wiring or soldering and you can make something in seconds.  There's a synth kit kids who like to make music and make sound and make noise love the synth kit.  And of course Arduino is great for anybody who wants to program and manipulate the outside world.  I just think these are so great.  Now we're going to give you $20 off your first kit when you go to little bits dot com little bits dot com slash twig plus free shipping in the US L I T T L E little B I T S bits dot com slash twig.  Everyone can build electronics and learn about them with little bits and $20 off your first order makes it even more little bit of little bit of little bits dot com slash twig.  And if you make something would you Instagram me Mr. Underscore Laporte and I would I'd love to share.  I haven't actually checked but I would love to see there's some little bits projects from our Twitter listeners our twig listeners.  There's not a health kit yet.  But that must be just a matter of time.  So you had this story in search engine land the story of the man who put Edward Snowden's den secret den inside the White House Danny what how how did that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's actually a really interesting story.  So you know what a reader tip this to it saying check this out or whatever and we looked at it and it's not unusual you might find a weird thing on Google Maps.  It's unusual when you find a weird thing that's been verified by Google.  That listing was literally like Google verifies.  This is Edward Snowden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way it looks where the Oval Office is to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah it actually is not where the Oval is because I had to go look it up.  I thought it was too because it's all curry like that.  The Oval Office is actually in the West Wing.  I think you'll see another curvy bit.  So I got to learn a little White House geography.  Yeah exactly.  That was my first thing.  In fact my headline originally I was started to write Oval Office like oh wait a minute.  So by the way it's gone now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What happened was there's a guy named Brian Seely and I did a follow up interview.  It might be linked at the end of this story or you can search for him by the name.  There it is.  So you might recall about a year ago this thing came out where Google maps.  Somebody had made listings for the FBI and the Secret Service on Google that were verified  and people started calling them to leave tips and things.  That was this guy Brian Seely who basically was doing this because he's frustrated that  Google does not take the security of their search listings more relevant or more strict.  Seriously yeah.  And so he did a Ted Talk the week before this latest thing happened and he set this whole  thing up so that he could show as part of his Ted Talk in Kirkland in Washington state  how you can go through and do this.  Let me talk about Mike's because we're a verified listing the Twitter brick house and the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it worked is I created the listing in Google Places and then they say OK so we can verify  this by sending you a postcard.  Right.  And so they sent a postcard to that address and it had a code on it and I went back in  and I entered the code and now that at least proves that I have access to mail at that  address.  That seems like a fairly good way to verify it.  There are other ways but that's I think the simplest.  So how did he get around that?  They also got your phone number right?  That's where it goes wrong.  You've got to verify by phone number or mailing address whatever so you do the verification

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  by postcard.  It comes to the physical address.  You've got this little pin code.  You call in and you enter the code and they go OK well someone clearly was at that address  to get the mail and that's what he did.  Right.  And then you delete the listing or you don't delete the listing you delete your ownership  over that listing and you leave it all alone right with the phone number that was also  part of it.  So he made a listing that went somewhere he like his house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He had it like a local real place.  A real place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK.  So then after you've kind of released it and let the listing be an orphan you go back home  with a new Google account and you claim it and you claim it and because then you have  to re-verify it you re-verify it using the phone number which you still control.  Right.  Once you've re-verified it with the phone number you can move that listing all the way  across the country if you want to which is exactly what he did.  You know and if you look at the number at the time the number was a 206 it was the Seattle  phone number.  In Washington DC.  Yeah.  So that's how you ended up with this Seattle phone number for Edward Snowden being in the  White House.  And so he was it was interesting because after it happened I didn't know who did it.  I thought maybe it was that same thing and I remember being on vacation when the other  stuff had broken up about the secret service and then he called out on me at Twitter he's  like yeah I'm the guy who did it.  So I called him to the quick interview with him from there.  But you know what's interesting to me is that you know we went back to Google PR and Google  PR is like oh yeah this is like a minor thing and you know rarely happens and you know there's  a few people and we you know patch things up whatever and he's like yeah they knew about  this whole before I did the secret service stuff then they closed it for six weeks after  it then they reopened it again.  So it's still sitting out there.  And you know I do think there's some validity to the fact that it speaks to Google not maybe  doing the effort that they could do with local.  You know it's just it's one of those Google likes to do things at scale.  They want everything to be automated and everything to be happen and all it's just magically  come together whatever.  And local seem to be one of those things where actually it might be useful to have a lot of  people involved with it both from working with the local businesses and getting them online  to making sure the information is verified or whatever.  And until they make that kind of a commitment I think you're going to have you know these kinds  of weird oddities come up.  Now you know most people don't see them happening I suppose.  So but still you know it is strange that you could let that sort of thing go through especially  when you knew about it over a year before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I so I could release my tweet thing and I could then and it's still the hole still there right.  Yeah the loophole still there.  So I could release this move tweet into the White House rename it.  Yeah the White House podcast studio.  And they would phone me and I would verify it and it'd be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who do you want to put Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Twitch should be in Langley at the CIA headquarters or maybe in McLean at the NSA headquarters  or that new facility they just built in Utah.  Now the downside the downside for you of course is once you do that it's going to burn your listing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and you can't afford to do it.  But what his real concern is not that people are doing it with these real attention grabbing things  but they're doing it with smaller listings for fake businesses and they're actually making real  money off of it.  How would they make money off of it.  Well you could set up a business as if you were a locksmith in a location where you don't actually have a location.  You could potentially pretend to be another business and let it get burned after you pulled in some people  who are calling saying I want this business to come out right.  I imagine you make a fake listing for a florist or whatever and then you put it next to some other florist  and then you start getting phone calls.  People think they're calling that actual florist.  You're like oh yeah yeah I'll send that out to you.  What do you want whatever.  Now you kind of hijack their customers that thought they were reaching the other place or your pizza joint or whatever.  And you know so there are things that could be done if you're really kind of going at it.  And they're the kind of people who will go through and do that sort of stuff.  So that's the real concern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trolls could use it to troll basically.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Also people who are in a business where there's just one person and they're competing against a big company  they could make it seem like they are also a big company when in fact it's just somebody in a basement somewhere.  Microsoft support right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know you put your thing out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know I could maybe kind of sympathize a little bit with Google that the damage is kind of not as de minimis in most cases.  I can't think of a serious.  We don't know that because we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  They tell us that these things are very really rare.  There's other guys like they're not rare and I'm really concerned about it.  And so you know the truth may lie in there somewhere between.  But it's it's you know it doesn't seem difficult to say to Google hey if someone like tried to chase your address  and it's like moving it from five miles from where it was before maybe you ought to just send out another postcard.  It's how hard is it right.  I mean it's the old you know routine did point on map get moved more than five miles outside where it was trigger remove verification.  Send renew verification postcard.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When is it I think back to the future day is this year isn't it.  Is it October.  Coming up.  Pretty soon.  Quartz has a great article went back to the future got right about tech in 2015.  Flat screen TVs yes video calling believe it or not we're actually doing that biometrics 3D we don't have self tying shoelaces.  Well we do but they're just expensive.  Yeah.  And we have yet to have drones they got right but we have yet to get the the floating hoverboard programmable home.  So here's a Google path this also from Quartz a Google patent a patent does not mean they're making it folks.  But they have patented reactive paint that could actually turn a wall painted with photoreactive paint into a screen.  Yeah.  This would use a projector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is actually a wider trend that I see happening there's actually a child's product called the Lumo interactive projector and it basically projects things onto a floor or a wall.  And then kids can interact with it it's a touch display on the floor the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what HoloLens is going to end up doing.  Yeah exactly.  Microsoft augmented reality.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Microsoft has a patent for Illuma room.  Remember that which is projects peripheral vision gameplay content on the walls and ceilings and floors when you're using Xbox.  I think that this is in of course the vision videos from Microsoft and Samsung are loaded with this kind of thing using walls and windows and desks and floors and surfaces as the next interface.  I think this is going to be so great when this happens.  Like I you know I want the whole wall to be like a computer screen.  I just think that's the coolest idea.  We already have the technology we just don't have it at a cost that's ready for the mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see this is I'm going to skip this out here and show you this is from Philco Ford.  They made this in 1966 what life will be like in 1999 A.D.  And it's actually the most depressing dystopic version of life this poor kids school.  Oh there's your computer by the way menu Tuesday screens.  Multiscreen turning knobs and this poor kid.  This is the kids school.  He's all alone in a room.  Yeah.  And he flunks his test and he has to now go over to the other.  Apparently there's one massive computer in the middle of the house.  Yeah.  And the poor kid has to go over to the other computer turn a knob and go sit down at the other computer and take the lecture again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Little do they know in reality he'd be like flipping over to PewDiePie on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But PewDiePie they did not predict PewDiePie I can tell you that.  Here's mom of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that'd be much better.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mom likes to cook and flowers of course is 66.  So it's an incredibly sexist vision to put the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually that's not correct.  What was happening there was mom's actually a work at home developer and she's been working on this menu app.  And she is interacting with it right there.  We can reinterpret this and make the future be the way the future should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The plates are coming down out of the things.  That's just.  Apparently the future is very physical and knob oriented.  Yeah.  Look at that carpet.  Shag carpeting.  They haven't solved that one.  By the way is Philco still around?  I don't think they.  This is it's dinner time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow that is depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is the most depressing view of the future I have ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's interesting that almost all of the future visions involve like the computer was a knob turning interface.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well that's what they knew right.  Look at dad on his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And now the man is going to balance the budget.  Yeah.  It probably is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at all the knobs he has to turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Again to be clear that is simply her assistant who is back at the office.  Who is taking her.  He's received her programming instructions that she has created because she is the programmer.  He is merely the key entry person.  Yes.  Who will be putting this in there.  Look at the stylus.  That's why she works at home by the way because she has been so successful that she can just do the stuff where she wants and this guy has to just take care of these things for her.  More knobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other thing is that the computers are specialized so there's a shopping computer and then there's a you know.  And so they didn't envision that you could do a million times more than this with a smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The person who did this really didn't have much of a grasp of the present let alone the future.  This is a patch bay and knobs.  Maybe maybe Philco was in the knob business.  Right.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was a great the great knob collapse of 1968.  It was tragic.  You might recall you to go into the stores and there used to be the big knob testing things that you get back to test machines.  So if you didn't have the right knob you could kind of put it in there and you know but now we have 3D printing.  Oh the.  Oh here we do some working out.  Good job.  Yeah.  There's his off hours.

Transcript:  Oh my God.  I don't know if this is good.  This doesn't look good.  What is going on.  He's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's been trying to get his hand.  He's getting a tan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  This is on it.  This is on YouTube.  This is the grimace division of the future I have ever ever now.  He's refreshed.  Seen from.  It's from Philco Ford.  You could search for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean that could be my desktop with just the screen.  But not the not the rest.  They had big screens.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh what's his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  He looks familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well they got my haircut right.  That's that's why I got it right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was just bringing up a map to go to Pebble Beach.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is what I imagine the computer scene in North Korea looks like.  What's his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's his name.  Wink Martindale.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chat room got that one.  Wink Martindale Lars in Michigan.  I knew you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to have to get about two strokes aside because I haven't been playing all winter and I'm a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This could really be mystery science future computer 4000.  We'll just do the narration of it.  We should.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Meanwhile back at the office the home office she's wondering why he still hasn't finished the things that she's demanded.  Oh well she's making a pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a it's a 3D printer.  3D printing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Look at the lovely pots she's been making.  She's a talented artist.  That one on the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These will all be rendered into the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to know what kind of pots they were smoking.  Yeah.  This video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't it fun.  This is what parties in 1999 will look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those are the party knobs.  What are they going to do there?  Oh I remember this scene from Logan's Run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is this where Jessica six peers and oh I didn't mean to put myself on the circuit.  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bungos of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They spent so much money.  I do not have the words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Making this piece of junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know this is another aspect of human nature that futurists always get wrong.  For example when they invented the telephone they thought people in the country would listen to opera over the telephone.  The thing is that people don't stop and pay attention to things if it's not live.  Only live music causes everybody to stop talking face the music.  If it's recorded or just on a projector people just talk to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other thing that is clearly wrong that you can see here is that no one is using their phones to take pictures of the screen.  Or themselves.  There's no hashtag being displayed.  How do I even know what I'm supposed to say about this?  Where should I post this?  Although that could be...  Should be saying Longo Tuesday.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That could be Jeff Needles in Havana like meerkatting this to the back home.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Alright there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the home of the future year 1999 A.D.  That's beautiful.  From Philco Ford.  Boy he's hitting some high notes there.  In the future men will sing like women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  At this point they ran out of futuristic things so they're like just go long on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now we bring on the conga group let them sing for 12 minutes and we're done.  Yeah that'll be done.  This damn thing had to go 15 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ricky Ricardo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People still applaud in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The women in the future have I dream of Jeannie hairdos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they applaud when something's on TV.  It's like why did anybody think that would ever happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's two way.  Hey it was two way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At least they're racially integrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was impressed by that actually.  It is very integrated there.  Oh it's gone now.  What's the 1920s what the future will look like?  Oh well I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go even farther back in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love the future from the pre 18th century future where everybody has a personal dirigible.  This we're doing right now what we were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're working here and we're watching a stream of YouTube videos one after the other.  And YouTube did the right thing by the way which is instead of showing me a grid of possible videos to watch featuring women in bikinis.  They've actually segued into another video.  I don't know when they changed that but that's something that does encourage that kind of just sit here and watch the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is the future aka 1930 or 1940.  By 1940 dirigible trains will have propellers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By 1950.  Oh well that's true.  We saw that in DC.  The guy just flew the gyrocopter.  So let's go.  And the channel tunnel exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Channel tunnel or carpal tunnel.  I thought he was entering the carpal tunnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He pulled down the table and all the plates were already there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the future the tables already set.  What's that?  The gun went off a little prematurely I think.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is terrifying.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a lady robot.  That's just animation.  This is frozen.  By 1960.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Boy they really nailed the 60s.  Gears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pistons.  And buildings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh I wish this vision.  A lot of spotlights.  That's what happened in San Francisco.  They built a bunch of elevated freeways which they've seen torn down.  They got the traffic jammed right?  So ugly.  Traffic jammed right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there will be biplanes everywhere in the city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Flying all over.  Drones.  Drones.  You can't fly with just one set of wings.  Come on.  Come on.  This is a crazy town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh what year is this?  This is definitely the far future.  This is still 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Madonna is being anticipated early on.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's the sleeves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does it?  Apparently in AD 2000 we should be having a hair raising time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'll still talk with that phony Hollywood accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The same thing in the Philco Ford from 1960s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They all have that kind of weird pseudo British accent.  Why did they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well they got climatic changes.  They look at they.  They were talking about global warming in the 20s.  Well they knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The future bride in a wedding dress of glass.  A wedding dress of glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The future bride in a wedding dress of glass.  Aluminium.  Aluminium.  Well they got that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Johnny Ives says it like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Electric headlights in her hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would kill if her wife comes out now to get married to her.  That would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Containers for coins, keys and candy for cuties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is he wearing on his head?  And isn't he needed back at the Game of Thrones dressing room right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Any period of history is a direct outcome of the social, economic and technical conditions then existing.  Cities of the future would be laid out to a master plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The show is completely devolved.  I don't know. This has nothing to do with Twig.  I think it's completely fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to stop right now and move on.  I think there's a whole other show here.  Watching YouTube videos.  Google Glass 2.0. This is a patent from...  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What?  No, I just can't even look at it.  Like I was thinking the other day, am I ever going to turn them on again?  It looks like you're looking into the glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They move the prism to the left and then they put the camera on the right.  That fixes it all.  I think that what would fix it would eliminate the...  It's just balancing out the dorkiness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry.  I was too leaned over with dork this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now it's fine.  Oh Lord.  What would fix it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To make the camera removable.  The problem that everybody has is the camera.  For people who want notifications, if they can shrink that prism down to the point where it's almost indistinguishable  and make the camera either optional or non-existent, it would be great.  You'd have notifications. You'd be able to see things.  But until they...  As long as it's...  Well, the other thing is that the tech press was proven hypocritical about the camera.  But he said it was an invasion of privacy.  But the second Meerkat hit, all those same journalists were out there filming everything in sight.  Just like they had their glass on.  Doing exactly what they said Google Glass would enable people to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Meerkat would be the perfect app for Google Glass.  Wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey Danny, is this new on Google?  You enter in a geometric equation like X times sine Y.  A giant calculator?  And you do a search for it and it gives you the graph?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't keep track now.  It's from Wolfram Alpha, I think.  They probably had that for a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's kind of cool.  I think so.  Yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do all my math on Google now.  It's usually a little less complicated than that.  It's usually like 5 divided by 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't use sine calculations much in your checkbook.  Sometimes I like to do a little infinite number testing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But for the most part, I just stick with basic arithmetic.  That's wild.  I only got 5, 10 fingers.  That's a search result.  That's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty amazing.  The other interesting search result is that if you lose your Android phone, you can search for it on Google.  You can Google it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do I do?  What am I going to do to Google my phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I lost my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You type find my phone in a Google search.  Find my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't work for me.  You have to sign in again to get your phone's location.  I'm going to sign in again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Then it will screw up because if you have multiple apps or if you have Google apps, it doesn't like it.  I can see which phone too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a list of phones.  I'd love to know where my Nexus 6 is.  I really want to start using that for PHY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, because you sold it years ago.  I'm wondering where it is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who has my Nexus 6 now?  No, actually it's at home.  I'm glad I kept it.  There it is.  There you go.  There's my Nexus 7 right there.  It's in my hand.  It's right next to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't even know I had a phone.  What's an XT1058?  That's the Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  So there's the OnePlus One.  There's the Moto E.  A couple of Samsung phones.  The Moto X.  GTP3113.  You should have renamed them when you had them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just so hard.  I know.  It's almost like when you're dealing with your Kindle.  It's a sixth Android device.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just installed something on my 47th Kindle.  Yeah.  My 47th Kindle.  I don't know how that happened.  Every time you install the Kindle app, it counts as one, I guess.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's good to know I have 47 Kindles somewhere.  I just want to run down, make sure we get all of these before we wrap it up  and get our tips and tricks and numbers of the week in here.  What are their big stories?  Oh, let's give Jeff Jarvis a chance to raise his blood pressure real quickly.  The French government.  Whoa.  What?  That's all you have to say.  The French.  I had to wake up Jeff.  The French Senate back sped to force Google to disclose how its search algorithm works.  Next, they'll be asking Coke what its secret formula is.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they admit that it's not legal within EU law, so it's ridiculous.  So it's just another show trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they can't even, even if they voted to do that, they can't do it.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.  This is the French Senate.  They haven't approved the law, but this is a bill approved by the French Senate.  And the other part of it that's really wonderful is that they would require Google to offer direct searches or links from Google.com,  the homepage, which Google doesn't put anything on there mostly, to three competing search engines.  And one of those competing search engines has to be a French search engine.  Are there any?  There are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But then the French sold their search technology that the government held back like Quario over to, I mean, it's really going back in time.  But yeah.  Oh yeah.  Voila. Does Voila still exist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does.  It does.  It's the number one search engine in France.  Of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yes.  V-O-L-A-N-T-E?  Just Voila.  No, it's not.  Oh, Voila.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, when you say it's the number one French engine in France, you're joking, right?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the highest traffic search engine that is owned by a French company.  Right, right.  So that's a slight difference.  Yeah, it's not.  Between that and being the number one search engine.  It's not bigger than any search engine that people have heard of.  Voila.  Mais sorti.  Yeah.  And so this is the absurdity.  This would be required to be on Google.com.  Yeah.  It's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, look how you spell oops in French.  O-U-P-S.  Oops.  So, si vous le savez, c'est un dollar.  A d'autres, non trouvé.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To some degree, that's what Google used to do, right?  And actually, you don't really.  This is the stupidity of, say, lawmakers.  Well, we'll put it on the Google homepage because not as many people who search on Google  actually go to Google at the homepage.  They actually just get to it because they did their search from Chrome or everything.  So what they really want is that these would be listed, say, at the bottom of Google search  results, which people with long memories will remember.  And they were a little tiny search engine.  They used to say, also try your search on Allsta Vista or Excite or all these other  things.  I'm in an oops loop.  And you know what?  If I were Google, I'd be like.  Loop being spelled L-O-U-P.  Yeah.  You want us to put it there?  Fine.  We'll put it there.  Because when we were a tiny little search engine, no one wanted to use it.  We linked out to bigger competitors.  And that didn't seem to hurt us becoming the big thing you worry about.  So yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, the irony, of course, is that Leo found voila by Googling it, which really  wasn't that hard.  Let's be honest.  Voila.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's far.  This does not seem to be a new story, but maybe I'm missing something.  According to the unofficial Google operating system blog, you can now export your Google  web history, your saved search history.  Couldn't you do that all along with takeout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought so, but apparently not.  It wasn't one of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.  So it's an expanse of Google.  Google takeout is awesome.  And it seems to me that it's not such a big deal that you can get this because for a long  time, if you go to your Google dashboard, google.com slash dashboard, you've seen all  the things Google takes, keeps track of, and you can download it all.  Although it's one big XML file.  I don't know what the hell you do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it deals with probably a proactive thing where Google can anticipate someone saying,  oh, I can't get my Google search history out.  You're being anti-competitive.  And it really is sort of an oversight.  So yeah, people want to take it out.  Now you get that too.  Now you get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My advice for what you should do with it is delete it.  Get rid of the evidence for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me see if I do google.com slash dashboard.  So these are all the things that Google knows about you, including location history and stuff.  So is it search history?  Is that what I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's easier just to search for Google web history on Google.  You could never find where the dang thing is.  There you found it.  Yeah, search history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can, by the way, disable this.  You can remove search history items.  And if you wish, you can use Google takeout and download it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did this, by the way, like two days ago, and I'm still waiting for it to actually generate  this archive I'm supposed to get.  So...  Well, that's another problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I keep asking Twitter for an archive of my tweets, and they've never done it.  Never.  Not once.  So...  MobileGeddon we did.  Is there an update to Chrome OS?  Somebody was saying that Chrome OS was updated.  I guess it's updated all the time.  What's the news there?  Certification program for cardboard clones.  That's a story from the future.  In the year 2015, cardboard clones will be certified by a company called Google.  Oh my gosh, you're doing that voice is great.  If you'd written that story, people would have said, what the hell?  A company named Google has announced a certification program for cardboard clones.  Here we see the young Maureen O'Hara trying her cardboard clone.  What are the cardboard clones?  A lot of companies make these, right?  Dodo Case made one almost right away.  LG is making one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say, by the way, I went up to F8, and I was using the...  Because Oculus is coming, right?  So they had the little Oculus thing, and they had where you could try on the Galaxy VR gear, whatever it is.  And you pop in a Note 4.  Yeah, but you had to have a Note 4.  What?  It only worked with the Note 4.  And then you had to pay all this expensive thing to put it on the Note 4.  Then the Note 4 got too hot.  It was essentially cardboard.  It was cool, but yeah, it was an expensive thing to put on an expensive phone.  Here's a hat mount for your cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now that is awesome.  That's the future. That is the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your hat will have a virtual reality helmet built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Feeling lost? Put on your baseball hat. You will see the world in a whole other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A map will leap to view.  Wow.  So this is it. This is the new logo. Works with Google Cardboard.  That is the most down market search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A baseball coming at them now. Oh, and it's going back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so down market.  Yes, works with Google Cardboard.  Next, we'll be working with Google Pasteboard.  Soon, Corkboard.  Don't root your Galaxy S6 Edge, Danny Sullivan.  We knew this, but Knox will stop working as well as Samsung Wallet.  OnePlus One no longer needs an invite. It's got invite free.  Just in the nick of time for nobody to care.  Exactly.  Nice timing, OnePlus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Strung us along for a long time. You've got to give them credit for that.  Now nobody wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And by the way, if you're going to tell me that I can finally get your phone,  but the next one is going to be invite free, then I don't want your phone.  I want the next phone. So screw you double.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. They've really got to work on their marketing message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have never done anything well in terms of marketing, ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Osborne 2 problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, the Osborne themselves.  This is an interesting story in Wired. I don't know how much this is.  Kyle Weins is writing this, who is, by the way, if it's the same Kyle Weins,  I think it is, the guy in charge of iFixit, founder of iFixit.  He has pointed out that John Deere and General Motors are planning to change  the agreement they have with owners.  They have submitted comments to the Copyright Office saying that because  computer code is so heavily written throughout your entire tractor that  they wish to be able to say that you, when you buy a John Deere tractor,  do not buy the tractor, but an implied license for the life of the vehicle  to operate the vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He discovered this when a friend of his, he was checking out there incredibly,  these are incredibly high-tech tractors.  They drive themselves practically. They're tied into GPS.  And his friend, because he's a very technical person, asked him to help him  tinker with it, and he discovered that they don't let you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is not unusual, the diagnostic computers are sealed up.  Exactly.  You have to buy very expensive equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it turns out that there are laws for cars around repairability and stuff  like that that don't apply to tractors.  So what happens is they subsidize, this is kind of an Amazon-style business model,  they sell the tractors at essentially below cost, knowing that they're going to  make a bundle on the servicing because they don't let the farmers do the  servicing themselves. And so it's a racket, essentially.  Wow.  This is a really interesting feature that he wrote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is just an example of the DMCA gone wild.  Yeah.  Crazy. Good article. You've got to read it to Kyle Weins writing in Wired  magazine, it's online at wired.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, that's crazy. That would be like saying you bought Star Wars on digital  and you don't own it, even though you thought you were buying it on digital.  Oops, wait, you don't actually own it.  Oh, you don't actually own it.  Well, maybe like buying a book on Amazon.  Kindle, maybe.  Kindle and thinking, I own the book.  But you're telling me I only have a license for the book?  Yeah, no, I only have a license for the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's especially frustrating is that these tractors cost two, three,  four hundred thousand dollars. They are just amazingly expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they're still selling them for a less than cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the point is that they're able to reduce the cost of the tractor itself  because it's like if you buy a car, they're making more on the financing plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's almost as if you bought an inkjet printer and you had to use the ink from  the inkjet printer from the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it'd be almost like that. Wouldn't that be awful?  That'd be terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like if you bought a coffee maker and you could only use pods from a coffee  company that made the coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But look at how cheap printers are and how expensive ink is.  It's the same model. But he's leading this whole cause.  You can do something. If you want to get involved, go check out this article.  And he'll lead you to a site where there's petitions and so on because he  considers himself a right to repair activist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I love Kyle. And he's fighting God's fight there on that one.  That's good for you, Kyle Weins.  Read the article and then write your member, your Kyrus critter, I guess.  So what's going on with the Android Wear?  Because as Apple Watch comes out day after tomorrow, the first Apple Watches  will start arriving at people's homes.  And of course, one of the things Apple Watch has is Wi-Fi, which is cool because  it means you can leave your phone anywhere in the Wi-Fi network and the watch will  continue to work.  According to Mike Elgin on Tech News Today.  Yeah, it's a great source.  I heard you talking about this.  The next version of Android Wear will support not only Wi-Fi, but the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the thing that's cool is that if your phone is at home and on your home  Wi-Fi network, you can be at work in the future because this isn't backward  compatible with older Android Watches.  You can't use it with existing.  This will be for upcoming Android Wear watches.  But you can be on your work Wi-Fi network and your watch will talk to your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It uses the public Internet to communicate with your phone, not just your Wi-Fi network.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's different from the Apple Watch.  You have to be on the same network.  Exactly.  So that is a really cool improvement.  They also added a new gesture, a sort of wrist flicking gesture to move from one car  to another and a couple of other options.  And you can now draw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have handwriting recognition for emojis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the big thing is the Wi-Fi because this is something, you know, you go to the gym  and you don't want to be carrying your phone around.  You can leave it in the locker and still use it as if it's on your person.  I love that.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So now we had heard originally that maybe Wi-Fi would, that Wi-Fi was a capability of  the existing Android Wear watches.  That's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it is on one or two of them, but most of them do not have that.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, a lot of them do.  Moto 360, it was guessed that it wouldn't.  And it in fact does.  The LG G Watch does not, but the G Watch R.  The new one does.  Yeah.  So if I have a Moto 360, I could get a software update that would enable this Wi-Fi capability.  You have 360, you will get a software update that will enable Wi-Fi.  Is that 5.1?  Motorola has said that about Moto 360.  5.2, do we know where this is happening?  I don't know.  I mean, that's the next update, which is supposed to come sometime in the next couple of weeks.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Crazy.  Yeah.  They're fighting it out over my wrist.  You're going to have one watch on each wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to have two phones, two watches.  Yep.  You have two arms.  No, you won't need two phones.  Leave your phone at home.  Carry the iPhone.  You don't need any phones.  Wear both watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the neat thing about that.  Yeah.  All right.  Great.  It's good.  As always, competition is very good for end users.  So that's really great news.  All right.  Let's take a break.  When we come back, your tip, your tool, your number, we will wrap this up with the back  of the book.  Mike Elgin is here, our news director.  He is of course the host of TNT Tech News Tonight every Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to Pacific  1 p.m. Eastern, 1700 UTC.  Got to watch that.  Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com, that mobile, unready site.  He is also the author of Public Parts, What Will Google Do?, Gutenberg the Geek, and his  latest Geeks Bearing Gifts.  Always great to have Jeff, our professor, Professor Jarvis.  And Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land, who's probably been watching this search engine  scene for longer than anybody else.  Search Engine Land has always been the place to go to get the latest on what's going on  with Google.  They also have Marketing Land.  Is it Marketing Land or Marketing Engine Land?  Marketing Land.  There's no engine in marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can merge them all together.  My friend was like, don't you work for Search Engine Marketing Land?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, obviously an avid snowboarder.  Yes, that's my Bing snowboard actually.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at that.  A Bing snowboard.  Sometimes people are like, you've got all that Google stuff.  You're so Google.  I'm like, no, it's just you can't see it says Bing.  It's so big you can't see the Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He uses that 20% of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's got a board that says Bing.  Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.  It's so funny.  I watch House of Cards at the end.  Images courtesy Shutterstock.  Really?  Movies more and more.  I'm seeing images courtesy of Shutterstock.  So what I realized, what are they doing?  Shutterstock offers, of course, it's the place to get more than 52 million high quality stock  images, illustrations, vectors, but they also have millions of video clips.  And I realized if you're doing House of Cards and you need an aerial shot of Washington,  D.C., you're not going to hire a helicopter.  You're going to go to Shutterstock.com.  4K and HD video, very affordable.  You pay once, use it royalty free forever.  Some of the best looking photos and videos, each is reviewed individually for content  and quality.  They get more than 385,000 new images every week.  So there's always stuff new.  Look at that.  I think that's right from the...  That's House of Cards.  That's House of Cards right there.  And the beauty part of this is you can get a free account right now.  If you go to Shutterstock.com, use their light box to store images and photos and drawings  and videos so that you can access them anytime.  Use them as kind of like an idea book.  Share them with other team members.  They've got a great app for both Android and iPad now.  Webby award winning app that's just gorgeous.  But most importantly, when you have this many images, this many different clips, more all  the time, the best search ever.  Google quality search, better than Google quality because you can search for a topic  but then drill down by palette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also better than Google search, Google image search because when you arrive at the  photo, you can use it.  You can use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Subject.  You could say, I want two people in this one.  You can say, I don't want any people in this one.  You say one man, one woman.  You can specify emotions.  It is incredible.  I want you to play with it.  Just go set up your free Shutterstock account, Shutterstock.com.  No credit card necessary.  If you do decide to buy images, we've got a deal for you on image subscription packages.  Use the offer code TWIG415, TWIG415, and you'll get 20% off your new image subscription package.  That's a great deal.  The image subscription packages are for publications and others who use a lot of images.  We have the basic one, which is I think 25 images a day, and we use it all the time.  Shutterstock.com, 20% off image subscription packages on new accounts with the code TWIG415.  We thank you so much, Shutterstock, for your support and for providing great images for our use all the time.  If you have a blog, you've got to have an image on every post, I think.  Great for Google Plus'ers too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's something that a lot of people don't know about Shutterstock.  If you have a blog where you write about technology, the brands are in there too.  You can search for Facebook or Twitter or whatever.  You get just hundreds of images that are relating to actual brands.  These aren't iconography taken from the company.  These are conceptual illustrations built by illustrators that you can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wanted to share a tool this week called Fostroid that I found.  I think it was on Hacker News.  I found it. It looks just like the Play Store, but all of these are open source Android apps.  Many of them are like barcode scanner, Eason, and K9 Mail, and VLC.  These are on the Play Store.  But if you are interested in using open source, free and open source software,  if you're interested in what kinds of free and open source software there is out there,  this is a really great compendium of programs.  Of course, all you have to do is check the side load box in your settings,  and you can download these directly from fostroid.com.  In particular, when it comes to security, I like to use open source  because then you can verify that there's no NSA backdoor, no CIA backdoor, and so forth.  So if you're looking for encryption tools or that kind of thing, this is a great place to go.  Fostroid.  The other thing I wanted to show, which just came out today,  Microsoft is true to its promise that they're going to support users wherever they are,  has released Microsoft Outlook for Android.  And this is the Accompli program that they bought.  They have released this already on iOS.  It's now out for Android.  And it's actually really sweet.  And I don't mean that sweet, like it's really cute.  I mean, it's actually a very nice program.  Supports OneDrive, OneBox, Dropbox Box, iCloud, iMap.  You can, of course, set up your Gmail account in it.  Let me get back to there.  Set up your Gmail account in it.  But you can also use exchange or outlook.com.  You can even use Yahoo mail.  Is there anybody still using Yahoo mail?  I won't log in right now, but if you go and look at it in the Play Store, it's free.  You'll see it has a nice, it's got a complete interface where you can swipe.  If you like Inbox, you might like it a lot.  It also has a built-in calendar.  You know, if you want to go a little bit past what the Google apps will do on Android,  it might be worth checking out.  And I think it's great that Microsoft is releasing all this stuff for tablets,  even before they release it for their own Windows product.  Outlook is now available.  I'll sign in and show you a little later on for Android tablet or phone.  Jeff, do you have a number of the week for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I apologize for not, I didn't want to break in more with my lag here,  but I got one number, which is Ruth Porat, the new CFO of Google.  It has a $70 million paid package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's up there with Angela Arens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where did they get Porat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, shoot. She came from Morgan Stanley.  She's a CFO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. That's a lot of money.  Don't tell Lisa that a CFO can get that kind of money, will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's 10 times more than CEO Tim Cook makes, I think.  Is it really?  He's ranked as the highest bang for the buck in the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They get a good deal. Apple gets a good deal with Tim Cook, believe it or not.  And Angela Arens, their director of retail, costs more.  Like $75 million or something like that.  She's in there with Porat numbers. Those are Porat numbers, not Borat.  That's another person, the new CFO at Google.  Mike, do you have a thing or a tip or a tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do. Speaking of Facebook, were we speaking of Facebook? I don't think we were.  We weren't, but we will.  Facebook today released something called Hello.  Speaking of Hello and Lionel Richie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, is it me you're looking for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is built by the Messenger team.  Basically, it's caller ID, even if you don't know the number of the person who's calling you.  But if they have ever interacted with you on Facebook, Facebook knows who they are and will pop up information about that person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And glad to tell you everything they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. You can also search for people and businesses, local businesses, and call with a single tap.  This is currently in beta. It's available for Android only.  And it sounds like it might be a nice, as long as it's not too obtrusive, it might be a nice addition to the existing caller ID.  Because of course, if you're a heavy Facebook user, and Leo, I know you love the Facebook.  I love it a Facebook.  This is a good way for you to see who's calling you.  You can block people that you don't want calling you and so on.  It sounds like they may be onto something.  They've had several abortive attempts to be a phone interface with Facebook Home, with a Facebook phone and all that stuff.  But this is a way where they're offering a tool that does something kind of minimalist and leverages your so-called social graph from Facebook for an interesting caller ID function.  I like the fact that it covers people who are not in your contacts database who you may not know their number, but it still functions as if you do.  So Facebook, hello. Hello. Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to download it. It's only with Ad, I presume, caller ID for people you follow or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's anybody who has interacted with you on Facebook.  So if they've commented on one of your posts, they're added to the list somehow. At least that's how they've described it.  And you can call with one tap, as I said.  So they're sort of trying to get people to use...  I think eventually they want, of course, everybody to use Facebook as their contacts database.  And so this is a way to start populating...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's something to be said for that. People tend to keep their information up to date on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, people I think are reluctant to add their phone numbers to Facebook sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but if you're using Tinder, not that I am, but if you were.  Danny Sullivan, you got any cool objects of interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got a number for you if you want.  A number? 404? Go ahead.  Yeah, not 404. Today the Internet Advertising Bureau came out with their year-end stats on how much spend has been happening in different countries.  And different kinds of online digital ads.  And Search was again at the top with 50% of all money that is spent that they track in the United States.  So it's anything but dead, although the growth is not as strong as when you look at what's been going on with Social,  because Social is a smaller chunk, so there's a lot more spending starting to go into it.  Or if you just take out mobile from all of this stuff as well.  So that's sort of my number, kind of simple.  After Search, by the way, I'm looking here at the stories on Search Engine Land.  Search makes up all of 50% of online ad spend.  Display ads make up 40% of it.  You can then break down and look at Desktop Search is actually 38% of that share.  Desktop Display is 27%.  One thing that surprised me was video spending is only 7% of online ad spend.  Wow, we've got to get that up.  Yeah, it might be a bit higher because there might be some mobile ad spend that's in there  because they don't break out the mobile part of it.  But I was surprised it seemed to be as low as it was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would include pre-rolls in video ads.  It should do. It should do. It's a video spend.  Yeah. Interesting.  Yeah.  Danny, it's always great to have you. Thank you so much for being here.
