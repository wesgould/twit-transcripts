Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those are  That's pretty cool. You know what those were from a Kickstarter. In fact, the there was a a DVD documentary on  Roland Sherman the photographer who took those and I got those as part of the Kickstarter nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not gonna put a needle on that. Are you I have not yet  Honestly, I have it's like opening an 80 year old or 30 year old bottle of water 80 year bottle of pour. It's like I  Don't you the minute you touch it? It's gonna lose some fidelity. Yeah, it's gone. I mean, no, it's just a keepsake for me  It's so neat. I remember when I was a kid  We had the 45 I'm trying to remember it was I saw her standing there on one side. Oh  She was just 17 and the other side we played it played it to death

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Loved it loved it this week in nostalgia this week in Beatles

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey little  Give me some German help here. Is it schadenfreude?  Shodden brighter when well, is that the right word? I'm looking at Lenovo comm right now  Stop it's shot and right we cashed it. They probably fixed it  In fact, I know they've fixed their DNS entry, but they were hacked Lenovo comm was hacked  By it looks like the lizard squad if you click the page or you look at the title of the page it goes back to it  a Twitter  account at lizard circle  Don't know if the people who acted have anything to do with the slideshow the images the people in the slideshow  Or even what's going on?  But this is not if you went here to buy a think-pad think twice  This is this is not Lenovo  This is the weirdest this doesn't have any text as far as I can tell. It's just a slideshow of images

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so what are the odds they've got super fish installed on their servers? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, wouldn't that be funny?  And of course, there's a Java update a new version of Java is available. I let's skip that. Thank you  Let me if I close that page. Oh, it clicked and it brought me to the Twitter  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, of course Lenovo the news in the this week and Lenovo selling laptops with  Software they claim were for it's for your benefit  software they've been putting on there and stopped in January stopped last month, but  The extensively they claim was to help you searches in searches with image recognition was in fact merely  Intercepting all traffic including  SSL traffic so that it could add ads to the web pages you were visiting ads that presumably benefited Lenovo  Turns out that super fish had gotten this technology didn't bother writing it themselves  They got it from a company called Commodia and we talked yesterday on security now about Commodia Commodia apparently  Was run by 14 year olds. We're not sure because just the worst  software ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just little explains to me was this but this was this was just junk word no matter what this is not software  You anybody wanted right? It was what Lenovo says people want it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, we just had this debate with Paul throughout. Yes earlier on Windows Weekly  He said he's every time he talks to the OEMs who make these Windows PCs loaded with bloatware  He says the end to a man they all say no. No, we know people want these Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  BS

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The B is to masses you could say that with an antivirus you could see cuz all of them come bundled with Mac  Afee or oh and you so you could say it wouldn't be completely  Bizarre to say well, we know people are gonna want an antivirus. So as a as a customer convenience  We give them six months free of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Antivirus X of course, yeah, Kevin Kevin. Do these things happen on your Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's funny you say that I did I did it my public service announcement and said hey if you need to remove  Superfish from your Chromebook here are the steps  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even a Lenovo Chromebook  As far as we know no Lenovo Chromebook has Superfish on it  Well, no Mac does either but I have to say you're right  This is this is something that Chrome OS doesn't have to suffer from no these OEMs

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean they have to be getting money to  For these apps to be put on there. I would imagine that that's what the benefit is. I would think right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I mean the first thing that I thought was well in a way  We're kind of to blame because we've pushed the price down so low on Windows PCs  I just bought a $59 Windows 8 tablet the HP streams are 200 bucks for pretty decent  Laptops and so the because these the cost of goods is equivalent to the price. They're selling it at in some cases. They have to  Make a profit somewhere. So that's what the the adware I would presume. That's why they put the adware on  Although you got to look at Chromebook the same price for a Chromebook, right and they can't put adware in a Chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, there's very little that the OEMs can do or have done in the past  I think Samsung put a couple of small apps on one of their chrome  But yeah, I'm sure they had Google's blessing though. I mean, I don't I don't think it's something that you can just go and do  Otherwise, I think we'd see this become a bigger problem in the Chrome OS area. We're not seeing that. I'm sure Google controls this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just got the new Samsung Chromebook to review yesterday by the way before you buy really nice  229 bucks. Yeah, really nice and no, I mean I know presence of Samsung at all on it  Yeah, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, right kid  But but while you're on the topic of Chromebooks, that's I brought it up and Kevin backed me up here  Big news the big news  pixel to pixel to all three of us the world  Google admitted that 85% of the use is all the Googlers but Kevin you and I are the other 15%

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so everybody went to IO three years ago as a pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, even so I got all kinds of tweets immediately afterwards say Jeff your dreams come true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This by the way was in a briefing Google did and has since pulled down  Yeah, so Google's not admitting to it publicly. This was not a public admission  But who were they were talking to?  this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Teamwork event wasn't it? Okay. Yeah, I think so teamwork is for people who I  Think it's Google for work type. Okay stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, and the presenter said and here's some good news. Yes. We're working on a next generation pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and actually that's that's the second time this month that this information has kind of gotten out and been pulled because  We do a chrome show over at giga home and we had noticed in the beginning of February  Several mentions of a device that was being worked on we look in the chromium OS bug tracker  That's where Google is tracking bugs for all the chrome stuff  They're working on and there was mention of a new laptop that had a light bar a touchscreen with the same resolution of the pixel  It was even a screenshot. So we're like, uh-huh  They pulled the screenshot and so we kind of figured two three weeks ago. This was coming and  you know, we should I don't know if you guys want to talk about what to expect but I  Really expect a big big change here at least in the outside. I expect just better specs. Don't you I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really want LTE on it. That's one thing Google Google. Are you listening? Keep the LTE? It's very important to me  Otherwise, I think yeah, it's just a faster processor and probably some more memory and things like that  But it's a it's a you know, what are you gonna do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's not much to do well, there's one thing missing is the battery life isn't very good on that too  Yeah on the pixel I should say and they and they and of course is pre has well  So they by putting a broadwell chip into it they should be able to double the battery life easily  Which will be amazing because right now what are you getting three or four hours? I don't get more than oh god. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's about five is the advertised but I mean these pixels are almost two years old now  So I'm getting about four because it's been used so much. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? Yeah. Yeah  You know turn the light down a little bit close once in a while that kind of stuff the  Yeah, you know the other thing is my my touch screen has just started getting a little hinky two years old but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I love the thing still I actually brought mine out to compare it to the Samsung Chromebook, you know  now thirteen or fourteen hundred dollars versus two twenty nine and  I have to say with the improvements that have been made in chipsets and so forth. The screen is not as good  This is a beautiful screen on the pixel. It's weird because it's four three aspect ratio  Nobody's making screens like that. In fact, it's the one of the main reasons  I can't use it on the air here is we've never been able to get to work with her our equipment because it's such a strange aspect  ratio, but in most other respects keyboard trackpad  Speed battery life the said the 229 dollar Samsung Samsung not Samsung  Samsung is is pretty comparable in better in some ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it is time to Shiba the Toshiba one, you know as a high-res screen for an ice cream  The only problem is it's it's high resin. So the type is just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three two, of course, it's not three three. That's why it's really weird for three is a TV aspect ratio  it's three two, which is like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  surface through but but somehow Kevin but they do say that they do this as a you know as a demonstration to  Show what a Chromebook can do. So there's got to be something in it that that revs the engine doesn't there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I say oh we could do that too. I don't know about that. I don't know that there's that much more you can do  With the hardware that's out there and available and still keep the prices down to where Chromebooks are gonna be attractive to people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the $1,600 Chromebook  That if price were no object you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You would do what you want. Could you do you know that I don't know what they could do  I  Almost want to see them get rid of the touchscreen or offer a non touchscreen option and have us cut two three hundred dollars off the price

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's one thing they could do make an eight hundred dollar pixel. Well, you don't know but here's what I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was thinking about this and I actually tweeted them and didn't get an answer considering but but my old goomba Michael Dell  you go back to  The early days of Dell what was Dell's specialty, you know  Burger King you have it your way  Why doesn't Dell make a Chromebook that you can you can touch screen no touchscreen LTE no LTE this memory that memory  Somewhere there should be a customized Chromebook and that would be your $800 machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well and Dell does it now with at the low end  I mean there's six different models of their brand new Chromebook 11 you can get touchscreen no touchscreen 2 gig gram 4 gig gram  16 gig of storage 32 gig of storage. Oh well, either  No LT, but I mean that's that's geared towards the education market  and I think that kind of points to the problem and that is there enough of a demand for a  Customized Chromebook that an OEM will take the risk and invest that kind of time and effort. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the lack of mid-range Chromebooks proves one point is that  Part of the appeal if not the entire appeal of a Chromebook is as low price  So making anything anything good and I know security

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At ease of a group installation a school for a school it is pretty amazing. You don't have to worry about  Crapware, I agree that's that's important to those guys and so so so and that goes together with price for a school  Yeah, but yeah, well, you know, the other thing I think Kevin is  You know I ran  What's McCall of the the Linux?  Distro on it for a while, but you could only do that in the dev mode  Thank you  It was just too flaky to run in dev mode as my main machine  But I could imagine that if you had a pixel that really was easily just switchable bit back and forth  They're not gonna do that. Why would they do that?  Because because they're geeks run Linux their geeks want, you know that would be hot for geeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting cuz Renee Nehemi who was the one who's said there's gonna be a new pixel  She did say what was it 85% of the users are Google employees  What she neglected to say is nevertheless they didn't very make very many the vast majority of Googlers do not use Chromebooks  They use Macs. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The vast majority do yes, but I know lots of people who use their Chromebooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm just saying it's not the not even the laptop of choice. She admitted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a time. This is a laughably small. Whatever it is. It's a laughably small number. We know that we've always known that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have to say though every time I review a Chromebook like this Samsung. It's so easy to set up  It's just great because I said I spent a lot probably  Most of the time I spend reviewing stuff is setting it up  Installing stuff getting it to work like I like it to work, especially with phones  There's nothing easier than setting up a Chromebook you log into your account and you sit back. It's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think I've ever spent more than five minutes to get a Chromebook up and running from great one to another

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's just amazing. Well, not only that to rebuild it entirely. Oh, I'm not something  So that's what all minutes yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's done. All right. I got a new product for you. Just got the box. Oh, I got a mysterious email from Motorola a Lenovo company  Although to my knowledge there is no snap fish on Motorola phones yet  But I just got an email last week from a Motorola saying we'd like to send you a box. It's embargoed till 6 to 8 a.m  Pacific time  Wednesday the 25th today your box will arrive and I think their hope was that people would have live unboxings all over the internet  I just I wasn't gonna rush in so I came in at my normal time and we opened up the box and this is what we got  I think this is inspired. I wish more companies would do this from a point of view of a tech journalist  What a wonderful thing so I open up the box and here here's it says slide to start

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Be great if it had a time that you really couldn't I know do not open wouldn't that be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it arrived, you know based on when it arrived  I guess there wasn't really that wasn't an issue because I couldn't open till arrived. So you slide it open actually  I'm sure it came out this way and it said the new moto e so this is the second generation of Motorola's  really inexpensive  Phone list price 150 bucks and it was kind of cool. It says start here. So you open the flap  and that actually in here were

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These put your hand in and something will bite it off. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These bumpers. This is one way you can customize it. They have a variety of colored bumpers  And then you flip this open. This is I thought this was really cool. Here's the welcome welcome desk  Oh what you also had a badge with your name on my name on it said Motorola that would let it so I already got my badge  Thank you at the welcome desk and there's a  Cool  Door and then you pull open the door and there's little seats for you and the other press to sit in and  And there's what's what's his name?  Osterloh, hey Rick  He's a little Rick and there was a phone in here, which I've since take that take it out. But that is so cute  Thank you, Motorola

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a great the phones was getting very good notices today that they've done a lot of little price

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is remarkable given now somebody said it was B it was for sale

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me unlock it because I think Best Buy might have leaked the price and information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last week somebody said was for sale 120 bucks, but I think that's for the three. That's for the 3g. Okay, so  This is the new one full 4g. It's a small screen. It's a QHD screen, which is what 960 by 540  245 pixels per inch which is  Small but but not tiny now  It's only 8 gigs of storage in fact  the first thing I had to do was take apps off because I of course it immediately auto installs everything and  Once you take apps off, but it's a good-looking screen. It's fairly it feels fairly snappy  It has you know, okay Google  The standard okay Google doesn't have a lot of them a lot of the moto stuff, but it does have the watch while you're driving  It will assist the moto assist. Yeah, I really I love that  There was and it's supposed now. I don't know anything about battery life yet because I just got it  But it's a fairly hefty battery for a size something this size  Here's the says meeting have a productive meeting so it won't ring now because I'm in a meeting which is awesome  And it's lollipop and not only lollipop but clean lollipop. It is  It is effectively  You know Google  Versions are any any moto wearer on it at all. There's just the moto apps there needed to do assist  And I think it probably has the connect app which allow or migration app my crazy. Yeah to migrate stuff over

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like a mini Nexus. I mean, it's pure Google. It's pure Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in fact for people want a really cheap Nexus for development. This is a great choice  They're saying in the press kit. They say it's for first-time phone  You know buyers it's for kids this comes off and you can customize it  There's a black version also and a variety of different colored little these little colored things  This is something nice even though only 8 gig storage it does support an SD card micro SD card up to 32

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh, why don't work? Why don't more phones? I think that's such a nice feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to do in the OS, but I think Google's figured it out now  So if you wanted to store me it would be more for music not so much to give you more app storage  So now I've made it a pink phone  Because I like pink  I think this is for a first phone. It's also third-world  Oriented they will be a dual sim model and there is an FM radio in and I think that's something that already nation. Yeah  Nations want but  for anybody who wants a cheap unlocked phone, I mean you think about just just remember back to our wonder of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smartphones and what this cost is $129 for a phenomenal phone  Yeah, and also also compared to the prices being rumored for the new Samsung  Mm-hmm over a thousand bucks eleven over a thousand bucks. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unbelievable. I give moto a lot of credit here. I mean they came out with this moto II last year  I got one sitting here as well great little disposable phone  Absolutely great backup phone  Yeah, I put the purple band on there my little Rick Osterloh, he won't stand up. I don't know what happened  He fell down  They they added a front-facing camera, which last year's model did not have  Five megapixels front and back no flash on the back, which is a little unfortunate, but that's okay  You mentioned the moto assist it also has the some of the notification stuff that the moto X has yes  You can't put your your hand over and have notifications appear. There's no sensors for that  But if you nudge the phone when it's sitting down  And the screen is off the screen will actually wake and show you your notifications  So they're doing what they can with this, you know with very limited hardware  Up to a quad core chip as compared to last year's dual core chip inside  It's a snapdragon 400 410 something like that. Yeah, it's not gonna set the house on fire  They that last year's model actually only had four gig of storage  So this is the eight gig is actually a doubling it really I mean it's almost the same price as last year plus it has LTE

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is remarkable. I yeah, I think for a kid. It's also  It feels indestructible. Yeah gorilla glass very plasticky  But boy you feel it also somewhat water-resistant. I feel like this is the kind of phone that somebody  Would give a kid or your first phone if you're in a budget constrained. Yeah, kudos to Motorola  I think this is really pretty impressive  Kevin this is probably coming out of Chicago not out of China. I  Mean the design and the sensibility and all of that. Well, it's hard to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean if you look at it and you can see in the band that I have I mean  It looks like the moto X design which really originated back here. So  Yeah, I mean it's the dimple and everything  It's just a reuse of a very smart elegant design and it's a little bit of a chunky monkey because of that battery  But you know, they say 24 hours of battery life to be expected. See that's remarkable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually cast my moto X aside in 2014 moto X because I couldn't get through a day as much as I love it and I had  The leather back and everything but you know if I can get all the features and it lasts a day  This thing's compact. I this isn't a bad choice at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could actually buy buy one of these outright for 149 never put a SIM card in it  Just use it as a Wi-Fi Android iPod for you know, right? Yeah unlocked unsubsidized price

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, then then 129 because you don't need the 4g, right?  Why did they release this before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because there's gonna be a lot of noise from Barcelona starting on Saturday and  The best way to avoid that is to do exactly what they did  This clever little box with the mini Rick Osterloh in it and by doing that they got our attention didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, Rick. Yours is like yours is like falling over. Yeah, he like there's glue on the bottom, but my glue never sets  So Rick, I'm gonna put him on my desk somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like Rick and I and I yeah, I really think I  Hope Lenovo doesn't screw this company up as they have screwed up. Yeah, let's think  Nice nice job  Is the thinkpad bad? I know they don't have super fish. It does not have super fish  So it was only on the low the cheap consumer grade products that it has all that  So yeah, here's some masking tape in here. They obviously break constantly even has a back. Oh, they went all they went  Holy cow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've changed it changes everything changes everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love how this is kind of like thumb thumbing their nose at the big kind of what's become a tradition now  Which is just that in order to get attention they feel like you know  These companies feel like they need to throw these huge announcements  Filled with the you know glamour and Broadway music and all this stuff when really all you need is a clever kind of  Campaign that sent out at the right time  Which in this case ends up being before Barcelona and they're gonna get a pretty decent amount of awareness and coverage out of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what? You know what else about that is that if you go to a bit, you know for the sake of  Twitter I've gone to the big Samsung event at Radio City. Oh god, right?  We're we're number one is an awful event number two. They don't give away any phones  Yeah, number three. I'll bet it cost five times what just giving away the phone in the cute box

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think they sent a lot of these to bloggers and people who probably can't afford to go to Barcelona  Don't there they don't want to go to Barcelona. So you get more attention by doing that  Yeah smart with their moto the the moto X announcement this year wasn't or last year was in Chicago. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think you need them on your shoulder. They'll I can do that  Lincoln speaking your voice  The good angel of the bad angel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hanging on for dear life. I could tell you that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rick Rick not long ago you could you would have stuck to your head your head. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, maybe not free action figure with every phone purchase isn't that great I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Imagine imagine if you could have gotten this your own Steve Jobs in the other day. Let's take a break. We come back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're gonna do like a mini change log because Google has announced some  Big stuff neat stuff and we'll talk a little bit about what's new with Google in just a second  Kevin Toffle is here from Giga. Oh, it's always great to have you on Kevin. I appreciate that  I wish I don't know how we got we got out of the habit of having Kevin Toffle on all the time  I'm a bad habit to break. I don't want to break this habit. Don't worry. I'm on it. Yeah, Kevin's great  As is everybody from Giga home. It's a great bunch over there. I will let them know I appreciate them the the emeritus  Is he all my meritus?  Meritus

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's always good for a money quote

It's asynchronous meetings. They get sidetracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is big news because up till now Google play music only allowed  20,000 tracks in the cloud for free now for free you get  50,000 tracks which is God I can't even imagine how many albums and all that is and I haven't come close to the  Limit on my 20,000, but now you've got 50,000. I  Actually, I was an iTunes  Radio guy for a while, but I moved over to Google play mainly because of the free storage  Yes, now they've got the songs integration, which I love. Yes, and  I mean a lot of tracks are that I own are not available on Google play or elsewhere like my Beatles for example  I upload those there that the real big thing to me is cross service cross-platform services  I can use Google play music on Android iOS  Chromebook Chromecast  PC Mac, whatever  So this this is really nice news for people who are Google play music listeners. They also updated the iPad app

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a full native iPad app, which really makes it because it's got such a great UI  It's definitely material design and I think that's really nice. They bought the songs of service  We've mentioned this before and that's incorporated in so I think in terms of radio  They absolutely compete very well with Pandora the fact that your own music is in there  That's like Amazon music which does the same but now with 50,000 songs. I was not able to get my whole library in there  I can't how many do you oh how 38,000 something like that Wow  so  Having everything in there, you know who loves this a friend of mine is a professional musician  He has a lot of his own music that's never been released on his hard drive and he was really concerned about losing it  Google play music uploads it so it's he end up  This is the service that he uses because it not only gives you everything else  All of his own music is stored on Google play music and available anywhere. He can listen to Google play music  So that's that is huge  I  Used it you can get a little on your Android phone a little widget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what's the total four device five devices for you can do ten ten devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Five of them can be mobile such as tablets and phones  It's pretty much an unlimited amount of computers because you can use the browser for that  So it's not it doesn't really count but you know for people who review devices all you do you open that icon or that app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put every I get everything into my computer one way or the other so  the  Other thing that's changed and this is less of an exciting change apparently the porno is leaving  Blogger, what do you think about that? I think it's smart  Means that Marissa Meyer owns pornography now, which is great  Starting a very proud I'll explain that in a moment starting March 23rd  You cannot publicly share images and videos that are sexually explicit or show graphic nudity on blogger  Google says will still allow nudity if the content content offers a substantial public benefit. You see that's that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if it's an anatomy lesson, maybe or something well, well, I don't want Google to be our nanny  I really I really don't like this problem is a porno takes over

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at tumblr

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, so that's the real problem. So it's I think it's on blogger. I think it's I think it's a sequestered  You know, there are warnings

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true. Don't you have to go through a block?  You do you're gonna see a don't do it. Of course, if you're 13 years old you go looking for that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but my issue is that I don't want the Google nanny  I don't want Google to become our artist isker and and it puts Google in a position  where  You know pick your country  The problems are gonna have well if you'll do that in America if you get rid of poor in America  Why don't you get rid of pictures of women here?  I died I am not comfortable with Google putting itself in this position  And I was always kind of proud of them that they allowed it  Not saying you gotta like porn, but they allowed it because they they did a speech and  I'm  Google I'm what's going on here. The only thing I can figure out is that this is maybe tied to the YouTube for kiddies. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which was also released this week. It's a new however

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah at the exact same moment reddit does the same thing. I was just gonna say reddit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well reddit didn't do exactly the same thing already did is say if you're gonna put

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Explicit content up you have to have the permission  It has to be from the person who was in it or you have permission of the person who's in it  Which is a direct response I think to the fact that reddit was being used for upskirts  for right jail bait, you know our side-chart jail bait for revenge porn and of course for  Jennifer Lawrence images  Reasonable response

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I get the scourge of the of the crappy stuff going on but but you know to try to find the price you go to  Tumblr to find the provenance of any given no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which means you can't you can't from you can't put that up you have to I know what that means almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is it almost becomes weirdly more intimate  right  And and how do you have to prove you're the permission to me again?  Yes, reddit's dealing with something that's slimy and awful that was going on I think what reddit's doing is reasonable I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I'm not sure I  Google if Google were the only place you know if blogspot were the only place you could get this stuff  Maybe but Tom now if tumblr says no more adult material in tumblr  Then maybe that's a general shutting down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the issue Leo is is is I understand Google shouldn't be the business shouldn't be the arbiter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree of what's good and bad for us, and this is a challenge because Facebook Google plus all of these sites  To some degree do have to become arbiters don't they?  Not you know not everything goes, but I think Facebook and Google plus and are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bit different Facebook won't allow people breastfeeding breastfeeding. I know which I've always thought is awful  I thought it was absolutely ridiculous  And I've never I never liked that out of Facebook  And you know part of what is is is is we're spreading our American pure tanacle view to the world  You know go into a French subway or a German subway and look at the billboards and you see breasts women have them  And I'm talking about you know horrid porn and disgusting stuff and all that but that isn't I mean truthfully that's not you're not just  Incidental pictures of breasts on I understand that but now where do we so where's the line so they're not they're not saying you know  Tasteful there's they're basically saying  Nudity right yeah, that's and that makes it a little difficult. Yeah, that's that's a problem because because but it's just as bad if you say  That's an American standard now set to the world and I think in a diverse and open world  That's wrong, and they were the problem here is the reverse can happen Iran can say no no use our standard for the world right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And indeed you know kind of tries that mean there should be no standards at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course there are standards. This is the free speech and yelling you know fire in the theater argument child pornography  Yes, you don't you don't allow it. I agree with that there are victims to it  There's a play that I just read the review today in the Times called the nether that came from London to New York  about a  Evidently very disturbing but apparently very well done play that I'm now eager to see  because it's about the idea of having a  Made-up world the nether is a new world for the internet and you go into this wonderful place where you  and you don't see this perhaps but but you  Are part of child pornography and and and and violent crimes against children, but they're made-up children  So they're trying to play obviously with right how far do we go and and that's a fine discussion to have Kevin?  What do you think I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think I  Need I need to hear from both sides

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Need to hear from both sides, but the bigger news to me is that people still use blogger to be honest  I  Didn't even know about this until it hit the headlines and what not yeah, no I know I know I  Got my start way back when using blog spot and also you know  I see where Jeff's coming from because I don't know that I want one thing singular company  Especially in the US to dictate what's happening in the world how these tools are used and so on  The question though is you know does Google just not want to be held responsible for the contents that's on there  You know if they're going to be held responsible for what they're what they're hosting then they want to lay down the law  I'm not saying I agree with it, but I can I mean Apple doesn't get any heat for doing this data

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They well they get a little bit of heat. I guess but they're very dead

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had to do a spell Apple had to do a special arrangement with built the the largest newspaper in Europe  Because built has my line about built is that it's tabloid at heart, but the paper is bigger  So the naked breasts are bigger. You know it's on big paper and  That's part of built and so they had to get dispensation for breasts in Germany and Apple said okay because you're a newspaper in Germany

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're gonna let you put boobs in your app  That's this is the reductio ad absurdum yes, it is pointing out that  Where do you draw the line and it gets sillier and sillier and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know as Kevin I both said it is culture if you go to Germany  And I'm not you know North Center  You go to Germany you turn on TV at 10 o'clock at night, and you get the the sex the ads for the sex call channels  It'll blow you away the first time my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I used to go to New York to watch to watch public access  Dirty dirty George. I mean ugly George. I think George yeah  I was I was blown away by that and that's a that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Freely available television for you kids for you kids who don't know the reference not the why should we spread this for?  George was this very odd guy who would walk around and in  Short shorts and kind of wearing foil and in the earliest days had a huge VCR in his back  Yeah, the huge camera  And he would his whole schnick was to wander the streets of New York and and and attract as he put it goyles  To follow him into it into a hallway or room somewhere to show off their body it was I was it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was on Manhattan Public Access a TV and now by the way. It's on YouTube  We should be very careful here  Although this is YouTube how far could they go in fact doesn't that raise the issue of what do you do with YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question Leo. Yeah  Well how far does Lee I don't even know how far YouTube goes what door does I have to say I have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I live with a 12 year old now  And I'm and he watches YouTube all the time and I'm shocked by some of the stuff that's on YouTube, but no no sex  No, no explicit nudity  Which makes me wonder what I'm gonna see here  Me too. Should I just keep going here? I'll play it and watch and I'll let you know  Coco Crystal posted this who that was the young lady at the beginning apparently she was an advertiser in public access television in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess I don't know there was another talk show where they just sat around nude. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there was a woman  Yeah, I can't remember her name visit New York and say it'd be in a friend's apartment and say whoa  television

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, so this video they cut away as quickly as they can from the nudity okay  But apparently they're not as swift as they think I mean well, okay now now all argue your point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got a point. So if what if YouTube had allowed sex that it would have turned entirely. That's the problem into you porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem. Yeah, and we have you poor literally is a place called you porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you want that you can go there. There is a precedent YouTube. You've got a point there  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can understand not you know not my not wanting is in my backyard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I get that too but but and Google is in a particular position where it is a gateway to  through content right now  And then they're in such hot water all around the world on on try, you know  Everybody's trying to make them salute their local standards

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if I am not I am not a prude is everybody knows and  And I am very sex positive and I like nudity  But I also think that it should that it's not necessarily a bad thing to segregate it  So that I'm fine with even I who enjoy all of this don't want to see it everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm absolutely fine with that and labeling and all that kind of stuff. I think is only wise  But you know what's gonna happen is it some German nudist club and there's lots of them because it's a culture belief is gonna  Come in and find their their sight taking down when the to them  This is not pornography. Well, let me point out that you could you can still have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just has to be private by invitation only if you're a club you can invite everybody in the club and they can say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you trying to use it as a marketing tool for people to come to your news?  This would you know, you can't be on Google  I'm just let's say here. I am, you know defending pornography today on the show. No, no, no, you're defending free speech really  Well, I'm also trying to defend Google against the precedent of being forced to be the world's nanny and and I see  The unintended consequences in danger of that. That's what's worrying me about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, and then I look at tumblr and it's  It's infested

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an issue. I get it. That's a brand issue. I get it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now  Marissa Meyer owns pornography is this really I mean  Yahoo is home to if you everybody go from blogspot to tumblr because anything goes actually  You know what? They actually come to think of it. They do anything does not go on tumblr  they've done a variety of things to reduce the  amount of  adult content on tumblr so I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Took my my daughter my daughter's class from her school  She's a high school senior and it's a class around women in media during a three-week project  So I took them in to meet Katie Couric yesterday who was wonderful and delightful and generous fun  It was really great. Wow, what a treat for them  It really was it really was and they got to talk with her for a bit  They also got talked to Margaret Sullivan of the New York Times. They got their cunning ass  My media connections came in handy  But anyway as we're in the elevator going up to Yahoo, which is which by the way, you know  Is in the old New York Times building in the great lady. It's so funny  Yeah, it is they went from visiting the New York Times and his new building over to visiting Yahoo at the old New York Times  They didn't they didn't understand the by the late at this irony  As we're going to the elevator up to Yahoo, they're saying tumblr tumblr. Can we see tumblr? That's what we're gonna see tumblr  They were all excited about that. Yeah kids love tumblr. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and of course  To my mind and I agree with you Weber. He says we could show all sorts of violence  Yeah, when it comes to nudity and healthy sexuality. No, no  So, you know, but that's the world we're in I don't want to see by the way, I don't want to see violence  Everywhere I go on the internet either. Oh, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is offense is a terrible standard. It's very hard. It's  important knows  crime is a decent standard trial pornography is illegal and has victims and and you get rid of it because of that right but  To get rid of something because it could offend someone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The slipperiest of slopes nightmare in a chat room raises a good point which is  In workplaces you absolutely cannot be looking at adult content period  It the workplace is liable  you know you you you can lose your job of the workplace can get sued for making a  Hostile work environment. So maybe this is just an attempt by blogger  I mean if they use those standards to say we want to make sure all of our sites are work-friendly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was sitting in the faculty meeting and I must confess that faculty means I do have the tweet deck up don't go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tumblr

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a guy there was a guy who I don't know how he had my fears all these things you put in your in your  Twitter feed three years ago and there's a guy who had great jokes about the Jets  It turns out he also runs a stripper club  I've had our service in North in New England and I've had one there for three years  Only like last week did he start putting up naked pictures on Twitter and I and the first one popped up as I'm in the  Faculty meeting with faculty on either side of me. Nice. Yeah, it's so you say what I'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which shouldn't that have a warning that you would say I agree to see the you know, the potentially a friend there is a setting into in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter that you could say don't want to see if yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I have that set because I don't have any of those those pop-ups, you know  Just show up because that could be obviously embarrassing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's another good point Twitter doesn't seem to have any rules do they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Though I never get that was the first time I saw a naked picture on Twitter. I swear I never get them  Yeah, it maybe I'm just with you know ancient old prudes  If you follow people with xxx in their handle

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're more likely to see something  All right, well a good discussion I don't know what the answer is frankly  I guess I'm I guess you swore you swayed me Jeff, but I do understand how a company would wait me too  Is the YouTube example does set a precedent I get it but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only, you know, societally redeeming breasts may now be seen  So whose whose job is it to go beat you go to go be the breast blesser  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem but but Google faces is in every respect they have to decide this in all the time  They're always an arbiter to some degree  And maybe the difference of course is they're not just linking to it. They're so they're hosting it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  I like Mexican restaurants tell me the next one at the next exit and all you'd have to do to your Thomas vehicle is you  Even have to just say stop at the nearest at the next restaurant, right?  You have to search for it. They stop at the next mixing restaurant

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds like you need

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need a Starbucks on the Pulaski Kevin, are you in New York, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm in Pennsylvania, but I head into the city which is a three-hour drive for me for events and such and one of those  Hours is on the Pulaski Skyway. Yes. I feel so bad right now because it's broken

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I make my living on people who are stuck in their cars I might add but I feel so bad for you  I am so sorry  My commute five minutes and I could walk it if I hate you. I hate you  And it's so funny when Google pops up that it'll be seven minutes. There's traffic on  Just makes me smile but I did for many years I had a two-hour to our plus commute that's right  So I know what it's like and I just that was one of that's actually to me one of my strongest motivating factors  To moving to Petaluma once I moved here to not working in San Francisco  And that's how twit came about alright inbox by gmail now in more places  This is the gmail interface that I prefer but a lot of people don't like an awful lot  They've added as I mentioned Google music and now inbox both have native iPad apps  Also inbox supports Firefox and so far you don't have to use Chrome anymore  Have you come around on you don't like this Jeff do you um?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm afraid of it  Remember you remember how much you scared me when you had me put up those in gmail you had me put up these tabs  I can't like it free  Freaked and the problem is I don't know what it's like because it's only good you know on my gmail account  I use my apps account so when it comes in I'm afraid it's gonna be like an autonomous car  Where's gas pedal where's brakes on this thing I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't know why but it's the first thing I've ever found that gets me to inbox zero. It's easy  I use it on all my devices. I even wow oh, so you are really oh it is the app for me  And they haven't do you use it you know I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Try it every now and again Jeff and I struggle because there's such a low information density there  I don't get a ton of information. I guess that's the whole point of it. I'm so used to  You know being drowned in gmail for the past ten years that I can't break out of it. Yeah  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't know I seem to be the only person who likes inbox it is missing a lot of features I  There's no signature. I have to use a macro to put my signature, and there's no encryption  I think that's really important Google needs to add that yep nevertheless  It's just the fastest way to do triage for me  There's no undo undo send which for me and do you send there is no undo send in mail there is in gmail  Oh, but there's that's because email just holds on to it exactly and I use it all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many times do I send something in the minute?  I said it I read the thing that I wasn't supposed to type in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love change it when I get an email from somebody who sent something something wrong to me  And then I get another email from them saying you know Darlene wants to retract that email, and I just laugh  Because if you're using out look everybody's in exchange and outlook you can do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the only in certain circumstances so the other problem. I have with now is that I use  Mark as unread like crazy  Because that's my way to say okay. I know about this. I'll deal with it later. Let me mark it as well  I'm ready and pin there's a pin thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where it better it is better than mark is unread you can mark is unread you can move so I didn't buy it  You just move it to the inbox, and it's unread, but the better way to do that is to pin it  There's a little thumbtack icon stuff you pin sits there forever until you unpin it or you sweep it. I don't want that either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tried to use the star in gmail, but it's like it's do list to me. I  Can't do it. I just can't know it so it'll stay there for a little longer  But then if I don't really do anything with it well God didn't mean it for me, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have noticed that people are in  In inboxes and eGmail are very personal and  The more that you've customized it and specialized it and got it just right the less likely you're gonna use a new system frankly  And it's just it's interesting how personal everybody's email habits have become just mostly because I think it's a  Overload we have to have some solution  So I my email system wasn't working for me, so it was easy for me to shift and I have done  I've had big filters and all that say you know 1800 you Dora filters and stuff  Google launches invite program to bring inbox to Google app for work customers  So I guess I can now invite people who use apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For work we we have Google apps for our email here you can apply  To be one of the first companies to be able to integrate inbox into Google apps all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our staff who wants me to do that I do  Mike Elgin I so do and you do Jason you like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like inbox I think it would be incredibly useful  More so in business than it would be in my personal needles. You don't want it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Slinina he doesn't like anything Google though, so he doesn't care Jason Clancy's to option is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no you don't have to use it. That's well, so what's not everybody's not forced into inbox  It just means that it supports it so I should apply

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure, where do you apply? I think your admin has to your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The company is me he has his own personal Google for now. I'm just apps, so it's just me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I should apply Russell would you is Russell still here Russell would I don't know who our admin is it must be Russell  Russell's the admin  Inbox okay once so you have to email Google at  inbox for work at Google calm  First invites will be going out next month only admins can ask make sure you do something nice for your friendly neighborhood sys admin on July 31st  Nice plug for sys admin day  I was that again Leo inbox for work inbox works at Google calm  Google says companies that should consider signing up for the early adopter program are those that want to use inbox as their primary email service  Whose employees are heavy mobile email users and those that want to partner with Google on user studies to learn more about how employers use this  Service we do use you know we have at twit TV is our  Domain and we use it  The truth is I don't ever check my email at twit TV  Because I can't use it. That's another solution entirely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was gonna say there's no such thing as inbox zero except of course just deleting all of your email

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shutting down your email accounts entirely just go offline. You remember seeing my inbox with 25,000 unread messages  By the way the way I fixed that is I used that was the most satisfying sweep of the day  I used inbox I pressed sweep  25,000 messages gone  That was a nice and did you suffer any consequences from doing I have my mother thinks I died  Okay, but other than that  No, no I have no zeroes no consequences because anybody who hadn't heard from me by now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the thing I hold on to these emails for so long like I really do need to get back to this person  This emails three months old I guarantee you that person is not losing sleep over the fact that they didn't hear back from me at this  bright  Email that's called

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's there's a word for that declaring declaring email bankruptcy  Yes, and you send an email out to people and say hey, or you post it somewhere. Hey, oh no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's every day for me inbox here. I'll tell you what I tell you when you hear inbox zero when you die I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is using their ITA

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They bought idea. It's more aimed for people. I mean, okay, I'm doing a business thing  This is gonna sound obnoxious when I'm doing a business thing and I've said, you know  I want this flight and I wanted business class and I want this or that  These things are all meant to find you better prices, right?  But the but the but if you if you if you go in and try to search for some destination it will  Give you a very nice visualization of flights, but notice what what was just there Leo in the last screen. Yeah  Suggested destinations. That's what's new here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google knows what's best for you. You're looking to go to Fort Worth, but maybe you'd rather go to Honolulu. Yeah  You're so right Google  That's pretty fun. Although it is a little devilish, isn't it?  Perhaps let me let me do this. So is it flight? I didn't even know about this dot google.com  So, let's say this is a flight and I'm  round trip San Francisco to Fort  Worth  Texas I have to  Trying to decide there's a podcasters Hall of Fame induction ceremony in July 31st  Trying to decide if I want to go I  Don't think I can because it takes forever. But let me just so where does it suggest better places to go?  I think on that main page  It already did that a minute ago. Yeah, that was for hotels. Yeah. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go back to the main page the flights page  Oh, I see here see notice that nine similar flights and it does these night nice visualizations. Yeah, this is nice

This is this is competing with that. Yep  Yeah, cuz they're not I imagine if I choose this flight I then get sent to Alaska Airlines. Yeah, you book with Alaska

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't know what the business deal is does does Google get a spiff? I have no idea probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Travel agents that's that's what I was wondering because usually if you book reservations flights  Whatever all that stuff comes through email. So Google now actually has all that information  So I know they're not getting additional information that they didn't have. So what's the angle here? Right San Francisco to Barcelona

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's go right now  All right. Well, that's fun. I'm not getting suggestions here, but I did on hotels  Now what are they gonna suggest better than Barcelona? There's nothing better than Barcelona. Yeah, they didn't bother  No, it's nothing better  Fast searches Barcelona Dallas Fort Worth suggested destinations. I see so it's when you go when you first enter it will give you some suggestions  I'm not sure why they what they get out of that  Doesn't there does Paris give them a little kickback for everybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody comes to well  It's also it's also the philosophy that Google wants to give you the core information not send you all over searching for stuff  Which of course this is off those sites where you went searching before  What I want is is okay Google get me the hell out of here  My self-driving car takes me to the airport I get on a plane. I don't know where I'm going. I'm most best

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you want I'm feeling lucky but for travel for travel. Oh, that's a great idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seven days zoom a lot of people complained about the fact that there was no seven-day view on the phone  You would appear on a tablet with a larger screen, but it wouldn't on the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't even tell what you're looking at, but I guess people are used to this seven-day. I am

Transcript:  That's the Google change log  Why did Google buy toro  Which is not fatty tuna  But a Facebook marketing startup formerly known as red hot labs  Toro  Is used to make launching and optimizing a Facebook ad campaign as easy as possible  What maybe they just maybe it's an acquire rights these two guys  Yeah, cuz it did seem a little odd  I can't imagine that Google cares about how easy or hard it is to set up a Facebook marketing campaign  They'd raised one and a half million dollars in funding from investors  We don't know how much they sold for in its announcement Toro writes joining Google will give team members access to more resources and distribution  Allowing them to continue our mission of making the lives of app developers easy I  Think they'll apply it to Google sites at Google properties.

Transcript:  Get in the wagon not dead yet  Google is shuffling engineers in the glass project a new team developing the new version under new leadership  Hmm  So the project graduated out of the Google X  Lab into the hands of Tony Fidel Tony of course went on to other things  Google has been seeding prototypes of Google Glass to glass at work partners  Continues to approach partners, so it's not dead yet  But there is a new fresh  Strategy and we're starting to see posts people like Stephen Lau  He was the according to this article in nine to five Google the face of the secret San Francisco glass foundry developers event  last year or two years ago  engineering technical lead on the glass software team for four years  He was part of the group that built Google Glass and he says it's been a wild and crazy ride  But after three years and eight months, I'm leaving glass to start a new episode of my career over a YouTube  Wow  I

That's 1500 bucks. Oh plus I got the special frames with prescription  I paid for that but  $2,200 done. Yeah, it adds up  But you know if they are seeding any type of new prototypes and such to Google at work partners  That's probably the best possible market they can work with at this point because as a consumer product, it's just not there yet  But I'm sure people want it, but there are a lot of places in vertical markets where it could be handy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fortunately, I picture a whole product team sitting around  So what do we want to do? Let's make it blurry  Using up their  Yeah, it was I know you have to differentiate but that wasn't the way well to be fair blur didn't actually make it blurry

I  Mean really wasn't blurry but this but you got a command now with command them under Rick Osterloh's direction  They are now pure as pure Google as you can get in a company that isn't Nexus and a fun is and that's how they differentiate  It's a great way to do it  Mobile World Congress starts in a couple of days. We've got Miriam Jwar flying out tomorrow  Mike Elgin flying out I think Saturday  The Congress officially begins March 1st, but there's of course press conferences  All of the big phone manufacturers have big announcements. Maybe not Motorola. I guess they've shot their wad, but  We expect to hear more about the Google. I mean the Samsung Galaxy s6  Looks beautiful  We've all seen the teaser I'll play it one more time. You probably played it yesterday and all about Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Colors will live and things will fly and it's just a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Kevin Kevin if this were the first smartphone you ever saw  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would feel like one of the monkeys staring at the monolith  I agree with you, but we've seen phones for how many years now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And when you actually see images of the phone, this is from an XTA forum  In bubble wrap

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know, it's a gal what's our bet is this gonna be I mean $1100 is is this gonna be  the Samsung gonna  redeem itself I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't know Kevin you cover this don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm shaking my head because they've taken such a beating lately because they focus so much on the high end  They've crammed so many features and things and starting with the galaxy s4  You know, I'm thinking there'll be three three different additions here Jeff to this in terms of price  You know the dual the dual display the display try display. That's try display. I displayed both left and right side and front  You know, so all three of your eyes can see things on the phone  That may be very expensive. Yes, because of the curved glass on both sides  But I would imagine there's gonna be a standard galaxy s6 edition. That's much more reasonable in price  You know, I think the bigger thing here for them is to get rid of all their touch with bloatware  Which remember is they have done that also talk of Microsoft apps pre-installed which is good for Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that idea. I do like it that they would not replace the Google apps, right? They would just replace the Samsung apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they can replace the Google apps by licensing agreement. No, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that would be nice because who needs the Samsung calendar the Samsung anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only thing disturbs me when I try to fix help a friend with a Samsung phone is that it's just so off-putting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know even the settings I can't find anything on it, right? Well now let me say this I do use a note for it's  My daily driver it is in many respects the best hardware out there many would agree the best camera phone out there  I  You know, I love the stylus and I love the screen is there's no better looking screen at the edge  I played with the edge for a while that does not woo me  But that's a good hardware device and they to their credit Samsung's backing off a little bit on touch  Whiz bit by bit if you add your own launcher and and then a lollipop skin, you could almost feel think you were using lollipop  Do you see any benefit to the you know added curve no, no, I played with the edge screen it was crazy  It didn't make any sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you imagine a benefit? I just want to should ask is can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I imagine a benefit a benefit that they sold at their  Announcement which is that you're sitting in a meeting. You've got the phone on the table in front of you and you can read the edge  Except that the way they've set it up the edge is upside down that way  Ah  And there is there was no way to turn it around and I thought well, wait a minute this I guess if you put the phone  No, there's no way to read it  You had it was like why is it upside down? You're supposed to look at it like this  That makes no point of it was an extra navigational. Oh, yeah. Well and you can and you can have little bubbles  Come up the side that was kind of there's like screensavers on it  It is an extra navigational so there's little icons there, but I don't find that particularly useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also one-handed. I mean if you're right or left-handed  It's gonna depend on if you can actually use the device or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well imagine now with three screens they want to have it wrapping around on each side

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then you have to be what kind of hand would that I'll have the thing strapped to me sitting in front of my face  And I'll use both hands to drive on the phone. I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So  But I know waterproof to be  To be fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Miriam was telling me that she has talked to people who have seen the  Trifold design and say it's surprisingly elegant and attractive I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can oh I can imagine that but you know, I told you on the show  I think last week we were for last the problem I have with every phone  I have including my Nexus 6 is when I pick it up  I've got to go through this whole you know little ballet to figure out whether it's  Right inside up or upside down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I mean the Samsung devices do have physical home buttons  So it is actually easier to do that than it is on many other true true  That would be a selling point. I know I hate the idea of a physical home button. I just think that's so pathetic  Here by the way from Samsung Norway  Are some pictures the Samsung Galaxy s6 will not look like  And I at least there's the Norwegians had some some funny senses of humor about this  they had some images of  Let me see if I can this is rumor six  Samsung is expected to release a flexible foldable phone  How can I see the other rumors the left arrow? Is it the left one? Yeah, here's oh, yeah  Here's rumor five an all-glass galaxy. These are the concept drawings. You see all the time on the internet  I like them, but they made their own it is rumored that the next galaxy will feature a larger display  That's a blue blueprint  Three sides, this is the three side first the Pono Galaxy it looks like a Pono player and the new galaxy is expected to be durable  This is one with forward-facing stereo speakers. I think that's for you Kevin and your Beatles collection  It's the Firefly edition bug to me or something. I like I like it that they had a sense of humor about it  We'll find out we're gonna have coverage of the Samsung event the LG event the HT. I like the m9 the new HTC  Both of these will be using the snapdragon. Actually, I don't know the s6 will not be using the strap snapdragon 810  That's a nose. They'll be using their own  octo octo core Exynos  But the one m9 will be and I think many others will are you an Xperia fan you mentioned that you like the X

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  X3 the experience III actually like it. It's all it's completely waterproof. It's plays high-res audio  Nice camera 20.7 megapixel Sony sensor  It actually has the same internals as the Moto X the 2014 Moto X. So it's it's not bad  I you know, it's not bad at all. It's just Sony has never had the carrier support here that the other brands have  So that's they announced they're getting out of the business now, right? There's talk about that  yeah breaking that out and selling it off and getting out of that business, but  There was was a leaked experience e4 tablet. That's apparently coming out at Mobile World Congress  They're not completely done yet. Good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. I hope so  Pebble did announce an or a Kickstarter to raise money for a new pebble watch  Back to the well again pebble, of course raised ten million dollars.

Transcript:  Over ten yet, they only launched it two days ago. I wouldn't be surprised it went to three your day morning  What's a five million almost it's called pebble time?  Yeah, almost ten there at nine point six million dollars and this really just shows you that people now treat Kickstarter as a pre-order system

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah in a marketing in a dry area. Yeah

Transcript:  Which pebble pebble was taken to task on their reddit AMA today for good  Yeah, well I kind of I see both sides to this one  I mean, yes Kickstarter shouldn't be for projects that are readily to you know, ready for sale and such  But the flip side is pebble said look, you know if we go to a big box store  You know, we've got to deal with their marketing and so on this builds buzz for us in our user base  Okay, I get that also the big box stores want a 50% profit margin on these devices and such pebble through Kickstarter  They're just paying a little fee to Kickstarter and the payment processing so they're in best five pebbles in Best Buy  They yes. Yes, they are and they will be again with pebble time  But they're trying to get as much bang for the buck and as much profit margin out as they can in the first  31 days with this Kickstarter project. So yeah, I mean, you know those profits to Best Buy is a smart question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what the real clock is what the real countdown is to the Apple watch release  They're trying to get as much of the as they can  Yeah right now before the Apple watch is out because once it's out  I have a feeling all the oxygen is gone from the room for every other smartwatch  Of course, if you're an Android user, what are you gonna do? You're gonna exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's I actually backed the pebble time. I did not back the originals. I got review units  I backed the pebble time because I switched between Android and iOS on a weekly basis

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna switch back to iOS just so I can use an Apple watch  I bought the original pebble on Kickstarter and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty quickly gave up on it. I bought you know what I did. I bought it and then I  Saw all the grousing about it. I sold it for a profit on eBay. Nice job. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice job  There are people who love their pebble watches  You know, there's some it you'd only have to charge it once a week  This one's gonna be color the old one wasn't  So we'll see mobile World Congress is is I think now the most interesting show much more so than CES  So we'll see a lot of good stuff coming out of there and I will look forward to  To seeing that including probably some new Android wear devices  What else  Twitter's while you're away feature. I do not like this is now on Android it was on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  IOS yet. Yes, we have to change the app or I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't like it. I don't like it one bit the idea being though  See to me the thing that Twitter taught us that was a valuable lesson  Was that you don't have to read everything when I first started using Twitter  I tried to read everything I'd missed and pretty soon that becomes untenable and you realize quickly that's the way life is  That's the way the internet is it is a stream a river of information  You can't possibly gulp the entire stream. So dip in and dip out and that's fine. It's okay  You can't it's okay to miss things

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Twitter apparently has decided no when I'm away from Twitter. I'm away for a reason. I don't need to go back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What people were talking about now during the Oscars and that and that's where snapchat obviously changes the paradigm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right stuff dies  But you know what I have to say I got away from doing snapchat only because I want to create stuff that people can read

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After 24 hours. Yeah, I feel like it's a lot of work  Well, I wonder if that's I was thinking about that today Leo  Is that kind of an old fart thing where we care about archives and file cabinets and stuff like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is is that just an old habit of ours? I think if you're okay some content really has no shelf life  Yeah, Katie Couric's news updates on snapchat ESPN  sports on  There's no shelf life, but I like to think the stuff that we do  I mean, I admit it doesn't have a year shelf life. Although TV shows I made in Canada ten years ago are still airing  This I do not recommend but I would hope that we we consider that our shows have at least a week's shelf life  24 just seems too short for me  Especially if I'm gonna put some effort into you know, creating a video and stuff like that  So tomorrow's the big day  It's okay. I finally figured out what we're talking about the net neutrality thing the FCC commissioners will gather and  Will vote  It is expected certainly the proposal in front of them is that the FCC adopt title to regulation of broadband providers making them a utility  Allowing the FCC see the real problem has been that con you know Congress didn't give FCC explicit  Control over Internet service providers the FCC tried to implement open Internet rules  Verizon sued and won and the court told the FCC no Verizon's right. You don't have a mandate from Congress to do this unless  You do it if you invoke title to  The Telecommunications Act and say that they are common carriers  Then you would they the judge clearly in this decision the judge has really clearly said  Title to and Tom Wheeler fought it back and forth now for a long time  I thought wow, this is great. Tom Wheeler is listening to the people and  Then I realized  This has nothing to do with the people  this has everything to do with which lobbyist brought the biggest chunk of change to the table and  so for a long time the cable companies the wireless companies ruled the roost then Google and Facebook and  Microsoft decided some years ago to hire their own lobbyists and get in there and this all this shows is a  Changing of the guard in Washington DC  Politics the money is now coming from Silicon Valley in greater amounts than it's coming from the broadband providers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't think the political pressure of not the people of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing. Nothing. No, we're people. I  Real I had an epiphany yesterday. I  Realize because their New York Times had a great article on how the big internet companies had lobbied for this and that's really and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, but others like like was a free press and  EFF and Mozilla and others I think had some objections to that because they were saying hey we had a role

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Overstating their role. I know there were I mean there were five million comments to the FCC. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were I love the part. I didn't know what this the 30  Top FCC executives our officials got got 50,000 phone calls  awesome that their direct numbers were were were  hacked and found awesome. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also see which is very interesting a concerted effort from conservatives  Including Rush Limbaugh and others to fight this to say whoa, hold on there, but they're a little late

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think they missed the boat. Well, that's gonna be it'll be fought in court now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, of course Verizon and AT&T is already prepared its brief now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You saw if you saw I added this to the rundown right before that now Google the 11th hour is trying to  Get a change in the regulation. Yeah, what do they want?  I think what I think the way I read it and I could be wrong here  I need you to read this and see I think basically what they're saying is the peer to peer  Charges made to the likes of Google and Netflix are not neutral  So they're trying to go not just from the front-end consumer and to define neutrality  But also at the back end to define neutrality

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the I would love to help write the articles on the financial times which are behind a paywall and since I am  Not a subscriber. I cannot read this article on mine. I just had to answer a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Survey question and I was in oh  survey says

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boxer  Enter your email address  Select an access level. Well  free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you were you register you get you get some number you get alpha bill plus selected blogs you don't get the news I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have the minimum of 645 a week. Yeah  Hmm. Oh, yeah, sign up for quick access to three articles per month  Three per month, I don't want to even give them my information screw them  I'm not gonna read their articles there, but they put it behind a big old brick wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google  In its filing Google said the regulator risked encouraging broadband providers to try to charge companies such as Google and Netflix for sending content  Through their pipes while the same broad broadband groups already charged retail customers for internet access. Does that sound like a peering issue?  Such an outcome would defeat the purpose of net neutrality rules. Google said in the FT  Its effort has revealed cracks in Silicon Valley support

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What this shows remember Google kind of held back lobbying on this yes  Although you could probably say they let their packs do it  You know, they kind of they let the companies do it a little bit more anonymously  But I think what this is about is the so-called forbearance provisions  One of the things people were very worried about with title two  I myself included is that it does allow the FCC to do things we don't want it to do like for instance  Set prices and charge right which the FCC has said they won't do and so there's a doctor  And called forbearance which the president proposed that the FCC adopting the FCC agreed to that says we're gonna enforce these but not those  We're gonna choose here and not there one of the items  I remember in the forbearance was this peering stuff that we won't mess with this work. Well, so so the the key paragraph

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In explanation net neutrality centers on the ability of broadband providers to control video streaming other content delivered to consumer screens  But Google's lobbying is about a different set of relationships the informal back-end links between  Broadband providers and content providers and that's the Netflix. That's the Netflix

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  cogent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds like Google is trying to say  Okay, what that what this we're winning. Let's let's go the next step. Well, Google doesn't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ISPs like Comcast to charge it for access to me. Oh, is that but it also doesn't want  YouTube is the bit I would guess is a big one. Yes, it doesn't want YouTube  to have to it wants to make deals with let's say cogent or  Comcast to have access to the network or to have appropriate peering. I consider that all part of fast lane  I'm not sure exactly  What they're talking about here? I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But here's the odd thing about it. So Austin schlick Google's director of communications law  Talked about this is a practice of double recovery that could do serious long-term  Harvard the virtual circle of Internet innovation blah blah blah blah, right?  A large right then a lobbyist for another big Silicon Valley group  Said quote here. You see that Google is not a big supporter of net neutrality. Everyone thinks it is  Well, they're why they're trying to just make it even more neutral where you can't charge anybody for anything special

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is so complicated. It is that I don't think anybody understands it including the FCC  I think that's one of the reasons big money wins  Because they know that the public really doesn't have any idea what's going on  I think what's really interesting to me also is how the tone has shifted once the right-wing demagogues  Started to wait like Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and Rush limbo started weighing in on this. They  Really galvanized their base and all of a sudden even in our chat room  Which was once very strongly in favor of title to people are horrified by the notion including our care for the including Mark Cuban  horrified about the notion of title to regulation  It's a mess

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is but you know, I still think this Leo I still think that the telcos and cable companies brought it on themselves  Absolutely  If they hadn't tried to screw us this wouldn't have been an issue. The reason this is an issue is because you greedy  bastards  Tried to nickel-and-dime us make us think you're your prisoners in a case where there wasn't competition you went overboard  Power corrupts absolute power corrupts  Absolutely monopolies corrupt and and you did it to yourselves  if you had if you had come up with your own standards of decent behavior long ago and held to them and  Given us decent service without this kind of crap. This wouldn't have happened  It came up only because you're a holes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree and some who blame the FCC for creating the duopoly we have  ignore the fact that they were pressured into it by the big cable companies in the  And the telephone companies who said well in that case we're not gonna invest and so you'll notice that in the language  Chairman Wheeler has used he's he's very much trying to have it both ways  Well, we want to make sure there's incentive for the broadband providers to invest  We'll make sure that they can make money, but we also want to make sure that the internet is not  Divided up into you know fast lanes and the best internet goes to the highest bidder  Content creator and I agree with that  The  Next day I'll wait the other thing that he suggested and I think this is really good  I see good movement from the FCC on this is that there should be competition  I think that ultimately that's the only real solution  Amen, and he one of the things he said is we're gonna stop  we're gonna stop these companies from from getting state legislatures to block municipal Wi-Fi and  That's a I think it's a huge part of it. We've talked about that before it sounds like  Apparently I say Chattanooga and that's not how you say it's Chattanooga  But anyway Chattanooga in Chattanooga, I know it's Balmer, but apparently Chattanooga in Chattanooga  They have a very good very successful gigabit  municipal internet access  And this is the kind of thing that cities could foster that would create competition and be very it would solve the problem  We'll have to wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This means for a while frankly, I also have a link up on the rundown that Google has now said to cities  Treat us better, you know be get rid of your stupidity and you can attract us  For fiber. Yeah, but if you don't make it hard for us, right? The first thing I said is get rid of your fax machines  For all this regulatory BS. Yeah, come on people  Love that story  Isn't that great?  I also love that. There's a Verizon ad there on the yeah Google Fiber story. Oh, yeah right there on Google  Who is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, might take a couple of days to go 5,000 feet one of them might, you know do a bouncing trick or something like that  I don't know. So I have one other number which I enjoyed so  Google a company that it bought  Has created the machine that taught itself how to play and win at 49 classic games  Which means people that we finally invented the machine that can waste its own time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute wait a minute I want to see what that tell me what I want this  This is a machine that can teach itself. It's an AI software. It's AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That gets adept at playing 49 retro games and comes up with his own winning strategies  Interesting shall we play a game? I think that's what whopper did isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't I don't remember the touring test having anything to do with video games with long  It's deep mind that's the British company they bought as I remember the touring test you have to convince someone you're a teenage boy

You know, the best thing to do. That's it  No, come on deep mind, you know the best thing to do that's it get in the back  Oh, I love that it goes and goes and goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think of the Xbox one achievement points I can get with this. Oh, man. Actually, it's quite good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But of course a computer is good at this. That's the whole point. It can never miss. I  mean really

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got better reflexes. I track there kind of knows where that little balls it knows where it's going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's talking to its brother computer  By the way, they cut that video short. I'm wondering  Did it win or did it lose?  It's still playing  It never ends I played so much breakout I can actually hear the sound of that ball going  So you were talking about a clean reading mode in chrome. This is for mobile. It's called flinks  And I think it's very interesting. This is for android they were in a public beta for a long time. It's now out  um  Allows you to modify  Your  Default browser on here, although you don't have to to use it  It's kind of like pocket in that it can save articles out and it saves them without ads, which is awfully nice  although i'm sure the  Creators of the blogs won't be uh, too happy to hear that and it does the saving in the background  So you can continue browsing i've had it set up for instance to use twitter  So if I see a link on twitter in fact, that's what he's going to do right now  When he opens that link on twitter the flinks bubble pops up he continues to browse twitter  But flinks meanwhile is saving that article  To the browser the flinks browser, which he'll then be able to go to and read it in a clean formatted  Fashion kind of a medium style read  Uh on the phone  So I I thought this was kind of a nice little app. I think it's free  fl y n x for android  um and uh  I like it a lot. I don't have you guys tried flinks  Nope ring a bell. I have not i'm a i'm a pocket user, but yeah, I use pocket like crazy  um, and I don't know if this would eliminate the need for pocket because it does  It does allow you to do sharing outside so you can continue to share it a pocket if uh, if you want afterwards  So it's really more I I use it more  Not like pocket, which is lets me read everything at the end of the week  I use it more to kind of in a get in a news gathering mode on the on the device  In that single session so you save it all out and then you go and you can read it and then continue to share it  Back to pocket or whatever you want  I actually share it to a  Pinboard most of the time because that's where our links come from for our show  I just thought it would be worth taking a look at I also have to say with my early impressions on the moto e  If you have somebody you don't want to you want to get them an android device  You don't want to spend a lot of money or if you're a google developer  An android developer who does not want to spend six or seven hundred bucks for a nexus six  This is a pure google experience. It'd be uh  Perfect for that 150 bucks. I'm very impressed  just with the first day of  using this um  Amazing what you can do for 150 bucks these days. This is the new second generation  A moto e which both kevin and I got along with our little paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rick australo in the mail this morning. So so the the advances in phones really  Are not in new features and new things because they've kind of that has been terribly new  It's it's going to be in getting it cheaper and cheaper and cheaper  Battery better and better and better. No

Transcript:  I think there's other places like the the chromebook because the conversation we had yeah, that's your other place

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can you can have high end but there's only so far you can go now. That's why watches I think there's more things  That's why watches. Yeah, that's my wearables  you know my theory I keep on saying on the show is I think that the  The phone itself is going to be an accessory  To to a computer that you you just constantly have that that it itself then communicates with all kinds of screens and devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And all kinds of things that you wanted to happen. Well, I finally, uh got my order in for the amazon echo  um having played with it now, um  That have you this  I asked for it and I haven't gotten the invitation to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spoil sport so my amazon echo purchase expired on january 13th. See you didn't see the invite  But this is insane. I signed into amazon. I'm on amazon literally every day  Why didn't they say on the amazon site? Hey jeff want to buy this? I almost missed it, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
