By the way, if you're watching the show and you were here on Sunday  and you left your nice Google baseball hat, Mr. Google, I think Larry Page is in the audience.  We have it. We'll hold on to it for you. Joining us now to talk about Google in the cloud, from  right to left, Gina Tripani, from SmarterWear.org, founding editor at Lifehacker.  Host also of All About Android. Hello Gina. Hello. Good to be here. And new mama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How's that? She's wonderful. She's just cuter every day. Oh, gosh. How's she looking in the  Google Glass? She looks good, right? Oh, man. I cannot wait to use that on her. I just cannot,  because she definitely smiles a lot more when, you know, direct eye contact. So I haven't gotten my  pair yet, but she's absolutely going to be my first, you know, we're just going to do a hangout  with grandma. Mom is looking at you. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm sure she's going to be like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what is that thing on your face? I don't recognize my mother. She doesn't have a bump over her  eyebrow. Joining us also, Kevin Marks. Hey, Kevin, good to see you. Tummelvision.tv. He's  over at Salesforce now, but he's been at Google. He's been at Apple. He's been at British Telecom.  He's been everywhere. I've been everywhere, man. I get around. Right now he's in his garden.  That's right. Any  sort of song is my fault. I love it. Are you kidding? That really adds to the show. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  look at those oranges back there. It brings a natural feel to the show. It matches our wussy theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our theme's not so bad. I can't imagine Steve Gilmore ever using anything like that.  Also here, Aaron Newcomb of Oracle fame, but he's going to disclaim himself. Right. He's  wearing a Raspberry Pi t-shirt, which I'm really digging. Yeah, everybody should get one. He also  is a part-time host at Floss Weekly, our open source show. Great to have you. Floss Weekly. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was on All About Android last night in Jason's absence. Jason had a baby. We got to do Breaking  News last night. It was really fun. 3 PM Pacific last night, right before the show, Stacey had the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  baby. Jason watched. And the baby's name is Savannah, for those of you who were betting.  We knew it began with an S. Isn't that a great name? Great name. Yeah. And she is such a cutie.  Yeah. Yeah. And it's good too. I love the new baby names. They're kind of old-fashioned and  sweet. And I just love them. Yeah. Love them. So I got to say, speaking of Glass, we're seeing a  lot of pictures now from Robert Scoble and everything is just from his point of view,  right? So it's slightly tilted and at a weird angle and great for taking baby pictures. I'm  not saying that, Gina, but I got to tell you, if we're all of a sudden just going to be a world  full of Google Glass shot photos, I'm not going to be happy. They're just weird looking. Yeah. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mean, you know, it's not high art photography, right? But Scoble's, here's the sad thing. Scoble

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is a really good photographer. So instead of using his camera now, he's taking a lot of pictures from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  his right eyebrow. Yeah. It's a quality versus quantity thing, right? I actually haven't seen  Scoble's. At some point, I just sort of unsubscribed. I'm looking him up on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seen, just hashtag seen through Glass. I guess I'm thinking this must be done automatically  whenever you take a picture. Is it seen through Glass or... Oh, now that didn't come up with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anything. On cheap Glass? Well, he's using the hashtag through Glass. Through Glass, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that must be done automatically. So if you do the hashtag through Glass,  you'll see a lot of pictures taken through Glass. Wow. There's one that's just a blur. But some

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of these are kind of cool. I mean, there's one where he's on stage and you can kind of see the  entire audience. Yeah. That gives me the butterflies just looking at it. You don't like public speaking?  I don't. I don't. I mean, I do the show partially because I want to get over my fear of getting up  on stage, but doing the show is a different thing than getting up on stage. Oh yeah, come on. We're  biologically programmed to feel like we're about to get trampled by a herd of blood-sucking enemies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one thing I know nothing about. I actually... Oh, you're a natural. I don't say anything  unless... My ex-wife used to say, you don't talk unless there's a hundred people listening.  You're a special breed, Leo. I was born to be in front of a live audience.  Apply to the internet, unfortunately. So I'm guessing that this tag through Glass is automatic  because you can't type. And I'm sure somebody's not hashtagging all these. So yeah, go to Google Plus,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hashtag through Glass. Oh yeah, if you run the search, there's quite a few through Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so this is a good example of one where you can see the point of view is somebody's right eyebrow.  I mean, it always is. And I'm just... I don't know if this is... I mean, I guess what it has is it's  kind of got that photojournalism, you know, immediacy. Right. Yeah. At some point there was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a taken through Glass hashtag which Vic Gundotra used, but it looks like they should have just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and that makes sense because you don't want to take up, you know...  Yeah, I'm seeing lots of Googlers using through Glass.  Through Glass. It must be the...  It must be automatic.  ...default because you can't... You're not going to type.  The... For one... It's five megapixels. The image quality is fine.  Oh, good. Let's see... Steve Lee shot... I want to see video. Let's see what the video looks like.  This is apparently at Disneyland, California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because most of the video we've seen has been in the commercial. It's been highly edited.  Right.  Oh, I did see this one. This is actually pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is first person on the... This thing... I think you get up to 90 miles an hour in the  beginning of the... It's like catapulted.  This is a roller coaster?  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah, you get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just made for Glass, right? Like this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except you only get the first 10 seconds.  Oh, no. There was another one with the whole thing.  No, I think it just restarted.  Yeah, California Adventure.  Oh, it just restarted? Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, my son went on this a few years ago. He came off it. His hair was sticking straight up.  There it goes.  Oh my God. This is the only way you're ever getting me on this.  This looks like a fun ride.  Yeah, this is cool.  It's like a rail gun. Exactly. Yeah.  It's an amazing thing. You get up to, I don't know, 90 miles an hour in two seconds. Zero to 90 in...  ...two seconds. Makes your hair stand up.  This is a very good use of Glass, because you're not going to hold a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I went on the Cyclone in Coney Island years ago and brought my digital elf and  shot video and sort of took the risk of just dropping it at some point. And it came out great,  but it was... I didn't get caught by the attendants and I risk losing the camera. I mean,  this is really cool. This is a good use of Glass. But the reality is most people are not doing  anything like, you know, things like this every single day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I also have to wonder if Disney knew that he had a camera, would they have taken it away from  And how long before they start looking for Glass?  Well, maybe a long time, according to Eric Schmidt. Google's been saying end of the year,  Eric Schmidt, I don't know if he made a mistake or if he let slip, not till next year. He said,  about this time next year.  Is the world going to suffer?  Or will we all be greatly relieved? By the way, there have been... I have a pair of glasses that  have a camera right over the nose. And, you know, I mean, it's called the pivot head.  And it's been around for a while.  But is it Wi-Fi enabled? I mean, can you share and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no. It just records to memory and then you take it off.  And you have to... Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Did you see Tim O'Reilly's commentary on Glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'd love to see it. Now, here's a guy I trust. If Tim says it's good, I want to know.  What did he say? Me too. Me too. I put it in the rundown here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He loved it. He said it's a magical experience. Yeah, he said, a huge grin. It's been a long time  since a tech gadget had me grinning ear to ear so often. It's not at all what people expect.  It's a magical experience. I mean, this is a guy he's obviously in love. Yeah. Yeah. And he...  I haven't been able to quite put my finger on why it feels that way, but I think it's the immediacy.  This is exactly what Brynn was saying. Rather than fumbling for your phone, opening the camera app,  you take a picture or video with a touch and share it with another touch. You can talk to the advice,  taking pictures, doing Google searches, getting directions without ever touching the device.  So, you know, this was the emasculator. This is what he was supposed to... He was trying to get to  when he said it's emasculating. Sorry, Brynn. But I like this post by Tim O'Reilly because I  trust him as well. He's not... You know, he doesn't... He criticizes when things are wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. He is not... So, there's a category of people that I just love everything new,  and he's not one of them. He's not one of them. He's very thoughtful. And he kind of... He listed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a couple of things. He said, you know, people have this notion that it's privacy invading. It really  isn't. It's very easy to see when the device is on. The lit up screen is viewable from the other side.  So, on Talk to You with Glass On, you can tell when it's on. And he says, yes, you can quickly  take a photo, but either with the voice command or push the button on the frame. So, it's clearly  noticeable. Now, it's interesting that he said that because there were some stories this week  as someone dug into some code and saw that there's an eye wink gesture, right? So, it's possibly you'll  be able to wink and take a photo. That does not sound like it's enabled right now in the Explorer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  edition that Tim had on. And it may never be enabled because I think that that is one of the  sensitivities people have is that you could be taking a picture without anybody knowing. You know,  even on some cameras now, by law or by Fiat, they make a loud audible noise when you take a picture  on some camera phones and you can't turn it off. I think that that seems to be societally acceptable.  You know, what Tim just described is exactly the experience people had with something like the iPad.  Where on paper, I remember this, when the iPad was announced, I went to the demo room and handled  it. The people who just had heard about it and seen the presentation were much more skeptical  than those of us who held one. And it's not unusual for a technology, the appeal of it,  not to be apparent until you use it. And then you go, oh, it is magical.  So, I've been very skeptical of Glass. I may have to rethink this. I may not get it because,  unfortunately, Google's being somewhat restrictive about who can have it. So,  Kevin, you didn't buy one when you were at Google I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't because I was there impersonating you.  So, Sian, I wish you had now.  No, it didn't work. I had to show more forms of ID and give them a credit card that had the same  name on it and stuff. This isn't going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, what I did is Jason Howell was there from All About Android, a producer of TNT,  and I said, Jason, get it and I'll pay for it. Well, it looks like I'm never going to see it  because it's now tied to Jason. Google's being very finicky about they are preventing  loaning of it even. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You can't give it to someone and they'll say they'll turn it off. They'll say, we have the  ability to turn off the device if you do this. If you give it to someone else or loan it or give  it to anybody, we will turn off the device is what it says in the terms of service  that you have to agree to. I don't like this at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this just for the Explorer edition or you feel like this is going to be the case going forward?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't do that with something people buy for real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like the peanut dollars is buying it for real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do too. That's the thing is if you pay $1,500 for a device like this, granted,  it's for early access and stuff, but that really rubs me the wrong way to say we will turn off  your device if someone else signs into it or logs on with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's within their rights, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've had prototypes of things like this before, but that was for prototypes where you weren't  actually wearing them in public. I've had prototypes from Apple before I worked there,  which meant that we couldn't take them out of the room and things. I've had prototypes from  game development companies. We had early access to a console where you get some  like version of a console that isn't finished yet. You have these kinds of things, but it's  a bit weird applying it to something that is actually being worn all around in public

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and walking around with it. My initial reaction is maybe this is to prevent a lot of scalping on  eBay because people have tried to sell it for thousands of dollars on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like this thing is just not ready. Tim was saying there are certain things you can do.  You can't call someone and choose their phone number if they have a home number and a mobile  number set up. He had trouble. I think he had trouble getting SMS. He said the Explorer edition  is pretty buggy and clearly not ready for consumer adoption. Part of it might be just like,  hey, we want to give it to developers. When I was standing in line at Google I.O. last year  to sign up for Glass, the woman there, the Google representative was saying to us,  just so you know, this is for people who are actually going to develop on the device. What  are you guys going to do with it? This is for academic research purposes only. She was really,  really stressing that this was not about playing with a new toy. It feels like they loosened up on  it though. They released that commercial of the ballerina and the bubbles and the kid. They made  it seem much more consumer friendly, but I think this Explorer edition is actually just, I think  they're trying to get developers to build for it. Of course they would say that though. If you look

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at the terms of service on the Google website, it doesn't say this is an early adopter thing,  this is a review unit. It doesn't say anything like that. It's just Glass terms of sale.  So by purchasing the device, this is what you agree to. But it isn't a gather or review unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is for developers. And of course I want to use it as a review unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the point. I think they're trying to do a developer release. And so this agreement  looks like what you get when you've got prototype hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although remember now when they did the contest on Twitter,  they didn't make people be developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I suspect they're dancing back and forth with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I have to point out that despite the fact that I have a lower number  of developers, well, Jason has a lower number than either Scobel or Drew Olenoff, both of whom have  received their Glass, that they did in fact jump to journalists ahead in line. Scobel and Olenoff  are not developing for it. They're journalists and they're posting like crazy on Google Plus  pictures from Glass. I wouldn't be surprised if this is an internal struggle at Google between  marketing and engineering. I'm a little pissed off because we lined up. I mean, I'm not saying  at least Jason should have it. I can live with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I take back what I said before. There is device specific addendum.  In the addendum, it does specifically say Glass Explorer Edition. And that's where they give those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I doubt very much they would do this with the commercial versions when they sell it next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this must only apply to the early versions. Still, it kind of stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's got to be like a phone, right? You sign in with your Google account.  I mean, this is the thing. If you have the Explorer Edition and someone says,  hey, can I try it? I mean, you hand it to a person. You're signed into your Google account.  Now the person wearing them sort of has full access to your account. It's like trying someone  else's phone when they're signed into all their stuff, but even more personal. So I mean, it just  seems like the production edition is going to let other people sign in the device. But the  Explorer Edition, they just want to keep it mapped to the people who got in. And if I had  a Glass contest, Leo, it was focused on what would you do with Glass? I mean, granted, the bot who  chose the winners was obviously completely arbitrary. I mean, I'm not saying that the  implementation was right, but they framed the contest in like, what would you do if you gave

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you Glass? But not as a developer. So to me, that's proof positive that this program is not just for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  developers. Yeah. They're looking for lots of cool videos and different uses that they haven't,  that they haven't thought of, right? And they want celebrities like Neil Patrick Harris doing  the live tour backstage at How I Met Your Mother and you know, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll do a live tour backstage at Twig. Well, I'm not going to get one, apparently. Now that Jason  is busy with a new baby, I doubt very much he'll get, he's the one who's, I mean, you know, I'll  pay for Jason. If you're watching, I'll pay for it. Wear it. I can't wear it. No one else can wear it,  but you wear it. Take pictures of Savannah, but not of Stacey, because that's not nice.  Anyway, I understand people's upset, but I think it's, if you say this is a very, you know, you're  saying it upfront. If they were then to do this next year and say, oh yeah, you buy it, you use it.  No, that's not going to happen. That probably is illegal, right? Isn't it? You can't say to somebody,  you can buy something, but well, maybe that's exactly what terms of service for software and  books and digital. Yeah. The first-sale doctrine applies to physical goods. It doesn't apply to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the account you got attached to it. So they can still cut you off.  Didn't courts say though that for instance with CDs, because the record industry would love to kill

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the resale or it's too late now, but for some years would have loved to kill the resale of CDs  and tried and the court said, no, no, you can resell something you have.  Right. But there's a court case going on about resale of MP3s, which is much messier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's different. That's digital. It's completely different. Yeah.  But this is a physical good.  Yeah, but you can take every bit off the CD and get a perfect copy of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the courts still ruled that you can resell CDs and nobody can stop you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yes. So I think that that's pretty obvious.  But not MP3s. Not MP3s because there's a pure digital.  Well do you think Eric misspoke or do you think that we're really waiting till next year for Glass?  I think that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's the question.  So I think that's the question.  I think that's the question.  So I think that's the question.  Yeah.  So I think that's the question.  And I think that's the question.  So I think that's the question.  And I think that's the question, is that we're really waiting till next year for Glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it would be a mistake for them to wait.  I mean, they've got all those buzz.  Well, they might have to.  They might have to. You're right.  There may be other things that come out in the mean time, you know.  Right now they've got this niche and they can either fill that niche or someone else is going to do it.  I've already, I mean, how many knockoffs have you seen of Glass?  I mean, they're not the same, but I mean, I've seen like at least five knockoffs.  You can't wait too long.  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The market moves fast.  No.  What's the price point?  But I would think that you would all buy it if it were, say, $399?  $399 was exactly the figure of my head.  I'd buy it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would probably go to $499.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would probably go to $499.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I would probably go to $599.  I would go as high as a high-end smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $1,500 is way too much.  But $399, I could see.  Chat room saying, yes, they'd buy it.  And a lot, you know, some people say $399 is too much.  Others say that's about right.  I think for a first generation, I think that's right on for me anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think it's going to be hard to make less expensive.  Maybe not though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't know what it is.  I think over time they'll be able to get the price down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  It's not got anything particularly magical in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about that screen?  Is that magical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Compared to the screen on the phone, you're holding your hands?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's just a little LCD screen with a prism?  I mean, how is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's way lower res.  It's got a slightly higher image density than that.  It's tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's smaller and easier to make.  Right, easy to make small LCDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've been putting these into wearable  This technology has been around for a long time.  Maybe not quite to the quality that they're using.  But there's been technology around for quite a while  where they project that image.  I remember back in 2002, I was looking into wearable technology  and they had it available then.  Not so hard.  Yeah, I mean, part of the challenge is doing it brightly enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that it's not like  you don't have to wear goggles completely over your eyes  like a classic VR setup.  So you've got something that's bright enough that works as an overlay.  Right, right.  Plus all the sensors.  That's pretty important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the sensors that they put into it to do  potentially the eye blink, take a picture thing  which may or may not be available.  Those types of things  definitely were not available.  And just recently, this sensor technology  has really gone crazy.  Well, we'll see.  All will be revealed in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't know Facebook was doing this.  Facebook is using a new image format  developed at Google Cloud.  And it's a very popular image.  They're using a new image format developed at Google called WebP  that is not compatible with JPEG.  And it's making some people a little irate.  Supposedly WebP...  And you know who's...  It's good we've got you on, Kevin,  because you're an expert on standards  and so forth.  And I imagine you know a little bit about this.  WebP is...  Why would you want to replace JPEG?  Is it smaller?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's...  Potentially it's smaller.  Yeah, I'm not quite sure what...  JPEG is a fairly old spec.  It has certain artifacts that are built in.  And WebP has picked up something slightly...  You know, some newer stuff.  They say it's faster too.  I guess that means it's smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get a slightly better compression.  I think you don't get a lot of benefit from it, really.  You don't get a great deal of...  Compression doesn't follow more thought.  It's almost the opposite.  We've got a thousand times faster  more users than when we were using JPEGs.  And yet we can't compress  more than two to one better.  So compression is actually really hard.  And also horribly tied up with patterns.  So there isn't a lot of massive improvement in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Compression follows Zeno's law,  not Moore's law.  Remember Zeno's paradox?  You get halfway there and halfway there and halfway there  and you never reach the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's about right. It's true.  And WebP...  I haven't looked at it in detail.  What's concerning is it's kind of similar  to what they're doing with  the video, the Google video stuff.  But just a still version of that.  So it's just the inter-frame version of that  without any difference frames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they use as an example is  complex, very complex-ish images.  Water seems to come up a lot.  And they say they're more accurate  when the image is complex.  I'll tell you, I'm looking side by side.  If you're watching the video, you are too.  If JPEG is right, is WebP...  I can't tell a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just don't see a difference in that example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is one much smaller than the other?  If that's the case, then that would make a difference.  Those are fairly identical images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it's recompressed back into JPEG.  Oh, and this is a JPEG?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I assume.  Oh yeah, you know why?  Because only  Chrome can read WebP.  So if you're using any other browser...  Oh, Chrome and Opera.  Opera supports WebP.  I don't understand why they're doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are other compression techniques  that are more interesting.  This is JPEG 2000 stuff  that's actually wavelet-based  and therefore has the ability  to download the first part  and give you a particular resolution  and then keep downloading to get higher resolutions.  And that would be something that would start to make sense.  Now you've got to build a page that works  on different pixel  and if you've got to make it work on  your shiny new phone with 400  and whatever it is DPI and an old phone  that is 72 DPI,  then having something that lets you  download higher resolution ones over time  will be better.  That's how we've had that for 10, 12 years  with JPEG 2000.  What about ping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They sometimes say this is comparable to ping,  because it does have, apparently has  transparency, which ping has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I understand from WebP  is that it's a combination of,  basically it's a combination of JPEG  and PNG. So you get the good  compression of JPEG, but you're still  able to support things like transparency,  which PNG does.  PNG is replacing GIF.  Right, exactly. So you can do  transparency with PNG, but you can't do  transparency with JPEG. So this is kind of a  balance in between.  Is that an alpha channel? Is that it?  Yeah, you get an alpha channel as well.  And it's a 45% reduction in size  when starting with a PNG  and then transcoding  that into WebP.  So there could be, of course it's going to depend  on the image and blah blah blah, but  there could be a significant savings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The issue though is if you go to Facebook and you're using  Chrome or Opera, Facebook  delivers you not a JPEG, but a WebP  image, which you could download, but  you can't open it anything.  And that's kind of, you know, this is why we have  standards.  This, from this article,  good article, by the way,  from Stephen Shankland on CNET,  we have some images, and I'm going to have  to open these in Chrome.  This is an image of sunflowers.  First, let me open the JPEG,  and then open the WebP,  and I have to do this in Chrome.  Here's, and this is from Facebook,  so this is a JPEG version  of sunflowers,  which looks quite lovely,  and this is the WebP.  I'm switching back and forth, but  as you can see,  there's no difference. Now, here's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one on the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is about half the size of the one on the left.  So, now you see why.  Remember,  Facebook's serving lots  of images. I don't know what the...  So those two images were 159K  for the JPEG, and  103K for the WebP.  That's pretty good.  We've had other

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  compression algorithms over the years  that were better at this kind of thing.  So, the JPEG 2000...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, all browsers  support JPEG 2000, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems that JPEG 2000  support is pretty widespread. I've seen it around

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for a long time. It's been around for a while,  but I think there's still  some lurking pattern crap that means it's not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, interesting. And I presume  that Google's other argument for WebP  is that it's unencumbered.  Right. It's like WebM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. That's the point,  is that it's unencumbered. So here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  look at this one. This is a JPEG  compared to WebP. This is almost  50% smaller file in the WebP.  And again, as I flip back and forth,  I don't see any shift at all.  Maybe at a higher  resolution, I might. But that's...  You could see why Facebook would want to do this. That's saving them  50% bandwidth.  But the browsers don't all support it. Only Chrome and Opera.  And worse  of all, of course, you download this  and try to open it in Photoshop, and it's going to go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  huh. Yeah, but that's  easily fixable. You can get a plug in the Photoshop.  Right.  But yeah, JPEG 2000  has got  so far as far as... I'm not sure if it's got  support in everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google has added a WebP  accept header support to Chrome.  So if I  enhance... Enhance.  So this is the waves.  Now this is the waves on the JPEG.  This is the waves on the...  Oh, macro blocking. On the WebP.  Significant macro blocking difference. Right.  You see a lot of chunking. So this is,  of course, when I am zoomed in very  far. So here's...  But that's where you'll see it is in  solid colors. Right. So JPEG  WebP.  Kevin Marks is leaning in  to his laptop.  As if you'd be able to see that over the stream,  you won't be able to, Kevin.  JPEG WebP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like... There's a TV adverts  where they show you, look how good this screen is.  Only as good as your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the reality is that  99.9% of Facebook users  are not trying to open these images in Photoshop  or an external viewer.  They're not going to view it at a size that's larger  than the browser  window. Right. I mean, this is huge  savings for Facebook, and it's going to affect  a very small percentage  of designers or whatever who are perfectly  capable of downloading the plugin.  I mean, it's a little weird, but I  imagine that they save  billions of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. No, this is not insignificant for Facebook.  But as you  say, they could have chosen JPEG 2000.  So I don't know why they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm sorry,  did you say JPEG 2000 was  encumbered or unencumbered? He said slightly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  encumbered. I think it's still encumbered.  I'm not sure. I'd have to go  and read a bunch of stuff. Who owns JPEG?  No one anymore because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the patents have expired. OK, so it's not like  it's the Joint Photographic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Experts Group. Experts Group, right. But it's  old. It's like mid-80s. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sold and nobody cares. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But JPEG 2000  was obviously ratified.  I think it was ratified in 99 and has  a few leftover patents in it. A couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  years left, though, and then we're done.  Twenty years, right?  Yeah, we should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can get submarine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bastards who come and get you. I'm becoming such an  expert on patent law lately. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why. But the difference  between JPEG 2000 and the point of it is  is that it  uses what they call wavelet encoding, which means  you encode a sort of  low-res version image first and then  you successively encode  the differences of that as a sort of higher-frequency  components that you add in.  But also the file format is  designed such that you can stop reading  any point and you've decoded  that level of the image. And if you then read a bit  more, you decode the next level. Oh, that's interesting.  Which means you can now... Really save  bandwidth. So the theory  of that was you could, you know, just as you get,  you could have progressive JPEGs that kind of do that, but actually  have several copies in. This would  give you part of the image and let you  stop. But the problem is you have to know where to  stop. And that's  which means you've got to have your renderer  in the fetch loop, which is not really how the browsers  work. So  it's a sort of  it was a  a solution to that problem  that was designed 15  years ago and it doesn't actually  solve the practical problem of  no, I just want to load  the low-res one at this point because you don't know where to stop.  You have to be decoding  on your read thread, which is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  how the browsers tend to be architected. Yeah, you remember those bad old days where you'd go to a web page, it'd be a progressive download and the picture would be ugly and then slowly get better and better. I don't miss those days. We can do without that. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the point would be, but this is the challenge we've got with web design at the moment, which is because the pixel density of the devices varies so much. A lot.  Yeah, by factors of  This phone is over

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  460 TPI. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, what do you do to that? One answer is you use SVG like I was saying a couple of weeks ago, which is which is a really good answer because it works everywhere. And it literally does work everywhere because all the brands on mobile use support it. But if you actually have an image like that, you know, that you want to want to have extra Christmas in, then you end up having to store multiple versions of it and making that work on the web is still a bit messy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  regulation service that doesn't require GPS. They could say, I see four access points. This one's this strength. This one's this strength. I know where you are. And it's actually a really good service. You have it in your phone. Apple's doing the same thing. There was a company as I said, so I called skyhook that was doing this. Google's mistake. And it was a mistake. I'm convinced was that in the process of looking at these Wi Fi signals, they were capturing a packet or two of data and saving it. Not in any attempt to snoop because in most cases it was encrypted. And if it wasn't, well, then somebody was sending  it through the air unencrypted anyway. And I think even they said that this was this was one guy, the guy who was writing some of the software did this. The bigger Google didn't even know what was going on at the time. In fact, it was the bigger Google that notified Germany and others. Oh, we made a mistake. Sorry about that. Well, this has been going on for a couple of years. This is happened in 2008 to 2010. And Hamburg data regulator Johannes Kaspar,  who had reopened the probe after prosecutors dropped the case, the criminal case last year. In my view, this is one of the biggest data protection rules violations known. Internal control mechanisms have said oh, no, that was Google. They probably didn't say that in German accent. Internal control mechanisms must have severely failed said Google. And so Johannes said, well, I don't care. You're going to give me 145,000 euros, which is a hundred. I really wish Jeff just for the story.  It's $230. It's cigarette money. This is this is money in Larry Page's sofa cushion. However, come on. You know, that's just a blatant grab for it. We want some money. Yeah, it doesn't. It doesn't say in there where how the money is going to get distributed, right? Is it going to get distributed?  Not to the victims. Here's your $3. You use this to improve the infrastructure of the city of Hamburg. I don't know. They didn't say. I doubt very much they're giving it to charity. French regulators levied 100,000 euro penalty in 2011. I'm sure Google kind of is not happy about this. But at the same time, at least it's over. And it's it isn't really a lot of money. I don't know how many minutes of or seconds of adsense revenue.  they will. They were the big people behind adding an elite, according to the San Jose Mercury News, elite corporate jet center at San Jose International Airport. They rent right now. They rent space. Oh, it's pretty. They rent space for the private jets of which they have numerous at is it Moffett Field where the blimp hangers? Yeah, you see when you drive down one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's actually right next door to Google. Yeah, that's the thing. I don't understand. I mean, it's a worried about losing the government contract. It's controversial. Well, it could be. I mean, there says their lease is up and they've got to find someplace else. So so building elite. It's too bad, though, because it is like right next door to Google's headquarters. I'm sure it's way more convenient than driving down to San Jose Airport. But well, they probably what they'll do is they'll store a helicopter at the Google campus that gets them to the airport. Then, yeah, of course, of course, when you got more money than right, Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I told you my my business idea. This was speedboat service from San Francisco Airport to Facebook and Google headquarters because they're both on the water cigarette boats. Richard Branson. I love that.  Is this a business idea or this is just like it's I was just amused by how long it takes to get from San Francisco to Google or Facebook when you fly over them to land there. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could just drop us out of the airplane right here. We'll get out of here. Just give me a parachute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some Google Glass to use on the way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I often think that when I fly south because I fly over Petaluma, if I fly down from Seattle, say I'm home. I'm right here. Just let me out.  The door. I'll jump out.  Eighty two million dollar facility beyond the west side of Moneta, San Jose International Airport.  Not really any any dissent. Some people didn't like the noise idea and so forth. The airport gets three million dollars in rent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That helps pay for the construction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder how many Google employees fly private jets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's just it's just Larry.  Maybe you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Private private small planes, probably more.  This is a this is this is this is corporate, though, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this is these are these are G3s and G6s and that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never got to do it. When I was working at Procter & Gamble, my management did. They would take the corporate jet if they had a meeting that you'd be at in Brussels very quickly.  They would say, hey, is the corporate jet available? And like five of them would get on it. Didn't have to be like the president of P&G or CEO of P&G.  They would just get on and go because it was cheaper. I mean, they've got crews sitting there manning the, you know, maintaining the jets.  And so it was cheaper for them just to get on the corporate jet and go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're of the seven hangars. Five will be used by Google.  The company Blue Sitting Holdings manages aircraft for Larry Page, Sergey Brannon, Google's Chairman Eric Schmidt.  Their private jets are now at Moffett Field.  By the way, they have more than one, as I remember. Larry has a couple, three, maybe four.  We don't know. It's hard to count.  The real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would you need more than one? You can't fly on more than one plane at one time.  Because you can. Because you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you have family and friends who may be flying somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they're used for the other executives and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It must be a nice feeling though. You see, you know, hey, can I have the jet this afternoon?  I'd like to fly to Brussels.  I'll take the blue one.  The blue one. Yeah, I'm in the mood for blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you park my pink Batmobile Tesla in the garage while I do that? Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only issue is that there is a curfew, a flight curfew to protect residents 1130 p.m. to 630 a.m.  for the airport. And there's some concern that these private flights might go during off curfew hours.  There's no evidence that that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they said they're not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. You know, if you got it, flaunt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The birds agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.  I like San Jose airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a nice one if you can fly out of it.  You know, I often think I should be.  It's a trendy view.  It's pretty. It's empty.  Like most of San Jose, you go to San Jose, you go, does anybody live here?  Because it's a beautiful city.  But the streets are deserted.  It's like a zombie plague hit it a couple of years ago and then nothing.  Is it? Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I agree. I completely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have light rail, but it's always empty.  You know, there's these trains going by.  There's not even a driver.  Unless it's rush hour.  I mean, unless I guess I think that's what it is.  Everybody's inside working so hard trying to keep the economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other thing about San Jose is if you look at it, if you like,  if you go up, look at it from above, it looks like trees because right.  It was all orchards and they kept a lot of the trees.  I mean, none of the buildings very high except downtown.  So it's very odd.  Primarily prune orchards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, the big mall in San Jose is called the prune yard.  Yeah. But it's you know, I live in San Jose for a few years.  It's where I started my career in radio and I actually enjoyed living there.  I was there in the  must have been the late 70s, early 80s during the, you know, an apple boom.  It was just it was really exciting time to live there.  But I go back there now and, you know, you go to the computer museum.  There's some it's a beautiful little town and it just feels like it's  it's kind of quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it is very strange.  I don't know if it's overbuilt or what.  The climate's lovely.  I mean, I think it expanded at the wrong time.  Yeah. And so it's very, very spread out and suburban  and very hard to get anywhere without driving. Right.  And the downtown doesn't really make much sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Mike said owning a jet for Larry Page is like me  owning a used Huffy that I got from Goodwill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a couple of bucks.  Give me a jet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good I think that's an apt analogy and probably pretty accurate.  Google has a new ad size, richer user engagement,  they say, which means you can't avoid it.  It is 970 pixels tall, no wide.  I'm sorry, by 90 pixels tall.  I said that was in my browser.  No, 970 is pretty wide, isn't it?  I think I thought 960 was the standard.  I know it's probably nonstandard.  Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.  Maybe I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought 960 was the standard width, though.  Well, how wide is your I guess on modern screens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you're assuming it's going to be no more than 10,  I mean, no smaller than 1024.  Nobody runs 800 by 600 screens anymore.  Except me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, what I do is I run the browser in part of my screen  and I have another window open on the left.  That's right. That's right.  I'm not as you shouldn't assume people are going full screen.  No, that's right.  And that means everyone's, you know,  half the pages that are stupidly designed  end up getting scroll bars on the bottom,  including Google, because they assume that,  oh, if you're on a computer, you must have 1024 pixels wide.  No, I didn't want it full screen you today.  Right.  And it's frustrating.  But is this really news?  Do we care about this?  No, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just look at it.  It's in the rundown. I'm reading it.  We're going to take a break.  Let's talk. All right.  You know what's in the news?  It should be in the news.  Google Now and Google.  It should be in the news.  Google Now and your home page.  I like this.  I can't wait.  But first, a word from Squarespace.com.  When you're talking about websites and well-designed websites,  Squarespace leaps to mind.  Why?  Because all their designs,  and they have many templates to choose from  when you go to Squarespace.com,  are what we call responsive design.  They adjust automatically to the size of  not only the screen they're on, but the window they're in.  So you always see a beautiful page, you know,  that is just right for whether it's an iPhone 5  or a 27-inch display or bigger.  Squarespace is everything you need to create an exceptional website,  the great hosting from Squarespace.com,  and the great content management software.  And now Squarespace Commerce,  you can add a store to any Squarespace website  and immediately start selling.  It is a very powerful, very flexible,  really nicely implemented commerce solution.  Works with every Squarespace template,  digital or physical goods.  They help you in so many ways.  They calculate taxes for you.  They track orders.  They provide customer email updates.  They print shipping labels.  You can do coupons so easily.  Happens all the time.  People will come on the show and say,  well, I'd like to give a coupon for my product.  And they say, I have to call the engineers.  We'll have it, you know, in a few hours.  No, with Squarespace, you go in, click a box, it's done.  Squarespace.com, an amazing place for your next website.  I want you to try it for you.  You don't need a credit card.  You don't need to give them any personal information,  just squarespace.com.  Click the get started button, pick a template,  import your existing content from almost any other website.  They've got API based importers from Blogger  and WordPress and TypePad.  Just a really, and by the way, the import is amazing.  Imports all the links that SEO has preserved,  all the images, even all the comments.  So if you want to see what your page would look like  at Squarespace, within, you know, 15 minutes, you can.  It's very easy to do.  And by the way, another great thing I love about this,  this is, you know, done right.  So your content is separate from your design.  You can try another template, another template.  You can go through all the templates with the same content.  Kind of like Zen Garden, right?  CSS Zen Garden.  So you can just, oh, it looks nice, oh, nice.  And then drag and drop.  You don't have to know any code.  If you are a JavaScript or a CSS coder,  they've got a great developer platform with, you know,  syntax, color coding in the editor and all of that stuff.  Just everything you want, I'm telling you,  including this great e-commerce.  And then, so go and try it for two weeks.  You don't need to give them a credit card.  If you decide, hey, you know, I kind of like this.  I could live with this.  Take a look at the pricing.  $8 for the standard plan, $16 for the unlimited plan.  That means unlimited bandwidth.  You'll never get a bandwidth bill.  Unlimited pages and galleries and blogs,  unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.  If you buy the annual plan, it's $16 a month,  and they'll throw in a custom domain name.  They'll register for it, you for it,  and hook it up and all of that.  Now, if you want the e-commerce,  it's only $24 a month for the annual plan.  It's amazing, amazing.  Squarespace.com.  Look, if you're looking for a new website  or maybe you want a better host on your old website,  you owe it to yourself to at least try it.  Squarespace.com.  If you decide to buy, use our offer code TWIG  and the number four, because it's the fourth month of April.  TWIG four and you'll get 10% off your first purchase  on a new account.  Squarespace.com.  You don't need this offer code until you decide to buy  and then use it though, if you would.  TWIG and the number four, we thank them for their support.  Of this week in Google.  I'm excited, I can't wait.  When are we gonna get Google Now in our browsers?  I already am a huge fan of Google Now on my smartphone.  And I guess there's code in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I love when these leaks happen  because somebody's going through Google source code.  It looks like somebody found a page and viewed the source  and found some JavaScript that seemed to indicate  that Google Now is gonna come to the home screen.  You can see some JavaScript, some variables here,  string variables that say, Google Now uses your home location  to show relevant information,  like weather, traffic conditions, and nearby places.  You can set your home location, set your work location.  This is all familiar to those of us running it on Android,  which I am.  I don't know when this is gonna show up  and we don't really know what it's gonna look like,  but it looks like the code is there.  We've got a couple of stories like this where-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Code is embedded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Code, yeah, like code has indicated  that something is kind of on its way.  So I guess this is a page, Google operating system,  the blog reported on this.  This is a page hosted on Google somewhere,  which looks like it's been pulled.  Oh. We're sorry.  There's no such thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pay no attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking up to a 1% test or something,  so they need to host it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not the now you're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is an old school Google error page, by the way.  Wow, this looks like Google circa 2004.  So I don't know when it's coming,  but it seems like Google now is kind of like the obvious,  the direction that things are going,  design-wise and product-wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  There was a leak a couple of weeks ago I saw on Google+,  from a Google employee that said,  if you know the address of the Google Now server,  you can actually get it to work in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, in the about flags, right?  There's a flag you can set in Chrome, right?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Local storage, you have to set local storage  to a certain URL, but the problem is,  like not very many people actually know  because the servers aren't, they're in development right now.  So you have to know, like you have to be in Google  and know what the addresses are,  but you can get it working in Chrome apparently,  if you know what that super secret address is.  So I'm really excited about it.  I think it makes total sense,  especially with some of the services that are going away,  like Reader and iGoogle and things,  to have this be the, or one of the solutions  to replace those things that are going away,  I think is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Now seems to be one service  that Google has had great, that everybody universally likes.  And when I first heard about it, I thought,  oh, this is gonna scare people  because it's based on stuff Google knows about you  from your emails, so if you get an email  confirming a flight, it'll put the information  in Google Now, or if you search for the San Francisco Giants,  it'll put ball scores in, and I thought,  oh, people are gonna be a little concerned about the,  and nobody is, because it's so useful.  And so what it really illustrates is,  you give me some value, I don't mind  if you take some information, just give me some value for it.  And I think this is a great product from Google  that really will help them convince people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all about Glass, Leo.  Like they announced Google Now and Google Glass,  or they talked about them kind of back to back  at Google I last year, and it was so obvious,  it seemed so obvious to me that Google Now  was gonna be the interface for Glass,  that this idea of just-in-time, contextually relevant alerts  would show up in your heads-up display makes complete sense.  And even the Mirror API guidelines now,  you can see the cards look very similar  to the Google Now cards.  So yeah, let's hope, maybe Google Now,  people really like Google Now, that the transition to Glass  won't be as scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some speculation that Google's acquisition  of this company, Wavy, for $30 million,  is also for Google Now.  It's a summary, it's a natural language processing,  does some summary stuff.  Apparently Apple and Google were both bidding  for the Seattle startup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where you wanna be in a bidding war  between Apple and Google, man.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  between Apple and Google, man.  Congratulations, baby.  The smile on the CEO's face, and he just comes out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't really lose, can ya?  Yeah.  So Wavy, maybe a little bit better for Google Now  than Siri, according to TechCrunch, should be interesting.  They had raised a mere $2 million in angel funding.  And so it sounds like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a bit of profit there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice, nice, nice, what do they call that?  Must be a phrase for venture capitalists out for that.  Ten bagger.  A ten bagger.  You get 10 times what you put in.  A ten bagger.  Wow.  This is a takeoff on the baseball four bagger,  which is a home run, right?  Cause you hit each ten bagger.  I think it's time to play some trumpets.  What do you think, Chad?  Should we get ready for the Google Change Log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.  I just said that.  It's redundant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I gotta remember not to say that.  Gina Trippetti here for our Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google launched a new app this week called One Today.  It's an invitation only pilot program in the US only.  So you have to have an invitation to actually use it.  You can go to google.com slash one today,  one spelled out, one today, to sign up for an invitation.  I haven't gotten an invitation yet,  but the app is available in the Play Store.  It's called One Today.  And it's a way to feature charitable causes,  charity organizations,  and let users very easily donate a dollar,  one dollar today to a cause that they inspire by.  Yeah, I kinda really like this.  Because this is kinda right in line with Google.  They're sort of philanthropic organization.  I really liked the idea that you can,  you each day a different cause gets featured.  You can donate a dollar.  It's gotta be,  I'm sure that it's gonna be tied to your Google Wallet  account.  I'm sure that it's gonna be as easy as an in-app purchase.  And it's social as well.  I'm not really sure how this is gonna work,  but I think it's gonna be tied into your Google Plus circles.  And so if all of your friends donate a buck,  four of your friends donate a buck to a charitable cause,  you can match their donation as well.  So there's a little bit of crowdsourcing social.  There's a social aspect in there.  And we were joking about this last night  on all about Android.  It's kinda crazy that you have to get on a wait list  in order to donate your money,  but they must be just trying to beta testing this out  or alpha testing this out with non-profit organizations.  And I just love this.  I think that this could be a really cool platform  for raising money for good causes.  So go check that out at google.com slash one today.  Cool.  Another big launch this week,  Google Plus comments for any website.  Well, I shouldn't say that.  It's not for any website.  Google Plus, Google has launched Google Plus comments  for blogger blogs.  Just enabled those.  So if you have a blogger blog,  you can see Google Plus comments on the blog.  This is pretty cool.  We know how this works, right?  Facebook comments, Facebook has had this for a while.  Similar deal with Google Plus comments.  Someone can come to your website  and comment on the content right there on your website.  So when you embed this on your page,  you've got a little input box to comment.  If people on Google Plus are discussing your webpage  on Google Plus, you'll also see that activity  on your webpage, which is really nice.  People can comment publicly,  which everyone can see those comments,  or people can comment on your stuff privately  or to only particular circles.  And of course the author of the webpage can only see  the comments that they're allowed to see.  So people who have had them in their circles.  So this is looking pretty cool.  I mean, we've been sort of waiting for this,  I think for a while.  Google has only releases for blogger,  but it turns out that the JavaScript snippet  to make this happen is very, very simple.  So there's already a WordPress plugin out there  that lets you add these to your WordPress,  your WordPress blogs if you want them.  So nice commenting system,  Google Plus based commenting system now available.  What else do we have?  Oh, Google search results.  There's, you know, Google's constantly sort of tweaking  the design and functionality of their search results.  There's a brand new green dropdown menu  next to search results when you search for something.  If you click on that down arrow, it's a little down arrow.  I think it looks like, yeah, Chad's zoomed in there.  Yeah, you get that little green down arrow  and you get a couple of options.  Cached, which lets you see the cached page  if the website is down.  Similar, which shows you, and actually not in that example,  not everybody has similar, but some results do.  Shows you similar search results and share,  which just pops up a Google Plus, of course,  prompt to share the webpage in Google Plus.  And finally, I talked about this a little bit last week,  but applications open.  Google Summer of Code is a project  that basically pays college students $5,000  to hack on an open source project over the summer  from June till September.  It's a really great program.  Student applications just opened this week.  You've got like, I think a week and two more days  to get your application in.  If you're a student enrolled at full time  in university or college, you can apply to Summer of Code.  You choose the project you wanna work on  and then what project you wanna work in within that project.  You get assigned a mentor.  You only get paid if you ship your stuff,  but it's great experience, great resume item,  pretty good money, better than flipping burgers.  So definitely check that out.  That's at google-mallonge.com.  You can see all the organizations.  And the open source project that I run, Think Up,  was accepted as a mentoring organization,  so I'm gonna be mentoring hopefully one or two students  or definitely one, hopefully two students this summer.  So check that out.  And that's all I got, the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Play the drums.  That's the change log.  Every week, Gina gives us the latest new features in Google.  This was a listener's idea and I think it was a great idea.  Just all in one place, everything that's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Gina, do you get to pick your interns  or whatever they are?  In the Summer of Code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, so students submit an application  through Google system and we put out a series of questions  that we want them to answer and they actually,  they get a couple of weeks before applications open  to interact with the mentors and the kind of leaders  in the community asking about proposing projects  that they wanna work on and getting some guidance.  So they submit applications and then we accept  certain applications and assign mentors to them.  So yeah, we do get to decide, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think about doing that for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just signed up for a course at San Jose State.  Maybe I can weasel my way in.  Oh, you wanna be an intern?  I wanna work for Gina.  I wanna help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Gina would let you in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually I was just curious whether Google decided  or whether you got to decide who it is that works for you.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like you have to be enrolled full-time.  There's a series of eligibility requirements for students  but as long as Google deems you eligible,  then you can apply to whatever projects that you want  but then the projects have to accept you.  Yeah, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  We continue to move along in the move in cell phones  from using the cell infrastructure  to the data infrastructure.  Facebook in March allowed Canadian Android users  to make free calls from the Facebook Messenger app.  Now it's in the US version as well.  If you're in a Facebook chat in Messenger,  you tap the I button inside the conversation,  select free call and you're talking.  You're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean this makes home more.  Holy cow.  Yeah, more useful, right?  Like this is like, oh yes, this is my Facebook phone.  I can now make calls with it.  And it's sort of I think an important piece of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I presume they're using Skype  which is integrated into Facebook, the Microsoft product  but I don't know.  You do not need to update Messenger app  or be running Google Home.  It's just, but you'll have the chat heads feature  is in there and just tap three info dots  next to a person's name to move the,  there it is, Messenger.  You probably have it.  I mean, I think it's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have it.  Yeah, database may apply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  I just, I think Apple's doing this, moving towards this.  And if you're a carrier, you just gotta wonder if you,  you see the writing on the wall,  you're gonna become a data provider, not a voice provider.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're a carrier, you better be working on  making your pipes bigger or serving more data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just sent my mom up, she's been visiting for a month  at 80 years old, she has an iPad.  I just set her up with a Galaxy Note 2,  her first smartphone.  She loves it.  I thought, it's a big screen, I can get the text pretty big.  She loves the stylus, she's an artist, she sketches on it.  And I put Skype on it and I said, watch this mom.  And we had a little video call and I said,  first of all, now she can text.  And she had to have a smartphone  because the grandkids, me, we don't respond to email.  If you wanna reach somebody this day and age,  you gotta use text messaging, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and even phone calls go right to voicemail, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so you gotta have, so she had to have a smartphone  and this is kind of a nice additional thing.  So I put it on her laptop, on her iPad,  and on her Note 2.  Do you wanna do a call?  Oh look, Kevin Marks has messaged me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Facebook, but now that came,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just pressed the free call button to see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, do I have to have Messenger launched?  Let me just see here.  Facebook Messenger.  Oh, you know what, I don't think I've ever used it  on this phone, so I'm gonna log in.  Now you should be able to try to,  welcome to Messenger, reach friends wherever they are.  You're calling me.  Well, come on.  Yeah, so how do I answer?  It's not ringing.  It came up on my laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if it's confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's press the I, Kevin Marks, free call.  Please note, your carrier's data rates may apply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, if you were trying to call me now,  that's gonna really confuse things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says you're calling, I'm gonna answer.  Wait a minute, did that hang up?  It was red, oh crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the new Facebook voice calling works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to figure out, I don't understand how I pick up.  You're calling Kevin now.  No, okay, now I'm talking to Kevin.  And now I can hear you, there we go.  Oh, but it's not video, it's just voice.  Let me just put it to my ear and see how it sounds.  How you doing, Kevin?  I'm doing okay, it's actually not bad.  You know what, it sounds better than a cell conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it should do, I assume we can use a decent codec.  It sounds really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Some lag though.  Yeah, but there's lag even in a cell phone call.  You only notice that because you can hear me un-lagged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's like two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not subtle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you are on Skype too.  Oh, but no, this is a different connector.  It's like double Skype.  No, it's not, because you're on WiFi.  Can you put it on speakerphone?  Yeah, let's put them on speakerphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With those great speakers on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, these big speakers, but yeah,  it's breaking up a little bit.  It's also frozen as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now I'm gonna be unable to speak properly  as I get three acres of myself coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say this, today I consider myself  the luckiest man on the face of the earth.  He doesn't, he's British, he doesn't know.  He doesn't know from Lou Gehrig.  Well, this is good, he knew what I like.  It's very chat-heady.  This is the new Facebook home look,  which is he's got a big picture of him on his, you know.  They really know how to make it pretty.  Look at that, I mean, that's great.  Yeah, all right, I'm gonna hang up.  Wow, you know, what mom does not have is a Facebook account.  I said, mom, you know, that's where you'll see pictures  of me and the kids and stuff,  and it's a great way to keep up.  And she said, I don't want anybody to know where I am.  So my job tonight is to see if I can make a Facebook account  that's invisible to all.  You can, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of, sorta.  I bet I could turn up the privacy to 11.  But then she could do that too, right?  That's easier than Skype.  Pretty amazing, what a world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually easier than Google Hangout too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was very easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Google Hangout, but that was pretty easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was pretty easy.  Yeah.  Oh, and it says, now it says,  Leo missed a call from you at the bottom  because you didn't pick up the first time.  I didn't pick up the first time, yeah.  Well, I mean, the thing is it's,  um, it's showing you, I mean, what it's like  is the calling in Google Chat.  Right.  But they haven't actually made that work  on the phone yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and that's where Babel will solve the problem, right?  Because it'll be cross-platform, let's hope, anyway.  This is what Google could do in Babel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and this is, you know, this is fascinating for me  because this is, when I was at BT two years ago,  this was like, you realize we could do this  to everyone's phone and make phone calls,  and they didn't quite get it.  Yeah, because it kind of undermined their business model.  Well, no, no, it didn't,  because they can connect out and charge for that.  Ah.  In a way Skype does.  Right.  We can make this bit, you know,  they don't care about within US calls,  but if we call the UK, then that's where they make money.  Ah, interesting.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still think carriers must be a little threatened.  First, they're losing their SMS business,  and now they're going to lose their voice calling business.  It's the same thing that cable companies are going through.  We don't want to be wholesale bits on pipes.  We want to be premium bits on pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but the challenge is knowing,  you can't say what a premium bit is.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.  I'm afraid the future of the die is cast.  Netflix, proving that its strategy was correct all along.  They showed a strong profit.  They said, we have paid for all of our new programming  that we're creating, like House of Cards with Kevin Spacey,  which was a hundred million dollar investment.  They now are besting in the United States  the subscriber list for HBO.  They added two million new subscribers,  and that more than, you know, two million times 7.99 a month,  16 million a month, yeah, that's a good way to pay for it.  Pretty impressive.  They're up to 29 million online users,  which is more than a home box office in the United States.  When does Arrested Development?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Soon.  May 26th, May 26th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm waiting for the second season of House of Cards.  Yeah.  That was a good show.  Now you're British, Kevin Marks.  I am indeed.  Yes indeed.  And I watched the British House of Cards,  which is about parliament, not Congress.  Yes.  But very, I mean, it's the same idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same basic plot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which did you like better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny, you know, there's 20 years difference  in production style as well, which makes it hard.  Yeah.  I really liked the British one, but I enjoyed this one too,  but they're different things,  Unless you can watch both on Netflix.  Yeah.  The,  it somehow, I don't know,  the scheming has seemed slightly more plausible  in the English one to me,  but, and that may be because, you know,  he was, the author was in parliament at the time,  and had a sense of the mechanics there  that wasn't there in the Washington one.  Because some of the plot mechanics  in the Washington one were a bit weird.  Right.  You know, he-  Well, it seemed awfully corrupt.  I won't spoil it, but some of the things that he does,  he's like, he did what?  Why would he do that?  He's a chief whip and he just did what?  He can't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because he's a master strategician.  Right.  He knew three moves ahead what was gonna happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, no, but yeah-  I gotta watch it.  Oh, you haven't seen it?  I haven't seen it either, so.  No, I haven't seen it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When did she get time to watch 30 hours of TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there's so much good TV going on right now.  There's Game of Thrones and Mad Men,  and like I just haven't, and I fired up Netflix,  and I was like, oh yeah, it's-  I know.  It's like, I gotta-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very competitive.  And it just shows you that the secret is not to be a pipe,  not to be a conduit, but to be a creator.  You wanna make money, create content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can do both.  I mean, they're different kinds of business.  A commodity business is a really good business to be in  because it means everybody wants to buy your thing.  So-  But how do you distinguish yourself  as a commodity business?  Everyone wants it good.  Well, you don't need to.  You're a commodity business, just do it well.  Do it well.  But that's the mistake is saying,  oh, we need to not be a commodity business.  No, actually, a commodity business  is a really good thing to be.  It means you're in a business you understand  that people actually want.  There's a price for it.  You can just iterate on that.  Is it that there are-  A fashion business is much harder,  but there are people who are good at that.  And that's what the production companies are in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What you don't get in a commodity business  is the insane multiples that you get in the tech business.  And unfortunately,  everybody's so stock market driven these days  that they're not real happy with,  hey, we're gonna grow 5% a year.  It's like, who cares?  I take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a parallel-  I can't believe Apple stock hasn't gone up.  That was the weird one for me.  It's like, okay, Apple is in an ounce.  Yes, they've made more profits than anyone else ever again.  Oh, and their stock's still-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this future, yeah,  we had a good conversation on this in Mac Break Weekly.  We hadn't seen it yet,  but we knew that the results would come in.  And it's all about not what's happening today with Apple,  but what the future looks like for Apple.  And I think the market and many of us  have started to think maybe Apple's lost its mojo  and what will the future look like.  Apple's a perfect example of a company  that does not wanna be in a commodity business.  That's Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they're kind of in a fashion, sure.  They're at the fashion end of a commodity business.  They're selling the expensive version of the,  the premium version of the other things.  And they do that supremely well.  And they do that, and this is Cook's genius,  is making that actually profitable.  Right.  But yeah, it's,  but it is tricky because it is easier  to replicate some of the stuff, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Netflix is gonna add a $12 a month plan  that'll let you get four different streams.  This shows where people are going with this.  We got four people in the family  all watching at the same time.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds about right, yeah.  Yeah, he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't the Netflix making house of cards?  I thought I heard a quote that they basically said  that they wanted to become HBO before HBO became them.  Right, I mean, they're scared of HBO Go, right?  But they're not tied to the cable companies  the way that HBO is, right?  So I thought that this was more about them being like,  oh, we've got to make a move and start off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's also very simple from a financial point of view.  They spent $100 million.  All they have to do is get a million new subscribers.  They've paid for it, and they got two.  So it was a very straightforward thing.  What they've proven is that people will get  a Netflix subscription just to watch a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that's been always the ding against Netflix  is that the selection isn't always the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they got Arrested Development.  They have a new horror series called Hemlock Grove,  which just launched.  And what's really interesting to me  is instead of dribbling these episodes out once a week,  they just, boom, here.  13 episodes, boom.  Because you know what, that's how I want to watch it.  Right, right, I think they get that.  And this is the same thing that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, YouTube is doing something similar, right?  They're paying people to create content.  In their case, it's not a subscription they're looking for.  It's ad revenue, right?  But I think it's the same thing.  They've kind of maxed out what they can do.  Or maybe not, who knows?  Maybe they'll surprise me.  But YouTube's kind of at the top of their game.  So it's like, where do we go from here?  And I think their answer is,  hey, we create our own content and we double down.  So I think Netflix is doing something similar  and good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also shows that people are honest  and willing to pay for content  because you could easily game the free trial  given that they put 13 episodes in.  You get what, a two week free trial?  You could do a free trial,  watch all 13 episodes and move on.  But I think people are honest.  They're rewarding Reed Hastings for creating this content  and looking forward to these other shows and saying,  you know what, I do want to pay 7.99 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the thing is,  the thing that it works really well for is a series.  You find a series you want to watch  and you can go through that.  It's awesome.  So they're sort of, with this, they're teaching you that.  They're saying, okay, here's the thing.  You just can watch as many as you like.  Then you go, oh, there's a UK version of 99.  I never saw that.  Oh, it's now recommending I watch this series,  Am I Flying from the UK?  That's kind of a political thriller.  And they have seven series of that and you can watch that.  And then they've hooked you in and you, you know,  and this is how we end up watching stuff.  We watched our way through The Tudors,  which is great fun.  But that was on Netflix and we worked our way through that.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if Netflix could fund those programs  that like those beloved shows that get canceled too soon.  So like something like the Veronica Mars movie  or like a new season of Veronica Mars.  Firefly, Firefly, right?  So instead of doing a Kickstarter,  which everyone's sort of getting annoyed  about all these rich celebrities doing Kickstarters now,  that they can sort of get funded through Netflix  or if they can negotiate the rights, you know.  Yeah, why not?  That would be awesome.  I mean, Firefly alone would triple Netflix's subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember, Netflix is not becoming a production company.  They just say they're an investor.  You know, Joss Whedon's got a production company.  You just say, Joss, we're gonna give you 100 million.  You know, this house of cards,  they were shopping it to everybody  and Netflix stole it out from under, I believe it was HBO.  We don't know for sure, but stole it out from under  somebody else, it might've been a network,  by offering them 100 million.  And they said, oh, okay, deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did the Arrested Development,  how did Arrested Development though work out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, somebody has the rights to that.  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that was the cost.  But it's a production company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that has been passed on by the network.  That's the point.  So the production company puts it together and makes it.  They would probably have to go and get all the actors  to recommit because whatever options ahead of that  would've expired.  But they're good at doing those kinds of things.  That will work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Happens all the time.  Happens all the time.  It's all about money, that's all.  You can write a check.  Sure, I'll come back.  I'll do the show.  Yeah.  Now, I'm interested in what your thoughts are  and I shouldn't do this without Jeff Jarvis here  because he's such a lover of the Chromebook.  But a couple-  Oh boy, oh boy.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can channel him, okay?  Net market share, which measures traffic,  monitoring operating system traffic  by looking at what browsers are coming into websites.  Jeff started monitoring worldwide usage of Chrome OS.  The percentage of web traffic from Chromebooks  to one hundredths of one percent.  A figure so stunningly small as to not earn a place  at the rankings at all.  Two years they've been selling Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do they tell that from Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess the Chrome browser in there probably reports  the user agent probably is Chrome OS.  I don't know, they must use the user agent.  No, you know what, as I remember,  there's more than user agent.  They're a little bit smart about that.  But you can tell what, right?  Yeah, you can tell from-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's ways to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought HTTP reported not only the browser,  but the operating system as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe.  Yeah.  And it could be spoofed and all that.  But we knew this was a specialty problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is where Google changes the Googlebot's browser  signature to be Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really genuinely curious at whether or not  Chromebooks are gonna be at Google I.O.  the way that they have been the last two years.  The last two years, we've gotten Chromebooks, right,  for free, like they've been giveaways.  They've been a thing.  I wonder if they're gonna be there at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depends how many pixels they've already made.  They got a couple of thousand extra pixels,  I think you might get them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think they'll unload them?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we got Chromebooks last year,  which I plugged in once and haven't used since.  Yeah, the Chromebox is not exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a hideously useful product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I'm in trouble, look at what to do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not portable.  You need to have a keyboard, screen, and mouse  to attach to it.  I don't understand the product at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it makes sense if you're trying to replace a...  School or business.  A final services in the school business,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  those kinds of things.  These things appeal to people who have admins  that want to lock everything down,  and it's great for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in theory they do.  In practice, those admins are so tied into Windows  that you can't get them to change their minds half the time.  Maybe.  It makes sense as someone who hasn't got  an admin can do that.  You don't need a system, you can just plug it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if Jeff were here, he would say,  hey, I love my Chromebook, I love my Pixel,  I do everything with it.  Jeff's been doing an experiment for many months now, right,  Gina, where he just uses that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been a while, yeah, he's living the little Vita Google  he said in service of the show, which we appreciate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think, if I think about it,  the people who really are most happy are people who write.  Because their needs are few.  Yeah.  Programmer isn't gonna want it.  Although I just read a long Google Plus post from,  I think he's a Linux, I don't know if he's a kernel hacker,  but he's a Linux programmer who said he loves his Pixel,  loves it, but of course what did he do?  He put Linux on it.  Right.  He's using a Linux bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen lots of tutorials pop up lately  about how to get it.  And these are from programmers saying,  here's how you get it to work.  The people that really aren't gonna be happy are gamers,  anybody that uses any third party software.  Yeah, if you do media production,  media production, exactly.  I mean, it's just not gonna be good.  And so, who knows though, they might get there.  But yeah, there are a lot of drawbacks.  I mean, I'll tell you this, I'd rather be hampered  and use a Chromebook than I would use Windows 8.  Right.  I'd rather give up all that stuff and not use Windows 8.  You know what I'm using right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Windows 8.  Yeah, it just looks like any other computer.  Especially if I'm using Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't like it.  I don't like it either.  That's a good question, Chromebook or Windows 8.  I think I would choose the Chromebook as well.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would.  I mean, if you didn't have any of those things  that I mentioned, right?  If you're not trying to run games  or you're not trying to do something specific,  I'd much rather use a Chromebook than Windows 8  if it's just for that online email, word processing,  those kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know anybody who's purchased this Dell Linux Ultrabook,  the Project Sputnik?  I don't, it's gotten good reviews,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I don't know anybody personally that's used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in Ubuntu, it ships with Ubuntu, it's aluminum,  it's apparently fairly nice, it's not cheap.  USB3, not USB2, mini display port, and it all works.  Yeah, it's a really nice piece of hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and good on for Dell for making sure  that the drivers are there.  I mean, that's difficult.  That's the biggest hurdle is to make sure  that all the drivers work with all that new hardware  that they packed into that thing.  It's a really nice machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you can't, I mean, if Dell can't do it, who can?  Yeah, Dell's been on the Ubuntu bandwagon for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've been doing this for a number of years now,  making machines, you can buy them,  just that come with Ubuntu, the first real major  hardware vendor or laptop vendor that has actually done this.  There's been other ones around for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not crazy about Unity, but I could put another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can put something else on there, that's the thing.  Put Linux Mint on there.  It's easy to do, yeah.  You wanna buy me one?  I'll review it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was thinking of buying it.  I was thinking of buying it.  By the way, 1920 by 1080.  I don't know how they're doing that,  because that's something that classically Linux,  you get little tiny icons and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, actually not for a long time.  Yeah, absolutely, especially if you've got  a dedicated Nvidia graphics card.  The driver, right.  Yeah, that's great.  And even the Intel chips with the built-in graphics  are doing that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Three hours battery life, that's a little disappointing.  I'd like to see more nowadays.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The opposite of the, to go back to the Chromebook story,  did you see this Slate story?  This writer on Slate basically got locked out of,  I think it's a him, at least account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he said it was like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clear reason.  I think it's a her.  It's a her, okay.  So what happens when you've got a Chromebook  and you just can't, I mean, it's useless, right?  The Chromebook's useless if you can't sign into your account.  So her account got shut down,  just it was the generic message just saying,  you must have violated the terms of service somehow,  and she couldn't get to anything.  And she had to call friends at Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and it still took six days.  Yeah, that was the scary part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she has friends at Google.  She said, I asked all of my Google friends,  what should I do?  And then she got different answers.  Like one of them thought they should go to accounts.  Another one thought they should go to policy.  This was a bit of the terms of service  that I actually didn't know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She said, I felt like I'd been dumped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Felt like I'd been dumped.  In its terms of service, Google limits its total liability  for stolen data, lost data, anything,  to the amount you paid us to use the services.  Which could mean as much as the $249 per month  you shelled out for 25 gig or more storage,  or in my case, nothing.  So that's essentially saying,  if you're not paying Google anything to host your data,  the data is lost or they shut down your account,  which also in the terms of service,  they say that they have every right to do  for any reason whatsoever,  then there's nothing going on.  So I mean, we've talked about this a lot here on the show  about backing up your stuff and using takeout  and doing exports often,  because this kind of thing happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you run takeout after the fact?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  I mean, this is what's wrong with,  so I love the concept.  I love the data liberation kind of concept, right?  And I like the concept of takeout,  but the reality is,  is that unless you do it once a month  or every two weeks or whatever,  diligently across all your products,  the exported file becomes, gets out of date at some point.  If you're counted, you get shut down.  And a lot of times the exported files  are just not as useful without the service.  When you separate the data from the service,  it's just like, well, okay.  You know, and I've just got this, you know, this-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What good is this XML file?  Yeah, yeah.  This 500 gigabyte XML file I can't use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So I mean, this story,  this is kind of my nightmare story  about sort of moving all my stuff to the cloud,  is that at some point, you know,  and Google just does not have the mechanism  set up to appeal this.  There's no structured appeal process.  They don't tell you what part of the terms of service  you violated.  In fact, I think she said she was working on a spreadsheet  that involved some phone numbers or something,  some private information.  And she thinks that that might've been  the terms of service violation,  but I don't even think she's sure.  That's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what's really scary is you don't,  you still don't know.  And if you haven't, you maybe, you could,  you could learn Python and query the Python user script  and ask, talk to me, what did I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so she said that my data was intact  when she got, when her account was restored  six days later.  Except for that spreadsheet.  Except for the last thing I worked on, yeah.  Spreadsheet containing clients' account numbers  and passwords.  It seems that Google's engineers determined  this single document violated policy  and locked down my entire account.  I don't know if that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was just the last thing she worked on.  Maybe it wasn't saved in the backup.  I wouldn't jump to that conclusion by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and I think this also could've just been  an algorithm failure, you know.  I don't think it was actual Google engineers  that actually said, hey, look at this chick,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we're gonna shut her down.  She has a Chinese name, Tian Lan Ho.  Could've been a confusion in name.  Maybe they thought she was a Chinese hacker.  I mean, there's all sorts of, we just,  but the problem is Google's opaque, you don't know.  She was, it was a Googler who got it restored  after six days and escalated it,  she said, to the right person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  somebody inside Google to escalate the response.  I mean, not everybody knows someone.  I mean, we, I don't know about you, Leo,  but I often get people to say,  oh, you do this week in Google?  Like, I'm having this problem.  Yeah. Can you get anyone at Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to respond to me? Can you get me a pixel for cheap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Can you please, you know,  is there someone that I can, since it's tough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get that all the time.  And what I tell them is, no, I intentionally avoid  conversing with anybody from the companies we cover.  I don't want to have any relationship with them at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wonder if this is an opportunity.  Maybe I should start a Google support business.  Third party, third party Google support.  Call me and I'll help you fix your phone  or help you fix your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I still have, I think.  Wasn't there a company that did that backup thing?  What was the name of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'd back up all your social networks automatically.  Storify?  No, no, not Storify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the tweet creation.  I know exactly what you're talking about, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I got, because I got in early, it was free for life.  So I presume they're still backing it up.  I'd have to find out who it is.  I didn't expect it.  Backupify?  Was it Backupify?  It might've been, it was Backupify, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Backupify, Backupify.  I stopped getting the emails from them.  I was getting the emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they went out of business  because it wasn't a very good model.  No, see, there it is.  That would be an example.  It does an automatic backup of all your social networks,  including Google and Facebook.  And if that runs automatically, then you're all right.  Then you're good.  You're up to date, hopefully.  So I'll just have to recover that account  when Google kills my account.  I'm wearing a hat, Google.  See, you told me, wear the hat and all would be well.  They have wheeled a lot of power.  They do.  That's the bottom line.  All right, we are gonna take a break.  Come back with your tips, your picks.  Nobody will do a number, but that's all right.

And middle-aged looks like me.  What are you wearing?  You're all raspberry pie. Senior citizens.  I guess I'm gonna go for the jumpsuits,  go straight to jumpsuits.  A onesie, right?  Onesies.  When you're born, right?  You got a lot of onesies, right?  Etta's got onesies galore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Stacks of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, when you're born and then a little later on in life.  Go back. It's back in the onesie.  Just put the little hatch in the back.  Diapers too.  And diapers, yeah.  And diapers. And diapers.  The hatch.  Kevin Marks hung up on us.  I think he was offended.  99designs.com slash twig.  All right, it's time for our tips of the week.  Let's start with you.  Gina Trepenny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now that Google Plus comments are available  for blogger sites,  you can also add them really to any webpage.  I said there was a WordPress plugin that already came out.  This is all kind of unofficial,  but it totally completely works.  You can add Google Plus comments to any webpage.  There's a little snippet of HTML.  Just Google, Google Plus comments on any website.  This link will come up.  You just drop a little snippet of HTML.  There's also an HTML5 version that you can use.  And you can show the number of comments,  comments counter,  how many comments they have.  You can load the comments dynamically.  That replaces Disqus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should have probably used that instead of Disqus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is, you know,  Google hasn't announced that this is an official thing yet.  So I use, I would say,  it seems like this is gonna become official very quickly,  but use this initial bit of HTML,  knowing that you might have to adjust it later  if the API changes.  I don't think it will.  It looks like this is gonna be the official way to do it.  But yeah, so you can get Google Plus comments on any page,  which I like.  I personally like a lot better than Facebook.  Disqus is pretty great,  but really nice that you also get the exposure  also on Google Plus,  and that you also get the comments  that people are making on Google Plus.  Yeah, see, and it's free, discusses a paid service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's pretty tempting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like it.  I really love the Google Plus commenting system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a very smart thing for them to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really smart,  because it gets you plugged in.  And I mean, if I ever get my website up and running again,  you know, and modernize,  I don't know if I'll ever do it,  but if it ever happens,  I'm definitely gonna check this out.  I think it's awesome. I might have to try it too.  I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish you could have more than one commenting system,  which that's really probably not a good idea.  Yeah. Unified comments.  You gotta pick one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the challenge is integrating them, isn't it?  Right.  Yeah.  Because there was a completely geek out story,  but Tantech, you know, Tantech, Shelley,  wrote a post on the first  IndieWeb cross-site commenting system  that they've actually put together a way to do this,  where three different people with their own sites hosting  is doing cross-site trackback and pinging again.  Wow.  That's so there's,  they're still trying to make that work.  And the challenge is dealing with, you know,  competing with these unitary systems.  Cause you,  you want this stuff to stay there and not be, you know,  don't disappear when that company goes away  or vanish in those ways that a lot of these  common systems has.  And that's kind of hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually returned, didn't track back.  We've had track back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is bringing track back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's bringing it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, track back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in a way, it's, you remember track back?  It never worked.  It worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It worked so well.  The problem is it worked so well.  Yeah, it worked so well.  It had no authentication.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was, it worked, but it was confusing.  Cause it was like, well, anyway,  track back is back, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll put the link in the chat room.  Thank you.  IndieWeb types you want to play with that.  So the Google Plus thing is interesting  cause it lets you have comments on a site  that only you and your friends can see,  which is kind of weird.  Google Plus private commenting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Private commenting.  Yeah.  Your very own Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there might be comments that you can't see, right?  That other people could see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, as you all know, April is the cruelest month.  So it's time to talk poetry with Kevin Marks,  who actually has a good public school education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Indeed.  Well, in the UK, we call it state school  because public school means private school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  So you don't have a public school.  You didn't go to Eaton or Harrow.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good Eaton or Harrow, no.  So these are a couple of sites that I think are very cute.  There's this one called googlepoetics.com.  And if you go to that,  it's a list of when Google auto-complete  turns into little poems.  Let's not do the first one.  Do the one at the bottom of the list  from yesterday's world projects.  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently there's some very horny people  who've started using this  cause they're all, hold me closer.  Tony Danza.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I was just reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why does that come up?  Cause people think that's what John's singing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they think it is.  Hold me closer, Tony Danza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The blogist made that joke.  So I think that's her.  I've got that one in there.  I love the blogist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God bless her.  What is it to be human?  What is it today?  What is it that makes tears without sorrow?  What is it that given one?  So the idea is this is from auto-complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's auto-complete suggestions  that look like modern poetry.  So there's that one.  Then the other one that's fun is pentametron.com.  And what this one does is it looks at Twitter,  the tweets that are in iambic pentameter,  and then it finds two that rhyme and put them together.  And you get this sort of very strange found...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Advising Holly to become a nun.  Thanks for the birthday wishes, everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You always have a little more in you.  I want a follow from McDonald's too.  Got me a baby brother on the way.  Heart turns a little colder every day.  Time for a shower.  Gonna go apply.  All Polish people going crazy, sigh.  This is good.  This is better than Shakespeare.  So nearly got a Gary Neville squeal.  I'm such a jealous person, it's unreal.  Bores, then a bitch in a little Mexico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just had a great idea for a show.  Is this done algorithmically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so they know where the beats fall in English.  So they look for the pentameter sentences.  Which is da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum.  That's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's just like we look for the meter  and create the poetry.  So I thought those two were very cute  and also very da-da.  This was, cut up poetry was this like  early 20th century thing where you generate this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to put a smiley header,  but just saw an Asian with a mullet, what?  This is better than damn you auto correct.  This is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's wonderful, you just sit there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing that people, this is how code should be,  this is what code's for.  Stop writing apps.  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need more crazy poetry.  I do have an actual tip,  which is my blog post I've linked there.  And this is something I discovered you could do  while trying to solve another problem.  So my problem was my son's old blog,  the picture had gone away  because the pictures were on Apple's iDisc  and they broke the site's link.  And so it was like, ugh.  So I thought, oh, but you can get URLs from Google Drive.  So I stuck them on Google Drive and did that.  And I thought, wait a minute,  you can download your Twitter archive,  then you can just throw it into Google Drive  and then you've got your Twitter archive on the web.  So I put the steps to do that.  And it's slightly annoying in that you get a URL  that's like 25 feet long because it's a Google URL,  but you can use a short of that.  And so now I've got my archive of my tweets  up on Google Drive and you can go and find them.  And this is, you can already download your tweets  and do this locally,  but they actually designed it well enough.  So you can just throw it on the server and it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then as long as Google doesn't go out of business  and they don't break up with you, it's somewhat permanent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So as long as I, you know,  I'm now relying on two flaky services to deal with each other.  Now I want to back up my Google Plus onto Twitter.  I'm not sure that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is the usefulness of the HTML export,  right?  Like this is really nice that you could just do the,  you know, and Facebook offers this as well, right?  Can't you export all your stuff and you get HTML?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you do, actually I should do it with the old,  the stuff that Google dumped us,  cause you get that from bars as well, don't you?  You can get an HTML dump from bars.  I should put that up too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you go to j.mp,  this is Kevin's shortened URL for all of his tweets ever.  Slash KM tweets.  Slash KM tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it isn't, cause it only goes up to the beginning  of April when I did this.  So you have to be near March.  Yeah, you have to set up a cron job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a cron job.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he said that it's a manual process with Twitter, but.  Oh, come on.  As it's monthly, you know,  you can do it once a month and update it.  So I need to update in that April.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what's nice is it's a nicely formatted Twitter,  obviously is doing this in HTML and XML, right?  So there's some format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they actually do is they download all the tweets  as JSON as if they were coming from the API.  And then they have some code that runs there  in JavaScript that renders them in HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very nice.  So this is a large HTML file  that Google Drive is just rendering for you.  Yeah.  Actually, your browser is rendering it.  Google Drive is storing it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Drive is just storing it.  Google is just being a dumb server  and the Twitter stuff is working quite nicely,  which is, you know.  I'm going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cool.  It's not a think up replacement, but it's cool.  I had to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should feed you to think up.  Dal, that's the next step.  No, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we're working on the import right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kids, this is why web standards are so important.  Now you know.  Yes.  So now you know the rest of the story.  Erin, you got anything for us?  A little tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use what you use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is something,  if you're not familiar with it,  I think a lot of people probably are,  if you're not familiar with this particular program,  it's called Wi-Fi Analyzer.  And so a lot of people have trouble connecting to Wi-Fi.  Maybe they have intermittent Wi-Fi service,  Wi-Fi connectivity at their house, whatever.  So it's a little tool that you can get.  You can download.  There we go.  So I'm actually running this here at the Twit Brickhouse.  And you can see all the different-  You can see the problem.  Yeah, you can see the problem, exactly.  This is why there's so many problems.  These are all the Wi-Fi-  Oh, that is cool.  Connections that I can see from my phone.  And it tells you along the bottom.  It tells you what channel it is.  And it tells you what the signal strength is.  So if you're wondering,  and I know that you can look at this  if you're selecting a Wi-Fi network,  it'll give you the little bars and says,  oh, this is a stronger signal or whatever.  But this is good in a couple of ways.  So one thing you can do with this,  if you're setting up a Wi-Fi, a new Wi-Fi router,  or if you're not getting good service  and you're wondering why, you can go look at this and say,  oh, I know why.  It's because everyone's on channel 11.  Then you can go back to your Wi-Fi router  and you can turn it to channel six or channel one.  And you'll get much, much better throughput  and better signal strength  if you don't have as much conflict on those channels.  So that's one thing you can do with it.  It's really simple to use.  There's different modes you can do.  You can do a time graph,  which is a kind of messy actually in this case,  because there's so many different Wi-Fi signals.  That doesn't really help so much.  Holy moly.  Well, it tells you something.  You can do a channel rating, which is really good.  So if you were, this is really an easy way  to set up a new access point on your system.  If you want to know right off the bat  what to set it up on right here, you would choose channel 14.  And you can just do a simple AP list  and it'll tell you the green bars are good,  more green is good for all these things.  And then the last thing you can do  is a signal meter, which is really cool  if you're running, what version of the Apple phone was it  that had the antenna problem?  Four. Four.  So like right now, whatever I'm connected to  is getting a little above negative 60 dB.  And I think if I, oh, I actually got better signal quality  by putting my hands around it.  Usually you'll see that drop off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not supposed to happen.  What phone are you using there?  Yeah, this is the Galaxy S6.  That was Apple's contention is it happens to everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it actually does.  I'm not gonna, of course, it's a live demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends because your hands can act as an,  your body can act as an antenna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could if I was actually making contact with it  but I've got a case around this.  So anyway, so that's it.  I mean, it's a pretty simple tool.  And if you're having trouble  I actually use this at my house.  My wife's Nexus 7 was not getting good reception.  And I was like, what is going on?  Everybody was complaining.  I went, looked at it, sure enough,  verified that my phone and the Nexus 7 were way off.  And so then I started looking  and the case had popped open in the back  somebody had dropped it.  The case had come open just a tiny little crack  and that's where the antenna is.  So it wasn't making good connections.  So I was able to fix that.  And of course, then the signal strength went right back up  to where it should be.  So check it out.  It's wifi analyzer available  on the Google Play Store for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a really good example of a program  that you couldn't do on a, I tried to on an iPhone  because it doesn't give you access to that,  that information only Apple can access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was so glad you mentioned that earlier.  I was like, yay, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I used that in my apartment.  When I was in an apartment and I had lots of signals  and it was really very, very helpful.  That's one of the reasons I love Android  because you can get access to that kind of stuff.  Apple locks up this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a-  I can see all my neighbors networks now.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you can.  And this is a similar program.  Every smartphone, all the Android phones  have an auto brightness feature.  But as you may remember, I was having trouble  with the HTC One battery life.  And one of the problems, one of the,  it had several problems that I was,  I think mostly able to correct,  was that the auto brightness was set artificially high  because it makes the screen look better.  So it was a super bright screen.  And I kind of felt that.  I was dimming the screen artificially,  but this is for real geeks.  And Russell Tammany, our IT guy told us about it.  It's called Lux.  And it lets you program your auto brightness  based on, I have it set here.  And this is the dashboard based on the brightness here.  So the sensor on the phone is measuring 320 Lux lumens here.  And I'm gonna, I can say, you know what?  This screen's a little dark in that kind of brightness.  I wanna, whenever I'm in anything that's this bright,  let's set it for 77% brightness.  And it will do that.  And there's a variety of other features.  This is the most complex program you have ever seen  for auto brightness.  But you know what?  If you're a geek, this is why,  if this is the kind of thing you say,  why would I ever wanna do that?  Get an iPhone.  If this is the kind of thing where you go,  oh, that's pretty cool.  I'd like to do that.  This is why you like Android.  These are the measurements I've done  and the settings I've set at different brightness levels  for different lumen levels.  It's called Lux.  There's a free version, but for a couple of bucks,  you can get the paid version.  Lux Auto Brightness by Vito Cassisi.  Very nice app.  The other app that he told me about,  which is kind of handy,  is a widget to monitor milliamp draw off the battery.  And the temperature of the battery,  it's called Current Widget.  And it is a fabulous little tool that will,  I even have a log file that I can look at the power drain  from my phone over time, the temperature.  And when you're charging on some phones, not all phones,  this is something that seems to be hardware specific,  it'll even tell you how many amps the charger is drawing  at any given time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that sounds handy as well.  Very useful.  I've got a problem that I've got some cables  that I'm never quite sure if they're plugged in properly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or there's two kinds of charging,  depending on the amperage of the charger you're using.  There's a trickle charge or there's a blast charge  and you may not know what you're getting.  This is very useful for that.  But it was helpful for me to diagnose,  am I drawing a lot of power?  Is there a program drawing a lot of power?  Right now I'm using 271 milliamps  and it goes up and down and that's very handy.  Very, very nice little program.  So a couple of tools to improve the battery life  or at least to have more control over your Android phone.  We gotta run.  Mitch Kapoor is our guest on triangulation.
