Transcript:  It's time for Twig this weekend. Google, Jeff and Gina are here.  We're going to take a look at a brand new email program for your mobile and web from Google.  A replacement for Gmail? Possibly.  Twitter takes a pivot with its new developer platform. We'll talk about that.  And Jeff finally understands why WhatsApp is worth $22 billion.  It's all coming up next on Twig.

Show the, not just about Google, but the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, anything we really want to talk about,  including new media. That's partly because we've got this guy over here, Jeff Jarvis,  professor of journalism at the City University of New York,  turning young minds onto the possibilities that remain in the tattered wreck that is journalism.  Corrupting them.  Great to have you, Jeff.  Also here, founding editor of Lifehacker,  programmer, developer, host of All About Android,  and the creator of Think Up, Gina Trapani.  Hello. Hi, Gina.  Gina did us a mitzvah, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She did indeed. She did a couple of mitzvahs. What's the plural of mitzvah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mitzvah? Mitzvishis? It's a mitzvishi.  I don't know why.  She sent us invites to a new Google service that I think is kind of on the order of Gmail  when it first came out in terms of people wanting it.  It's called Inbox, and they say a marriage of Gmail and Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just to be clear before I start getting a barrage of emails,  I do not issue the invites.  Yes. You can have out.  I just happen to have a few Googlers who follow me on Twitter.  I asked. They sent exactly three.  Thank you, Gina.  I save them to my co-hosts. I don't have invites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really hard to know exactly what this is.  By the way, you can go to google.com slash inbox and request an invite.  That's where you should go.  Yes. Soon, they'll open it up.  Yeah. Well, maybe. I don't know.  Remember Gmail was in beta and you invite only for some time.  That was earlier Google.  What is this? Why should we want it?  What do you need it to, Lucy?  Because both Jeff and I have it, but we don't know what the hell to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm also kind of trying to figure out what this is.  I've only had it for an hour or so, and I'm still kind of confused by it.  But in short, it's a new updated client for Gmail,  which exists on Android, iOS, and the web at inbox.google.com.  And it adds features to it's kind of like Gmail supercharged.  It's got a little Google Now action where you can say,  set a reminder and remind me about this email in two days.  It's got some snooze this, mark this as done.  It bundles different types of emails similar to the way priority inbox groups,  emails by subject.  It's all material design.  It's all kind of a new take on it's got lots of different cool interactions,  but I'm still figuring it out.  I'll be really honest.  I haven't quite gotten my head around this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It reminds me a little bit of Mailbox, which is an app we've talked about.  First came out on iOS, then Macintosh, and I think there's Android versions now.  Same idea.  In fact, Mailbox really opened people's eyes to a new way of handling mail.  You swipe left or right.  Mailbox has four different states.  You could swipe all the way to the left to delete it,  sort of the way to the left to archive it, all the way to the right to snooze it.  This has those features in it.  But as you point out, it also incorporates those new categories  that were introduced in Gmail a while ago, promos.  But they have new ones too.  They're called these bundles.  So there's purchases, promos.  Promos are basically bacon, stuff you agreed to sign up for,  but don't really want to read.  Purchases are actually what you want.  Nowadays, especially with Google Wallet and Apple Pay,  purchases will collate all of the receipts into one package.  Your orders too.  There's travel.  I'm about to travel, and it would be kind of nice to have  all the emails associated with my flight, my rental car, my hotel,  and one full travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And again, it's not just that you have the email in one spot.  The preview in the listing alone tells you what you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So here's a Virgin America reservation on their sample page,  and there's a link that says check in.  What's the URL on that page we're looking at right there?  This is google.com slash inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google.com slash inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is their preview page.  And you can create your own bundles.  So I would create, for instance, a Twit bundle for emails from the twit.tv domain.  I see they have book club, weekend, whoa-hoo, ski buddies as samples.  So your bundles could be added to the list of bundles.  So bundles are essentially email filters.  In fact, the setup is very much like setting up an email filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's little bits and pieces from...  I don't know if you go through.  Sagan?  Can you do a never show me this again bundle?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, you could, I presume.  But it's very easy to get rid of stuff by swiping it off.  Swipe it one way, it gets rid of it.  Swipe it the other way, it snoozes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let me understand.  So you swipe it the one way.  That's telling Google, I don't care about this.  You swipe it the other way.  It's telling Google, yes, I care about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kind of, sort of.  Well, it's telling Google, remind me about this later.  I don't care about this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because the problem is, because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's an issue I can imagine for Google.  Because you can now see the essence of the email in the preview,  you might swipe it off.  You might say, thank you, great.  I now found out everything.  That was very important to me, and swipe it off.  Or you could say, I hate this.  I don't want this.  I don't care.  Please don't prioritize this in the future, Google, and swipe it off.  If the same action is the same signal,  I don't know how they're going to prioritize.  Well, they'll figure it out.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is pretty interesting.  If you do it on the web, by the way, obviously,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's not a touch screen, so swiping isn't available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless you have a Chromebook Pixel.  Unless you're a...  Well, I'd be curious if it knows that you have touch,  because on my desktop, I don't have touch,  but I have buttons for pin.  We didn't mention pin.  Pin is another category.  What you could do to triage your email is pin everything you want to save,  and then there's a button to change the email.  What you could do to change your email is pin everything you want to save,  and then there's a sweep button.  Microsoft invented this for Outlook mail  that will sweep un-pinned items off as done.  So I think the idea is somewhat like the triage capabilities of Mailbox,  where you're going toward inbox zero.  You're very quickly dealing with everything.  Either get rid of it, do something about it, postpone it, or pin it,  and then you sweep everything else away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you see, that's not my behavior.  Google taught me not to do that.  Google taught me just to leave it, and it'll go out below.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't...  Sweeping it doesn't get rid of it.  It just puts it in a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't even do...  Most of my email, I don't do anything to.  I say, okay, I personally don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you look at my email, I have like 30,000 unread emails.  And by the way, my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pfft, is wrong.  I, on my wonderful Pixel,  the sweeping of an individual item doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You have to still use those buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, dang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was hoping the web-based material design would be touch sensitive.  That's interesting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything you've marked done is stored in a done folder, as well as our...  So done just means I'm done with this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that an alias to archive?  It must be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the other question.  Yeah.  So your normal Gmail, is this...  I mean, are you affecting Gmail itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've got to be, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anything you marked done is safely stored here.  Emails you previously archived, they're here too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's added...  Has it added?  So it's archived.  I mean, look.  It is archived.  Because I don't see new boxes with the labels that they talk about.  Oh, maybe I do.  I see social promote...  Yeah, I do.  So you'll also see if you've turned on categorization in the email inbox on Gmail, you'll also see those categories there.  And I presume if I add another bundle, I will see that category too.  So bundles equal labels in Google Speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They behave slightly differently.  Right?  Because...  What's a bundle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those have different characteristics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems like they'll group...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't put bundles I create in the categories list.  They now become a new label.  So bundles I create are really just labels.  The bundles Google's created are more categories.  They go in the categories section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  They seem to group similar emails in a way even beyond just conversation threads.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that.  I mean, Google does...  And I think as I remember, Jeff, you did not turn on categories in your Gmail.  You didn't like that.  I didn't.  The automatic thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this got...  I wish I could show you guys this.  This has got some Google Now action going on.  So I'm checking in on a Virgin America flight tomorrow.  And so I have my Virgin America, you know, it's time to check in email.  And I've got, you know, the flight number.  It looks very Google Now-ish.  It expands down the flight number.  It's willing to check in.  You know, New York, San Francisco.  Like it knows that the email...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the key to this to me is that preview is that you don't need to open a lot of it.  You'll have to open email a lot less time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what you do is you open inbox instead of email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As I'm saying, you just pull the email out and it will be before you at a glance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, I...  Okay.  I'll make a commitment to use this for the next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't do it.  I don't use my vanilla Gmail account as my...  It doesn't work with apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll use it for my account I never use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google!  All right.  I will use it.  Google!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You promised me you were going to fix this and you don't.  I yelled at you when I was out there.  I love you guys.  But really, really, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This doesn't...  Are you saying this doesn't work with your apps account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not yet.  It was even worse than that, Leo.  Gina nicely sent the invite to me to my apps account.  I opened it up and it says, oh, sorry, sucker.  So she had to send it to my Gmail account for it to work.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It actually detected whether or not it was in your Gmail inbox.  Just, you know, they can do that, right?  And you know, this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me just say, because I went and talked to the work people.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those people are paying for apps now.  They're paying for apps functionality to make apps people second class citizens.  Not the best thing, Google.  Not the sportiest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, I have some trepidation about completely trusting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, moment of zen.  Trust the machine, Leo.  Trust the machine.  I just said the same...  We all said the same thing, I think, when priority inbox came out and it has not failed me.  It is a rare, rare moment.  You're still using that.  At the bottom of the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I don't use priority anymore because I moved to the next thing Google invented called  categories.  Scattergories.  So I use...  So I don't have a priority inbox.  I have a primary inbox.  Same idea, though.  And that's been reliable.  And so, in a way, having gotten used to now the idea that promotional stuff is in one  tab and updates are in another tab, I am perhaps now more likely to use inbox.  This is...  Hey, I'm glad they keep trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Priority inbox just means I ignore more people without guilt, which I guess is a nice thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this is part of the problem is that email is so broken and everybody is trying to figure  out a way to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can't fix email as is.  You can't add on to the existing infrastructure and it's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what this is, I'm sorry to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it has to be.  But you've got to totally create an entirely new email infrastructure and ecosystem.  Right.  And that's the kind of ambition Google can have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, the other problem I have is that you and I, Jeff, we don't do much with our emails.  So, we just have 14,838 unread emails in my inbox.  You especially because the world emails you.  Well, I get a lot of email.  But this is really about inbox zero, isn't it?  I mean, it only makes sense if I sweep it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, because I think those previews are key to this.  But I have all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I could scroll forever.  I have all this stuff from previous days.  Maybe I should sweep that out of the way.  The problem is, doesn't it do that on my Gmail?  So, well, but now it's in the done.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I disagree.  Google always still leaves the search.  It's not going to get you to Gmail.  You can sweep stuff out, but you can also just let it go down the screen.  Right.  And it has a clear demarcation from today and yesterday, which is kind of nice.  Because it kind of says, if it was yesterday and you didn't deal with it, you could go back there.  But you don't have to.  It's just still there.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because you only sweep a day's worth of mail when you sweep.  Isn't that right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Looks that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you sweep each day by itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in the rundown under this story, I put a report there were a couple of them about a leak of Gmail 5.0.  Two days ago.  Yeah.  Yeah, I believe that this is a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I'm asking.  Well, yeah, I think that Gmail 5.0 is actually an upgrade to the native default Gmail 5.0.  For lollipop.  For lollipop.  Yeah.  We're seeing a lot of 5.0 versions.  There's Play Store 5.0 as well.  Right.  They're basically lollipopized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  But the Gmail 5.0, according to the report, will also handle Yahoo mail and other such  things.  As it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Because Gmail 5.0 is a different thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  So there's a default email client, which is a generic IMAP pop email client, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then there's the Gmail app, which handles Gmail, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just Gmail.  Just Gmail.  Now you could always pop or IMAP or I guess just pop to Gmail on the web and then have  that bring up the email.  Yeah.  And then you can also have a Gmail app that can handle all of the emails.  Yeah.  You could always pop or IMAP or I guess just pop to Gmail on the web and then have that  bring down or have your email forwarded.  This is different.  This is actually Gmail, the client acting as just a straight pop three or IMAP client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unified inbox, as most mail clients will do.  Okay.  That's all I saw.  And I think what that means is they're going to deprecate the AOSP email client and Gmail  going forward, Gmail 5.0, will be the default email client in AOSP.  That would be my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Because I think there's proprietary code.  I don't think that they're going to open source the Gmail app.  There's proprietary code there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right.  So this is why you have to buy a Nexus 6 phone, know what is official, what is open.  But I would guess that on most Nexus phones, Gmail will be kind of the default email app,  right?  I don't even know if they'll include an email app because it'll do everything the email  app will do.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, and just to make things more confusing, they've introduced a third mobile email app  called Inbox.  Just because we weren't yet baffled enough.  I like Inbox though.  I think I could get used to it.  I like this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the other question I'm going to have.  Is that because I'm a Chrome user on airplanes, I use offline email Chrome app.  Which is really useful because I can read my mail offline.  And the question is, will they make this an offline app as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, interesting.  Yeah.  I mean, it seems like it makes sense that this would be an offline app as well, but  probably not there yet.  Right?  So you have to sync.  You have to install it as a Chrome app and then sync it.  You say get, you know, sync and then you get on the plane and you've got everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I'd almost like to see is them turning Gmail into a true plain IMAP client.  Because right now it has extensions that, for instance, in IMAP emails in one and exactly  one folder.  In with Google's labels, you could have multiple labels.  And so there's no direct mapping of Google's Gmail organizational strategy to an IMAP  organizational strategy.  What if Google just went to true IMAP?  That's been a problem, for instance, for Apple and its mail app.  What if Google just made Gmail an IMAP standard email client and then used these third, you  know, these other mobile clients and new desktop client as a way of doing its oddball labeling  system?  I think that would be good.  Then we wouldn't have a non-standard IMAP on Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But OK, but there's still back end functionality for, for example, priority inbox that adds  a lot of value.  Yeah.  So it's not Gmail is never going to be again, just a plain vanilla straight feed email account.  You could make it into the real value add of it is priority inbox and the thinking that  goes into the organization.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because priority inbox is one of many labels a single mail can have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of thinking that goes in behind that.  A lot of computing goes into that.  Well, it's just filtering.  Yeah, it's filtering, but it's very smart filtering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Multiple, multiple labels isn't going to go away.  I mean, they're just they're not incentivized to get rid of that at all.  Right.  I mean, if they're incentivized to get more Gmail users, right.  Like, like, so their IMAP implantation is a little janky.  It works.  Right.  I mean, technically it works, even though, you know, a one piece of mail could be in  several different folders.  Right.  They're not actually folders.  But I don't see them backing off on the multi-label feature, because I think it's one of the few  things that like distinguishes Gmail.  Right.  Yeah, it's real value add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Archie, I got a different question.  So this is presented as an Android slash iOS mobile app, but it also exists on the web.  Does this indicate anything about their thinking about Android v Chrome, Android v Web, and  how things are being developed, what they're being developed for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is this this this web app that inbox at Google dot com looks very material  design.  It's got the floating action button.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's got that floating action button.  It's got the transitions and the and the list items that kind of expand in place and the  nice kind of sliding back and forth.  I think that they use Polymer to build this.  Polymer is a framework that basically lets developers, you know, create material design-ish  apps on the web.  So, yeah, I mean, I think that Google is moving totally into this direction.  I think we're going to see it on the web.  I think we're going to see it in their Android apps.  I think that this material design is actually going to be we're going to see influences  of it everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say I'm just been playing around with this inbox and it does.  It is a nice thing to be able to really quickly triage email and then sweep the rest away.  I just went through my whole updates folder and picked one thing I wanted to save swept  the rest away.  That's great.  Same thing with my my finance folder.  I can go through here and this is all the credit card, you know, warnings and stuff  and I can just sweep up and say, OK, got it.  Sweep it away.  This is good.  This might really be a good solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I dig it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I dig it, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it is going to it is learning curve.  But I like it a lot.  I want it.  I want it for my apps account.  I want it for my primary email.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can't use this as an apps with your apps account.  It says what I what I try to do it.  It said your organization isn't ready for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, they are.  I think it's a terms of service privacy issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that it takes them longer, like for whatever legal reasons to opt or, you know,  apps organizations into the kind of permissions.  Give them excuses.  I still think they haven't figured out the damned to account thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe I love them.  I love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love them.  I did amazing work.  But you know, this is the when Gina and I were going to email back before, I just said,  you know, Q Jarvis as fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did say that, didn't it?  Hey, I've just gone through all of my while you have been talking, gone through all of  my email and swept away everything but three messages, which I pinned.  I got to at least daily inbox zero for the 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Congratulations.  Yeah, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was really easy, but that was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's that's certainly was the purpose of apps like mailbox.  Right.  And it seems like inbox is following in those footsteps is giving you an easy way to clear  out your inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very influenced by mailbox, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not a lot of people, not everybody clears out their inbox every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't.  That's why it's such a big deal that I did for the first time in my life while you were  talking and that's and it does reflect itself back on your regular Gmail interface, which  is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when you when you pin it, what happens with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It then now stays in that inbox until you handle it.  And when you pin something, you can no longer sweep it away.  So what you do.  So this is what I just did.  I went through each bundle, scanned it, pinned the ones I knew I wanted to act upon, ignored  the ones I knew I didn't care about now that I've read them or at least looked at them  and swept everything away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I had basically like starring was but instead of going to a separate star category, it now  stays in the yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you have this sweep command, which means that once you start stuff, you can get rid  of the stuff you didn't use star.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then then then you can separately you can say, remind me about this in three days.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a separate thing.  A separate thing.  So there's pinning and there's snoozing.  Pinning is saying, stay here.  I'm not done with you.  Snoozing is remind me tomorrow.  And I did snooze three or four things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's archiving and killing.  There's not because before you really basically couldn't kill Gmail.  I mean, you could, but they made it difficult.  They said, don't bother.  So now there's a distinction between archiving and killing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, trash or archive.  Yeah, you don't have a trash button on this, by the way, the way they think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no trash button on this.  The worst, the worst you can do to email is put it in done, which you say Gina is the  same as the archive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are times when you want to erase, erase, erase things.  I mean, your own email, you have a right to forget.  No, sorry.  Erase, erase, erase an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, sorry.  You don't get to erase, erase, erase it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an issue for companies that have lawyers saying, get rid of the digital paper trail.  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I take it back.  OK.  So the big three buttons and the swipe choices are pin snooze done.  But then there's a menu.  There's a three button menu thing.  And in there it says move to and among other things, you can move it to trash or move it  to spam or move it to bundles or unbundled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have this vision that somewhere at Google right now, there's three people from this  team having beer, laughing at us.  No, no, no, no, no.  Look over there.  Look over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think I think what they're doing is rooting for us.  He'll figure it out.  Come on.  They're not laughing.  They're going, OK, OK.  Do you get it?  Do you get it?  No.  OK.  Keep trying.  I think this actually I'm kind of liking it.  But we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The location based reminders are pretty cool too.  Pick a place.  It does that?  Yeah.  So you can say snooze until there are a couple of pre-set choices later today, tomorrow.  You can pick a date, a time, or then you can pick a place.  So when I get to work, remind me about this email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, even though I swept my inbox, now there's like 30 more emails in there.  That's the problem.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Told you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just fixed it.  That was a good time.  I just cleaned you out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's when you're going to give up is what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it fan email?  What fills you up immediately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just, yes, lots of stuff.  Bacon.  There's a lot of bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you sign up for crap over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it's also, anytime I use my credit card, card not present, I get an email anytime.  I also turn on alerts and financial things.  There's just a lot of email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I go back.  The thing I've mentioned on the show over the years is that Marissa Meyer talking about the hyper personal news stream.  Google is trying to let you know at a glance what you need to know in the context of your needs.  That's Google's goal.  They very cleverly bit by bit, piece by piece, find new ways.  Here's the way I've been putting it lately.  In Seoul, they asked me to do what would Google do presentation.  I'm thinking it's five years old.  Hey, great.  What would Google do five years later?  I look back and Android was new in that time.  I really saw that Google is a personal services company.  Yeah, I agree.  That's just so key to where Google is.  I saw the glimmers of where it was going, but just this whole notion that I talk about them being in the signals business.  The reason is because they, unlike mass media, unlike mass manufacturers and marketers, unlike government, Google gives you personal service.  That's their goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What better thing for them to put their big brains to work on than solving email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I said earlier in the show.  I think that they have not moonshotted this.  The moonshot for email is to invent an entirely new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was Google Wave and we saw what happened with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was recipient controlled communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wave was absolutely a moonshot.  In fact, wasn't it some of the Gmail team was involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was the Google Maps team.  It was the Maps team.  Lars and his brother.  Yeah, it came from Maps.  Yeah.  Rasmussen's.  Yeah, I mean, Wave was a shot at that.  You could argue that social networks are the better email.  The problem, the reason why I defend email and I want email to stick around because it's the only truly federated system that everybody uses.  That's great.  You know what I mean?  That's easy to set up and everyone uses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not reinventing email.  We're reinventing how we perceive it and process it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're trying to fix its inherent vulnerabilities and weaknesses.  Well, and there's nothing.  Google could invent something new that's federated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  It wouldn't be federated.  It'd be Google.  Then you'd have to get everybody else to agree to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the difference because Gina was right.  Just a minute.  Google Plus, my friend Bob Wyman at Google lectured me years ago and he said Jarvis, the problem with Gmail, with email.  From the day one, I know the day the decision was made is when it became center control.  And we talked about this in the show back when Google Plus started.  Google Plus is recipient controlled.  And that's the essence of an entirely different communication scheme.  But you're right.  That's just Google.  That's the weakness of it is it's just Google.  What if you truly could imagine a federated recipient controlled Google Plus where not every fine, you're still going to have email, Gina,  and you're still going to get the stuff that you didn't ask for or whatever.  And Google is still going to help you try to fix that as best as it can.  What if all your really important communication went through?  What do we do instead?  We try Facebook.  Facebook is controlled, not federated.  Limited.  It's the closest thing we have to everybody being there, but it's not built to communicate.  It's not what it's there for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is federated?  Would you explain that, Gina?  I think Gina could do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Federated is when is a peer to peer network where there's several different servers, all of whom have the same are on the same ground.  Right. They all have the same amount of power and they exchange information peer to peer.  They're equals.  Exactly.  Versus a collection of servers controlled by one company that serves out to clients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when email first started, it was that latter situation.  You had MCI mail or you had Genie or you had AOL, you had CompuServe and you could email anybody within that system.  But getting email from MCI to AOL was very hard because it had to go through a gateway and it was just hard.  You had to know how to do it.  You had to know the right address.  So they solved that problem by federating by saying, look, everybody has a canonical email address that is some name at and the host that hosts your email, AOL or Genie or MCI mail.  So they had a system of naming that everybody understood.  And then they set up the interconnect.  So you didn't have to even think about it.  You just I would write to Gina at AOL dot com and it would get to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is pre-TCPIP.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not exactly.  But TCPIP is a protocol.  It's pre-web.  It's pre-web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it was also pre-TCPIP, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess it is because it's using SMTP and POP or some other system.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the federation of all those POP and IMAP servers, and that's kind of one of the cool things, is that not only did you you could you be on disparate servers, you could be a service that use different protocols, POP or IMAP or Exchange.  And the email would still magically get to where you sent it as long as you knew the address.  And that really worked quite nicely.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the problem was this was a different time.  Right.  This was 1971 when we were just trying to get the network to work.  Right.  Now there's no company that's financially incentivized to make a federated system.  There just isn't.  Right.  There's no reason why any company would say everybody can have an equal copy of the data that we can have.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter doesn't want to do federated.  They want to do Twitter.  Facebook doesn't want to do federated.  They don't want to do Facebook.  Google doesn't want to do federated.  They want to do Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if you go to the I would argue if you go to the WordPress model.  So what you know, people thought some people thought we're RSS is federated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  RSS was an attempt to create a federated protocol that would cross all of these systems.  Yes.  But people I think Gene is right.  There's no economic incentive to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me argue the WordPress model.  WordPress versus movable type.  Right.  Movable type said we own the software and yes, we'll let it out there, but we're going to limit it because we're going to go into business.  And we don't want you to compete with us.  WordPress, on the other hand, said no software open source stays at the dot org.  Anybody can do it.  And we're just the first company to build on top of it.  And indeed, it's a great business.  Mullenweg has a genius business there where he's building great business.  But I can use the WordPress underlying code and I can start my own hosting company competing with WordPress dot com.  And Mullenweg still benefits because I'm going to contribute to the code base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, we've conflated the different OSI levels.  TCPIP is still the protocol on top of which SMTP and PopRun.  I thought so.  That's simply a communication protocol.  And then there's email protocols that are well-understood.  And similarly, WordPress is at a higher level still than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All I was trying to suggest there by that was that even before we had broad use, standardized use of net,  you could connect MCI mail, which was not TCPIP, which was not internet, to other mail services, through a protocol.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a gateway.  Yeah, there was a gateway.  But you know, the best example of this is XMPP, which is a federated protocol.  It was a Jabber protocol.  Google used it for G-talk.  And what did Google do?  They killed it.  They said, you know, we don't want to support that anymore because exactly as you said, Gina, they have no economic incentive to do that.  They have every incentive to create a proprietary protocol that you can only use on Google and not to interoperate with everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the pattern is kind of you make this amazing client that works with a standard protocol that anybody can implement.  Right. But then your client becomes so good and so specialized and so proprietary that after a while you don't support the protocol.  I look at GitHub, for example, you know, Git is a distributed version control system and everyone that runs Git has an equal copy of the data and, you know, GitHub.  But GitHub itself is this amazing Git client with a bunch of add-ons, pull requests and social and tagging and user profiles and wikis and website hosting.  Right.  And people love GitHub is a great place to collaborate, but it is controlled by one company.  But it's based on this open source software.  Right. Much like much like WordPress.  Now WordPress has Jetpack, which is their sort of proprietary layer kind of on top of WordPress that gives you lots of things, site stats and that kind of thing.  But it all feeds back to automatic, which is the commercial entity on top of this is Thinkups model.  I mean, we're an open source software, but we're, you know, we're and we're a hosted company building a hosted service on top of it.  Because if it's too much of a pain to set it up yourself and that and that definitely works.  But there's definitely a tension between, you know, of course, we're building this client, say this I am client and we're going to have Java support in it.  Right. Until it gets so big and so good and so proprietary and so embedded into our system that, you know, it's just too much work to support Java anymore.  You should just use our stuff. Right.  You know, our stuff's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just I'm just wishing for some scenario for someone totally reinvents email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Email. Well, but OK, I'd say let me say say one thing is that that's the application layer and email.  All email is is a protocol for exchanging messages using universally accepted canonical addresses.  And there's a protocol for saying I got all the pieces.  I mean, there's a lot of underlying stuff.  The presentation layer is can be anything.  That's what Google's doing with inbox client.  That's the client.  And so I think what you want, Jeff, is a replacement on the presentation layer.  I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I'm going to disagree. I want people to not be able to send me anything unless I have approved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we've had systems like that as an anti-spam systems for some time.  Remember, I used to hate this.  You get an email for somebody saying, well, Jeff's not accepting email.  And if you prove you are who you say you are.  Well, but again, I think that's annoying, Jeff.  You don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How does Google Plus operate?  Right. Google Plus is a model for this.  I don't get and listen to Mike Elgin, right?  Mike Elgin, Mike Elgin is Dvorak 2.0, right?  Dvorak. I get John.  I get no spam Dvorak.  Right.  I get no trolls.  Elgin. Right.  Right. So Elgin.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In this way.  And that's, by the way, why I've completely moved all my social interactions to Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, you see.  He's right.  The question is, the big complaint about Google Plus is what?  Nobody's there. Just our geeky friends.  Just us.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And everybody with a Gmail account could conceivably be on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what would make Google Plus explode?  Opening it up.  I don't want it to explode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, in my circle of friends, my team, my company, they laugh when I mention Google Plus.  It's a punchline.  I mean, really, there's a certain community who's heavy iPhone Twitter users, for whom Google Plus is some weird,  it's a cultural indicator of some weird ASPy Googler.  Excuse my, I'm sorry, I apologize if that's offensive.  I like that though. I know what you're saying.  I never heard that phrase before, but I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't either.  It is a little offensive, but that's okay.  We all know what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm actually really regretting saying that. I'm sorry.  I never heard that before.  You know, but there is something about it.  She's trying to move on.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff and I will not let her.  No, move on, move on, move on.  No, but I find that interesting because I would think everybody you know would understand and love Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I come to you and on all about Android to be with my people, my fellow Google fans,  but you know, there's a lot of folks out there who just aren't, who aren't about it, you know.  They use Gmail, but that's it.  And they think Twitter's great?  People love the Twitter.  I know, I know. Listen, you know, everybody's got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Twitter numbers, all this week I have the top editors from Berta, the big German publisher with me,  and I'm brainwashing them and we're going around some great quarters.  And we visited Twitter. It was a great visit.  But the numbers on Twitter, especially let's say in Europe, are really small.  WhatsApp is much bigger in a lot of countries.  And what's the deal about WhatsApp?  WhatsApp is more recipient control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. You can't WhatsApp me unless I approve you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So maybe WhatsApp is what I'm looking for, even though I don't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there are a lot of cases where you want somebody you haven't previously approved to communicate.  That's what email becomes. That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Email is a separate system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Well, then, Jeff, you don't want to reinvent email.  You just want to stop using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to make it less important to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, I think inbox is kind of about that.  It's kind of about saying, well, here's stuff here.  If we do this organizational stuff, you can quickly find the stuff that you want to get an email.  And all of your marketing transactions can happen elsewhere.  Right. Sorry about that.  It'd be nice if actually if inbox could forward could say, you seem to be talking to that person a lot.  Why don't you go move to WhatsApp?  That would be good.  That would be good.  Should we just change that to WhatsApp account?  Maybe that's what Google needs to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That Facebook has WhatsApp and Facebook has Messenger.  And I was just saying a few minutes ago that Facebook's not a communications company.  All right. Facebook is not a communications application, but Facebook is becoming a communications company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know what happens is people want to want me to use Messenger.  And some people insist on communicating with me with Messenger.  And this is the problem with Messenger, Jeff, because unlike WhatsApp, if you have a Facebook account,  you have a Messenger in inlet.  And so WhatsApp, you have to explicitly say, I'm going to allow that person to share with me unless he knows my phone number.  He can't. And for Facebook, anybody who has a Facebook account can can bother you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So your canonical address in this world becomes your phone number and using that, figuring that this is OK.  I see the brilliance WhatsApp now suddenly, knowing that everyone has a canonical address.  But it's built across that.  But it's not widely known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only your friends know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can choose how it's on my business card.  You can choose how to put it out there. You can also have some choice whether to accept or not.  My point is this. Google and Google Plus tried to make everybody get a canonical address called a Gmail address.  And they finally gave up. WhatsApp more cleverly said, no, no, no, no, nobody can make this happen, which is Gina's point.  Nobody's going to build that. There already is a new canonical address.  It's the phone number. What can we build on top of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And people are saying in the chat room, well, you can face you can WhatsApp anybody, you know, their phone number.  Well, that's the point is that you control the phone number and much more tightly than you do your email address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we're also people who publicize our email address.  Maybe we should. Maybe that was our mistake.  I mean, you know, you have to think about the fact that email electronic mail was built on the model of like an electronic version of postal mail.  Well, somewhere where if someone has your street address, they can send you a letter. Right.  Postal mail and electronic mail is that with postal mail, the onus is on the sender.  They have to pay for a stamp. They have to get the envelope.  It's a pain. It's a pain to send somebody a letter. Right.  With email, the onus is on the recipient because it's because it costs so little and because it's so easy for the sender to send email.  If you publicize your email address on websites that get millions of hits versus your postal address in a white pages, you know, you're going to get killed.  So here's the easy fix. I don't know why I didn't think of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, this is all you do. And many people do this. You have different email addresses.  You have a public email address. You have one you give to a close circle of friends when you only give to intimates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have enough trouble dealing with the two I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's really what you're doing with that. What's happening?  Well, my my phone number is a little bit more secure, so I'm going to use that for the most intimate conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Inevitable. No, no. Here's why.  You know, here's why I don't think that'll work, because inevitably it leaks in the spammer world and it gets ruined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a friend who has solved this. My friend changes his email address yearly in a regular known fashion.  His friends will know what to do each year to change his email address and to be able to get through to him.  And he deprecates last year's email address, doesn't use it anymore.  It's brilliant. What a pain. What a pain.  But I know as his close friend, I know how to email him. But I'm going to start doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, I'll whisper to you my secret.  On WhatsApp, not only do you have everything Gina just explained, you also have at the moment of someone trying to communicate with you, you have the option at that time to say, no.  Can you block them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you just decline.  Decline and they can never contact you.  Yeah, I think so. Can't you?  But you're just doing what you are actually just doing what you could do with an email address, which is have a higher security one and a lower security one.  You can't spam WhatsApp. You can't spam WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If your email address leaks out in any way, it will prop your email will propagate against spam world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if your phone number leaks out in any way, you will see the idea is really your phone number is not as easy to use as an email address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you'll get invitations, but you have the opportunity at that moment to refuse the invitation.  Right. I mean, I don't use WhatsApp, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why WhatsApp is worth twenty two billion dollars right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You nailed it. Yeah, because I'm now seeing the architectural insight into it.  And it is Dr. Berg's appreciation for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This this kind of segues that the email or the email address versus phone number conversation kind of segues a little bit into the announcements that Twitter made today.  Did you get did you guys see that?  Let's take a break and talk about those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We also have third quarter results for Google.  Lots of news, but we are going to take a break now because we're brought to you by a fine company that's up in Canada that we love so dearly.  It's called hover dot com.  This is it's it's a quality service run by nice guys who really protect you.  They do the right thing.  For instance, they take all the hassle and friction out of registering a new domain name.  They know you want who is privacy.  They just include it.  They don't give you 50 check boxes and upsell you five ways from Sunday before you can buy the domain name.  Right now is a great time to get a domain name at hover dot com.  They've lowered the prices on 200 plus extensions.  Many TLDs they reduce the price for a new dot com domain name.  It's now 1299 a year.  Who is privacy always included.  And that's one of the reasons you can't just kind of you can't compare with it because they they have the best domain name management system.  Let's you set up DNS do all the right things.  And it's so easy to use in less than five minutes.  You'll find the domain name you want.  Buy it and get it up and running.  They even have a valet transfer service.  This is I highly look not available.  But here's some other choices.  I highly recommend that when you move to hover you get let them do it.  It's free.  They'll take care of the entire process for you.  They'll transfer your DNS settings and everything at no additional cost.  Then you get all the benefits of hover dot com.  They've got great customer support.  They're famous for their no wait no hold no transfer phone service.  When you call you will get a representatives who is empowered to fix your problem.  Not that you're going to have any.  They're so good.  I've never had to call them.  They also offer volume discounts.  If you're one of those people who likes to register a lot of domains or you've got a bunch of domain renewals coming up.  The volume discounts start at 10 known domains and go up in value from there.  You can add email to any of your domains.  They have every one of all weird top level domains as well as the dot com and dot net.  I just think they're great.  Hover gives you exactly what you need to get the job done with no fuss.  H-O-V-E-R dot com 10 percent off your first purchase when you use our offer code twig10.  Take advantage of that.  Twig10 at hover.  H-O-V-E-R dot com.  Just do it.  Just do it.  Hover is great.  Yeah.  See.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unsolicited.  Hover is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I registered my domain.  We've all suffered so much and I've moved.  I keep trying to remember who was the first one that everybody used.  I can't remember.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is pre-Dead Elephants and NASCAR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Pre-Dead Elephants and NASCAR babes.  I admit I had an account with them at one time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it was so, it felt so nice to move over to Hover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See ya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Bye bye.  So what did Twitter just do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Twitter had a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Twitter had their first developer conference in several years.  It's actually going on today in San Francisco.  But they had a live keynote this morning and they introduced a bunch of stuff.  Basically, they're trying, a bunch of stuff for developers.  Okay.  So none of this is really consumer facing yet.  But essentially a mobile toolkit of a bunch of tools that help developers embed tweets  and sign in with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not telling people develop Twitter clients.  They're telling them to put Twitter in their application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Put Twitter in your mobile application.  And one of these tools that they introduced is called Digits.  And it's their effort at removing email addresses and passwords from signing up for mobile apps.  So Twitter project product managers kind of traveled the world to do some research on how people use the web  and how does Twitter get new users.  And one of the things they found is that the farther that you go away from the United States,  the less likely it is that someone has an email address.  Everyone's mobile phone is the way that they identify themselves.  So what Digits does is it's this, you know, it's a bit of UX you can embed into your mobile app  that lets users sign up for your app using your mobile phone number.  So you enter your number, your app SMSes you an authorization code, you enter the auth code, and you're in.  No email address, no account activation.  Right, exactly.  Exactly.  So similar to the way WhatsApp and Yo! works.  So it just reminded me because what Jeff was saying earlier was like, oh right.  This makes sense.  This makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, but this is a bigger, huge strategy shift for Twitter.  Yes.  And it depends upon developers trusting Twitter.  Notice when you started this saying, well, Twitter hasn't had a developers conference in a few years  because the developers would have thrown spitballs at them for the way that it treated developers before.  So explain to me what a developer, what you in an app would get out of doing this in your app.  And then explain to me what, then Twitter, as far as I can tell, gets to be at the center of things  and gets to sell ad revenue and okay, it gets data.  Okay.  What does the developer get?  Why would you build on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so I mean, this is from what I understand, this is a mobile developer's toolkit.  I think that it's still really hard.  Fabric?  Yeah, fabric is part of it.  Is it like material?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or textile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The idea that Twitter is offering tools, development tools and SDKs to help mobile developers get certain,  get particular tasks done in their app, like single sign-on, like embedding a tweet, like getting crash statistics.  Crashlytics, they call it.  Crashlytics is one of the things that they're offering, right?  So as a developer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should have fail- faillytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does this mean it's hosted by Twitter and you're going through Twitter's services,  or does this mean this is just a standard separate from Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are like bits of code that you can embed into your mobile app.  It's an SDK.  So yeah, it's an SDK.  You embed them on your mobile app.  And so yes, I mean, Twitter is collecting, for instance, your crash reports,  since you log into Twitter to see what those look like.  And yes, users maybe are signing in with Twitter, so you're using Twitter's authorization,  but that's the same as using sign-in with Facebook or sign-in with Google.  Basically, Twitter's trying to make life on mobile developers as easy as possible,  and they're trying to make Twitter a central part of any mobile app.  And the way that they're trying to do that is to offer these best-in-class developer tools.  Now, Twitter's basically said that they've learned a lot developing their own mobile apps,  and they want to share what they've learned and the tools that they have internally  with the developer community.  And this isn't unprecedented, right?  Like if you look at Bootstrap, actually Twitter's open-sourced  and released a lot of different frameworks and things.  In fact, I use Bootstrap all the time.  It's great.  I mean, it's a fantastic framework.  They're good at making developer tools.  Most developer tools are pretty crappy.  So as a developer, this is attractive to me.  Maybe they're offering something for me better than the app store's crash logs  or the Play Store's crash logs.  Android is a first-class citizen in this effort, from what I understand.  Really good tools here for Android as well.  So you have Twitter, which is not Apple, and it's not Google, right?  So it's kind of this neutral third party that lets you add in components to your mobile app  that you don't have to code yourself, right?  Because the thing is, you're building your app.  It's not just building, right?  But it also needs all these other things, right?  It needs sign-in.  It needs crash reports.  It needs all these little bits of functionality.  As a developer, you don't want to spend time on that.  You don't want to reinvent the wheel.  You don't want to have to do that for every app that you build.  That's what Twitter is trying to offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter's done this before.  Didn't they have Bootstrap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wasn't that?  Yeah, Bootstrap was one of the frameworks that Twitter offers.  Twitter makes really great developer tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So as a developer, when...  If you put in all these things into your app, what is Twitter getting out of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter gets more users, particularly with the sign-in stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they get Twitter in your app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They get Twitter in your app.  They get tons more tweet impressions.  They get to control or they have some say about the way that you're displaying their content,  so the way that they're displaying tweets.  So when you display a tweet, there's generally functionality shown with it,  like favorite, retweet, reply, DM, et cetera.  Is this even about tweets?  I'm sorry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this even about tweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it is because in fact what it does is kind of changes Twitter to be an infrastructure,  to be what people often thought Twitter would be like the dial tone of the internet.  And it kind of makes it more of that.  It's not so much about the public presentation of Twitter as a whole,  but how Twitter is used as a communication medium within your app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it makes it a mobile platform company is what it does, which is a huge shift.  So this isn't at all about the consumer product.  It's very interesting.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I like it because that eliminates the whole trollish nature of Twitter  because you control the community because it's whoever's using your app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, hold on, hold on. Explain that. Explain that, Lucy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, right now there's a public-facing Twitter that's everything, right?  Whoever you follow and all the garbage that goes into that and whoever ads you and whatever.  And it's just a big mound of horse poo with a pony buried somewhere in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With a bird flying over it and a whale from how it's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think with many birds dropping more horse poo.  So I would think that this would be, let's say I'm The Voice.  Right now on The Voice what they do is they say vote on Twitter, put hashtag the person's name,  and it becomes part of that pile of poo.  But a voice app could incorporate this all in it,  use Twitter as more of a backend infrastructure and surface just the appropriate tweets into the app,  making it much more useful for The Voice and its users and viewers  and much less a part of the massive car wreck that is Twitter today.  And Twitter still gets the benefit, right?  In fact, it's better for them because they now can say, they can now say to advertisers,  hey, by the way, we get all these people using The Voice and they can monetize it.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what has Twitter's problem been?  Well, there was a discussion I had about Germans and Twitter.  They need more signups. So they become infrastructural.  Right.  You sign up.  All right. So the question you have to ask and maybe it's because Twitter smokes more now and is nicer.  But if Twitter does what it's done before and pulls the rug out, what happens to your apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the grand question of any developer who depends on a third party service, you know, when they build their app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this circles back to that discussion of Federation versus Silo.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's the convenience versus risk, you know, the thing that we always say.  I mean, look, you know, I build an app based on Twitter.  We use Amazon Payments.  You know, we use Google Analytics.  We're dependent on, you know, my company is dependent on all these third party services that at any moment could change their mind or take it down or block us.  And that's just kind of, you know, it's kind of one of the tradeoffs that you make when you decide to make an app.  Now, Twitter did in a lot of developers views totally screw over the developer community.  Marco wrote a post about this.  I thought it was a little heavy handed personally, but I get it.  Like, I get that client makers felt really burned by Twitter doing, you know, kind of a 180 from a very open API to a very limited API.  These announcements they made today are pretty separate than that.  They're orthogonal.  But, you know, I was at the original Twitter developer conference.  I think they did it and it was called Chirp.  And I think it happened in 2010.  And at that conference, they announced a thing called annotated tweets, which was a way to like pack lots of different information into a tweet, like any sort of metadata that you wanted.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which was a great idea.  They deprecated it.  It never happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't even think it ever launched.  So I don't I don't I actually think fabric is not that was treating, by the way, Twitter more like XMPP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what XMPP does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  They were trying to figure out a way.  Hey, we want to push packets across the network and however developers define.  I mean, it was a very exciting, big idea.  It never really happened.  Fabric appears to be less vaporware.  I mean, I think you can actually download some of these components and use them now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think devs understand this and already are using it by using the Twitter authentication system.  Right.  And this is this.  You're a step.  Look, I don't think this is a risk for a developer that you get all these benefits.  And if Twitter goes away, which doesn't look like it's going to do anytime soon, you go you do Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not Twitter dying.  It's about Twitter changing the rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they change the rules and you change to Facebook.  I mean, right.  We all we all have Facebook.  But now here's the problem, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And listen, Twitter sign up is extremely convenient.  Twitter and Facebook sign up is extremely convenient.  Google sign up is never really taken off.  But it's there.  And you know, it's all like crazy on Android devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You use it like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But at some point, if I sign in through a service through Twitter, that's where my linkage is.  And if Twitter changes the rules or I I'm violating Twitter's rules and Twitter pulls back on me or whatever, or my light switch goes off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I feel like this is I hope and it may not be, but it almost feels like Twitter is reinventing itself.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to understand that.  And I want to trust it.  I'm trying to put it in the context of Twitter's culture and behavior previously.  I think that's important.  Well, maybe they want to turn over a new leaf, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they want to be better now.  Maybe they want to turn over a new leaf.  And they've got that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they got to they got to acknowledge the past and they've got to give us reasons for future trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Twitter must see the writing on the wall at this point that the public facing Twitter has some real problems.  Don't you?  I mean, it's obvious to me with the you know, all the harassment and GamerGate.  How does it how does it happen?  Twitter.  This is Twitter is.  Yeah.  Arab Spring.  Blah, blah, blah.  Great.  But the truth is Google Plus and Facebook don't have nearly the problem that Twitter has with harassment.  Most her Twitter has become the channel for harassing people.  Yes.  Yeah.  Agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They must know how to fix that.  It lets you have a little world maybe for the voice where you see voice stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's people use Twitter to create communities.  And it's a form of federation because they're all through Twitter, but it's all owned by Twitter.  So what do I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I belong to 100 different Twitter communities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you have a single Twitter sign on and you'll notice when you use an app that has a Twitter interface.  Hey, good news.  And you will see in that app only the stuff that's really germane and apropos using Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll come across Twitter like an Intel chip here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be everywhere.  They hope.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm maybe that's wishful thinking on my part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I you have a point, Leo.  I think that this is a completely separate issue from the harassment issue.  And I like to think that there are going to be developers who say Twitter does not try it doesn't make any effort to protect its users or doesn't make an effort.  I mean, I wouldn't use 4chan sign in kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think Twitter must say, gosh, we're turning into 4chan.  Don't you think?  God, if they're paying attention, they must be thinking that the brand the brand is affected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long before the voice says, gosh, we cannot use these Twitter hashtags anymore because our fans are going to Twitter and are going.  I don't know.  I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder if it's if we are a small community of people who are sort of tuned into this happening.  I mean, how many people are friends with an indie game developer who got driven from her home for threats?  Like, I don't think I don't think that many.  And Gamergate at this point is so convoluted.  And we haven't talked about it, but it's it's you know, it's tough to understand.  Deadspin did an article, which is a sports blog.  And, you know, a friend of mine was like, who's a big sports fan was like this game, Gamergate thing.  What what the hell?  And it was nobody knows.  Right.  And you know, a ten thousand word article explaining.  I mean, I wonder, you know, it's a big deal to me and it's a big deal to us because we care about these things.  But I wonder if it really is.  I mean, does Twitter really know how bad it is?  I don't know.  I mean, they haven't they haven't even verified it.  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, they haven't they haven't even verified Anita Anita Sarkeesian's Twitter account.  She's got she's got tons and tons of of accounts that are clearly impersonating her, you know, you know, ripping her profile and her cover photo.  And like the whole reason why verification exists is to is to address the and they're not even doing that.  And they're not even doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't do any good when you when you look at the imposter site and what you what are you expected to do to do to do a background research on on all these Twitter accounts to find the right one.  The green check doesn't mean crap.  I just feel like if if a normal person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First of all, no normal people probably don't use my mom isn't going to use Twitter.  But let's say my mom goes to Twitter dot com signs up.  And of course, Twitter does its best to do the intake and give her some interesting stuff to follow.  But she starts seeing streams and maybe she starts following people.  It doesn't take very long before even OK, maybe it's not even a good thing.  OK, maybe it's not even offensive.  It's just chaotic.  And it's a it's a strange culture.  It's not it's weird.  Right.  And there's weird abbreviations.  It's just it feels like a little bit.  Why?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still tiny and all that.  Why?  Why does every weather person in America push their Twitter stuff?  Why do all these big shows push Twitter?  But tell me why has it not taken off more than you tell me why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are they all using hashtags?  Why does every show use a hashtag and Twitter is not mass?  Yeah, but that's why I'm wondering why.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with you.  Here's here's my bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chad's going to tell us why, because he's under 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no other service that does that real time public posting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's why I think that's why important because Twitter recognizes that it does have a lock on a certain market.  And what it's looking at is better ways to provide that service for individual communities that will be more appealing to communities that will eliminate the heat it's getting from things like gamer game.  That's why I think Fabric would make sense as a strategic shift for Twitter.  And who knows what they know what they're doing here.  Here's my issue.  I don't claim any understanding of what they're up to.  But it's like IRC.  What if everybody what if people wander into an IRC channel?  Not ours is pretty well protected.  We have lots of mods up and just a normal IRC channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what if you're on a wonder or read it or a fortune or read it or fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So if you're trying to be a mainstream business and get the approval and appreciation of Wall Street.  You you got to start thinking about how do we present better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, but this goes back to our email discussion in Leo.  So then Twitter has two options.  One, which they avoided until the ISIS videos would be to try to censor the content.  Governments try to make them do that and so on and so forth.  Nearly impossible.  You cannot stay ahead of it.  But maybe they do, in which case it's no longer an open platform.  It's no longer an open stream.  Ferguson might not bubble up anymore.  Governments can control it more, which is Twitter.  Is it open?  In which case, if it's open, this is the discussion we've had.  I think it inevitably fosters incivility and trolls.  If it's not open, then it's not Twitter is not as useful.  That's the Hobson's choice to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google announced its financial results for the quarter ending September 30th.  Revenue up 20 percent year over year.  Sixteen and a half billion dollars.  Let's see. Net income, 2.81 billion.  It's nice.  Three months, you make almost a billion a month.  That's good. That's a good business.  It's a nice little business.  The Motorola stuff, the sale to Lenovo kind of messes things up a little bit.  I don't know when they're going to close that.  They entered that agreement, believe it or not, in January.  And there is a charge of 378 million dollars related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with Motorola.  They're writing off the patent library.  Anything else? I'm looking at international revenues.  9.55 billion. More than half of all revenues outside of the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cue the tax battle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They actually broke out their United Kingdom revenues because that's the Irish, the double Irish.  And they said 10 percent of total revenues went to the UK.  What they did for those who have not been following this story, they set up a subsidiary in Ireland that collects revenue.  They licensed the search technology to them.  They collect their search revenues.  But then none of the money gets taxed in Ireland and then gets transferred to the Canary Islands or somewhere Bermuda.  Bermuda.  Sound shady, but completely legal.  Cost per click went down completely legal for now. Cost per click went down 2 percent.  That's the big issue.  Yeah. They're making less money on banner ads.  However, aggregate paid clicks, which included clicks related ads served on Google sites and sites of network members, increased 17 percent.  So the cost went down. But so many more clicks, they made more money.  But is there a limit to that volume?  Yeah. Well, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a post that somebody sent us on Twitter that I put up on the bottom of the Google section of the rundown asking whether what's the phrase I want.  We've hit.  Where'd it go?  Peek Google?  Peek Google. Yeah.  And I don't actually agree with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mean it's all downhill from here? Is that what they're saying?  Well, it's Ben Thompson. He's going to be on Twitter on Sunday. We'll ask him about it.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think, for example, he's arguing that mobile is now bigger than web and Google was web and it's mobile.  But Google, I think, is conquering mobile as well as anyone.  He's also arguing that native advertising takes over search advertising.  I don't think native advertising joins the world.  I mean, it takes over the world because I think it's a fake on users.  And I think that attention, according to Chartbeat, is where we go.  And I think relationships is where we go.  But, you know, Google's not invincible and Google knows it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in a way, what he's saying is web search, which was Google's business, is going to be replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but Google already is a mobile company.  Yeah.  And Google already is the best at generating signals. Google is a personal services company.  So I think it's a little simplistic to say they were a search company still. They haven't been a search company in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's no accident that you've seen on the World Series and the playoffs and everywhere else ads for Android for the first time ever.  Not for a Google phone or a Google device, not for Chrome, not for search for Android.  I think Google knows the future is mobile and they I think they have a pretty you know, I hate to say it, but I think they're pretty credible as thing.  They're going with that Android. I think that Android going somewhere.  Yeah, just my guess. I don't know.  We'll ask Ben. That's good. That's a good. That's an interesting.  It'll be an interesting discussion. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And his blog post is sponsored. So there you go.  Well, a mandrill actually.  It's not a banner ad. It looks it looks it looks integrated into his blog theme.  So yeah, I think I think, you know, we've talked about native advertising and you're you know, you talked we talked about how it can be confusing to the reader, the viewer, the listener.  But I think that, you know, a lot of people really think native advertising is the best thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it tricks people. It's so effective.  You know, the best thing is fooling people. We find ads work so much better when they look like editorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was at the New York Times today with with the Berta editors and they showed off a lot of the native advertising we've seen.  We've talked about the oranges of new black and so on and so forth.  It finally finally, you know, it dawns me what it's about is that is the native advertising besides selling some of your brand value to your advertisers and letting readers think that this is appearing on your site, even though they put labels up.  That's the real goal on one hand. The other hand is that advertising has been Google's been a part of this completely and absolutely commodified.  So you have to sell something special to an advertiser. You've got a few choices.  You can sell them your special relationship with your users, but you don't have such a thing.  Google does, but you don't media because everybody's the same.  It's a mass or you can sell them special content that we made for you.  Aren't we nice? And so it's an effort to decommodify advertising, but it's expensive.  It doesn't perform that well.  Chalk. Chartbeat has also found that people scroll three quarters of the time with real content only one quarter of the time when they hit native advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they know people intuitively know they're reading crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. And and yeah, you could.  Is it possible to do native advertising that has an interesting piece?  Yeah. But if people won't read a four word banner ad, why do we think they're going to read a 600 word native only if they don't know it's an ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  If they think it's content, they might go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it's so subtle you don't know it's an ad, then is it an ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You said orange is the new black. That's native content? Is it brought to us by the color orange?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The New York Times did a native story about women in prison.  Oh Jesus.  Pegged to Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, if you'd like to learn more about women in prison, there's a fabulous show on Netflix.  Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God.  It was well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at this. It says paid post.  Just those of you who are watching at home, see if you can figure out where it says paid post.  It says it right. Well, it's obvious. It's right here in this little bay light blue.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but Leo, it also uses sans serif type. Isn't that enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There it is. It's obviously a paid post.  Oh, I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did Netflix write that? Who wrote this? Did the Times write this piece?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, a business side writer wrote this. It's very well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like got all that fancy new media stuff that New York Times does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The videos are good. The interviews are good. I mean, it's well done.  But if you're a reader of the Times, you have to ask, hmm, if this story is so good, why didn't editorial do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In an August op-ed in the New York Times, Piper Kerman, author of the prison memoir, Orange is the New Black,  which inspired the Netflix series of the same name, calls the distance between.  Boy, that's just horrible. Horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is being argued over and over and over. Industry is the future.  Now, Leo, of course, they'll say, well, it's no different from you reading this spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we say here comes an ad. There goes an ad.  And that ends the relationship with the advertiser. They don't doesn't bleed into editorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree. But that's the model.  It's like you try to say it looks compatible with the environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, it's the Times brand studio that did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, from a web perspective, the images as you scroll and stuff is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's beautifully done because they can afford to. Because they can afford to do it.  Because Netflix gave them a million bucks.  Check the URL.  The URL is paidpost.NewYorkTimes.com slash Netflix.  OK. They make no bones about that. But who reads that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you're trying to put signals out to make sure that there's some caveat at the bottom of the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny because Apple and its Safari browser would cut that all out except for the New York Times part.  But OK, some domain. What's the domain? Yeah, just some domain. It's on the Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to Forbes, of course, Forbes has made an entire business of what they call brand voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yes, we've talked about that before. So this is, though, for the most part, except for that paragraph I read, good content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the contents there. So it's almost this is although there's here's I mean,  is this a clip from the show, Orange, or is this?  These are interviews. These are real people. It looks like a clip from the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They went and they went and spent a lot of here's the other. They spent a lot of money to make this.  Of course, they charge the sponsor for all that money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it strengthens my character. Does this made me a better person being in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does this make you watch the show? And is this and is this in some way deceptive?  I mean, if you know, if the editorial content were slanted, somehow to the only thing is that they have this.  They have this segment that is Piper Kerman, the author of Orange is the Black.  And then they move on. And she was in women's prison. I mean, it's not like she doesn't have some standing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They showed another one from United about United taking all of the athletes to the Olympics.  And they said United has some data about this that only United has.  Right. It has stories, but there's only United has. We're just helping them tell their story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, how does this appear? The other question would be, how would I get to this?  Does this appear as a story in their story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In there's there's there's there's there's if you go to the home page of the New York Times, right underneath the whole big main news, there is a there is a coaster of I don't know, a half dozen boxes across.  Scroll down, scroll down, pay the stop. I'll keep going. Stop. Right.  Right. It's not in that inside and white times dot com. If there was one, there isn't right now.  They would have it in there and it would be one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would say a post and it would be there. And it would say paid post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they and they'll they'll sell ads. I believe they'll sell ads on the Times to drive traffic to the post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I have to say this is it's hard to find who's damaged by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'm somehow not really offended by that because it's like, you know, you know, the show actually is about trying to raise awareness and trying to create prison reform.  People care about this now. This actually looks like a well researched article with great, great assets like does that hurt anyone?  I mean, it offends me when it's done really badly.  But, you know, it's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's fine as long as you know, if the reader knows what we need more research and I think they're doing that research now I asked today and the industry needs to on whether readers are indeed fooled.  Now, if you listen to and I feared that they were. But if you listen to Chartbeat, they say, well, actually, no, people recognize it's crap, but they don't scroll.  Well, that might be when it's really bad. This is well done content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well done. I have to say, I would feel a lot better at it about it if this paid post indicator were a little bit more obvious.  I agree. That is very hidden on the whole.  Well, here's the scary part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's competing with that giant, you know, header image there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the Interactive Advertising Bureau and Edelman did some research that I hosted their announcement of it or panel at their announcement of it.  A few months ago or so.  And what they found was that in entertainment sites and lifestyle sites, people pretty much knew the difference they could give it a site.  They could say that's an ad. That's not that's an ad. That's not they had.  They could do it only half as well on news sites.  This looks like news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now everybody's seen this. I mean, for crying out loud, my local paper has had a paid real estate section as long as I've been alive where, you know, your local realtor writes a column on why it's a good time to buy a house and the auto section.  And the yes. So, I mean, we know. I mean, this is not new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, here's the issue. Here's the issue. And the example I gave when we discussed Forbes, when I see a Forbes link on Twitter now, it could be excellent content by a Forbes staffer.  And they have really good stuff. It could be it could be very good content by a Forbes contributor.  It could be crappy content by a Forbes contributor, or it could be a really long and wordy ad.  I don't know which it is when I click.  And when I get there, I see something labeled brand voice. And next to that, it says, what's this? Well, if you have to put a link to say, what's this?  Obviously, the link, the label, like, goodness.  So in the long run, I think that publishers risk.  Their their brands, their trust, their equity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't do it. But more that's more because I'm old, fuddy, duddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But now what happens is the Times has to say the Times puts itself in a position where and they will.  And they are there. They they reject ideas for native ads. They won't do them. They have to hold them to a standard.  I heard another publisher this week say that the editorial staff is asking the ad department to do better native advertising.  So it holds up. But at some point, what that says is it's being seen as part of your brand.  And and so you become responsible for your advertising in a way you weren't before.  I'm all I'm suggesting is it's not the future of all advertising because I can't see consumers reading thousand word pieces and and just getting the subliminal message that I feel like watching some women in prison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have the Google change log coming up in just a little bit, but first an ad from our friends at SmartThings.  You know, I don't know what the difference is.  Have you listened to Alex Blumberg's podcast about making a podcast company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I have to listen to that.  You really have to. And the funny thing is he goes out of his way to do this and he plays special little music when he goes into the ad and he explains.  That's how you know I'm in the ad. I'm going to explain this to you.  But you all people should listen to that.  And I'm sorry I'm doing this now over the.  No, I should. I should actually.  Paul Harvey used to do that. He'd go page two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And unless you were in the clue, you didn't know.  But that's what that meant is this is an ad.  I mean, I think always it's always the case that when the hosts read ads, there's a little bit of one of the reasons they want to host read ads is a little bit of confusion.  Or you know, it's just no, it's just you can't escape it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's part of the flow.  Yeah. All right.  I don't know.  I you know, I wish I didn't have to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish I were independently wealthy and I could just do this whole thing.  If you wait, wait, wait, wait, if you were independently wealthy, would you really be doing working as hard as you're working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't be doing three or four shows a day.  No, but I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I might do one show a day just in a leisurely fashion in my jammies.  Yes, I like to do shows.  Yeah.  And I and I but I wish I you know, we employ 20 people full time staff and another several dozen hosts like you guys.  We pay you guys to be here and not a huge amount, but you get something and all that money comes from advertising.  It's the only source of revenue.  We get a little bit of money from people who donate.  Thank you, donors.  But really, mostly it's from advertising.  And so that's how it works.  But I you know, if I had a couple hundred million dollars, I would have done it.  I told Kevin Rose really basically I'm paying to have some friends.  Otherwise I'd be lonely.  Our show today brought to you by SmartThings.  And this was a Kickstarter project.  In fact, Gina told me that she actually invested in it.  The whole idea of which was to solve the problem of having a few million dollars in the world.  And she was the first person to do that.  She was the first person to do that.  So she did a show.  And she invested in it.  The whole idea of which was to solve the problem of how to automate your home.  There's like all these different protocols.  Nobody talks to anybody else.  So the smart folks at SmartThings said, what if we made a hub that talked to everything?  And then you wouldn't need to worry about it.  You just put the hub in your your home, connect it to the Internet and then start getting little solution kits or security kits and adding features.  They have all sorts of do hickeys that work with the smart things.  And then the smart things hub also works with other companies stuff like the Sonos, which I love, the Wemo from Belkans, those great LED lights from Phillips, the Hue, the DropCam.  We use those Nest thermostats or Eon or Honeywell or Schlage locks or GE.  So this way you've got kind of this infinite capability of stitching things together.  You can use if this than that if you want to have, you know, kind of you can even write little programs in effect that connect these smart things has three homes.  Smart home security kits, because that's one of the things people first want to do.  They came up with those right away.  You get the hub plus devices to know if there's motion in your home or if somebody's opened a door, that kind of thing.  They've also got something new, which I really like.  These are the solution kits.  There's four of them, and they help you achieve common goals like automating lights or saving energy or protecting your home from leaks, that kind of thing.  If you're an Arduino maker, there's a maker kit that will let you connect your Arduino projects.  Now the sky is really the limit.  Every kit starts with a SmartThings hub and then has the sensors and devices you'll need to turn your home into a smart home in, you know, as little as 15 minutes, including the new improved updates to the SmartThings Zigbee sensors.  Zigbee is a very common home automation protocol, and they do Zigbee better than anybody now.  But the really powerful thing about SmartThings, it's an open platform.  That means because it's compatible with hundreds of devices, there are thousands of things you can do with this product.  They have an iOS and Android app, one app, limitless possibilities.

And I said that I was able to set these up and make them work with my my Hue lights and the Wemo and so neat.  And I love my Sonos.  Sonos welcomes me home.  With hail to the chief every time it's so nice.  Wouldn't that be great?  I should do that, actually.  All right.  Speaking of trumpets, it's time for the change log.  Play those trumpets.  The Google change log.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trippani with the newest stuff from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Play Music adds songs as can you hear me OK?  Yeah, yes, I'm just making funny faces.  Just making funny faces.  OK, good.  Google Play Music adds songs as contextual playlists for all access subscribers and using the new material design UI, which we're going to see a lot of in the change log in the coming weeks.  So that means if you're a Google Play Music all access subscriber in Google Play Music on Android, iOS and on the Web, you'll see a brand new section in the Listen Now area.  That's basically a take on songs as concierge functionality.  So, like, depending on what time of day it is or what you're likely to be doing at the moment, play music will show you a list of possible sort of playlists or stations you'll want to listen to, like working out, getting ready for work, studying, sleeping.  You know, hey, it's Wednesday afternoon.  Do you want some, you know, do you want to work to the beat?  You want to boost your energy?  Do you want to relax?  And it offers you kind of a list of a playlist.  And I'm playing with this today.  It's pretty great.  I got to say, look at that.  The blog 50.  I like that.  Read all the music blog, all the music blog songs that you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to say, I'm a huge fan of Google Play Music and I have all access.  And when I saw this come in, I was so excited because it's discovering music is the best thing to do when you have unlimited music.  And this makes it very simple.  Yeah, it's pretty it's really, really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, and, you know, we were looking at this last night on all about Android.  It was so funny.  You know, Jason has young kids like me and he had, you know, family and toddler tunes, you know, and Ron is is a, you know, single guy hangs out with his friends and all of his suggestions for Tuesday night or like going out to dinner, hanging with your friends.  Like, you know, we were saying we were commenting how scary it was that it knew so much about our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you look at mine, it has working to the beat, having fun at work boost your energy.  It seems like I work too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's the songs and stuff.  It always had stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  But it knows.  It knows what time of day it is, what you're likely to be doing based on, you know, earlier choices.  It's all about it.  Basically, Google Now for music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty great. They bought songs a while ago.  This is they've started integrating it.  They just started integrating.  I love Google Play music.  The more I use it, the more I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say this really this feature really.  Yeah, I was thinking of my all access subscription.  I like it.  I was thinking about maybe canceling this.  I'm in.  I'm good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know there's now Spotify and beats looks more and more interesting.  You got a lot of choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are a lot of choices out there.  It's true.  It's true.  This one, Leo, I think I wonder if you you must have talked about this with with Steve Google beefed up its two step verification with a physical USB security key option in Chrome.  Yes.  So it's so basically this is second, you know, two factor authentication, of course, is your password.  But then this other thing that you have a physical thing that you have.  Normally, it's your phone.  You know, you get your authorization code on your phone or via SMS.  This is an actual USB key that supports a standard for this kind of authentication that you can plug in with this enabled in Chrome.  You plug into your computer and Chrome knows.  Yes, this is you.  Ah, you have one.  This is from Ubiqui.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've made these keys for a while.  And there's this is Neo.  These is it Fido that Google is supporting is Fido.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I ordered one yesterday when they announced this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the Neo.  This this the idea is you leave this in your USB port.  And it just checks it.  I worry about this because I was afraid afraid of losing my dongle.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that was my question for you, Gina.  Does your phone still work with it?  Because your phone doesn't have USB.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a good question.  I haven't I haven't actually tried this myself.  Leo, do you know, does the phone still work or is that so that the USB is just for your computer and do I need one for each individual device?  You could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, both of these have little little holes that you could put it on a lanyard or something and carry it around your device with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can wonder that in case you want to put it into a work computer and then leave or someplace else and then leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But then what about when you're on the road?  Could it would authenticator still work?  I don't know.  I would love it if it did.  And I don't and I just don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I spoke to the work people head of of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Let me look, look, look.  It says use a verification code instead.  Right there on the on the verification screen.  So that means you could either have your security key in there or you could go to your verif.  You go to your authenticator and use the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they were the head of security that gave a fascinating talk.  And he said, we acknowledge that not many people use two step.  And he said, we'll soon have something.  I presume this is it.  But they thought we get more people to use it.  My guess is that you get to tell me if I'm wrong.  NFC on your phone operates in essence like that.  It says I'm me.  And I can see Google doing other hardware things that will help in this besides having a wonky USB device.  Thank you, Dr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mom.  Mom just said in the chat room that the key has NFC so you can use it with your phone.  This one does. This one doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  OK. So some some do some don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's why the difference in price is they go from four bucks to 50 bucks.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The little one does not.  It's too small.  And the big one does.  But there's more than that.  There's more than that.  I mean, so these are from Ubiqui, Ubico, you why you be ICO.  And we like them.  Now, how does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does that just have one special number and it says I'm a hardware thing so you know I'm really real?  No, it actually has a processor in here and does calculations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it gets queried.  But it's my understanding.  Steve did talk about this on Tuesday, but I was sleeping.  It gets queried.  I was trying to pay attention.  I didn't understand it.  That's the problem.  It gets queried and makes some calculations and comes back with a response, I believe, or is used by the computer to do the calculations.  So there is a processor in this, believe it or not.  Yeah.  Isn't that wild?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if you lose it or it breaks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's that's the point is then you use your verification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You use it off of your right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you what.  Before next week, I will set this up and start using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sweet.  We got you on inbox.  We got you know, I am sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have one arriving from Amazon like tomorrow, so I'm going to try it too.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, good.  Sweet.  Cool.  Change log.  What else we got?  Oh, Google Earth for Android got a new got some updates, including new 3D rendering technology, faster updates and some KML updates.  So first we got the new 3D technology.  This gives users this is Google Earth for Android.  Faster, smoother, crisper transitions as you zooming around to your destination.  And Google says the first major 3D overhaul since Earth launched is more than 10 years ago now.  I can't believe Earth is so old, old user.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You use Earth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't I haven't because Earth was kind of slow.  Maps maps.  Yeah, I mean, maps kind of replaced it.  So I think they're trying to make Earth relevant again with this update.  This update comes with it's going to get updated faster.  Google says Google said the new Earth update, the new Earth app will get updates at the same time as Google Maps to add access to the most up to date information for things like place names, roads and businesses.  So I might spend a little bit more time with it if it's faster.  And, you know, Earth to me was always, hey, I want to fly around and like explore.  Whereas Maps was always I need to get somewhere.  Tell me how to do it.  Right.  So it was more of a utility than anything else.  The new Earth updates also introduces support for opening opening KML files for custom maps directly from Google Drive.  So that's kind of nice.  You can store your KML and Google Drive and open them up in the new Earth app for Android.  Finally, Google Play Games added new nearby multiplayer capabilities to make it easier to play with your friends nearby.  So this is part this is actually for developers.  This is a part of the Google Play Games API and it lets developers more easily create like synchronized challenges.  You know, if Jeff and I are in the same room, I can challenge him to a game and sync up players at the same time.  And it's similar to the functionality on the Nintendo 3DS.  So hoping to see more nearby game playing come to your favorite games on Android soon.  And that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my friends.  If you'll play the drums slowly is our Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the chat room, cool breeze.  No, cool breeze.  Who was it?  Somebody's cool breeze.  Just put up a link to Yubikey comparisons of features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they have all the different kinds of those who want to see.  What did you buy, Jeff?  You didn't get a Yubikey.  I don't even remember.  I bought I don't know what I bought.  So what I have is the the Neo and so you want something that sports you to F.  That's the Fido technology.  Now you tell me.  Well, yeah, I got Fido.  I got Fido.  You got Fido.  If you got Fido, you're good.  And so the blue one that I showed is a Fido touch key.  And then the Neo and which is so the final touch key, even though it's bigger is $18 and the Neo and is 60 bucks.  That's touch one time password generator smart card and you it supports other protocols like Java card and so forth.  There's a lot of protocols.  Google points out that the reason you'd want to do this is you can't get spoofed by a Fisher who might grab your your text messages somehow and get the authentication code or I mean, if you have it on your phone as authenticator, I think you're probably OK.  I bet you businesses would like this because you could give you know, you could say, all right, this is your Chrome.  This is your your laptop.  This is your chip.  Put that in there.  Only you can use it.  Take the chip home with you or something like that.  Right.  A physical view like that.  Hand in your chip.  Mr. Yeah.  Hand in your chip.  Exactly.  Business likes hand in your chip.  So yeah, if you that's a good page, it shows you all the different kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you got this $18.  I don't know how if you lose your phone, you're OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you lose your chip, you're OK.  If you lose both, you're screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess.  But it gives you more.  You know what I do?  You know what I do?  I put the so the way you get authenticator to work.  And by the way, this is a standard.  It's not just Google's.  There are other companies that make authenticator included authenticator apps, including Microsoft.  But the way all these apps work is they need your secret key, which is issued to you by  the company that you're logging into.  Most of the time they do that in a QR code.  Right.  And so the authenticator lets you take a picture of the QR code so you don't have to enter  in this 30 digit key.  And then that says, oh, yeah, that came from, you know, last pass.  And that's this.  And so I'm going to now start generating numbers based on that secret key.  The secret key, the number is a hat is some hash of the secret key and the time.  And the reason that that works is because you don't share that.  See, it's secret.  So only last pass and I know the secret key.  We both know roughly what time it is pretty accurately.  So last pass knows based on my secret key hashed with the time, what number, what six  digit number I'm going to give it.  If they match, I must be the holder of that secret key.  But, you know, if that secret key leaks out, you're in trouble.  What I do is I actually put those QR codes for Google.  I use Google, Tumblr, Evernote, Outlook, LastPass in my last pass secure store.  I take a nice save the image.  So even if I lose my phone, it's only because I use so many phones.  Right.  Every time I get a new phone, the first thing I do set up authenticator on that phone.  And because I'm using the same QR code, the same secret number each time, I get the same  numbers on all those phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The industry has got to make all this easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's easy.  What's so hard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am.  I really like Othi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Othi is a very good one.  I've used Othi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I want you and I'm glad you explained that, Leo, because I wondered.  I was like, how does Othi know?  Right.  But so this is just a standard.  It's a standard.  And the timestamp.  And that's why they're time dependent.  That's why the clock counts down.  That's right.  That helps.  That helps a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you for that explanation.  I hope I'm right.  Again, I drift off during security now and I may miss the gist of it.  Othi is not from Google, but it works.  You'll get the same number that Google would give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  An authenticator.  Yeah, I find Othi just a little nicer looking than an authenticator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I'll switch to Othi.  I've used it on non-Android platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, anybody order a Nexus 9?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nope.  Me neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My phone's big enough.  Tablets are over.  They're over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they're not.  I just, it's too big for my pocket.  I like my 7.  Yeah, this giant phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you got the 7, yeah.  Yeah, I still have the 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't use it.  I haven't used it in ages.  Do you use it?  I use it constantly.  Use it on the train, is that why?  Use it on the train and on planes, yep.  So it's travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  October 29th, apparently.  The order date.  I will get up early on that day.  I've bought 2 phones this year already.  I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've bought too many phones.  I just can't justify.  And honestly, it's just a little too big for me.  It's really big, 6 inches.  Yeah.  So it's pretty clear with the strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to be the Nexus 5.  It's going to be the Nexus 5.  We hypothesized that it would be the Nexus 5.  It's a pretty good point.  But I don't know.  And honestly, it's just a little too big for me.  It's really big, 6 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to still sell the Nexus 5.  I thought that was interesting.  Yeah.  So it's pretty clear with the strategy.  We hypothesized this last week.  The strategy is the developer platform, the cheap lollipop phone will be Nexus 5.  And Google is actually going to sell the Nexus 6 as a real feature phone through all the  carriers and all of that at a steep price.  Yep.  I'm ready to buy it.  It looks like a...  I'm not clear.  It looks like it does everything the Moto X does.  Does it do the always listening and the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does.  It does the OnePlus One thing where you can tap the screen and it turns on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's lollipop.  Lollipop lets you tap the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I was saying this on All About Android last night, and you said last week you think  Cyanogen is the best Android.  I'm really surprised and it was so interesting to me how many features that are in Cyanogen  that made it into lollipop.  Yep.  Like clearly Cyanogen is this like bleeding edge thing and Google's paying attention or  they're mind melding.  I don't know what they're doing, but it just seems like there are just certain features.  And I'm like, oh yeah, that's already in Cyanogen.  And now that's going to be part of the default.  It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still think the OnePlus One is great.  I gave mine to the Catholic Church, so I don't have to use it anymore.  You're not allowed to give him anything.  It's always to the church and then they let him use it.  I think.  I don't know.  I said, you want my phone?  He said, yeah.  But I do like the OnePlus.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Those vows of poverty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They'll get you every time, those vows of poverty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a nightmare.  Poor guy.  No, I think he's actually doing pretty well.  So what are you using right now?  Nexus 4.  Nexus 4, which I'll talk about in a second.  And then the real question is going to be what happens.  This is 5.7 inches.  The real question is going to be what happens.  I have to order Nexus 6.  It's my job.  It's your job.  Yeah.  Chad, you went iPhone 6.  I went iPhone 6 Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I am...  You're not?  I am...  No regrets?  I don't know yet.  Miss an Android yet?  I'm going to wait until you get it.  I'm worried that 6 is the half inch that pushes over to...  It's an inch away from the Nexus 7.  I mean, it's so close.  Although, in photos...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But just look at the comparison of these two.  This is a 5.  I'm not sure it's going to feel that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right.  The 7 does have a bezel.  The 1 plus 1, which you're holding up there, that's a 1 plus 1, right?  That's 5.5 inches.  That's the same size as the 6 Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You said if you guessed, this would look like a 5 to a 9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing that's hard to understand, for instance, this Note 4, which has a bigger  screen than your 6 Plus, is a smaller phone because they're big bezels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Basically, I am holding out until you have it in your hand.  I will bring you the Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can look at it and you'll say, I'll take that.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I'm hoping that the resell value of the 6 Plus is good enough if I decided  jump ship on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Nexus has a couple of things.  It has dual front-facing speakers.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Out of the features of the iPhone that I'll miss, I will so miss Touch ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Touch ID is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it seems like they're doing Apple Pay right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I believe...  No, now wait a minute.  You'll still be able to touch and pay with the Nexus 6 or the Note 4.  The Note 4 does, in fact, have a fingerprint reader, which works.  It's not quite as good as Apple's, but it gets the job done.  It's a button, huh?  Yeah, you have to swipe it.  And it does mean you have a physical button, which I'm not crazy about, but you swipe it.  And by the way, applications like LastPass use it.  So I swipe and it unlocks.  So I no longer have to enter that pin in LastPass or the password.  I swipe and unlock.  So I wonder how long before Google starts doing that.  Apple bought the company that it uses, Thentek, and they seem to have the best technology.  Samsung is kind of more like those old Lenovo laptops.  You have to swipe across it.  Anyway, I'm going to talk more about this in my pick of the week, so I don't want to  preempt myself.  Let's see what else.  Some people are starting to see the Nexus 6 now, I guess, but we won't be able to order  it to the end of the month.  And I'm not sure when it'll arrive at that point.  I have to say, given the number of people saying, I'm going to buy one, I'm going to  maybe in short supply be prepared.  Lollipop, we're starting to see some...  Come on the 29th.  It's, no, preorder on the 29th.  What time of the day will that probably happen?  Midnight.  I'm going to log in at midnight and every hour thereafter.  Midnight California time.  I don't know.  No, Google is not like Apple.  Apple says midnight and then doesn't do it.  Google doesn't say a time and then just does it whenever they get around to it.  Right?  I'm trying to remember other preorders.  You just kind of have to keep checking.  I might be in Madrid.  Oh, you want me to buy you one?  I might need that.  We'll see.  OK, you just tell me and I will buy two if you need to.  I presume I can get two.  Blue, they come in midnight blue or moonlight white or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want the white.  Are you going to buy the 64?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, we'll buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to have the most memory.  So we're starting to see more about lollipop.  That's the negative on something like the Note 4 and the positive on this Nexus 6 is  you're guaranteed to have lollipop faster than anybody else.  I like that.  I think that looks like it looks just like a Moto X on steroids.  It does.  Swollen up Moto X without the fancy colors and the wood and the bamboo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first reviews are also saying the camera is really good.  Well, that's what they're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But remember, they're comparing it to the Nexus 5.  So, wow, it looks like the thing I took a picture of.  Yeah.  Notice this is this hands on.  This is the Verge's hands on.  Peter Bone.  You don't see any hands.  I don't think he I'm wondering this seems like maybe at an event he had a hands on.  I don't think he has the phone yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A whale of a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A whale of a phone.  Codename Shamu.  This is the ad that you're seeing for it and all that stuff.  I think it looks pretty nice.  We'll see.  Lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are offering.  Google's got a little bit of a problem because remember they moved everybody to Hangouts,  but they still have to offer a messenger app.  So they will continue to have a messenger app, a stock SMS app in the Lollipop as well  as Hangouts.  Which is weird, but I think they have to.  There is an opt in kill switch in Lollipop, not default opt in.  The new Gmail 5.0, which as we mentioned will handle all accounts.  The new Google Play Store 5.0, which is already out for some people.  Some people have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't either.  What else is going to be new?  You know, this material design.  Have you been playing with that at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you know, I haven't installed the preview images or anything.  I haven't played with it.  I think it's the biggest, most noticeable change, I think.  Is that everything is going to look different, but be faster and sort of seem spring loaded.  It looks pretty snappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see how fast that Windows moved on that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Last night we had one of the lead developers on Tumblr on their Android app.  He was saying that on other versions of Android, Tumblr's scroll mechanism was sort of janky,  a little bit stuttery in how they had all these internal projects to make it smoother.  And they installed the Tumblr app on L and it's smooth as butter and they didn't change  a thing.  So there's clearly like speed improvements that you get, you know, kind of just for free.  Like it's very, very snappy, even with all the transitions and sliding and effects.  It looks really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a page turn on a book.  Is this Dieter doing that?  It looks like Dieter.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dieter Bone of the Ridge.  The keyboard looks nice.  They're competing one to one with iOS now.  Their design is so top notch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had Neelay on TNT this morning, Neelay Patel from The Verge on TNT, and he said something  I've been saying for a while, which is that iOS is out of date.  And they really haven't.  Apple has not managed to keep up with Android.  And just UI wise, I really feel like Android has lapped iOS.  So material is really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Let's take a break when we come back.  A tool, a tip and a number as we wrap this thing up.  Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, this is one of those tips that is not news at all, but it's one of those  things that isn't obvious and it's super handy when you need it.  OK, so when you're in, you're using Google Maps navigation on your phone to get somewhere.  If you tap the compass, you can toggle between first person view and the route view,  which is really, really handy when you want to see, you know, what the entire route is.  So and again, not obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do that all the time because I always want to see where the hell you take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where are they taking me?  Exactly. Exactly.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. What is this route?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I read this, I was like, oh, right.  OK, good to know, because it's not I mean, the compass doesn't exactly ask to be tapped.  Right. So next time you're in navigation, tap on the compass.  You can switch between those two views, both of which are very handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice. Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to cheat a little bit.  I'm going to use the first Mark Zuckerberg's first interview in Mandarin.  He answered in Mandarin answered in Mandarin.  I watched the video of the video there on the rundown.  I just didn't know.  Overachiever.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I found out of Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark.  Skip ahead to like.  He's talking to students in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I heard you.  You said.  What?  You know, you're a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They love it when you speak, even if you're terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He actually sounds pretty good.  It's got to work on his tones, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when I was talking to my grandmother, she said, oh, that's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I studied Chinese in college for years and I couldn't do this.  That's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody said in Twitter where I found this, he did this while running the company.  What did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And killing and dressing his own meat products.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And tearing down his block.  Yeah.  I hate overachievers.  Wow.  That is very impressive.  Chinese is not an easy language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's great.  Good for him.  He actually seemed the crowd loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well.  And I got to tell you that that Chinese speakers love it when you even if you are terrible,  they go, oh, your accent is excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My favorite moment when I visited China was I was walking through a public garden and  happened upon what I assume who I assume were locals.  And my group raised our hands and said, Ni Hao, and they said hello.  And then we all just cracked up.  Like everyone just started laughing.  And it was it was fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like to I like to, you know, go to the get get the mani pedis.  And they're talking in Chinese the whole time.  And at the end, I go, oh, she she needs a gen and they go, oh, yeah, you understand.  I didn't.  But I like to pretend you like to pretend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That guy, Jim knew what we were saying about him.  So I did a full review of the galaxy.  Did you want to do another number, Jeff?  No, no, that's first is a number.  It counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I cheated, but I could I could go into numbers, but I know that was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like seeing Mark Zuckerberg speak Chinese.  It's good.  So I did a review, full review of this on before you buy.  This is the Galaxy Note 4.  I got the unlocked edition.  People are starting to get them now from the major carriers.  Costs thousand bucks.  No, not that bad.  Eight hundred fifty.  You can get it for three hundred dollars subsidized in Korea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was more than a thousand dollars.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's beautiful.  I mean, this is a five point seven inch super AMOLED screen running at Quad HD.  So it's what?  Twenty five, sixty by fourteen forty.  And you can see it.  It's it's really, really gorgeous.  Here's the inbox app running on it.  Text is crisp.  You can't see any dots at all.  I mean, it just really is a beautiful phone.  Very fast.  Quad core processors, two point seven gigahertz quad core processors.  I mean, that's that's desktop speeds now.  And the main thing, you know, I'm not a fan of what Samsung does to Android or  haven't been.  I am a fan of the notes because I like the giant screens and I've had every note  one, two, three and four and always loved it.  Huh?  You use the pen?  Yeah. I mean, the pen works great.  I like to have it once in a while.  Yeah. There's times when you want to take written notes, for instance, that this is  this is very handy.  They've got templates you can fill in.  You can if you work really hard at it, have the handwriting converted into text, but  you have to write very nicely on a straight line, which I do not do.  It also, as I pointed out, has a fingerprint reader that works and can be used  for Google Wallet and other things.  You could train up to three fingerprints.  The only thing about the fingerprint reader, you see, it's kind of wide.  That's because you're scanning your fingerprints.  So you have to cover it entirely.  You learn how to do it pretty good.  But it isn't as easy as Apple's where you just rest your finger on it.  Apple seems to work every time.  And this one takes a little practice.  But the main thing I want to say, and by the way, I'm not.  I'm running Nova launcher here.  I'm not running TouchWiz, as you probably could tell from the normal looking dock,  not the TouchWiz weird dock.  Samsung is king of just junk and stuff up in the interface and so forth.  But they have obviously listened to people and they've junked it up so much less than,  for instance, remember, the camera used to have 800 different modes.  They still have the same number of modes, but you can manage them and to hide the  modes you don't want to use.  Now we were talking about how good the camera is going to be on the Nexus six.  I think there's no question this is a 16 megapixel shooter.  That's spectacular.  Three megapixel 3.7, I think megapixel front camera with 120 degrees.  So it's really a great selfie camera.  Hasn't some interesting useful modes, but you don't have to see them all, which is nice.  One of my biggest complaints about the galaxy phones is the S voice, the Samsung voice.  They replace Google search voice with it's just, I want to use Google.  You can.  Okay, Google.  I'm talking to you.  Okay, Google.  And it does the okay Google thing.  And then every Google Android phone has done that since KitKat.  You can also get Google now by pressing and holding.  So it's really, it's a much purer version of Android than Samsung has done even on  the galaxy S5.  How's the battery?  Battery is massive.  And I think the biggest argument for these phones is this is one of the few phones still  remaining where you could take the cover off, put a new battery.  So if you have two batteries, it is a 32, 20 milliamp hour battery to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you know, which means it's going to get you through the day.  I don't have good battery numbers yet because I've only had it for a few days.  I like to let the phone settle a little bit before I really get battery numbers, but I  think it's going to be comparable to the one plus one.  And, you know, for 20 bucks, you get a second battery and you never have to worry again.  And SD card support.  You know, the Nexus 6 isn't going to have either of these capabilities.  So I've always liked the Samsung phones for that reason alone.  I can buy an extra battery and battery charge.  There's a chance you'd like it more than the Nexus 6?  It's possible.  We'll see.  I'm going to buy a Nexus 6.  Nexus 6 doesn't have a removable back, doesn't have a stylus, but it has lollipop.  This is KitKat.  And I don't expect lollipop to show up for a Samsung phone right away by any means.  But again, you put you put a launcher of your choice on there and it's I tell you that  the screen is spectacular.  We'll have to see what the Nexus 6 looks like.  Nexus 6 has roughly the same battery, but it's not replaceable.  It doesn't have SD cards.  So, you know, you're going to have to get 64 gigs internal and hope that that's enough.  Let's see.  Nexus 6 has 3,200.  This has 3,220.  So they have 20 little milliamp hours better.  I'm not saying rush out and get a Note 4, but if you did get a Note 4, I don't think  you should feel left out.  This is a pretty nice phone.  It is a gorgeous phone.  And, you know, if you show this show my pocket chat, it's not that big.  We're you know, so funny when the notes first came out, people said, oh my God,  that's huge.  We're so used to big phones now.  I can pocket it.  It's not so different.  How big is that one?  It's a little smaller than the iPhone 6 plus.  I don't know the exact dimensions of it, but because, you know, it's almost edge to edge  on the screen, the bezels aren't as big.  Crappy back single back speaker.  That's one thing that Nexus 6 will do much better.  So I don't know who's going to win on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I said to my Korean hosts, I can probably say the world laughed at you for your big  phones, but you got the last laugh.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love a big phone and I don't use a tablet.  I think you could use this on the train very happily.  Couple other quick notes.  If you have a Samsung phone, you can go to the Samsung store and download Nokia's  here maps and driving directions.  Those are very good.  Everybody loves those and they have one advantage over Google Maps.  You can use them offline.  They will download maps before you head out the door by state, by city, by country.  So you can just use them offline.  Also get the Fox app.  If you have FX or FX, FXX on your TV, because the the FX now app now has every  episode of the Simpsons ever.  25 seasons, 522 episodes on your phone.  Those are a couple of little tips for you.  If you're getting on an airplane as I am.  Thank you, Gina Trippani.  Thank you.  ThinkUp.com.  Everybody should sign up today for that great insights.
