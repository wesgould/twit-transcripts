Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I celebrated accordingly. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You set off bombs. You know, we didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was pouring rain. Oh, bummer.  We did have tacos, queso, and a big party.  That seems like a good idea. That sounds like fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tacos are never a bad idea. Did you invite Kevin over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I didn't. Kevin knows he has an open invitation to my house anytime. He and his entire family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's more than I could say. Kevin Toffles is also here about Chromebooks.com and Stacy's co-host on the IOT show.  Good to have you, Kevin. Good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have all the codes to Stacy's house on my phone so I can get in and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can probably control her house from where you are. Those blinds, they keep going up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. I've got to be very careful never to do Kevin wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we could begin the show now because Kevin and I have stopped watching football.  Kevin's wearing an appropriate jersey, though, I note. He's a Liverpool fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Liverpool Football Club, oi, oi, oi. Wait, someone mark this day. Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have a tattoo? I do. Is that a real tattoo or just a temporary? Yes, it's a real tattoo.  Oh my God. Oh, he's more serious about this than I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I have a Beatles tattoo on the back too. Is that why you're a Liverpool fan?  You know what? I had to pick a team and it just made sense.  I'm like, OK, well, I love the Beatles, so I have to go with Liverpool or Everton because they're both in the same area.  And I just chose Liverpool and that was it. Holy cow. Yeah. Fan for life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the only time I've seen Kevin not in a Beatles shirt. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kevin and I actually are brothers from another mother because I'm also a massive Beatles fan and I have a tattoo of a Beatle on my bottom.  Unfortunately, mine's an actual bug. No, I don't. I don't have either.  I do have a twit bug, but that was for charity and it's a long...  So I'm watching the game, which has now ended.  I'm watching it at work like a lot of people probably are do, elicitly streaming it on YouTube TV when at the half suddenly...  You could show my screen, Karsten.  Whoops. Currently, there's no content available for this page.  Refresh page to try, which means I kept refreshing it.  And it was like, what, it was about an hour before it came back.  YouTube TV went down in the middle of the World Cup semifinals.  This is not good. Arguably more people watching it than during the NFL Super Bowl. Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't this happen to Comcast or someone during the Olympics? Their streams also went down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The difference is nobody cared about it during the Olympics.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I care about the Olympics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Winter Olympics, come on. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Summer maybe.  Winter Olympics are awesome. Summer? What's in summer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Track.  You know, Stacey, that just like a regular game by the Liverpool Football Club is watched by more people than watch the Super Bowl every year.  You know that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. I'm aware of the fanatic soccer slash football fans.  I'm just saying that like streaming platforms go down and it just seems like they're the worst time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, YouTube, I mean, Google, come on, they know how to deliver video.  This is what's going on.  Kind of surprising, really. Yeah.  I was going to switch to YouTube, but I'm sticking with PlayStation Vue because it was rock solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's how you were watching it.  Yes.  Yeah. And I think that that's one of the things we're in a battle now between Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, YouTube TV.  There's some new ones. There's a new one called Filo that doesn't have locals.  And this is a real battle for over the top cord cutters.  And when you go down during a major event like this, that's got to hurt.  YouTube TV tweeted and they said, Hey, everyone, sincere apologies for it.  Hold on. The tweet will come up in a second. I don't know why Twitter really confuses Chrome.  Twitter's down.  Twitter's not down. Hey, everyone.  You know, it's funny. They used to be down all the time, right?  Twitter, we haven't seen a fail well in years.  Hey, everyone, sincere apologies for streaming issues with YouTube TV.  The timing is horrible.  But we're working to be up and running again ASAP.  It was about an hour, about one full hour.  And critical scoring was lost.  They came back just at the end of the game.  So people were able. I was able to watch the end.  We're so sorry about the service interruption.  We understand your frustration.  Yeah.  And I wonder how many people PlayStation Vue is going to win from this.  They're all the same price.  What do you pay for your PlayStation Vue, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's 40 a month, but they just upped it five bucks.  Actually, like three different competitors just went up five bucks a month.  So it's pretty much the same. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. YouTube TV was 40.  At least I got it for 35 during the trial and I'm still grandfathered in it for.  But you also, YouTube TV doesn't have tiers.  They have just the one offering, which includes locals.  PlayStation Vue, they have some tiers.  You can start at 40, then 45, 55 and 75.  Kind of more like cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we just do the core.  I mean, I just need my sports and other stuff.  And sometimes I even supplement it with Fubo TV because they've got Pac-12 network,  which I like to watch.  So sometimes I'm paying for two of these services.  But the nice thing is you watch it for a season of sports and then you cancel it.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Filo, which is the new kid in town, try.filo.com, is cheap.  It's $16.  But they don't have any sports.  And so this is really, they say, I think they're aiming at millennials  who apparently don't care as much about sports.  So they have MTV and Comedy Central.  They have the Food Network.  They have AMC and A&E.  Stuff they, I think that they're aiming at Viceland.  They're aiming at the kids, at the millennials who don't have as much money.  They actually started, I think, as a college station, college-wired colleges.  And now they're just now available for everybody.  It's $16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny you bring them up.  I just signed up for them just last night for a trial because we were thinking,  as I said, going to YouTube TV before today's debacle.  And my wife wants Food Network and I want HGTV.  Don't judge me.  And neither of those are on YouTube TV.  So I figure, oh, for 16 extra bucks a month, we can get those and a few other channels with Philo.  So I just signed up yesterday.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how much are you paying in total now for television services?  More than cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I know.  It's a good question.  Do you consider Internet as part of that?  It has to be, right?  Well, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not like your base broadband.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because you'd have that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  I'm just talking about like over-the-top services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's 40 for PlayStation Vue.  I added Philo yesterday.  That'll be 16 a month if we stick with it.  Of course, we have Netflix, but T-Mobile pays that for me, except for $3 a month,  because that's their deal.  They give you free Netflix if you're a subscriber.  Amazon Prime we have as well.  So it doesn't add up to be that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's 60 and then Costa Prime, which is 120.  So what is that a month?  70 bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's about what you'd pay for a cable.  Cable's still like 99.  Is it that expensive?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd probably still have Prime anyway, and I'd probably still have Netflix anyway,  even if I had cable.  Yeah, good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure.  It is interesting to watch this happen.  Of course, it's one of the reasons AT&T bought Time Warner, because, and one of the reasons  Comcast has bought NBC Universal.  The pipes need to, and we've talked about this a lot in the past, want to own the content.  Because it's not enough just to be a pipe anymore.  You know, you don't have a lock-in like you used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what we're not paying, just to close that loop on price, because a lot of people  don't think about this.  We were paying like $12 for each cable box.  We were paying an extra fee for DVR service.  I mean, my fees just for the rentals and DVR was like $40 to $50 a month alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say now having, I did try, because they all have one week trials.  So I tried them all just kind of as a review purposes.  This was about a year ago when AT&T's DirecTV now just came out.  It was not working very well at the time because they didn't, I guess they weren't prepared  for the traffic.  But I stick with YouTube TV because it's, to me, that's the nicest interface of the bunch.  I really like the interface of YouTube TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish that would come on the Roku.  Or has that changed?  Because the last time I checked, I couldn't, it drives me nuts.  It's on Apple TV now, which is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm not an Apple person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like simplicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do think there is, this is the other problem, right?  Is there's this natural animosity between these, all these groups and Roku doesn't like YouTube  for some reason.  I don't know why.  Comcast didn't like Roku for a long time.  You couldn't activate HBO Go on Roku using your Comcast subscription.  They finally hammered that out a few months ago.  So it's, and this is the problem for normal people.  It's quite a mess.  It's hard to, I think this is the intention.  I think the cable companies are really trying, they're kind of like Russia at this point.  They just want to sow confusion because then people will just go, oh, screw it.  I'm just going to keep my cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a lot to all the drama happening between the big players and the dislike.  And yeah, this is where, again, standards and whatnot come out.  Open internet.  Where's Kevin Marks?  He would be sharing this with us.  So, I don't know.  I don't have any of these services.  I have very few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have cable even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have cable.  Oh no.  We got rid of cable like, gosh, in 2008.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So does your daughter feel like a second class citizen when she goes to school and everybody's talking about?  Nobody in her class watches TV.  Oh, she goes to that fancy bilingual school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but they all watch YouTube.  I mean, they don't even.  That's really true.  That's all you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I think YouTube TV has kind of an inside track with the youngins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know if they'll want to.  Like my daughter is like, I feel sorry for people who have to watch TV shows when they're on.  That's crazy.  I had to explain to her she has a friend who's out of town right now.  And I had to explain to her that she could call her friend on the phone and talk to her.  Her friend doesn't currently have access to Google Hangouts or a phone to text her.  And she's like, I was like, you could probably call in like her dad or someone might have a phone and she could talk to you on the phone.  She said, why would we talk on the phone?  Yeah, it's a different world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a different world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, interesting to watch.  Now, remember, AT&T acquired Time Warner again, Pipes acquiring content.  And one of the things they got was HBO.  Remember that right now, Netflix seems to be the dominant player in all of this over the top stuff.  In fact, they've announced they're going to spend not eight billion, but eleven billion dollars over the year to both create and acquire new content.  Kind of amazing.  And it works for them.  They get subscribers based on the originals.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, people talk about them.  You know, you go into the office, although Stacey and I don't go to an office.  But if we did, you know, what would everybody be talking about?  The whatever show was on Netflix last night and you feel left out.  You don't want to feel left out.  You know, you get sucked in and then you binge.  And they get a lot of subscribers with original content because it's good content.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and I should correct this because apparently the last time I checked, I could not get YouTube TV on Roku.  But you can.  Two people are now saying that, yes, you can now.  So I should revisit that.  So when my dad comes up, he's got a YouTube television subscription.  He wants to watch golf and he can't.  So now I can tell him that he can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's one of the reasons YouTube TV is pretty awesome.  Yeah, it is now as of February, it's available on Roku.  So that's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many people actually watch TV on TV these days?  Because I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  We actually prefer.  We'll even Chromecast YouTube.  Yeah, I don't like the little screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to see it on a big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, we all want to watch different things.  So it's like I'll just grab my tablet and sit in my recliner and I'm good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if you think about it, if you've got good headphones or, you know,  and you and your and your tablet is close enough, it's really exactly the same  as if you were watching a TV eight feet away, a larger TV eight feet away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, we force ourselves to like go and watch things.  And here's here's the big ethical debate in our house.  No one can start a show without conferring with the other members of the family.  So you mean start a binge.  We start a binge.  So this is my husband right now.  We're all supposed to be watching Lemony Snicket together,  but we kind of Anna went and watched him without us.  But it's hard for adults to watch that actually after a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, we handled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And my daughter and I are watching Sabrina Teenage Witch, which is nice.  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, you got to find something.  Why don't you make her watch The Handmaid's Tale and learn something about life?  Dear Lord, she wanted to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She saw Children of Men or something.  And she's like, what's that about?  I was like, oh, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sabrina Teenage Witch. Good choice. Good choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the the new owners of HBO.  So HBO is kind of it's interesting.  They have internally thought of themselves as bespoke content that they hand make.  Great television like The Sopranos or Game of Thrones or Westworld.  It's an event. It's Sunday night.  It's worked for them.  According to The New York Times, they spent over the last three years.  They spent. Let me get the numbers right.  It's actually a pretty it sounds like a good number.  They spent two billion dollars a year to make six billion dollars in profit.  Doesn't sound bad, right?  Netflix, eleven billion dollars in one year.  All of a sudden, AT&T, the new guy in charge, he's in charge of all of Warner Media.  John Stanky, longtime AT&T executive with a very unfortunate name, comes in,  sits the folks down at HBO and says, there's a new sheriff in town.  And, you know, what you're doing is not enough.  We need hours a day, not hours a week, not hours a month.  We need hours of viewing a day.  You are competing with devices that sit in people's hands, capture their attention every 15 minutes.  This is a quote because the recording of his town hall leaked.  I want more hours and this is from The New York Times.  I want more hours of engagement.  Why are more hours of engagement important?  Because you get more data and information about a customer that then allows you to do things like monetize through alternate models of advertising,  as well as subscriptions, which I think is very important to play in tomorrow's world.  Now, I know he didn't want this to get out.  But this is the reason it got out, I would imagine, is because some HBO staff jaws dropped.  This is such a shift for HBO.  They want it, I can shorthand it for you, to be more like Netflix and less bespoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not terribly surprised by what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also Recode published the full text from the memo.  So I would encourage you to go look at both of those things because it looks like The New York Times cherry picked some of the stuff.  So they talked about actually bringing HBO is to be the front end of a bigger subscription business, which could include different programming.  So there there's that in there.  And apparently he also never mentioned Netflix, but he did focus on Facebook and Amazon, which is worth thinking about, too.  So yes, do we really like everyone's like the media business and then these old you know, he called himself a bell head, these old telco guys.  I totally see how the media business would be very snobby and not not wanting part of this.  And but John Stanky, he's a smart man.  This is not an idiot. This is not he.  I have met John Stanky on several occasions.  He is technically astute.  He can get down and understand a business, whether it's deep intricacies of fiber or spectrum policy.  I have no doubt he can figure out the media business.  And he's not going to he's not going to set HBO on fire just to make it turn out crap.  I promise. So that's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would. So Peter Kafka's recode article tries to dampen out the concerns of people who love HBO the way it is the Game of Thrones, Sopranos, Westworld fans.  We already have a Netflix.  Thank you.  We don't, you know, but he his premise is that AT&T said we're going to let all the Time Warner properties run themselves with autonomy.  But I have to point out, Peter, you know better than that.  That's exactly what every single company that acquires a new company says until they don't.  Right. And almost always in the long run, they don't.  And frankly, the reason the Times article resonated is it makes perfect sense.  That is if you were going to just kind of walk into a business and not be concerned with, you know, its reputation or its current fans and what they might want.  But really, how do we make this business compete in the modern world?  You'd say exactly what Stanky said.  So I'm not saying Stanky's dumb.  I'm saying he's saying exactly probably the right from a business perspective, exactly the right thing.  But I don't know if it's what we want HBO to be.  Anyway, it's just something to pay attention to.  There's no way AT&T lets HBO continue as it is.  It's just not profitable enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is incredibly profitable.  That is incredibly profitable, especially, well, even compared to a wireless phone business.  I'm like, they're doing real well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  AT&T spent $84 billion for Time Warner.  They've got to justify a very expensive acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're already boosting their fees.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, they said, wait a minute.  No, no, no, they're not.  They said they would never do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you not see the stories?  No, I know.  I'm kidding.  That's me being facetious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said they would never ever do that.  But immediately they did.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this FCC, FTC.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said they'd lower prices.  The Time Warner merger is a synergy.  See, how can you be really naive about this?  Every time a company wants to get regulatory approval, they say, no, the synergy is going  to be good for consumers.  It's going to lower profits.  They tell the new company they're acquiring, don't worry.  We're not going to touch you.  You've got a great business.  I remember this at Tech TV.  Comcast said, worse, we think Tech TV is doing a great job.  We bought you because we love you before they disassembled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't remember a single acquisition like that, a big acquisition where they promised  the world and actually fulfilled that promise.  No, they never do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These things are notoriously bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you put conditions on it, then maybe, but otherwise, no.  Yeah.  Like merger conditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway, I'm not, to Peter Kafka's point on recode, I'm not all upset.  I kind of expected it.  And, you know, we live in a golden age.  If you're a content creator, all you have to have is a good idea and a phone to call  somebody, you're going to sell it.  There's a lot of money at play.  Apple's put down more than a billion dollars.  Amazon, I don't know how much they put into it.  They spent almost a billion dollars for the rights alone to the Lord of the Rings.  There's a lot of money out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't get me started on that.  I can't imagine that coming out in a positive way.  I mean, what all they can do is go down or backwards with that, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One word, one word, Kevin.  Prequels.  Mm-mm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody wants to see a sequel.  I'm sorry.  A series on the Cimmerillian and take lost, lost tales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where was Gandalf all that time?  You know, hanging out with Tom Bombadil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, Lord of the Rings soap opera.  I don't think so.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Makes my furry toes curl.  Let's take a little break when we come back talking about the battle of the  dinosaurs, the giants, Firefox and its four-year battle to get Google to treat  it like any other browser.  But first a word from WordPress.  If you are a business, if you're a person, if you, everybody in the world  owes it to themselves to have their own website.  I'm not talking about a Facebook page.  Mark Zuckerberg owns that.  That's his website.  I'm not talking about a Twitter page.  That's Jack Dorsey's website.  I'm talking about your own website.  Maybe you say, well, I don't need that because I have Facebook or Twitter.  You got to have a place that people, when they search for your business name or  they search for your personal name, that's the first thing that comes up.  It's the place they go where you show your best stuff.  You get new customers.  You position yourself.  And what better way to do it than a WordPress.com?  I've been a WordPress user for years.  I moved to WordPress.com from self-hosted WordPress because I didn't want to be  doing all the updates and configuring and all that stuff.  I spent more time tweaking my site than actually posting content.  WordPress.com does all the coding, all the design, all the tools.  They've got great support 24 hours a day, five days a week, Monday through Friday.  They're there on weekends too.  So you never have to worry about a technical problem.  They take care of that for you.  And it's less to have a site on WordPress.com than it is to host your own site.  It's $4 a month.  I actually spent a little more because I want the business account so I get the  built-in SEO, the social sharing, so my fans and friends and customers can go out  and share my stuff on their Facebook and Twitter.  There's hundreds of great plugins.  You can even, with the business plan, bring your own themes and plugins.  You don't need to, though.  They've got them all.  I'm now using the Google AMP plugin, which means my page at leolaport.com  loads fast, much faster on mobile.  There is a reason why 31% of all websites run on WordPress.  Can you believe that number?  Almost a third of all the websites in the world, 31% run on WordPress.  WordPress is amazing.  It's awesome.  And you've got to try it.  Go to WordPress.com slash twig.  Get your website started.  Get 15% off any new planned purchase when you go to WordPress.com slash twig.  Please do me that favor.  Try it.  You're going to see.  I have to pitch.  I pitched my kids.  My daughter said, I need to have a website because I want to put my poetry up  there in my drawings.  I said, OK.  Got her set up, WordPress.com.  My son said, he likes to take pictures.  My pictures get squeezed and destroyed on Facebook because it's Henry.  When you were born, I registered your name and I've been waiting for this day.  I'm going to hand it over.  And we set them up.  WordPress.com slash twig 15% off right now.  It's good enough for my kids.  It's good enough for you.  Kevin, your kids are grown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mostly.  My son will be 21 in two months.  That's grown, dude.  Got bad news for you.  That's grown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to give him a WordPress site.  Did you have the sense 21 years ago to register his domain name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No.  I got him a social security number and I started a college fund for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did the first.  I didn't do the last.  Because I looked into how much I would have to save and I said, there's no way I'm saving that much.  You're going to college on your own dime, kid.  Do you have a domain name for your daughter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course we do.  My husband is a domain name expert.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nowadays, you shouldn't name a kid unless you can find that domain name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right?  He actually, I think he registered all of, no, he's missing one of his nephews, but our nieces and nephews, many of them, he registered their names too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like you almost have to do that Google search before you name your kid these days.  It's tough, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, pro tip when you're naming the kids, if you can't find the right domain name, just look for the country codes that have the different ones.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go to .io.  .ca.  It'll be like Will.io.  Ooh, Will.io.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I-O-I-O off to work I go.  .io?  .io?  .io is the Indian Ocean.  Is it?  Yeah.  Okay.  .libya is .ly.  Mm-hmm.  Bitly, yeah.  Yep.  There's some fun ones.  .tv is Tuvalu.  .fm, I can't remember.  Tuvalu.  Tuvalu.  The island that's sinking, but makes a lot of money.  I was gonna say, they're losing.  .tv.  I have .am, which is Armenia.  I have leo.am.  That's actually, that's a pretty good domain.  I don't want to lose that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of my favorites is Peter Rojas'.  What's his?  I have to look it up, because I can't remember exactly what it is, but it's, I believe it's roj.as.  Oh, it's a great domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Roj.as, it is.  Right?  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is for what?  What country is it?  Austria?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  .as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do not know.  It's easy enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where's Andrew?  Andrew would know.  .asnik is American Samoa.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good one.  Those are some good cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there a .te?  I could be lapour.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  .t.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there an eo?  I could be l.eo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you can't have a single letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I was chagrined, because leo.com was taken by the Royal Bank of Canada for their mascot,  Leo.  And then they let it, I gave up.  I thought, oh, well, they'll never give that up.  They gave it up.  And some squatter got it.  Oh, if I had just been watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never, ever, ever give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Never give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Firefox.  I'm watching the one in India, kev.in.  Oh, wouldn't that be good?  Oh, someone has it.  I'm watching it.  Oh, you're watching it.  I have for about 10 years now.  Yeah, Kev.  It's like watching paint dry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem.  FM is the Federated States of Micronesia.  So I have leo.fm as well.  Firefox and the four year battle to get Google to treat it like a first class citizen.  Firefox has gotten better and better, by the way.  It's gone through that bad time when it was really a pig and it's really fast.  And I've actually started using it a lot.  It turns out that Firefox doesn't work as well on Google pages.  The Google flagship search page, Firefox doesn't even have the toolbar.  You know, you can narrow searches by date.  Google Flights occasionally will block Firefox.  Sometimes it'll just give you a degraded version.  Google's explanation for this.  We're focused on providing a great experience for search across browsers and continue to work to improve this for all users.  Firefox uses the gecko engine.  Everybody else uses WebKit now, right?  Firefox uses the gecko engine, which requires us to do extensive testing on all of our features to insert compatibility because it's different from WebKit, which is used by Chrome and Safari and UC and Opera.  We've done this for Firefox desktop, but not have done the same level of testing for mobile.  Come on, Google.  That's a really mealy mouth response.  How hard can it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with you.  How hard can it be?  I don't know.  I'm looking at the two comparison images right now and I get it.  I mean, if you're on a phone and you're using whatever browser and you go to Google and you don't get the results or you can't manipulate them the way you want or move around the page, you're not going to blame the browser.  You're going to blame the company providing the information.  That's a good point.  Probably unfairly.  Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So on the left is a Chrome version of the Google search for World Cup.  On the right is the Firefox mobile version.  Funny thing is the Firefox mobile on iOS uses WebKit.  I think it does on Android as well.  So it's not even Gecko.  Do you think it's anti-competitive or do you think it's...  I mean, I think it's anti-competitive.  I'm sorry.  I think that's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's probably thumb in their nose.  I mean, because also look at how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, never mind.  Every time I use Firefox on Windows, Chrome bitches at me when I go to a Google page.  Microsoft bitches at me when I go to a Microsoft...  You should be using Edge.  You should be using Chrome.  You should be using Edge.  Why?  Please stop the bickering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Part of it though is if you look at the Google search results in Chrome, you've got these  Google cards, right?  Is that really the use of a web standard?  No, it's the way Google wants them to be shown.  So now they can say, well, look, that doesn't look as good because we have these nice flashy  cards that just get you right to the information.  So I'm not too keen on this whole thing personally with what Google's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mozilla keeps yelling at Google about everything.  Mozilla is yelling at everybody about everything.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is kind of Mozilla's thing too.  The folks behind Firefox.  According to the Washington Post, Google may have some big issues coming up in Europe,  not over this, although that could also be a cause for further action.  But Google may be getting fined billions this month from European regulators for forcing  its search and web browsing tools on the makers of Android smartphones.  So Google's already got a big fine over the shopping thing, over favoring, according to  the EU, Google sites over competitor sites.  What was that fine?  It was a lot of money.  And now they're facing maybe even a larger fine over what the EU sees as anti-competitive  measures against people who are trying to use Android without using Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This reminded me of the Microsoft EU fine.  I was not ever covering that directly, but it seemed related, the same arguments being  made that you can't download one app without downloading the whole thing.  So I didn't know if that was a better parallel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's similar, but it's different in that this is not the users downloading something.  This is the handset makers signing a contract with Google for what they call GMS, Google  Mobile Services.  And they have to have all of the Google apps in order to do that.  There's no picking and choosing.  That's the contract.  So it's similar, but it's different because it's not consumers who are making the choice  here.  It's the handset makers that force the choice on the consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The EU says device makers like HTC and Samsung face an anti-competitive choice.  Set Google search as the default search service, offer Google's Chrome browser, or lose access  to Android's app store.  That's part of the Google services.  Without the app store, you've got to make your own.  And you may well not have the millions of apps that Google offers.  So really, there is a pretty big stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's really terrible for end consumers because the Google app store does things to  enforce some security that generic app stores may not.  That's a big risk for users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So potentially a fairly large fine to add to that $2.7 billion fine they got last year.  They're appealing that fine, and I imagine they'd appeal this one.  See, if Jeff were here, I'm sure he'd have something to say in this.  But he's not.  So there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish I could argue here, but I've got really no great arguments here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's hard for Google.  I'll try to play somewhere in between Jeff and you guys.  It's hard for Google because see, Apple doesn't have isn't faced with the same issue because  nobody else makes iOS phones.  So they don't.  There's no necessary.  There's no necessity to strong arm anybody.  Google did the right thing.  They made Android open source.  So it means any manufacturer, including, by the way, Amazon, can take the Android code,  make their own version of Android, which Amazon has done with fire and distributed.  Google has one little thing that they do, which is, well, OK, but if you want the app store,  you got to take Gmail, you got to take Chrome, you got to make the default search engine be Google.  And that doesn't seem unfair.  That seems like a reasonable thing.  You know, it's all bundled together.  But and if you want, if you don't care about the app store, look, we've made Android available free for you to use.  It's free.  And it's why so many things run Android.  Because it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can install or sideload the Android apps, you know, get them from Google Play.  Of course, you get them from somewhere else.  And there is security risks, as Stacey had mentioned, that the safest place would be through the Play Store.  But if you don't have access to it, you can still get those Android apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You used to be able to when I would install a ROM on my Android device, you would the ROMs would not come with Google services,  but you would download G apps or something, a separate file.  Is that illegal?  Or is that legal?  Is that OK?  You would think Google would say fine, because you're going to be using our services now.  You would think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I almost don't want to answer because that's exactly what I did to the Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet that I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's so any kind of it's going to end the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go back and find it.  Wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's funny because Apple.  Didn't face this just by being a closed source and saying no.  So this is this is part of the argument about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the nature of anti-competitiveness in kind of a software driven world, like how far can you go when in these in you could make the point where I mean the point that antitrust people are looking at as well.  You buy an Apple phone or a Google phone.  You know, you can get those are apples to apples.  No pun intended.  On the software side, there's a bunch of people clamoring for Android because the other so closed off.  So where does where do we draw the line?  And I think it's going to be a harder and harder decision to make, especially when we start thinking about how data at the ability to collect data is going to influence the services you're able to offer.  So looking at something like is it going to be anti-competitive in a few years for like Google Photos to be so good because they have access to all of this data.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm I don't I'm not a lawyer.  I'm looking on Quora and somebody else who says I'm not a lawyer says it's almost certainly legal to do what Kevin did.  You just change a switch in the settings on your on your fire tablet and you click a link and you download the Google Play services in the Play Store.  And frankly, why would why would Google try to stop that?  Because you're saying I want to use your services.  Exactly.  That if you're Samsung and you want to pre-install the Google Store, you have to sign the agreement with Google that you're going to do all those things.  And that's what the EU is upset about.  I don't know.  I feel like Google should be allowed to do this because they did the right thing, which is they allowed Android to be given away for free.  So that's not exactly as strongly worded as Jeff Jarvis might have had it.  But I think I've somewhat represented the Jarvis position.  Let's take a little break and have more.  What is for dinner tonight, Stacey?  We're going to have something delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, we're eating out tonight.  Sorry.  That's delicious.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You live in Austin, Texas.  Yes, there will be tacos.  There will be tacos.  There will be.  Kevin, remind me, where do you where do you hang your hat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In between Philadelphia and Quaker Town in Pennsylvania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can go out and get a nice hot soft pretzel dipped in butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't need the butter, but yes, you need I'm looking at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need the butter, dude.  You need to fatten up a little bit.  Flesh out that Flippable Football Club tattoo.  Give it some swell it out there a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is for my pretzels, it's just a 10 minute walk down the street.  I don't get enough exercise to get the pretzel from.  Well, I won't say from where because last time that was a whole debacle.  Why? What happened?  Did you?  Wawa.  Huh?  You remember Wawa?  The store?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no, that we were going on and on about Wawa.  I felt so bad.  What was what's bad about Wawa?  Oh, nothing.  I must have been here.  It's awesome.  No, you were there.  You were there.  Jeff was saying how wonderful it is.  And then we started looking up where how many stores they had and the East Coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we got we got sucked into the Wawa discussion.  We went down the Wawa rabbit hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, Kevin, we go down.  That's all we do.  That's all we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is your show that you guys do is a little bit more structured and directed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We yes, we we try to focus only on IOT.  There's some singing.  Kevin, Kevin does not by Kevin, never by Kevin.  So Stacey sings.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She usually she doesn't realize I've been recording the all her singing, you know,  for three years now, unbeknownst to her.  And we're going to have a greatest hits podcast one time.  You'll hear Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can we have ringtones of Stacey singing?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Best thing I ever had business in my life, I think one of the best things I was in a  farmers market in Philly and there was a Pennsylvania Dutch booth, young lady with  a little lace cap, fresh, hot, big pretzel with salt.  And she dipped it in melted butter.  And I took one bite and I said, I'm moving to Philadelphia.  In fact, I'm moving in with you, young lady.  It was the best thing I ever had in my life.  Oh, my God.  Was that good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You might have to give up electricity to do that.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hear the Amish these days are very technology focused.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good they could well be.  I mean, I still see the carts and the horses every once in a while.  And we just moved my stepdaughter out to Kutztown University, which is about 45 minutes  northwest of us.  And we look like the Amish World Series, a bunch of guys playing baseball.  I mean, I was, you know, they're all over.  I don't know how technically savvy they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let me just refer you to this NPR story from a few years back.  Amish community, not anti-technology, just more thoughtful.  Here's one of their three horse buggies.  They all have electric lights powered by rechargeable batteries.  One even has windshield electric windshield wipers.  Nice one Amish man in Lancaster County P.H.X.  his voicemail about four times a day.  His shop is equipped with a propane powered forklift, hydraulic powered saws, cordless  drills and a refrigerated tank where milk from the dairy cows is stored.  So they are they don't consider themselves anti-technology.  Just careful.  Good.  We could probably use some of that.  Yeah.  Maybe that's the new Amish mode on Android P.  There we go.  You can only check your voicemail four times a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I never checked my voicemail.  That'd be fine.  Who checks their voicemail ever?  You know, the notification stays at the top of your thing and it drives me nuts.  So I every like twice a week or not twice a week, twice a month, I'll check my voicemail.  That's your by the way, that's your carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very annoying.  You have AT&T I bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have Verizon.  Verizon even worse.  Same difference.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very annoying.  And their voicemail like their voicemail is so archaic.  It drives me absolutely bonkers.  I'm like, come on you guys.  Do you really want to charge me?  I think it's like three bucks a month for visual voicemail.  Yeah, T-Mobile is the same thing.  It's crazy.  Come on people.  Crazy.  I refuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, whatever kind of go ahead.  Go Google Fi.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I have a Google voice number, but yeah, I ask people in my message not to leave a  voicemail.  Yeah.  But doctors do, you know, all those people.  Yeah, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm like, whatever gets back to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could make this my pick of the week actually.  It might be something you'd like.  So, I was a big Jabber fan way back in the way back.  Oh yeah, me too.  Yeah, everybody was till Google said, oh, we're going to deprecate it, blah, blah, blah.  But it was a really I thought a great chat protocol.  It could be much more than chat.  It supported XML and it was very extensible.  Well, I found this interesting service, jump.chat, jmp.chat.  And so, it gives you a real phone number.  You can choose your area code.  You can use it as a Jabber phone number so you can send texts.  People can call it, but they can't talk to you.  They can only leave a message, which then appears in your inbox as a playable WAV file  and text.  And so, I created a phone number.  It's a bit of a process.  You can try it free for 30 days and then it's 35 bucks a year or $3 a month.  So, what you do is you create a Jabber ID on this site in Germany called dismail.de.  And that can be anything.  You're not really going to use that publicly.  There are Jabber clients for all the mobile platforms.  I'm using conversations on Google Play.  Then I imagine they're using Twilio or something like it, but you can get a number for jump.chat.  And when you give out that number, you put it on your business cards, but this way people call.  You can't talk to them.  They don't leave one of those unusable, you know, call this number, press seven to delete, eight to listen or save.  They leave a text message in this Jabber client.  So, you can have like a separate messaging client that's just for text phone messages to this special number.  So, I immediately did this.  And so, for 35 bucks a year, I have a form.  It's not quite Google Voice.  It's an interesting, it's kind of an alternative thing.  I thought this was really, really great.  I set this up yesterday.  It's a Java messaging for phones, I guess is what JMP stands for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could, Stacy, we could use that for CES planning and just give everybody all that phone number.  We never have to talk to anybody again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I plan to use this when I make appointments, when I put it on your business card.  For your show, you could create a special number that people could leave messages that you'd have the audio, you could play back.  You can read the text.  It seems to be exactly the same capability transcription as Google's, you know, Fire Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe we should do that, Kevin, for the, Kevin's in the midst of a technical challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you trying to write this in Python, dude?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I already did.  Not this, not this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twilio will give you the back end for all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. That's what I did.  I took Twilio and Python.  I made our IOT voicemail hotline, right?  How long did that take you?  A day or two, I'll say.  I don't know. It was a year ago.  So it was a while ago.  It works.  Can you own it?  It works. Yeah.  But I run it on a Raspberry Pi.  Nice.  Which is fine.  But when the dog decides, when Norm says, I'm going to go chew on this cord and pull the back.  Exactly. Or the Internet's out.  So I just moved it over to Google Cloud and what I thought was going to be free isn't free.  So now I'm going to go to AWS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, here's the other thing.  You can send unlimited text messages from that number.  So what you could do is have an IOT number that you say, leave us a message or whatever.  And if you want to be on our mailing list, send, you know, send us a message.  And then you can add that to a contact list and send out messages to everybody.  Should I give out that number and my number and see what happens?  You know, what could possibly go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What could possibly go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll give out my here.  Let me see. I have to I can't remember it now.  It's a 415 number, which I don't see.  I don't have a 415 number and I thought I should have a 415 number.  Makes you look legit.  Makes you look too legit to quit.  Let me open the conversations because that's where that's my Jabber client.  Oh, I never set it up on here.  I got on this phone.  Too many phones on I just thinking how I can't find my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the opposite opposite problem clearly not Amish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's let the telethon begin.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is this is actually a good test.  This is a good test.  I don't hear those phones ringing.  415 604.  I got to give out the right number though.  If I give out the wrong number, I'm going to upset.  Someone's going to hate you.  Not going to be happy at all.  415 604 1630.  I'm pretty sure.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Should I?  Let me verify.  Let me verify that crap.  I can't.  Yeah.  Oops.  415 604 1360.  Everybody call that number right now.  415 604 1360.  Leave a message.  Send it.  You could text it.  You could MMS it.  It's using Jabber, but you don't have to use a Jabber client.  You can use any SMS client.  You can call that number.  Now you don't get a voicemail message.  You just when you call the number, you get a beep.  Because.  But I think most people are conditioned if they hear boop to start talking.  It would be nice if you could say, hi, this is Kevin Toffle and this is Stacy Higginbotham.  I want to sing a song, but instead, why don't you leave us a message?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is very close to the one we have.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We recorded an MP3 and we just host that off Twilio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can change it whenever we want.  We can make it seasonally specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chatroom wants to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  415 604 1360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we'll see.  The lines are open.  The lines are open.  I've done this many, many times because, you know, all of this stuff is cheap and easy now.  Thanks to Twilio probably is the backend for most of this stuff.  It's really kind of neat.  How much is a Twilio account for a phone number?  Oh, it's very inexpensive.  I figure it's less than 35 bucks a year because that's what I'm paying jump.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we pay like three tenths of a penny for every incoming call or something like that.  See, this is all at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's free.  Yeah.  God, I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, everybody, call me and leave long, long messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we're going to talk Chromebooks in a second, of course, because Kevin is the Chromebook Wizard and Crostini.  I'm loving it.  But first, a word from last pass.  Last pass works great in your Chromebook.  Works great on your Android phone, your iOS, your Windows, your Mac, your Linux.  That's one of the reasons I use last pass everywhere.  Every one of my passwords is in last pass.  I only have to remember the last pass password.  It unlocks and auto fills everywhere I am.  It generates long, strong passwords.  It helps me do a security checkup so that I don't have the same password again and again on site after site.  Look, this is clearly the answer to the password conundrum.  And everybody has it, especially if you're in business.  If you think of it, if you think of the problem that a business faces, because our well, we've had that problem.  We had an engineer put all of the passwords on a website that he could easily get to.  But so could everybody else.  That's when we set up last pass enterprise.  Last pass enterprise means that everybody in the enterprise can have access to the passwords they need.  You can actually share passwords without them even seeing it.  So you can change it.  It's automatically changed for them.  You can assign roles so only certain people have access to certain things.  Your employees don't have to write passwords down, remember them.  It just works.  Over 81 percent of all the breaches we hear about every day are caused by weak or reused passwords.  That's why 13 million people trust last pass.  Thirty three thousand businesses use last pass.  We've been using last pass for a couple of years.  And one of the things I believe in is so much that we do for all our employees is we give them a last pass personal account as well so that they are protected in their regular life, too.  That's how important it is.  When you use last pass enterprise, you can control your password policies.  For instance, we require two factor.  You don't have to use last two factor to use last pass, but we require it of our employees.  We can have automatic and this is for our employees.  We do this, I think, every six months.  All the passwords reset.  It's that that way.  You know, if an employee leaves and we forget to change or whatever, it's nice to you.  All the master password requirements are up to you, too.  We make sure that they use long master passwords.  You can restrict access to specific devices and locations.  So, for instance, when I was in Japan, I couldn't at first log in because it said, you know, your last pass is set to be used in Petaluma.  What are you doing in Japan?  So I had to jump through some extra hoops, which is I was glad I said, OK, in this case for the next three weeks, Japan's OK.  That's the kind of thing you want.  Configure over 100 policies, access security reports, create shared folders, organize database logins, SSH keys, software licenses.  It's not just passwords.  Everything we I use last pass notes to keep all of the documents.  You know, our EIN numbers, Social Security numbers, payroll information, it's all secure.  Its data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level.  Data stored in the vault is always secret, even from last pass, even from last pass.  So this this is the right way to go.  You and your employees could take the last pass security challenge.  So it tells you where there's weaknesses so you can fix them.  It's first thing we did in the business.  We made sure all the passwords were strong and long and compliant.  So there's last pass for all sorts of users.  Last pass premium for personal use.  Last pass families for the family.  Last pass teams for teams of 50 or fewer.  Last pass enterprise for the business as that's what we use at work and at home.  Fix your password woes with last pass.  It's the number one most preferred password manager.  And it's really a big part of of our business.  It has been for years.  And I've used last pass forever, practically since they started.  Steve Gibson interviewed Joe Segrist.  Joe was very kind.  Let him look at all the code Steve gave it.  His seal of approval started using last pass.  That was some years ago.  We love it. Last pass dot com slash twit.  Find out more.  Get signed up and get your business signed up.  Because if you think about it.  If your bookkeeper has access to your QuickBooks and has the password.  If he or she leaves, they still have the password.  Last pass dot com slash twit.  You better protect that stuff.  Last pass dot com slash twit.  We're very grateful to last pass for keeping all our stuff safe and secure.  So Kevin is the Chromebook guy.  I'm really pleased that you started this website, Kevin.  That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a good time actually.  I've been working with Chromebooks since day one when they first started.  And I got away from them.  And had some free time.  And just one weekend in March said, let me start up a blog on Chromebooks.  It was perfect timing.  There's so much innovation coming right now between hardware, software.  It's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  About Chromebooks dot com.  Nice and simple.  And you were the one who told me about Christina.  You can see you've got a most recent article as what are the good Linux apps to install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a question I get from a lot of people who are not using Christina.  And for those who don't know,  Christina is a Google project to bring full Linux apps to Chromebooks.  Even Chromeboxes.  Any Chrome OS device actually.  And the question I get is, well, when I can do the Christina stuff on the stable channel,  because it's in dev now, the dev channel, what do I install?  And I'm like, you know what?  That's a great question.  So everybody's different.  I put some IDEs for coding on mine.  I put Skype on mine.  It's not working yet because there's no audio support.  But people maybe don't want those.  But maybe you want, I don't know.  I either finding a wiki of finding Windows or Linux equivalents of Windows apps thinking maybe that'll help people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is so much better than what Microsoft has done with their Linux subsystem because it's real Linux.  It's Debian on here.  Correct.  And so I am now I'm a little concerned, but I'll talk about it a little bit.  But I install immediately, you know, get and key base and all the stuff that all that come.  It's command line only all command line stuff.  And as you can see, Emax and I installed Space Max, the Haskell compiler, the Python interpreter, all the stuff that I use day in, day out.  And what it does is kind of interesting.  You know, a Chromebook as configured is really kind of a safe, secure device for limited use for people who don't need Photoshop or, you know, 3D design tools, stuff like that.  Although I have to say with Adobe Fuse, which is a video editor that's coming soon to Chrome OS, this might be changing.  But what's interesting is I don't the middle stuff is not what I'm worried about.  The fact that I can use Linux and command line is huge for me.  This makes this like my go to computer now.  And if you have if you have a fairly fast computer, how does how does the crostini work on the slower machines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends. I would say not as good if you're going to do this.  If you're going to do this, you probably want at least a core i3 processor.  Even 4 gig of RAM is pushing it, I believe.  You know, that's what this HP Chromebook X2 is that I have.  And it's working.  But it's it's a good step behind the Pixelbook.  And then once you start into the two and three hundred dollar Chromebooks, I don't know.  I mean, we're asking an awful lot of that hardware at that point.  I just as a kind of a give you an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Emacs, I run on on every box of all the Max box, all the next boxes.  And normally Emacs, I will run it as a demon, which you can do, which is interesting on crostini.  So it could stay in the background and load pretty fast because that initial load is slow.  I've never really found it that slow on most machines on this.  It's eight seconds because I have space Max and one hundred sixty packages.  There's a lot to load and that eight seconds feels long.  So it is one of those things where it's not going to be as snappy as a dedicated Linux box or even Mac OS running a command line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, the funny thing is you mentioned it's all command line to install your packages and hitting the repositories to install apps.  There is a code changes that Google is working on actual installing of Debian packages.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I use I use apt.  You can use you know, you can actually apt get install anything in the Debian repositories.  Which version of is this stretch? What's on here?  This is stretch stretch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I think because that's the long term support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's stable. It's the stable branch.  Yeah. And that's what you want because you don't.  But it keeps you updated. I mean, every time I launch launch it and I put the terminal in my menu bar.  So it's very easy. Just click the terminal. It's launched.  I'm running bash right now.  Probably switch that over to fish my preferred command line tool.  You know, pseudo apt update, pseudo apt upgrade and all your apps are updated just as you would expect on any Linux box.  I like it. I like it a lot.  It really makes a Chromebook a lot more useful for somebody like you.  You want to use Python. You don't have to log into a Raspberry Pi with SSH anymore.  You could just do it on your Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. And the thing is you had noted how secure the Chromebooks are because, you know, everything is from top to bottom handled by Google.  It's got the TPM chip in the devices.  The way they've done this, I don't think I don't feel they've compromised security at all because this is all a sandbox container.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you still your secure boot still turned on. You don't turn you don't disable that.  You're not going to have to run in developer mode.  So but that is there. That raises the one concern.  I don't want to spend too much. That's one of the reasons I'm using Space Max.  Usually I use a custom EMAX configuration that's very complicated.  And I don't want to invest a lot of time in setting this up because I'm worried that it's, you know, at some point I'm a power wash it and I have to do the whole thing over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a valid concern.  But and I don't have the information handy right now, but I will look it up and maybe you can add it to the show notes.  You can take snapshots of the containers.  And then basically image them and then restore them.  So that's exactly what I want.  Yeah, because this is for people who are interested in the nitty gritty.  If you take a look, it's LXC and LXC is one of the components here and it's been in Linux forever.  And there's a lot of tools and ways to use it.  And that's what Google is using to create the container.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So is it a Chirut like like Crouton was or I don't believe so.  OK, I don't believe LXC is a container technology like Docker.  So that's nice. So it's running in a container which I could then snapshot and restore.  So I would snapshot it and save it somewhere you want to save it securely because you've got like I have all my GPG keys in here and all that.  I save my dot files. I have a git repository, a secure git repository with my dot files.  I guess I could just do that.  But it would be nice, much nicer if I don't have to reinstall it.  If I just had a container and I could that would be really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's so much going on with this. This is always changing.  Every every week I find five new things that are happening or coming.  And it's really exciting right now.  It's almost hard to keep up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When will it be in the regular channel in the standard stable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it was going to be in stable 68.  But then they pushed it back to 69.  So that's soon.  It is soon.  But again, it's also only on certain devices.  Because of the Linux kernel that they use and so on and so forth.  But so, Stacey, if you get a Chromebook, get one with Linux kernel 4.4.  That's all I can tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, well, I'm not going to ask you until like six months from now.  Does your daughter use Chromebooks in school?  No, they use MacBooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, that's nice, actually.  But expensive for the parents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she has my old computer.  And then I bought a new computer.  She might get this one or I might just get her a Chromebook.  She doesn't get to keep her school computer.  And everything's on Google.  So you just log in and you've got everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This Pixelbook is awfully nice, but it's expensive.  I got the base model, which is a thousand bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty.  I'm watching you fling that thing around.  It's so light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's nice.  You don't mind carrying around.  It comes with a pencil.  So I don't do any illustration.  But if a kid wanted to, this is a really well made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd buy my child a thousand dollar computer.  I don't blame you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look what it does though.  I was watching the World Cup on it.  And the fact that I can tent it like that makes it really great for watching TV.  No, I really like this.  I think Best Buy still has them for about $720 to $750 right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's very attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Considering that Chromebook X2 was $600.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what is Google's...  It's kind of futile to ask this.  It's like asking what is Google's messaging strategy?  What is Google's Chrome OS strategy?  Because it's a little confusing.  You had Chrome OS, then you had an Android store to it.  Now you've got Linux on it.  It's all over the place.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One OS to rule them all.  I don't know.  And I don't know really much about Fuchsia, so I won't go there.  This is their way to say, look, we used to be the platform that was safe, secure, and you're limited to web apps.  We thought that was good, but maybe some people didn't.  Guess what?  Now we have probably the most apps available on our computers because we have Linux, we have Android, and we have web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fuchsia, which is yet another operating system from Google, but it takes a while to develop an operating system from scratch.  The last one took me two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hard, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a lot of time.  It's a lot of time.  That kernel will get you every time.  So Linux was the kernel for both the Android and for Chrome OS.  So they didn't really have to develop from scratch.  Fuchsia, they're doing from scratch.  And they've been working on it for at least five years.  I think it's going to be a year or two more, I would guess, but maybe not.  Did you ever install Fuchsia because you can install it?  You can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw Ron Amadio do it and when I saw how little you could do with it, I'm like, well, thanks, Ron.  Exactly.  Thanks, Ron.  You saved me some time.  And I could be wrong.  Stacey, have we ever heard about Fuchsia being part of some embedded platforms or am I confusing with something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're confusing it with Brillo and Weave maybe.  Zircon?  Zircon.  No, I don't think.  Andromeda?  We have not talked about Fuchsia being part of embedded stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I'm confusing with the Android things or something right now.  Which was Brillo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  According to a tech radar, Google Fuchsia is a hybrid OS comprised of two distinct but connected user interfaces, a phone centric, one code named Fuchsia.  And a traditional desktop UI named Copibara.  This is actually from a 9 to 5 Google.  That makes sense because if you're Google and you're going to develop from scratch, you want one that's going to work on Android devices and you want one that's going to work on Chrome.  I lied to you, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did say that it could work on embedded devices.  That it was going to work on everything.  Everything.  Yes.  Wow.  God, that was all the way back in 2016.  No wonder I don't remember.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right, Kevin.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Microkernel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen or remember microkernel for Fuchsia that they were going to use for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have been gradually transferring people over.  Earlier this year, the former head of Android platform security, Nick Kralovich, went to define security at the Fuchsia's department.  That means, well, of course, if you're building an OS today from the ground up, you've got to do security from the ground up.  But it may be a little bit farther along than just a laboratory project.  But knowing how long it takes to develop an operating system from scratch, knowing what state it was in when Ronam Audio installed it just earlier this year, I think it's a ways off.  And so until then, you have this beast with three backs.  That's the Chrome OS.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what?  A lot of people are complaining about Chromebooks are getting too complex now because all these additions and Chrome.  Yeah.  Well, it can be.  It can be.  You don't need to enable Linux apps right off the bat.  That's a setting.  You don't turn on.  Exactly.  Google Play Store.  Turn it off.  And you still have the same Chromebook that you've always had.  I don't.  I don't.  Yeah.  People realize that it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get the choice.  Google's not forcing this.  Just like putting Linux on Windows, Google's trying to do the same thing Microsoft did, which is to appeal to a certain group of people, sysadmins and others, who really wouldn't consider Chrome OS.  But now you can have a good terminal.  You can have all the pen testing tools, command line stuff.  But you know, you know, Wireshark or anything you want to put on there will work.  I presume I don't know, but I presume you have access to the networking stack and all of that stuff.  Is it how isolated is it from the hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's still pretty isolated.  In fact, I mean, because they're still working on a lot of the hardware components.  There's no graphic GPU acceleration, for example.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You really wouldn't want to put any X Windows stuff on it at all.  It's not it's not powerful enough or fast enough for graphical interfaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, especially if you're going to have this run across a range of Chromebooks that some might be.  I mean, some of the ARM based ones actually support it already.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, so I'm curious what you guys think of this story.  I just was reading about it on Reddit.  Marcus Brownlee did a review of the OnePlus 6.  And by the way, the red OnePlus 6 is coming out.  And then tweeted that he was a little perturbed at OnePlus because they took his video review on YouTube and are running it as an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so he has no control over it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, then so there's a whole thread back and forth.  And at some point, the folks from YouTube said, no, no one can do that without your permission.  We should talk.  Now, at this point, that sounds like if Marcus wanted it to be pulled down, he could.  He does point out as his most viewed video ever.  So he says basically he was without his permission.  Google says, well, you can't turn an ad video on an ad without the creator's consent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now is it a setting that maybe he had and that he didn't?  Because I can totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you have to explicitly ask permission, certainly in the real world.  If somebody were going to take my review from here and put it on their website, they would be required to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, sometimes people pull review content from like I know that when I was writing at Fortune, people would sometimes pull our review content for their advertising.  But it's like their use.  So you could they would pull like a statement from my review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't even like that when people do that.  Occasionally they do that and I will complain and make them take it down.  But yeah, you see that movie reviews all the time.  You know, Cisco and Ebert, two thumbs up.  That's not you don't have to ask permission to do that.  I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where is the advertising revenue going?  Which account?  I mean, if it's going to Marquez's, then we would know.  It's not. It's not going to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just it's no there's no revenue.  It is an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One plus put his video in is using that to run an advertisement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if I'm Marquez, I'm upset.  In fact, I would say if I were Marquez, if that had happened to me, I would have it would be gone because that's an implicit endorsement.  And of course, a complete conflict of interest because he now I go even the extra step.  We don't generally review stuff unless we buy it.  So like I bought this pixel book, I bought this iPhone, I bought this pixel, too, because I don't want to even have a review unit.  But he most people and that's completely normal process have review units as long as you send them back.  You know, there's not a problem with that, although the other day Marquez showed his drawer of phones.  Apparently, he does not send them back because he has a drawer with at least 500 phones in it.  So that's a little weird, too.  Marcus, you should send those back.  That would be the right thing to do on those.  I don't know. I'm curious.  I don't know who to blame on this one.  If it's if the ad's still up, then at this point, I think you have to say Marquez probably is liking the traffic.  He's not making any money on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's yeah, that's I mean, but we're all old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, YouTube standards are very different, aren't they?  I don't even know anymore.  And I don't even know what's allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we send our stuff back with the exception.  No, there are a couple of exceptions.  There are things that we I think we've purchased most of it, but there are a few things that I have that I keep because they continually update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. It's like an ongoing.  Right. Like, yes.  Long term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think one of I think maybe my either my Wink or my SmartThings hub is an ongoing review unit.  However, the others are all one of the hubs is, but I don't remember which one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And by the way, I shouldn't say that Marcus.  I was I thought Marcus was getting these sent to him to review, but maybe he's buying him.  Maybe that's why his phone drawer is so full.  Maybe you'd sell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you'd use them, sell them and, you know, plow it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you buy them, you should sell them.  If you don't, if you're giving them as a review unit, even if and sometimes companies do this.  Well, we don't when somebody offers me us a review unit, our standard policy is to say fine, but you must send a return label and we will return it within two weeks of the of the final of the review.  And we insist on that and you have to pay for return shipping.  And then in that case, we'll review it because I don't want first of all, anybody who does this is the problem.  This is just this is a minor.  I remember John C. Dvorak told this story before, who was at the time writing a column a day.  He was in 30 different magazines.  And basically he was so powerful in the industry.  This is in the 90s.  Everybody sent him everything.  I remember going to his house once.  He had a laptop on every step of his stair going up his stair.  He had in his living room.  He'd been going through stuff, a pile of boxes of software that they were going to sell or throw away or dispose of.  And then I said, you know, John, I need a modem.  He said, oh, come with me.  And he was renting a space above a gas station that was like Fibber McGee's closet.  You open the door and you had to go.  And he said, there's there are a bunch of modems in here.  Let's see.  What do you want?  So he was he couldn't be bothered to send him back.  And, you know, if you don't have a staff, I understand that.  But oh, yeah, that's that's it's I mean, we're a small operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's that's why I insist on a mailing label, because then I just keep the box, slap the label back on it and UPS comes and gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is that is how we roll.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like I would like that.  Let me just say this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Marquez and everybody who does reviews, the Linus Tech Tips, all these people publish an ethics statement, put it on a website.  We should probably do that.  Everybody should do that.  I have a disclosure on my.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Explains all that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Kara Swisher is the role model in this, because she was for a while married to a woman who worked was an executive at Google.  So she has a very extensive, you know, statement.  And I think that that would be a good thing for us all to do.  And we don't have one because, you know, the last one I had was Jim Latterback.  We're one for everybody.  We all had to sign it.  You know, I'll write one.  I think it's a good thing.  I haven't done it either.  But we'll write one just so people know where you stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, what are we going to talk about next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You ready for prime day?  I am.  Do you buy on Prime Day?  Not really.  If there's something exciting to buy.  I've never been excited about Prime Day.  There's never like anything that I'm like, holy mackerel.  I need that.  It's now Amazon Prime 36 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So big.  One day couldn't hold it all.  I actually wait for it like when I lost my Kindle earlier this year, one of my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mini Kindle losses of this year, I was like, oh, wait till Prime Day because I  know the Kindle will be on sale.  But then they put it on sale for like National Book Month or something.  So I got it then.  So they that's the best thing to buy on Prime Day for sure is Echos, Kindles,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that kind of thing.  It's coming, by the way, second half of Monday and all of Tuesday.  I kind of feel like it's like a flea market of all the stuff they can't get rid of  in the warehouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you mean?  You think they can't get rid of the TRT travel, the turtle travel pillow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't think they can.  You don't think they.  I saw a 12 pack of pumpkin.  Pumpkin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Canned pumpkin for like an absurd deal.  And I was like, what?  12 pack.  You're in a pumpkin.  12 pack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're in a pumpkin coming out your butt.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's a lot of pumpkin.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Up to.  Oh, look, your chance to win a $50,000 Lexus ES with Alexa built in.  Now how much would you pay?  Popular movies, $1.99, 30% off selected Amazon devices.  Now, I always go to the wire cutter because they do a good thing.  I just hate Prime Day.  It's all hands on deck.  It just must just because they're there and they're just comparing the deals on Prime with real,  with other places and telling you what's a good deal because not all of them are good deals.  A lot of them aren't.  And what is?  And Thrifter, which is Renee Richie's company, Mobile Nations, also will be doing the same thing.  Probably before you buy on Prime Day, it'd be a good idea to check out the wire cutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They need to automate that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All that price checking and then if something gets sold out.  I don't think you can scrape Amazon for that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like there was a lawsuit or some sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bet if somebody had a Raspberry Pi, a little bit of Python code, there's nothing they couldn't do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll be running it off my Amazon Fire 10 with the Google Play Store.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, Kevin found some good deals on Google stuff coincidentally tied to Pi Day or Prime Day.  Well, it would make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google would want to offer some deals on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They teamed up with Amazon's arch nemesis, too.  And I just realized this, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We talked about this six hours ago.  How could you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it was it was it?  Was it Walmart?  It is Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah. Funny how it's the same day, the 17th, and you can get all the Google stuff with rebates.  So you get the Google Store sale price plus rebates.  It's like a home menu is $19 net.  You can get two Google Home Max's, the big speakers for $498.  Where is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it on the Google Store?  No, no, no, no.  This is just on Walmart.com.  I remember where I read it.  Mashable had it.  That's where I found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like, you know, if you are thinking about getting an Apple HomePod, seriously can stop, first of all.  Seriously consider the Google Home Max, which sounds in my opinion, every bit as good.  It's more expensive.  It's more expensive.  But with that deal, it's less.  And you have Google Assistant instead of a dumb little Siri in there.  I'm really.  Oh, yeah.  See, say no, it is on the Google Store.  Make waves.  Keep the keep the beat.  Save $150 on two Google Home Max speakers.  Just add them both to your cart.  It's right now.  So is that the deal?  That's the deal you're talking about, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That matches the deal that I was talking about for sure.  So there are three 99s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's $800.  So that's $650 for two.  That makes it less than the HomePod.  But you have to buy two.  Oh, students can save 10 percent using student beans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nest Doorbell and a Google Mini are on sale somewhere for $169, which actually is a pretty sweet deal.  Where did I find that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We should do a podcast.  The deals of the day.  Oh, CNET, CNET showed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's the that's a really good deal because the the doorbell, the Nest Hello doorbell is it's like 239.  So they're saying you can buy the Nest Hello doorbell with the Google Home Mini for $200.  And then you get a coupon code that brings it to 170.  Basically, that is a good which is in that.  That is a good deal.  Which is in that is a great doorbell.  Yes, it is.  I highly recommend that doorbell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want a team with the Wirecutter, a thrifter and have cameras in there.  They must have a bullpen, a war room, right?  With 20 guys typing fast as they can and have like a microphone there and have them just run up and say, I found a great deal.  And then sit down and just stream it live all Prime Day.  Why don't we do that?  Wirecutter thrifter, call me.  You know my number.  It's 415-604-1360.  I wonder if I got any.  Don't expect me to answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you've got voicemails.  Do I?  People did say that they left messages.  I don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's what you should use as your ringtone.  Beep.  Everybody around you just start saying, yeah, hi, Leo.  It's me.  Beep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On iOS, you have to use a weird.  It's sad what happened to Jabber.  You have to use a messenger called Tagazi Messenger.  She's not the best name.  Oh, my God, I did.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I got a bunch of them.  Thank you.  Yeah, how does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How's the format?  Can you show us the format?  Are they well, because it's to gotten there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Appropriate because it's to Gazi Messenger.  It has a little tiger next to it.  Here's what I was interested is how good are the transcripts?  That's what I'm interested.  Here's the audio.  That's a wavelength voicemail transcription.  Hey, Leo, I hear Texas.  They have done to the birds.  What that?  OK, that's pretty accurate.  Here's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shakespearean Vulcan, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, I know when Jay and the chaplain.  All right, just text me.  All righty.  Bye.  Here's another one.  Leo, I think she really need to let you buy a shotgun.  But first home defense need really need a pest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like Google Voice back in like 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not very high quality.  It's like drunk Google Voice.  There's just a text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, Leo.  Here's another one.  Joe.  Hey, I am calling you.  Thanks for the trip.  This is Leo.  How are you doing, baby?  Hmm.  Anyway, thank you all for the calls.  Hello, Leo.  Somebody sent me who dis?  So I get a whole lot, but I got a few.  And yeah, the transcription is a little bit disappointing.  I'll have to listen to the waves and see if they are that incomprehensible actually or  anyway, there's plenty more space where that came from.  If you want to call me the wire cutter, we'll figure it out.  Amazon devices are already on sale ahead of Prime Day, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this must be 35 bucks for an Amazon Echo, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  35 pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are you in the UK?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm in Mashable UK.  Oh, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got three barks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I forget what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It means my nest is probably going haywire, but my phone is not near me, so I can't look  at it.  That's her ringtone, actually.  Yeah.  Wait, is it?  Oh, it's not September yet.  I'm still waiting for my Google display unit thing.  So the Lenovo one.  Oh, yeah.  That's not until September.  Did you preorder it?  I don't remember.  Could we preorder it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't believe we could.  I may have preordered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you could have preordered it, I think we did, but I don't know if I did or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to go check the Lenovo smart display with Google Assistant built in.  Yes.  No, it's a notify me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So I signed up for notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I probably did too.  Limit five per customer.  Just get ready.  I'm not worried.  Limit five per customer.  And did you get pricing?  Do we know what the pricing is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it was $1.99 and $2.50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or $8 and $10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I got Norm going nuts.  Is that Norm?  Oh, Norm.  I love the oh Norm meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was $200 and $250.  I like the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're right for eight and 10 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  10 inches is such a nice size.  What's nice about that too is that one you can switch and have it in portrait or landscape.  I really, really like that design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's because of the weird fold in the back.  The twisty thing in the back there.  Yeah.  Let's just stand it either way.  Yeah, I want that a lot.  You know, I actually, I know you laugh at me, but I like the Google, I mean the Echo  Show, the Echo version of this.  And I got the Fire Cube, which is designed to...  How's that?  It's pretty, you know, okay, it's great.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How does it compare to the Harmony?  Does it recognize all your gear?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not a universal remote.  It does recognize some stuff.  So it recognized my TV.  It does some TVs.  It recognized my AV receivers.  Some AV receivers.  I have a Denon and an LG recognize those.  I don't have, I have a TiVo.  I don't have a set top box.  It does recognize some set top boxes though, quite a few.  So if you have an appropriate hardware setup, you could say things like Echo, watch Oprah,  and it would turn it to the right, you know, would do all the do-hickies and get it on.  It's really great to say turn off TV when you leave the room and it turns off the receiver,  turns off the TV.  But one of the things I really like about it is that it's essentially an Echo show  because if you say, what's the weather, it uses your big screen TV in the same way a show would,  to show the weather.  If you're playing music, it does the same thing the show does.  It shows the lyrics as a little karaoke kind of a thing where it goes, the lyrics go by.  And all of that stuff is great.  You can, if you had the Ring doorbell or the Nest doorbell, you could say, show my doorbell  and it would be on your big screen TV.  The thing I don't like about it is exactly the same problem I have with all the Fire TV devices.  They're basically a vehicle for advertising Amazon.  So it's very Amazon centric, you know, and you get a lot of ads for Amazon Prime stuff.  I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, because yeah, I was looking at that, but I have the Logitech Harmony Hub,  which I have linked through both Google and Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can control it with your voice, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the only reason, the only reason to switch over was to get a little bit more granularity  on like watch this particular show.  But that's, that's pretty like first world of me.  That's like the next level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you say, Echo, turn the TV on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can say Echo turn on television or you can actually custom turn off television.  I can say turn on Netflix and it'll link to Netflix from the Roku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With the Fire TV Cube, you can say watch Westworld.  Right. And it will know if you have HBO Go installed, it will know to go there.  But because there's Westworld the movie and Westworld the TV show, what it does is displays the two.  And then you say Echo play one or Echo play two.  So there's a little more interaction than you might, you might want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But OK, yeah, the only reason I was looking at it is for that next level granularity.  And because the, I would put that on the top of my TV setup and it's got the IR right in there in the Harmony.  I have this little tiny little IR receiver that attaches to a cord and it sneaks out of the cabinet.  My husband feels that it is offensive.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still use the most underrated set up box there is.  What's that?  The Shield TV, which is an Android TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I almost said Shield TV.  Yep. I really like it.  If it had YouTube TV, does it have YouTube TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't looked.  Does it have a view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it have PlayStation view?  Do you watch your view on it?  I do watch my view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I watch MLB TV.  Yeah.  OK.  Yeah.  But I mean, because I've got it.  Well, it's a Google Home as well.  It's a Chromecast as well.  If you're into Samsung SmartThings, you can buy a thirty dollar USB dongle, add Zigbee and Z-Wave radios and now it's your smart home hub.  Oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is how Kevin decided he didn't like SmartThings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I quite like the Shield.  I use the Shield.  And also the Nvidia Go.  Nvidia Go lets you play games on it.  I have the controller.  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  It is a nice.  It is an underrated TV device, although not cheap.  That's part of the problem is it's much more expensive than an Apple TV or a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You'll find it for like 170 to 200, depending on if you get the controller or the game controller.  That's the same as Apple TV.  It's a little more expensive maybe, but it's just, yeah, nobody knows about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a chat room, Mars woman, Sailor Lion saying, yes, YouTube TV is on it.  So I have to install that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you.  I'd be more excited, except I also pay for cable.  I also have an Apple TV.  I also have a Roku TV.  I have way too many ways to watch TV.  New book coming out that the chat room says you got to tell everybody about.  It's called Valley of Genius, the Uncensored History of Silicon Valley by Adam Fisher.  I'm reading it right now.  I'm loving it.  It's actually already out.  I think it's out, right, Karsten?  Or did I get an advanced copy?  I have it.  It's really good interviews with many of the people you know and many of the people you  don't know who made Silicon Valley the amazing place it is.  Adam's going to be our guest on triangulation on the 22nd, I think.  Is that right?  Coming up this month.  20th.  20th.  But you can read an excerpt right now in Vanity Fair's Hive.  Google was not a normal place.  Bryn, Page, and Mayer on the accidental birth of the company that changed everything.  So, if you want to get a sense of it, this is probably a great way to start.  Lots of good interviews in this.  It's a really fun book to read.  The Valley of Genius, the Uncensored History of Silicon Valley, as told by the hackers,  founders, and freaks who made it boom.  And I am really looking forward to talking to Adam about this.  He interviewed so many, more than a hundred people.  And what's nice is the book is transcripts of the interviews, which I kind of like.  It's the Studs Terkel method.  You know, you hear them in their own voices, which is really nice.  Okay.  What else do you want to talk about?  Timehop had a breach.  If you use Timehop, which I did for a long time, in order to use Timehop, you had to sign in through Facebook  and then give it permission to access all of your other social accounts.  And they got breached on the 4th of July.  They say they caught the bad guys in progress, but some data was taken.  They handled it well.  They reset all of the tokens that allowed.  So if you were, you know, whoever got your information at least can't access your Instagram, Facebook, and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems like every week there's something going on with breaches.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I almost don't want to report them.  21 million users, 21 million emails.  That's a lot.  Yeah, they published what they did really nicely, I thought.  And maybe this is GDPR. I bet it is.  They published a table of the number of breached records and the number that are affected by GDPR.  They're required within 72 hours to publish this.  So maybe this is the first, maybe one of the reasons we've seen so much breach information this week is thank you GDPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but see, we're already desensitized. Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We are.  Because just as Kevin said, there's been nothing but last week.  Polar.  You know, the polar.  Do you use Polar, Kevin, when you run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use Runkeeper when I run, but I used the Polar app because I had the Polar Android WearWatch for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Polar Flow was the app.  But as a runner, this is very common.  All the apps Strava, Polar, Runkeeper will keep a map of your run.  They'll tell you your pace.  They'll tell you how far you ran, all that stuff.  And a lot of runners make it public.  Do you make yours public?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The data in terms of the stats, my pace, how far I went, et cetera, that's public.  The maps are limited to my friends on the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the problem that happened with Strava is some smart reporter looked at the aggregate maps and you could see places there wasn't supposed to be anybody.  A lot of people running around.  The heat maps.  There were heat maps, effectively.  And the military, of course, fitness is a priority.  A lot of them use those apps.  They were able to deduce there's some secret military bases that aren't on the map, but we can see them because there's a lot of military guys running around them.  This one's a little bit different.  Polar had a flaw in their API and used simply simple serialized index numbers for all its users.  So you were able with the API to make requests for the data.  I'm not clear if it was all the data or just the public data.  It might have been some private data.  And I think some of the blame falls on the users because the Dutch newspaper that discovered this was able to, oh, here's a guy who spends a lot of time walking around the NSA.  Let's figure out who it is.  Oh, now let's see where he goes.  Oh, that's his home address.  That's bad operational security.  So some of the blame goes on if you're a spy, you probably shouldn't be wearing device that publicly publishes your heat map.  But also Polar didn't do a good job in keeping that stuff private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've played with the Runkeeper Health Graph, which is their API a little bit just to see if I can dig at my own data.  And you know, you needed to get tokens and IDs and credentials and all that.  So I can't speak for all the companies, but they seem to have locked it down and they haven't had a breach yet.  But you never know. It's getting to the point where I almost don't want to use any cloud based anything anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I was I was really bummed that Tinder is now encrypting your photos.  That's a bummer. Apparently they weren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is so much data that is. Yeah, it's all out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're putting it like guys, NSA guys, if you're putting it or whoever on the Internet, you might want to think about, you know, who might get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so this I will say like the fact that Congress is writing, I think they're writing letters to Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ron Wyden wrote to Tinder about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, I'm thinking about Google and the Gmail privacy policy.  Yeah. So they want them to testify.  I feel like, hey, maybe this is a good time to talk about creating these sort of usable labels for how data is used.  Right. Because it's not like Congress is.  I mean, yes, Google has these wonderfully opaque or not not opaque.  Yes, opaque terms and conditions.  But come on, people, no one reads them.  And now that we know this, maybe we should talk about making something more useful that everyone could read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, this story annoyed the hell out of me.  OK, this and I think I'm going to channel Jeff Jarvis on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tech, no panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No text. This started July 2nd.  We didn't get to talk about it. I got to log into my Wall Street Journal so I can show you the whole article.  But this the Wall Street Journal has a long history.  Jeff's pointed this out many times of sliming Google in its pages.  And you don't have to think too hard about why it might do that because, well, Google probably takes a little bit of money off the table with its advertising.  And the journal may not like that so much.  There may be other political reasons as well.  So they published what I considered a kind of a scurrilous article, text dirty secret.  OK, that right there. The app developers sifting through your Gmail.  Well, if you read it carefully, what it really is is yes, if you sign up for a service that reads, you know, that, for instance, looks for shopping receipts in your Gmail and then finds better deals for you.  I'm shocked, shocked to learn that it's reading your Gmail.  Well, duh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You gave me you approved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You said yes. And you wanted that service.  We know that some of these guys are pretty unscrupulous.  Unroll me, which had a very nice feature, would let you unsubscribe from newsletters.  Turned out they were gathering other stuff from your email and selling it to companies like Uber.  And I immediately got rid of unroll me.  So you want to be careful about who you give access to your Gmail to.  But there's lots of services, Sane Box, for instance, where you give them permission because they filter your email for you.  Well, how would they do that?  You had they have to read your email.  That seems obvious.  The journals just shocked, shocked.  And then they said sometimes humans will even do it.  And in those cases where humans were accessing the mail under very limited circumstances to do the machine learning to provide the service.  How data miners see your email.  If you're using any email program, and this is almost all of them has anti-spam protections.  Guess what? They have to read your email.  What they got wrong and this upset lawmakers apparently because that's what this is what precipitated those email those letters to Google.  What they got wrong is they said and Google's not paying any attention to this.  So Google posted a blog post and response saying, well, no, absolutely we're paying attention to this.  We every single person who asks for that kind of permission has to go through our process in which we make sure that they're doing what they said they're going to do, not something else.  We, you know, we're very careful about that.  It's probably a good idea to go to Google dot com slash permissions and review who you've given Gmail access to.  But if you give them Gmail access, you can't very well complain that they're reading your email.  That's what you gave them access for.  So I think this is a case of the frankly of the Wall Street Journal hoping that lawmakers would then write letters to Google and get all upset because I don't know.  Am I wrong? Maybe I'm wrong.  I was just telling Jeff Jarvis. Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think there I think there is a misunderstanding of how much data is gathered, how we use data.  And I think it is shocking to people who may not be aware of that.  So that is what I think we should.  I mean, yes. Do I think the article was a bit inflammatory?  Yes. Do I think people are really aware of what happens with when they subscribe to these services?  I don't think they are. I really don't.  It's the same way. I think people get surprised when I'm like, hey, you know, if you have the following home devices in your house, I could totally tell when you're home or not.  And they're like, well, it's so.  I don't know. I think we we have a long way to go to understanding exactly what's happening here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So is it Google's responsibility or the company that's asking for permission to read your email to be very clear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's everyone's responsibility in this role.  And that's why I think this is a great opportunity to create like there's some of the ideas are like a nutrition label for data.  Creating a simple and some are like like a good housekeeping seal of approval, but create a set of policies that make sense.  So that would include things like, hey, do we share your data with third parties?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do. How do we? I do have to say that Google in response to heat in years gone by stopped reading your email.  Yeah. Last year, they still but they still have to read.  They still have to scan it for anti-spam, but they stopped.  They stopped using it for advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They stopped advertising against it.  And, you know, I I don't care that Google like I was aware of this, but plenty of people are not plenty of people.  You know, someone says, hey, you should totally sign up for Gmail.  This is awesome. You should totally sign up for.  And I don't think it's wrong that people expect this stuff to be easy and convenient to use.  That's what we're trained for. And companies take advantage of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can use. OK, so using Gmail, by the way, that is not enough.  You then have to sign up for a service. Right. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's I'm just saying this is how these like the tech press gets all excited or maybe a friend uses and like, oh, you should totally try to use this.  Right. You're like, oh, that sounds really cool.  And you click through and you do everything.  I do think we need better like Azure signing up for something.  We need an alternative to a TOS or a EULA that does something in plain English with like four or five main points that you could just be like, oh, oh, they want that.  It's kind of like now on phones. I mean, we're trained to be like, hey, this thing wants to use your camera.  This thing wants your microphone. Do you want to allow it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The journal just pisses me off. Look at this picture they use.  This is just some people at Google I.O.  But of course, they use this picture in this article and it looks like somebody's reading, you know, somebody in a Google hat is reading your mail.  This is scummy. I'm sorry, journalist scummy.  I guess I come from the point of somebody who's technically literate going, well, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think? How would you can't you can't expect the rest of the world to be as technically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You shouldn't use computers. Just go home.  Go get your buggy with its battery powered windshield wipers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honestly, I mean, this is this is like people who, you know, when we talk about credit cards and we're like, how do they not understand interest payments?  But there are plenty of people who don't or who are in a position to not notice that.  And, you know, they are being taken advantage of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is Ernie, which is that service I talked about that you would sign up for.  By the way, you get a great benefit. They look at your mail, they look for receipts, and then they if they find a receipt, they see if they get a better deal.  They negotiate a better price for you. They share their profits.  This so when you do it, it says this will allow Ernie to read, send, delete and manage your email.  It says it very clearly. And then there's an allow button.  Stacey, what more do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that that is fine. But not everybody does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Like that. No, everybody has to. They have to access Gmail. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Well, then never mind. Gmail is fine.  It's all the other services out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's my point is that what do you want? Wall Street Journal.  Do you want me to come and hit somebody in the head and say, no, it said it's going to read your email. It says it.  It drives me nuts. And I and I what I feel bad is now that Google executives.  I mean, I don't have no reason to defend Google executive, but Google executives now have to go to Congress and explain.  Well, and Congress is completely clueless.  It's some nitwit congressperson who read it in the journal. So, God, this is terrible.  I don't know what more you could do than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google does that's actually that is exactly what I'm asking for.  Oh, OK. And I think I think even the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the eye for information.  And if I recall correctly, you can click that on the and get even more information.  I bet most people don't do that. So maybe they go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Allow, allow, allow. Yeah, yeah.  But that's we got to train users to stop doing that.  This is what Google does in order to pass a review process.  Non-Google apps must meet two key requirements accurately represent themselves.  They must be clear about how they're using their data.  They can't pose as one thing and do another must have clear and prominent privacy disclosures only request relevant data.  They should only ask for data they need for their specific function.  Nothing more. Be clear about how they're using it.  We review these applications to make sure they continue to meet our policies and suspend them when we are where they do not.  I don't know what Google could do that's better than this.  I don't know how it could be better.  If the journal doesn't like it, they should stop using Gmail, I guess, and stop using Ernie and stop using all these other things.  Because, I mean, I don't know what else you can do to make it clearer.  I don't know. It just gets me angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then that's fine. I mean, I'm thinking about the things I sign up for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, well, unroll me is a good example.  I mean, they were doing more than they said they would do and taking more of their data, your data, and they were selling it to other people.  And Google should have caught that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there isn't an audit process for something like this.  So it is unclear.  I assume they get complaints and that's when they look at someone.  It's not like there's some person who's like going through and checking this stuff.  Well, maybe there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, this blog post implied that it's an ongoing process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but is it one person looking at like 800?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Well, okay.  Joe in shipping?  So in that case, when the member of Congress writes to you, Google, you should be, you know, say that's, you know, do whatever you need to do to make it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Create an audit trail.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you could do like the FCC does and just charge people $225 to review the complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that is so terrible.  I'm so mad.  And that is so agit pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you surprised?  Are you surprised that Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not, but I don't even know anymore.  I just don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a little bit of a misleading headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they didn't review every free informal complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And if you want, so an informal complaint can be sent for free.  But if you want to make a formal complaint, you have to pay a $225 fee.  And that's the question is, does the FCC even care about informal complaints?  We know that when somebody pointed out that there were millions of spurious comments about net neutrality, including some created by members of Congress, phonily created by people posing as members of Congress, the FCC didn't really care.  So this is the change.  Currently, it says the commission will forward informal complaints to the appropriate carrier for investigation.  The carrier will underscored and italicized within such time as may be prescribed advised the commission in writing with a copy of the complaint of the complainant of its with a copy to the complainant of its satisfaction of the complaint or its refusal or inability to do so.  The new rule proposed rule, the commission will former forward informal complaints to the appropriate carrier for investigation and may set a due date for the carrier to provide a written response.  Maybe we will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So basically they're abdicating their responsibility to people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nothing new.  Nothing new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In in favor of the carriers, which is not.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Transcript:  It's not going to be long before we're Kazakhstan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It already feels like we're like, yeah, in a second world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Trump is like Trump is Dan.  So every evening for the last four months in Kazakhstan, social media websites have really slowed down to the point where they're unusable.  It's it happens for a couple of hours, just as many people are winding down from a day at work.  So it turns out the reason this is happening is because the opposition group leader, the Democratic choice of Kavakstan DVK is is getting online.  So whenever whenever he gets online, instead of just slowing him down, they slow it all down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if I can say is he campaigning or something?  What's he doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, well, so apparently he's they call him an extremist group.  He's a government for Mukhtar Ablyazov.  He appears to have only a marginal following.  This is an article from Eurasia Net has used online resources to spread the word.  He's taken to delivering political homilies through live video on Facebook often in the evening.  Oh, I see why they don't just slow him down.  They want they don't want anybody to be able to see it.  Right.  So the government even admits that, well, we slowed the Internet down when he's doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not I mean, this is not uncommon.  This is something that happens all over the world during election cycles or to prevent protesting.  I mean, we've seen it. Is it usual to be targeting one person?  No, but slowing and throttling the Internet is a time on our tradition of dictators around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't watch The Bachelorette Jerry's going online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's kind of remarkable.  It's kind of a lot of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Did that happen in the two weeks we were gone?  Billion dollars? I think it did.  I know it did. I know we mentioned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't talk about the Google game console news.  Oh, what do you think of that? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's a rumor, but we can.  This is from Kotaku, which is a gaming site.  They say sources claim Google is planning a game platform to take on Xbox and PlayStation.  The Nvidia Shield is a game platform.  Android TV can be a game platform.  The rumor is that it will be a streaming platform that includes hardware and attempts to bring game developers under the Google umbrella.  I don't know what that means, whether through aggressive recruiting or major acquisitions.  And Kotaku said this is the word from five people who have either been briefed on Google's plans or heard about them secondhand.  Is that a source? That's not a source. Heard about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe, but I wonder why would they want to do this?  I think, all right, so you want to get the Twitch audience, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They tried to buy Twitch. They lost to Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, then maybe this is legit then. Data, getting data from gamers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, they have the television platform for the next generation.  What if they have the sports platform for the next generation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True.  That was my only thought on this.  I was just kind of curious because I am not a gamer.  So I'm like, I would not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. You know, have you have you done GeForce now?  Have you used that, Kevin, on your shield?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the subscription based one where they stream the games.  I did. You got to have a fast Internet pipe, obviously.  But, you know, I couldn't even tell the difference between playing the same game on that versus my Xbox one at the time.  I mean, 1080p, 60 frames a second, and it's all coming from the cloud.  It was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was the only way I could play No Man's Sky because I didn't have a PlayStation 4.  Now it's coming out on Xbox one after everybody lost interest.  But I like it. You know, streaming games, you're right.  It's more though than just bandwidth. It's really low latency as well.  Yes.  It seems to work pretty well, but I wasn't playing a first person shooter.  So it's fine for No Man's Sky.  It was it was the only issue with No Man's Sky is that the startup time was pretty slow.  It took a while to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it still like nine bucks a month to have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I still have the membership and I haven't frankly played any games since No Man's Sky.  Probably one of many subscriptions I should probably cancel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't there a service that will like look at your credit card bill and tell you what subscriptions you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if I let him look at my Gmail email.  OK, it is. It's called Trim Trim.  I use it. Let me see Player Unknown's Battleground.  You could play Fortnite. You could play.  Let's see what the games GeForce now supported games.  Oh, there's quite a few titles. Rocket League.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not going to have every AAA title, but they add on a monthly basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Decent games. Yeah. Call all the Call of Duty games.  The Elder Scrolls Skyrim. I love that game.  It's 1080p, but that's good enough.  You know, I mean, you have an Xbox one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. It's collecting dust. Yeah. Yeah.  I bought a Nintendo Switch and that's it for me.  It's as complicated as I can get.  Yeah. Super Mario. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have that. We do not have an Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You shouldn't. Don't get one. It's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't. I'm like, Nintendo. We're a Nintendo family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It's the family thing. They can buy mine.  Oh, there you go. Work that out.  Work it out between yourselves. I'm good. We're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. I think my parents have an Xbox that they used as like a video streaming platform.  I use it for that. Way back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. My Xbox one is, you know, has Netflix and all that stuff.  But that's my problem.  I have on one TV, my nice 4K HDR in my office.  I have everything. The cube, an Xbox, a TiVo, a Fire TV, an Apple TV, Roku TV, everything.  And I can watch Netflix on every single one of them.  Even on the Switch. Yeah.  We have a Switch, but it's hooked up. It's not hooked up to my TV.  All right. Stacy, is there something you'd like to talk about today?  I have a lovely thing to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I am going to talk about something that is on sale for Amazon Prime Day  and is sufficiently weird that you guys will be excited.  I told you about it, I think, a couple of weeks ago, whenever I was last on the show,  I showed you the parts for connecting my sync to Amazon, the Amazon Alexa voice service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I did it.  Now, when she says sync, it's a sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's literally the kitchen sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Stacy, this is great.  This is the video. She shows you how to do it.  So what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, all right, it's going to be $500 on Prime Day.  Worth noting for the stainless steel.  There's two technologies here.  One is capacitive touch.  The second is the Echo.  If you are looking at upgrading your sync, I'm going to say go all in on capacitive touch.  I think it's amazing.  It means you just touch your sync anywhere on the faucet or the handle.  It turns on and off.  It's awesome.  And if your hands are dirty, you could use your elbows.  Sometimes I whack with my forehead when I'm holding a big pot.  It's very nice.  The second element is the Madam A enablement.  That, it's pretty cool.  I like it.  I wouldn't spend an exorbitant amount of money on this.  The nice thing is if you want the capacitive touch, it's only like $25 extra to get the Echo capability.  The best feature is you can say, hey, Madam A asked Delta to dispense 48 ounces of water.  That's kind of cool.  It is cool.  And my husband loves it.  I get frustrated because I can never remember the syntax.  So I'm always like, Alex or Madam A dispense 48 ounces of water.  And she's like, I can't do that yet.  So that's, you know, I did a pretty big review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need to put labels everywhere with the syntax like on your cabinets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they actually give you a little card that comes with it.  And it's like, this is your coaster for your Echo so you can see what to tell your sink.  Which I'm like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I only have one question, Stacey.  Did you, is that how your sink is underneath really?  Or did you clean it up just for the video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, I had, because I had to install something under the sink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where's the buckets, the sponges, the 15 different kinds of dishwasher soap?  What kind of sink user are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you scroll down the story and you don't look at the video, there's a picture of me with all of the stuff from the sink.  So if you, that's the inside with the even.  There it is.  There's the sink stuff.  I'm a human being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm glad to know you take off your shoes before you operate, as every good doctor should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, it's electricity and water.  I probably should have kept them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would have, I would have wear rubber galoshes.  Yeah.  No, this is good.  This is really thorough.  Well done.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bravo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Super fun.  Nice.  Stacey on iot.com for her review of the Delta Touch faucet with Amazon Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can get that on Prime Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  So what is it normally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the first time it's going to be available for sale for anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's launching on Prime Day.  It's launching on Prime.  And if you want Arctic stainless, that's 25 bucks more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a fancier finish.  It's a brushed, and I asked because I am diligent that way.  Arctic stainless looks like stainless, only there's more white and less yellow.  So it's a little bit brighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, you did the expert installation yourself.  If you had a choice, would you pay $182.75 or would you do it yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I already had the capacitive touch.  So for me, it was a simple, like you open the things.  If I had to replace a whole faucet, actually, I would just totally do it because I do everything.  I try it and then I break it.  My husband's like, oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Time to call the plumber again.  So nice.  Yeah.  Kevin, you got to pick a tip, something for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a little new feature in Chrome that kind of should remind you of Android because the same feature that Android has with the app shortcuts.  Like if you tap and hold on an Android app right now, you get these little shortcuts that will bring you to certain activities.  You can now do that in Chrome OS on the Dev channel for sure.  And one of my readers just commented he's got it on the beta channel as well.  So that's a good thing.  And it's just a Chrome flag setting.  So Leo, you could just switch the flag on and you're good to go.  Enable touchable app context menu, which is a mouthful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you have to obviously you have to have an Android app to do this.  Install. That's correct.  It's not just for any old apps.  And you have to turn it on in the Chrome flags.  In the Chrome flags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it doesn't matter if the Android app is in the shelf or the app launcher, wherever it is, you can long press and get the shortcuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When did they start rotating the wallpapers properly?  I'm just so glad that they did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With the surprise me feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, for a long time I was just surprised me gave me one wallpaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they have changed.  You even have an older version of the wallpaper.  There's a new one that's even better.  Very material design looking and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yeah, does it download new ones or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It actually goes out to a server.  They have a service that's running with it.  I think I believe it's the same.  They're going to be putting it together with the same one that the Chromecast uses.  What is it? Backdrop?  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because that, you know, by the way, can have your own pictures in that as well, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right.  So but you'll be able to get like backdrop type rotating pictures on the wallpaper,  which is weird because we really never see the wallpaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know. But notice it's now going down into the menu bar.  I don't know if that's a new feature, too, but the menu bar is not separate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are just little icons floating on the paper, which is there's a flag to have that as transparent or color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't think I said that.  So it must be. Yeah, I probably came with the dev channel.  Oh, though, that old dev channel got me in its spell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish Google, when it runs photos of things for Chrome, for any background, would tell you where these places are.  They do actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't they? They do on Chromecast.  I thought so. Mine does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What am I missing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you want to Chromecast.  When it first comes up, there's a little like MTV style little box, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mine just says who took the photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. OK, so if you uncheck surprise me, it is now saying in the control panel, this is by Mike Raifman.  But you're right, it doesn't say where.  It does give you a link to his website.  So maybe there you'd be able to see in his galleries.  So you'd at least be able to do some research.  But yeah, I agree with you. I often want to see that.  That's one thing on Windows, they have the Bing wallpaper and it does give you additional information, which is really nice.  And this is a pretty there's another pretty one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are pretty. I just I mean, like some of these places, I'm like, oh, I totally want to go for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's actually a feature Apple just added to the Apple TV.  They actually mentioned it on stage during the WWDC is now will tell you what you're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's here's the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, why don't I wonder why I don't have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's there's a flag for that.  It's got a little explore link so you can actually get more information about the picture and who took it and where it is and all that.  So it's kind of is going with what you're looking for, Stacy.  Would you know what the name of the flag is?  Uh, I think it's wallpaper picker.  Actually, yeah, just do a find on the yeah.  Yeah, do a find for wallpaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a flag for everything in Chrome.  Yep. Is it Chrome slash slash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Flag chrome colon slash slash flags.  I actually bookmark that, which is kind of silly, but you're right.  There's so many flags that it doesn't make sense to type it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Enable new wallpaper picker.  There you go. That's the that's the setting enabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice. It'll make you restart the browser.  It does. I have to restart anytime you change a flag pretty much.  It's quick. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. I already kind of mentioned my pick, which is a jump chat.  Do we want to mention? Do I want to mention this teletext?  I think it's not it's gone.  I really like this site, but I think they're gone.  T stop dot co dot UK.  I found this. I like to browse like the pin board popular and read it and so forth.  And this was really cool.  They were simulating a teletext terminal on a website, but it's it's gone now.  So I can't make that my pick everybody.  We're out of time, but we have had some fun.  Stacy Higginbotham is at Stacy on IOT dot com.  Subscribe to her free newsletter as I do.  It's a great read all about IOT.  And of course, she and Kevin do a great podcast together.
