Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good to see you.  To my right, Mr. Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com and his new book is out September 27, Public  Parts.  That's exciting.  Your inscribed copy is all in my box.  Oh, well then I won't click this pre-order on Amazon.com, although at $17, it's quite  a deal.  That's the hardcover Amazon price, Kindle Edition $12.99.  That's great.  September 27th.  Your publisher obviously knows how to use the Amazon because you've got the zoom in,  you've got the read it, you've got a video related media on the page.  You're working it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're working it.  Next week I'll put up the introduction online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you do this or does your publisher?  They do that.  Okay, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good, good, good.  You wouldn't let me anywhere near it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, it just feels like publishers do less and less these days and it's almost like  your job to publicize the book, but you've got a good publisher obviously.  That's great.  You've got to get the good publisher.  Yes.  By the way, Gina, I was unpacking my books as I move into my office and I found my complete  Guide to Google Wave autographed by Gina Trapani and that is going in a very special  spot on the shelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's Computer History Museum.  It is.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There, Leo.  I'll put it right in between the Minitel computer which is sitting right behind me, which has  just been discontinued in France and Cedric Engrand from TCI brought me that and the Amiga  1000 that we have in the basement.  And somebody's bringing us an Osborne and a 20th anniversary Macintosh.  So we're going to actually have in here a pretty decent technology museum.  That's really cool.  I'm excited about that.  Kevin Marx is also here.  Kevin is a technology museum in his own right.  He's worked at all the biggies.  Currently a sales force.  But he's worked at British Telecom previously.  Google, before that.  Apple before that.  You've been everywhere.  We just figured out though never at Yahoo or Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.  Maybe I should go and give them a call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's too late, although I understand they might be looking for a CEO right now.  I love Carol Bart's.  Even in departure, Carol Bart's manages to send a little FU to the Yahoo board yesterday  sending from her iPad and missive to all the Yahoo employees saying, I've just been fired  by phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Best announcement email ever.  No kidding.  Short to the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And just a little knife at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Little jab in there.  Nice working with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As Carol Schwisher reports out, she was the first to publish the email.  Although everybody got a copy because everybody at Yahoo got it and forwarded it on to TechCrunch  and everybody else.  But she pointed out that the chairman of the board and Miss Bart's were in flight at the  time so there was no way they could do it in person.  They were going to the opposite sides of the country.  Of course they could have waited a day or two.  No.  No, it has to happen right now.  Why did it happen so quickly and why don't they have a replacement ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because they don't have a strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The company is going to be run by its CFO temporarily but he's advised by an advisory  board of like a dozen people from all different walks of the company and of course Jerry and  David.  It's just a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I tweeted and Google Plus today, what would you do with AOL and Yahoo?  And I didn't see a single answer.  I just got a lot of jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, even I joked.  I don't know what I'd do.  I called them roadkill on the information superhighway because I do think AOL and Yahoo  both are outmoded.  It happens.  I compared it to Prodigy, CompuServe, Minitel.  Technology leaves you behind and few are the technology companies that can devise a second  act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The whole notion of a portal, the whole notion of being the gatekeeper, it ignored the end  to end architecture of the net.  It tried to replicate the old centralized architecture of media that we had and services  that we had and that's what's so fundamentally different here is that the net is end to end  and it's distributed and it's all kinds of different things that people just don't understand  and none of the CEOs of Yahoo's ever understood that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't that concern you?  These are two big content companies.  In fact, AOL is one of the few companies investing in journalism.  I guess you could call it investing in journalism.  They have an investigative journalist fund.  Isn't this not good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what Leo, I've been arguing lately, I wrote a treatise about the link  economy a while back which will really push you to sleep fast.  Arguing that we in content think the value is in the content and it's not.  It's in the relationships.  If I told this story before you're stopped, I went to lunch with the former president  of a big network news operation who said, you know, Google and Facebook and all these  companies use our steel to make their cars.  They don't value our content.  And I said, no, it's the contrary.  Mark Zuckerberg values more content than you do.  All you value is what you make.  You take all your value is encased in your content.  And he sees that there's value in content made by lots of people and he extracts that  value in a different way.  So he encourages more content for more people in more ways.  And you know, it's a fundamental architectural shift, I think, that these poor guys don't  get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they have a mind share and they have this user base.  I mean, I understand that I saw your Google Plus post, Jeff, and everyone just said, oh,  just toss AOL and Yahoo, whatever that they can't change.  They've got no plan.  They're totally worthless.  But the fact is that they're two of the biggest internet companies out there and they have  they could turn things around.  Right.  I mean, if they did turn themselves into a platform for content creation and sharing,  I mean, like the internet is one, but they have a distribution channel.  I mean, I remember the one time that a lifehacker post made it onto the Yahoo front page and  it was insane.  You know, I'd never seen, you know, that the kind of pages that we got.  I just there's a lot of power there.  I mean, it sounds like what you said, what they need is a plan and they need better leadership.  I think Ohm said that now that they fired BART, they should fire the board, you know,  kind of start all over again.  It sounds like just an issue of leadership and and strategy.  But you know, they're not totally.  I mean, they're both huge brands with huge mindshare and users.  They could do something good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny that we're lumping Yahoo and AOL together on this.  Yahoo is the one whose CEO resigned.  I mean, AOL is in a little bit of trouble with the Huffington Post, Mike Harrington  blow up.  But I think in some ways they strengthen their brand a little bit.  Well, I take it back.  They weaken their brand with the investment in the Crunch Fund.  But I think Ariana stepping forth.  This is my opinion.  I'd love to hear yours and saying we fired Mike Harrington.  He's out.  We're not going to we're not going to condense this.  Now, it looks like there's two different AOLs, but don't you think Ariana did the right thing  there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think I think I got some sympathy for Mike and TechCrunch there because lots of  everyone else is doing it, too.  He pointed to the list of investments The New York Times has in startups, which includes  automatic and John Bothwick's Betaworks and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're both invested.  They're each invested in Daylife, right?  Where I'm a partner, both The New York Times and AriaTuner invest in the same company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  You know, O'Malley runs a venture fund and a very successful tech blog as well.  So it's not like Harrington is proposing something that's completely outlandish.  It's just that his personality is such that everyone gets wound up by him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's reprehensible and we don't invest in any companies we cover, but  we do take advertising from companies we cover and some have said, well, how is that different?  I think it's this substantially different, but and it's unfortunately the way it has  to be.  You know, media, free media has to be paid for somehow.  I don't I really dislike the argument that Mike uses and some of the other TechCrunch  writers have used that as long as it's it's OK, as long as we disclose, I just feel like  there is such a thing as do you not think that there's such a thing as that inappropriate  conflict of interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think Kevin's point is that you have conflict.  Everyone has conflicts.  And the primary solution to that is transparency.  Well, I agree. You need transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But isn't there such a thing as an inappropriate conflict of interest?  And what would that be if there is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think we're trying to and I don't want to seem like I'm Mike's apologist here, but  remember how we started TechCrunch?  He was a venture capitalist who wrote about new companies to get information, to shed  information and to give him a brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said, I'm an investor and I want to know more.  And the best way to do it is to write the blog.  So from day one, he was doing this.  You're right. This is not a change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And from day one, he said, I'm not a journalist.  I talked to him at Disrupt in New York and tried to make him take on the mantle of  journalism and say, take it on and prove it, change it.  No, no, I'm not a journalist.  I'm not a journalist. Perhaps I understand that better now.  And, you know, what I think is happening here is that we're going to find all kinds of  entities that gather and share information for their own purposes and their own good  that is useful to others, for others of us to curate and link to and whatever, who in  fact are not trying to do journalism.  What complicates this is that it's taken over by AOL as Ariana is pushing that or is  taken over by AOL and then it merges with Huffington Post.  Ariana is pushing journalism, but Ariana, too, does things that people say ain't  journalism either. But in fact, do spread a lot of information.  So I think, Leo, you're right to hone in on the question of conflict.  Let's talk about that for a second.  Who's to lose more in an issue of conflict?  Right. I mean, if if David Carr or Kara Swisher, who smashed Arrington for this,  they lose credibility, they lose the key value.  That's true. But Arrington also, if he found if you find that he's basically screwing  over the people he invests in using this in bad ways, he loses direct investment.  So he has the same investment in having to hold on to trust and credibility or gain  it. I think that anyone else.  And so my only point here is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what if what if the big score is, you know, funding a startup, then pumping it  up with TechCrunch and turning it?  What if that's the billion dollar score?  That's what he has to gain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But but at some point, doesn't that bubble get revealed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, of course, it gets revealed. But by then, he's walking away with a billion  dollars. See, here's the here's my problem.  I know who stands up for the for the reader who is making a decision whether it is to  buy a product, to invest, to use a product and is making that decision based on  information that is not objective.  That now you're these guys will say, well, not nobody's objective and the reader's  competent to judge the difference and let the chips fall where they may.  It seems to me there's an opportunity then to provide information for people that's  reliable and trustworthy and not compromised by an investment in the company.  Or you're providing that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Absolutely. The question is, is that area in business or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care what Mike Harrington does.  He could do whatever he wants.  It's not my job to police Mike Harrington or Kara Swisher or Giga Ohm or anybody  else. It's my job to police my own endeavors.  And I I personally think it's reprehensible behavior.  And I think that people shouldn't read those blogs if they feel that, you know,  I guess they know that they can't trust it.  I just I know my feeling now when I go to TechCrunch, every single article, I'm  going, well, you know, I wonder I wonder who's got a stake in that pie.  Did you always wonder that?  Not as much as I do now.  I should have always wondered it.  It turns out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, they they will disclose on the on the on the post if there is a  stake. They do do that in the same way that I don't want to have to read every

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  article and parse it and try to say, OK, now, oh, this one's trustworthy.  Oh, this one's not trustworthy.  I say throw out the whole site because I'm not going to it's not my job to figure  out which articles are trustworthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but having imposed exactly the same.  They have a bunch of people posting on there.  I agree with you.  I don't read them either.  I mean, the thing is, I, you know, what do you read?  TechCrunch employs a bunch of journalists that I like reading and I'm going to keep  reading them because I respect them as journalists.  And some of them have worked other places before and, you know, moved around and  some some of them have started up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a good point.  I will read M.G.  Siegler. Yeah, I will.  And I consider that I read M.G.  Siegler, not TechCrunch.  I read Alexia and I read Alexia because I know them and I trust them.  But I'm more worried about our audience who are finding fewer and fewer venues  where they can find reliable technology information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it really fewer and fewer?  I think it's more and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I'm not saying there aren't more and more venues, but they all if they are  all compromised as everybody seems to agree, everybody's got us got a, you know, bias.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's, you know, if we get to hear from everybody, that's not so bad.  The problem before was when you only had when you actually had gatekeepers who would decide  what you got to hear.  That was much more problematic.  I think Dan Gilmore said this week is that the only gatekeeper now is you.  You get to choose which sources you listen to and trust.  That responsibility is put back on you.  You can't just delegate that to some supposed editorial board that you assume is doing that  job for you.  You've got to look at the good examine that the bias and everything you read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's a good thing to learn to do.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, and that's always been the case.  And we found that out about the New York Times.  Although you asked me a good question, Jeff, which I don't want to dodge, which is what  do you read?  And it's getting harder.  I mean, I still trust the New York Times.  I know they have investments, but I don't consider.  I know they have such a strong ethic that I don't consider that their reporters are  influenced by their investments.  And if I'm proven wrong, if I'm proven wrong on that, then I'm really going to be devastated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, one of the great ironies of this is I want to hear you answer the same question  in a second, Gina.  But of course, I'll get in first.  Is that I had a huge blow up with Arrington at the Online News Association in Washington  about five years ago when he claimed that the New York Times in a public forum there  could not possibly have been positive about a company he had written about if they  weren't in their pocket.  And I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's going too far.  And the irony is he didn't reveal at the time that his company, I forget, I actually forget  the company, was a competitor of Daylife.  And both Arrington and the New York Times had an investment in Daylife.  And I'm involved with Daylife.  And he and I really kind of came to blows and took a few years for us, not as famous  as yours, Leo, took us a few years for us to kind of make up.  And the irony is that he accused the New York Times of a level of conflict that the New  York Times has now accused him of.  And for neither is there in my mind a smoking gun.  And so I think Kevin's right here is that like it or not, the responsibility, everyone's  not just a journalist, no, everyone's an editor.  And that we all have to judge the sources.  And the truth is we always have.  We just had fewer sources to judge and now we have more.  And so now sometimes when the original company, you know, when there's news about Facebook  or Google, what do we often point to?  We often point to the company's own sites.  I guess a good job of revealing stuff in a way that we find open and trustworthy.  They get the first word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I sound like a kind of pathetic Pollyanna going, but no, but they've got to be trustworthy.  Aren't they trustworthy?  Oh, no.  Poor Leo.  I'm so depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I read TechCrunch with a giant grain of salt, especially when Arrington,  or really anyone other than MG, is the author.  And I think that at this point, most readers probably do.  I mean, we have checked TechCrunch articles in the rundown here.  I mean, I think that it's not going to be my first source of opinion and I often disagree  with them and Arrington drives me a little crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've got great scoops, though.  We can't avoid reading them because they get the scoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They report things that other organizations that have codes of ethics or lack of conflict  like the Times can't do, right?  They can get me information that the Times doesn't or can't because it hasn't been vetted  or confirmed in different ways.  So I think, I don't know, I kind of feel like this is on the reader to decide.  And I think the TechCrunch readers do know.  I mean, they do disclose right in the post, you know, in line in the post if there's a  conflict or an investment.  In this whole blow up with Arrington, I felt the people I felt the worst for were his editorial  staff.  I felt so bad for his bloggers and I think that was just me sort of.  Yeah, I think they feel pretty bad.  Yeah, they feel pretty bad right now.  Yeah, I mean, it just seemed like an epic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it's so funny because he gets fired and then he quits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Then he gets reinstated.  Well, what's the latest?  He's been reinstated?  Well, I think right afterwards he was.  Yeah, I don't know.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Ariana fired him.  But then Tim said he was still an employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he's because Tim has a 10 million dollar investment, half of the total investment of  Crunch Fund.  But that's not an editorial employee.  Mike no longer writes for TechCrunch.  Right, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Ariana threw Mike under the bus and then Mike got in the driver's seat and he  drove over Ariana.  Just so ugly.  And you saw Mike's ultimatum to Ariana.  Yes.  This is our definition of independence.  It's hard for a company to then kiss and make up when you've undercut a key executive like  that.  So it's a real no going back situation, I think, for both sides.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just ugly.  And I guess that's why we're lumping AOL with the O.  Exactly.  Because they really aren't the same situation.  I mean, AOL still has Tim Armstrong.  I think it's ironically, you wouldn't have if you've asked me 10 years ago who's more  likely to be around in 2011, AOL or Yahoo.  I wouldn't have said AOL would be the vital company and Yahoo struggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's been an epic public drama.  And at times I just want to close my eyes and just say, aren't you people all just grown  ups?  Can't you just get in a room and settle it?  At the same time that having this discussion in public, I'm sure that Jeff has been loving  it.  It's like you really get to hear all sides of it.  And I felt bad for Arrington's bloggers being like, this is the first we ever heard of  Crunch Fund was when the Times article published and we really have no idea what's going on.  But Mike started this site.  And the thing is that TechCrunch really is about Mike.  And there are a lot of things I don't love about Mike, but his passion and drive behind  the site and just his passion in general, even if it's totally wrong headed and crazy at times,  is something.  But I think it's really neat to cite what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to say the day I heard that AOL bought TechCrunch, I could see, couldn't we all just  see this day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This just like drama playing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And immediately Mike starts slamming in Gadget at AOL's number one property.  AOL doesn't defend in Gadget.  Topolski leaves.  Neelai leaves.  And then AOL sends out a confidential memo, which TechCrunch immediately publishes.  I mean the drama just builds in you.  You could just see Mike going, fire me, fire me, fire me, fire me, fire me, fire me, fire me.  And I mean it's just, I don't know what really went on.  And it's just, you know what, this is the equivalent of, you know, I don't know what,  our Paris Hilton scandal.  That's true.  Some for us to talk about.  These are our celebrities.  This is what we have for Kardashians.  This and Eric Schmidt.  Eric Schmidt was at Dreamforce, Mark Benioff, the CEO of your company, Kevin Mark's disclaimer  there, I guess, interviewed Herr Schmidt about a number of things.  And here's the segment, here's the portion of the interview in which Benioff asks Eric  Schmidt about Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When we were working on Unix in the 1980s, he's talking about Novell, his original company.  It wasn't clever enough to think of a strategy that would maintain fragmentation, avoid  fragmentation, but allow for open...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, that's an Eric Schmidtism.  Maintain fragmentation, that is avoid fragmentation.  All right.  By which I mean maintain it, by which I mean avoid it.  Model for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they do is, although Android is open source and you can do anything you want to  it, if you want to sort of use the brand and so forth, you have to be able to run the application  store.  That's the requirement.  And that's such a powerful incentive that it keeps all the people who would otherwise  go one way and the other and fragment Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like Amazon.com.  Together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So rather than using a contract, which is the old, if I could say Microsoft model, or  a no contract and hope for the best, which was an Eric optimist model, now we have a  pretty strong carrot and stick model where the people who really want the benefit of  the platform have a high incentive to maintain API compatibility.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon is doing exactly the opposite.  And he knew it when he gave this speech, I believe.  They're using Android but they're using the Amazon store.  They've completely reskinned it in this new tablet.  Which MG Siegler, by the way, got the scoop on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He got the scoop on it, right?  He was able to play with it.  He was the only Tucker Porter who was able to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Which is actually both a testament to him and to the power of TechCrunch, we should add.  But that was the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the point that Eric was making there was, I've talked about this before, I think  I wrote a post on this back in January, that Android is two things.  Android is an open source stack that is being used by consumer electronic companies to build  all kinds of things.  And Android is also the Google Apps and the Google App Store and the Maps and the Gmail  and the other pieces that Google controls, which make up a big chunk of the utility of  the experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree, but it's not much of a stick because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's the stick they've used so far to try and converge the cell phones.  And I suspect they'll be using that a bit more.  Right.  But Amazon doesn't need that, right?  That's true.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Motorola and LG and Samsung do need it, I guess.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Amazon's playing a different game.  Amazon's in a different business.  Amazon is in the business of selling media primarily.  The devices are a means to that end.  And in some ways, their tablet is more of a response to the Nook than it is to the iPad.  Because they already sell stuff onto the iPad, but they're worried about Apple taking the  control there.  So this gives them another lever here.  But so what they've done is basically what Barnes and Noble did with the Nook, except  extended a bit more.  And they've replaced more of the Google stack with their own stuff because they've got their  own app store there as well.  And they've also got their own media store that will be better integrated than the existing  Google one.  So it will make sense as an audio-video device as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Kevin, didn't...  I think the question that Leo's getting to here is, didn't Amazon just do to Eric Schmidt  what Eric Schmidt said he didn't want done again, which is fragment him?  Yes.  Use the basis, but then does Google get any benefit?  Put it this way.  Does Google get any benefit out of Amazon using Android in its tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yes, because they're still using the Android base.  They'll still be using the browser.  Google will still probably be the default search engine unless Amazon wants to annoy  its users.  So they will still be getting a bunch of the value they get.  And that's a lot of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, ironically, they get the value of the search no matter what OS.  I mean, I'm sure the Blackberry Playbook used Google.  So you don't really need Android to get the benefit there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Well, there was some people who switched...  There was a Verizon phone that switched to being just...  Big mistake.  Just to drive people crazy.  Users can switch it back.  I think broadly they're comfortable with that because it's the commoditize your  compliments thing again.  It's like, where does this company make their money?  They want to make the things that are complementary to that as cheap or free as possible.  So for Apple, they make their money from selling the physical devices.  So they want to make the content as cheap or free as possible so that they build the  app store and the original iTunes audio video store to make sure that that content is  available.  But they're happy to pass most of the revenue from that through to the publishers to get  the publishers on there.  Google cares about advertising and about searches happening.  Particularly, they really care about mobile searches because those are much higher value  searches than general searches because there's a much likelier call to action there.  So they're very keen on having that piece of the mobile devices.  And the tablets is part of that.  But I think the stress of Android is still mostly on the phone side.  And Amazon is in the media distribution business.  Originally starting with physical media, with selling books and other stuff over the net.  But now moving strongly into selling digital stuff with the Kindle and with the other audio  videos stores they're ramping up.  And now they've got their own app store for Android to go along with that.  And making that the default one on the device and iterating on that, I think, is a sensible thing.  To say, is this a fork of Android, I think that's a slight misnomer in that it will probably be one  of the Android releases.  Part of the problem is that Google doesn't actually do its Android development in public  the way it does its web kit or Chrome development in public the way Apple does its web kit  development in public.  There isn't a public source tree except when they do a release.  And they haven't pushed out the latest versions yet.  And so Amazon will be working from an older version.  But they could potentially pull in the updates into that.  And if they just built on top of that rather than actually modifying the guts of it,  that should be no more.  Here's another way to look at it.  They're not writing another device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Gary V. just put up a video minutes ago on to Google Plus in which he argues, and I haven't  watched it yet because I'm watching this, but just looking at the summary, he argues that  Bezos is the next Steve Jobs.  I think you're right.  It has the DNA to do that.  So the irony here is, did Google just help create a new Apple as a competitor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, not in the same way that Apple was a competitor.  Google benefits from Amazon doing Android-based tablets in two ways.  First, way more people are going to use a tablet, right?  Because Amazon is going to have huge reach.  The Kindle is super popular.  So moving to Android is a great thing.  Mobile searches, like Kevin said.  And even if they're...  So it sounds like they're using a fork of Android 2.2.  And they're not collaborating with Google on it right now.  But if they're working on the open source code, that means that Amazon is going to be  contributing back to that core, right?  So there is going to be some collaboration there.  So Google is going to be able to benefit from some of Amazon's work and vice versa  if they re-base their work on top of the next release of Android.  And that's all a good thing.  I mean, Google has...  There's Android and then there's the Google Experience Android.  And I think that Google's whole plan this entire time was to get different manufacturers  to install Android, even if it's not the Google Gmail, Google Market Android onto lots of devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When they count 550,000 activations a day, they don't say, you know, half of these are  Google Experience and half of them aren't.  That's 550,000, period.  They count every one of them.  And I'm sure that they'll include the Amazon tablet.  Let's listen to a little bit more.  This is Eric Schmidt talking with Mark Benioff at last week's Dreamforce conference that  was sponsored by Salesforce.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They feel like they have a choice.  And they really can.  But they also have a high incentive to stay within this boundary of compatibility.  And I think that's, in many ways, the legacy of Sun.  That these ideas were pioneered by Sun but not fully implemented at Sun.  We didn't...  We weren't smart enough to see this kind of an approach or maybe it wasn't available to us.  And I think that if you look at Android today...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, not all of the pieces were there, right?  Yeah.  I mean, one of the great things that we've seen was HTML in the web browser.  Sun didn't have that.  We were still in the motif world and all these kind of proprietary interfaces.  That made Sun so...  It made it too much its own box.  Wouldn't you say that that was a peak contributor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And HTML5 is sort of the next leveler of the frame.  Give you the numbers in Android.  Android has about 550,000 phones are activated a day.  So that's a half a million phones per day.  You can do the math.  That number has grown in four months, doubled in four to five months.  So if that continues, it'll fill the planet, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not going to continue, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So obviously it'll slow at some point.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't have a billion activations a day.  I think it's not possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Multi-platform, multi-vendor, highly competitive hardware platform,  which is what Android essentially enables.  With a lot of...  There are more than 400 vendors of one kind or another more than...  Excuse me, I should say more than phone models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, just to address that number,  Paul Therotte and I think others, Microsoft and Microsoft fans,  believe that actually what Google is doing is illegal.  They're dumping Android in the same way that  Microsoft dumped Internet Explorer to kill Netscape.  They're dumping Android to kill other phone platforms,  particularly iOS, by giving it away.  Does that seem an unfair characterization, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you come from Microsoft's world, you could look at it like that.  But the point is they're handing over control of it as well.  By open sourcing it, they're saying anyone can build this,  anyone can do what Amazon has just done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a carrot and a stick to keep you...  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are other variants of Android.  There's a build out in China that one of the social networks there  has put together because they don't care about the Google infrastructure there.  They care about their infrastructure.  And so they built another top half of Android that's based around that.  My suspicion is that Amazon-Maywell is building a device, sure,  but I wouldn't be surprised if they release the stuff that they're using  so other people can build those devices too.  Because they don't actually care that much about the device.  They care about having their store and their content on it.  And it would make sense for them to do something similar to what Google has  done with Android, say, okay, if you don't want to sign up with Google's terms,  we'll give you the Amazon Android top half on more favorable terms.  Maybe we'll even give you a percent of revenue as referral fee if you sell things.  You know, like we do for other things.  I can imagine doing something where it actually makes the person more money  for using the Amazon one than it does for using the Google one  because they're happy to give you those 4% referral fees  they give you when you sell something for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Randall Schwartz, who's in our chat room and the host of our  Open Source of Floss Weekly, in fact, he had a great show today,  if you haven't heard it yet, is in the chat room.  He said, you can't dump open source.  That's the nature of open source.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what open source is.  It's like saying that Apache open source, the HTTP server to like put IIS out of business.  I mean, it's insane.  It's open source.  The whole idea is that it's open public and anyone can use it.  I mean, it's not like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although there's some argument that the Android as  positioned by Google isn't exactly open source even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android open source project is absolutely open source.  It's true.  They develop the open handset Alliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the open source part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Open handset Alliance.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing Amazon could do if they wanted to really poke Google would be to  stick their fork, as it were, on GitHub, say we're accepting submissions from the outside  to improve this and we'll do a merge from Google when they throw their code over the wall next time.  You could quite happily do that, but the license that Android is under, they could do that.  They could say, okay, we're actually going to keep the Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it Apache?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it?  It's a mixture because the bottom half is Linux, so that's some GPL,  but the middle piece is Apache.  Yeah.  Shall I play more?  Is there more?  There are some other bits in there as well.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's keep going.  Eric Schmidt continuing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he announces the ship date of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's the next thing he's going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's many, many coming.  We have a new operating system internally known as ice cream sandwich for some reason,  which is being released in October, November.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't play coy, Eric.  We know exactly why you have a fetish for ice cream sandwiches.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What he's very excited about even more of these.  And I was thinking with this group that part of the reason that you'll want to continue  this transition to cloud computing is that your internal customers are all using mobile devices  and they want all that power on their mobile device and they can't get it with the old system.  They have to use the new cloud computing system,  which incentivize everybody to move to an HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I stepped on it, but he's saying ice cream sandwich will be out.  I think he said October.  Yes.  October, November.  October, November.  That's good.  That's 2.4.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He wants track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the actual real good tablet operating system.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because 3.1 is the current tablet operating system, honeycomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ice cream sandwich is the merge, isn't it?  Is it 4.0?  So it's 4.0.  So we're going to leave gingerbread here.  We're going to leave honeycomb there and we're going to merge them together to ice cream sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ice cream sandwich, yes.  Okay.  3.2 is the latest.  So it is.  We'll be up at 4.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I finally got gingerbread on my Motorola Droid.  So I'm not sure if that has anything to do with them buying them,  but that actually appeared this week.  So that was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I actually used Cyanogen to get to 2.3.5 and it really is nice.  It's nice.  This is one nasty side effect of the fragmentation that Google has not solved,  which is getting all of these carriers and all of these manufacturers  to get to the same version of the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they enacted that 18-month deal, right?  Where new phones have to be upgraded within 18 months of the release, wasn't there?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said it at I.O.  I don't know when that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to try to make that part of the conditions for the top half thing.  Good.  The other thing that they announced this week, or partially announced,  was that they were making the browser on Android more part of the Chrome tree.  It's WebKit right now.  It's WebKit, but they were going to say bringing Chrome over.  Chromium.  That means that it will actually go have an update cycle like Chrome does,  rather than currently where we get a new browser every time we get a new OS release.  Chrome is continuously giving us a patched browser every six weeks,  and you can choose which train you want and get a faster one.  Whereas at the moment, Android is just giving you a new browser  every time there's a new OS update, which means it's lagging a bit on some features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that does...  Yeah, and that is also driven by carrier costs and so forth,  because carriers won't push that kind of feature update without a chargeback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but if they treat it as an app, which it is,  and just deploy it through the app update mechanism they've already got...  Then it's not a carrier.  You're right. Of course not.  Great point.  Yeah.  If they can do that and get their act together on that, that would be good,  because the Android browser is now looking laggy compared...  An old compared to the iOS ones, especially the deployed iOS,  because the iOS guys do tend to update their OS a bit more.  So the Android web browser is missing some bits that the iOS web browsers have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Parse for me, Kevin, the HTML5 references he made.  Why is that important?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's important, again, because it's another standard that people can implement to.  And the value of HTML5 is obviously that you can build stuff for that  that works across multiple different devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is he implying that the app model is not the model going forward,  that the web app model is the way to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People have got bets on both horses.  We're seeing a lot of hybrid apps now.  What we're seeing is that people are using HTML5 for the stuff that it's good at,  which is expanding, but particularly dynamic layouts, text layouts, updating of content,  and then some of the rendering stuff that's there,  and then using an app layer to do the bits that only the app can do.  One of the great examples of that has been Netflix,  where they have used HTML5 UI across their entire range of playback devices,  but written custom playback code for the different video stuff that's available.  The UX for what you're choosing is the same across all of them.  And they went so far as to port Netflix to the PS3, I think,  so they could do it on that platform that didn't have a browser.  So that was that pattern that I'm seeing more of,  and I'm seeing more stuff of the hybrid apps, both for tablets as well.  One of the announcements of the Salesforce thing was the touch.salesforce.com thing,  which is an HTML5-based version designed for tablets and phones  that works across Android and iOS stuff as well.  We started to see that pattern come up more and more.  And Dionello has been talking about this too,  who's the founder of AJAXian, has been talking about this  as sort of the new pattern for app development for a while as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is exciting. So HTML5 sounds like the Holy Grail,  the place where we all go and everything's compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Haven't we been thinking that that day is almost here for about two years now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Much like the second coming of Christ, HTML5 will be here any day now.  It's going to solve everything.  Everything.  Everything, I tell you.  The second coming.  Well, I think nobody knows better than Kevin Marks  since you've been doing so much work in standards and video too,  because one of the keys to getting HTML5's acceptance is solving this video issue.  What happens when you have bracket video bracket?  Do you launch WebM?  We haven't talked to you since the Motorugal deal.  Do you think the acquisition of those patents will help with WebM?  Some people are worried about WebM's encumbrance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know enough about Motorola's patent pool.  They do have some video stuff, but I'm not sure it'll help a lot with that.  That could be because the challenge there is there is an existing patent pool  that's been fairly well organized by MPEG LA.  And so there's a potential challenge there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And MPEG LA has, I think, said that they believe that Google's  so-called open source WebM is in fact in question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not so-called open source. It is open source.  The thing is that what is not clear is whether there's actually a spec for it.  The spec is mostly run this code at the moment.  I shouldn't say so-called open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should say so-called unencumbered, unpatented encumbered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's always a debate.  And the patent stuff is a mess.  And everyone's agreeing that now.  And the challenge is, can we actually fix this?  Should these guys be spending billions of dollars on patents?  One piece that I think is, for me, software patents  are basically breaking the basic idea of what patents are for.  If you read the statute of law in the UK, or if you read the American Constitution,  the point of the patent is to promote the science and useful arts.  It's to make somebody tell you how they did something so that in future you can do it too.  Now we have another solution to that.  It's called open source.  It's actually better, much better at getting people to do things.  And the one for me that, just a couple of weeks ago,  Apple did a patent on printing without a driver.  And Google has Google Cloud Print, which is an open source project  that does printing without a driver.  And if you actually look at them side by side, one of them is, here's some code.  Download this code. Build it.  You can now print without a driver.  And the other one is, we propose a method for extracting it.  And it's like the most opaque, specious lawyer speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what does better in court, the specific code or the specious lawyer speak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, you can have software patents, but you have to produce code that runs.  That's what I think.  And maintain if it's in a repository so that at the end we've got something there.  Yes.  And then post that compared to the open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has to be an actual working method.  Just as in the original days of patent, you had to build a model.  You had to have something that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Patent, these sort of long hand wavy descriptions that have been written to be  as general and opaque as possible, shouldn't be allowed.  And yeah, maybe you should be able to patent code, but code, not, you know,  that actually has to run and is a specific mechanism  rather than a hand wavy description of an algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Schmidt did actually address this.  He said that we bought Motorola for more than just patents.  It wasn't just a patent purchase.  I'm not sure.  He's saying it's a product purchase.  Yeah, he says they're going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's excited about the product line.  Yes, they're going to spin it off.  Yeah, I mean, what we were kind of hoping for is like, oh, you know,  they're going to make great handsets here.  But the text, the story in the tech-o-media sphere was that it was about the patents,  but it sounds like he's trying to steer it the other way now.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, not spin it off.  They're going to make it an independent, you know,  autonomous venture that will continue to make great phones.  I think that's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.  Part of that is the stock market's reaction to this merger,  which is that Motorola will be a drag on Google.  So they've got to actually manage Google.  I mean, it's got to manage Motorola.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a real challenge.  It's an interesting challenge.  And I think Google has some of the same challenges Yahoo has.  And it's actually fun to watch them, at least so far, handle it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And one of the stories on the list is they're killing products and they're focusing,  which we've said for some time they need to.  Larry is doing that, it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ten products gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ding dong side wiki is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never did like that.  We did.  We hated it.  We hated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But not in all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not in all, oddly enough.  Let's see.  I'm looking for the list here.  Desktop, that's one thing.  That made me sad.  What is desktop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google desktop is an installable application.  I believe it's Windows only and maybe Mac.  But it basically indexes the local files on your hard drive.  Desktop search, got it.  Desktop search, right.  So you search and it combines desktop files.  I guess once everything you have is in the cloud, you won't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't need it.  Artvark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Artvark is dead.  Google web security is dead.  Fast Flip, I like that, is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What did Marissa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you use it, Leo?  No, but I liked it.  I didn't use any of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google image labeler.  Google notebook.  Sidewiki, yay.  Subscribed links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like Sidewiki.  I think they had something there that they missed, which was that they were actually  collating the same people commenting on the same thing across the web.  So one of the things that Sidewiki did was if you commented on a block of text and it  found that block of text on another page, it propagated your comment, which was really nice.  But that, it was opaque enough that people didn't actually use it very much.  They didn't spend the time of saying, oh, we can crawl the existing people where people  quote text and throw that into this mix as well.  So it's another one of those things that had a lot of potential but never quite fulfilled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's redundant because of Google+.  The Google Plus doesn't do that thing that you just described, but people are commenting  on links on Google Plus all the time now.  It's different, but Google Plus is much more easy to understand, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the things that I like about Google stuff is when they actually take advantage  of the fact that they're crawling the entire web all the time and use that to do something nicer.  That was something that Sidewiki did that wasn't, the Plus doesn't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is my Sidewiki.  I wrote a Sidewiki and I know when Sidewiki was launched because I wrote it that day,  23rd September 2009.  And it hasn't done anything since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can see why they killed it off, but it's kind of sad that they missed something there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also killed Photovine, which is what, 10 days old when they killed it?  Talking about infant mortality.  They killed all of the slide stuff.  I mean, this is good.  This is what you want.  Earlier this year, they killed the power meter services,  Google Health, which you put a lot of energy behind.  When they killed Wave, it was such a shock because it's so much energy behind it and  blah, blah, blah, and you're so willing to kill this.  And now they're showing, no, no, if something doesn't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're paring down.  It's a good thing.  I'm just glad that Picasa didn't get killed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That ain't going anywhere because that's so tied into Google Plus, right?  That's Google Plus' photo sharing.  Oh yeah, Picasa Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I meant the desktop.  Oh, the app.  I heard that they killed the Google desktop because everyone just keeps everything in  the cloud now.  I got nervous for Picasa.  The desktop version of Picasa because it's a really good photo manager.  It's what I use to manage all my digital photos from 1998 on.  So I got a little nervous about that.  I mean, we're going to be storing some stuff on our hard drive.  And I'm not going to upload the terabyte of personal digital photos I've taken since  1998 to the cloud.  I mean, I'm not there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But also, if Picasa Web is the cloud aspect of that, you need some client.  And I think that it works so well on Android and on Google Plus.  And then you need a desktop client.  I think if anything, its fate is protected by the success of Google Plus.  That's good.  Yeah.  I hope so.  I'm glad this is a good question.  What else should Google kill right now?  Null.  Null.  Yeah, there's no reason to keep null.  I know this pains Kevin Marks because he was big on the...  You helped do Google profiles, right?  Which went through null, didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the pain for me is what they're doing with profiles on Plus, which is making them  less general.  I don't want to rehearse the whole anonymity thing again.  But they've said, OK, we want these profiles to be across all Google products, which was  the original point of doing them as well.  But they've now said, oh, wait a minute, they have to follow these weird rules about naming  and things that work for Plus but don't necessarily work for all the other Google products as well.  So they're actually undermining the value of them in my book there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's a tough question for Kevin Orkut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would you kill Orkut?  No, I wouldn't kill Orkut.  It's very successful for the people who use it.  Brazil loves it.  But it's still got...  I don't know how many users, but in the tens of millions, if not 100 million users,  it's a decent sized social network that people get value from.  I'm sure they can be made to generate traffic and interest in the same way that you can use Plus for that.  What I suspect is they may bring more of the Plus features into it and most stuff in there.  But it wouldn't...  If the user base in the countries where Orkut is popular, it would be a really nasty thing to do to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  Unless you had an alternative that you could migrate them to.  How about Buzz?  Why don't they kill Buzz?  Why don't they just come and just delete Buzz?  Good point.  Just delete it.  Nobody will notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And now we're getting all kinds of nasty email from people who love Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no one...  That was true six months ago.  That was true six months ago.  There's no one there.  There were 10 people there who, if you said anything bad about Buzz, they'd flame you.  They were going to invade our chat room, but no one noticed.  And that was the good news.  It was really angry.  Yeah, no.  It's one guy because everybody's moved to Plus.  So I'm not even...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good point.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's an announcement that they're going to roll Buzz in a Plus or  somehow data liberation Buzz and shut it down soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Data liberation, by the way, some controversy over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've already had a liberated Buzz.  That's part of the thing you can download with Takeout.  Yeah.  Right.  But I suspect...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll take out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What they may do is migrate it into Plus.  When they say, okay, Plus is a real thing, and we migrate all the Buzz stuff into it  because it's close enough.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Base skipper says you didn't like...  Tom Anderson.  Go ahead.  Just Tom Anderson and Trey Radcliffe, I think became friends on Google Plus.  They did.  The last minute, Tom went with Trey to Burning Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just...  Tom is apparently...  Trey's moved into one of Tom's old houses.  And then they all went to Burning Man together.  That is a bromance.  A Google Plus...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boy, and Trey was teaching Tom how to take pictures.  And, oh yeah, it's just...  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of, you know, a little PDA going on there, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A social network isn't real until there's a bromance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I love Trey, by the way, and I'm just teasing him.  But actually, we tried to get Tom Anderson for an interview and he says,  he's not doing interviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He won't do them now.  He's just kind of learning to be public again, which is an amazing thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Tom, people read Google Plus, so...  Just so you know.  Let's take a break.  There's so much to talk about.  I just love doing this show and we've got such a good panel.  Of course, Kevin Marks, Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani.  We will talk about more stuff in a moment.  But you were talking about Netflix and I wanted to just say I have the Netflix  Chrome plugin installed and it looks exactly like the Netflix webpage.  I'm not sure what the difference is, you know?  I mean, but yes, this is the Chrome extension for Netflix.  Netflix streaming course, the page to look at, because this is where the action is, baby.  I was talking to somebody the other day and I said,  watch Spike Lee's do the right thing at the beginning there.  And of course he could, because he's on Netflix streaming.  $7.99 a month.  The British Office, we've been watching that.  That's fun.  My daughter's going right back through all the old Office episodes.  Oh, the Marks Brothers.  Wait a minute, what is this?  Duck Soup.  Awesome.  I know what I'm watching tonight.  They've got classics.  They've got new movies.  If you're mad as hell and you're not going to take it anymore, they've got network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My cousin Vinny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My cousin Vinny.  I saw that.  I just scrolled by.  Oh, Marissa Tomei is so good in it.  And Joe Pesci.  The Utes.  The Utes.  I just saw Videodrome.  There's a classic.  Wow, I haven't seen that in years.  I scrolled by something.  Oh, the Pixar story.  A documentary.  They're good on documentaries.  That's a great documentary.  Ed Catmull, the guy who started Pixar.  It starts at the beginning there.  And it's directed by Leslie Iwerks.  I presume that's Ub Iwerks' son or daughter.  I don't know.  This is just such a great resource.  You could spend all day just browsing.  But then the beauty is pick a movie and watch it on your Mac, your PC.  Modern TVs.  Most Blu-ray players also have Netflix built in.  Your PS3.  Your Xbox 360.  See, this is their HTML5 strategy.  It's working.  They're everywhere.  The Lion and Winter.  What a great movie.  Patrick Stewart.  Wait a minute.  Oh, this is a remake.  Interesting.  Of the course of this classic.  Who's the co-star?  It's Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart.  But originally it was Katharine Hepburn and Peter...  What's his name?  You know.  You know what I'm talking about.  That other guy.  Anyway.  I'll never forget his performance.  Yes.  Or his name.  Nintendo Wii.  Any...  Basically this is the way you bring movies to your iPad, your iPhone, your Android phone.  24 Android devices last count.  So here's how you do it.  You go to Netflix.com slash twit and you got a month free.  If you've already got it, don't worry about it.  Just tell a friend.  Throw up the window.  Run to the window.  Open it up.  Shout out the window.  I love Netflix and I want you to take it free.  30 days free.  I've been starting to go back through the old man.  Man, that's funny.  Getting ready for the next season.  Netflix.com slash twit.  Free for 30.  Tell your friends.  It is such a good deal.  This week in Google.  Peter O'Toole.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Peter O'Toole.  Oh, the Netflix is on my droid now.  It wasn't before.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  They've been...  So for update, I did droid.  Yeah.  They've been getting more and more droid.  By the way, hot droid out right now.  Droid Bionic.  Everybody's getting excited.  It comes out tomorrow on Verizon.  Four and a half inch screen.  Very fast.  Everybody's excited except now I'm thinking,  do I buy that or Sprint's going to have the Galaxy 2S  in about two weeks?  You think that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you wait for either the droid prime or the next...  You wait for the next phone that has ice cream sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody loves the Bionic.  What is it though?  It's for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess it's because you can afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He just spent a million dollars on this.  I can't afford nothing.  I can't afford nothing.  Then I say wait for my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the same shirt I had 11 years ago on a screensaver.  I can't afford nothing.  Same mug you're using everything.  Same mug.  All I got is a ZDTV, the gimme stuff.  Sprint is suing now.  They're getting involved in the AT&T T-Mobile merger.  Remember the DOJ is trying to block it.  Sprint is also trying to block it.  Of course they are.  They would be probably the people most affected by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But wouldn't Sprint want to be blocked by somebody?  And so careful what you say today because you might regret it tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think AT&T would buy Sprint?  No.  I want Google to buy Sprint.  Don't you want Google to have a phone company?  No?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's the problem.  I wouldn't ship white spaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, white space is the key, right?  A million phone companies.  Here's an interesting talk.  Long as I like talking about patents.  A couple of good stories both from FossPatent.com.  I love this because this guy is just like obsessively reading these filings.  And since no one else can understand them, it's good you got somebody  who understands them reading the filings.  According to Apple in their complaint against HTC,  they went to the International Trade Commission.  And in that briefing, it says Andy Rubin, I didn't know this,  when he was working.  Andy Rubin, of course, the guy in charge of Android.  When he was working at Apple in the early 1990s,  worked as a low-level engineer reporting to the inventors of the 263.  Are they talking about H.263?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it's just that they refer to the last three digits of the patent name.  Oh, okay, it's a patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, of the real-time API patent.  Got it.  It's a patent on Opendoch or something.  It's something like, you know.  But he worked for them when the invention was being conceived and developed.  So this, and apparently it's this patent is one of the issues  in this HTC infringement, one of the two patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is such bullshit.  Have they not read the history of Silicon Valley?  This place was actually built by people leaving companies  and starting new companies all the time.  It all started out with Fairchild, and then the guys left and built Intel,  and the guys left and built everything else.  And the entire place was built by engineers leaving  because they couldn't get on with their bosses and working on technology.  It was similar.  If you're going to say, oh, 20 years ago, Andy Rubin was sitting in the same room  as these guys who found a way to embed objects in objects,  and therefore Android should be destroyed, you are literally insane.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This total ball.  You flattened it.  Forget it.  I'm sorry I even brought it up at this point.  No, I love it.  Thank you.  That's what, that was the flaming denial I was looking for.  That is fantastic.  Foss Patents also just had an article.  Let me see if I can find it.  For Shocker.  Shocker.  It says for Android OEM.  So he's now parsing the Oracle Google thing,  including a senior Google engineers admission that he,  maybe I put a little sun code into Android.  Maybe I, what do you say to this?  What do you say to this Mr. Marks?  Here is a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was trying to read the 263 pattern to see if it actually makes any sense at all,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is probably, it's probably a very vague waste of my life.  You don't stop.  We're moved on now to this exactly identical code  in Android and Oracle's Java or son's Java originally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to at least change the variable names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't change anything, including array index out of bounds exception.  Of course, that's a logical name, but this, I mean, even the tab, even the,  this is a cut and paste because even the tabbing is identical, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, maybe that was auto pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty printed.  It could be pretty printed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty close though.  Isn't it?  What do you think?  It looks pretty, pretty much the same.  Let me go back to the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I think the reality is, is that everybody uses skills and to some extent,  material from one job and is that the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the same thing?  It's just, it's just, yeah, it's not quite the same.  I mean, copying code is not, is going a little far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Copying code is going a little far, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's not doing anything amazing.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's, it's, it's kind of obvious range check range checking code, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is that block of code?  I can't seem to find the link to that block of code.  Is that block of code the entirety of everything that was copied and pasted?  I mean, how many lines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If that's all that is, it's like eight lines.  If that's all that is, it's not much.  That's, um, this is, uh, then this is the, this is the other one.  Shocker for Android OEMs.  Google document proposes giving Motorola time to market advantage to build Android lead devices.  So this is what you wanted, Gina.  It's all your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is what they've done already.  You know, that's when they built the first droid, that's exactly what they did.  When they built the first G1, that's exactly what they did.  Right.  They've done it.  They've done this.  We will work with one developer on the exemplar phone for this release for the last three or  four years, whenever they've been doing it.  So it's not anything necessarily new.  It may make more sense for them to actually iterate with more than one developer now.  That if I was there, I'd be looking at that, but this isn't a change of practice.  And, you know, as, as people have said, you know, they have somewhat within their rise  to do this.  I think it would be, I guess that's the question.  It would be unwise of them to just favor Motorola.  That will be silly because the other guys are building great, great devices.  You need them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is the, uh, this is the smoking slide.  Nowadays it's not a smoking gun.  It's a smoking PowerPoint slide, or maybe this is Google docs.  And by the way, notice at the bottom, provide incentives, carrots rather than sticks straight  out of the Eric Schmidt playbook here.  If we give it away, how can we ensure we get benefit from it?  Do not develop an open instead make source code available after innovation is complete.  I think Google's doing that lead device concept, give early access to the software to partners  who build and distribute devices to our specification.  They get a non-contractual time to market advantage.  And in return, they align to our standard.  These are two ways to encourage, uh, exactly what Eric was talking about.  Encourage companies to keep pure Android out there.  Is there, is it illegal?  I don't even know if it's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not.  It's legal at all.  I mean, you know, it's exactly what people do with, with closed source code bases already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although it could piss off other partners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it could piss off the parties, if they're too stupid about it.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  What they, what they've done, you know, as I said, they've done this up to now with,  with some of these releases.  I'm not sure they've done it with the more recent ones.  This is when they were doing the faster iterations.  They were explicitly say, okay, we're going to, we're going to do a sprint with this  manufacturer to make sure this thing works.  So we, we've got a device that we can actually iterate on and iterate the firmware and with  other pieces as well.  And then end up with something that we can, we can show it off at the end of it.  And, you know, then they, you know, they did ones like the, the Nexus, the Nexus one,  which was, was one of these, which was done with, was that HTC, right?  And, you know, so I'm not sure it's any different than what they've been doing,  but they'd be sensible to do it with more than one manufacturer over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Florian in his, FOSS patents blog, maybe takes a step too far by saying that this  proves what we've previously suspected that the Android source code tree has private  branches.  I don't think that that necessarily is the case or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the private branch is the one that they're working on from the last release up until  today.  Until they open source.  It's private.  Yes, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's not, you don't need proof for that.  They say it.  That's clear.  Yeah, that is clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, they just magically write all the code in one day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  We'll think about it really hard for months and then that last day we'll just type it all  out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If they wrote it and wave, you could see them type it as they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the way to do it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, they, but that's the, there's this sort of private, the whole sort of notion  of branches is changing anyway.  The way you write code these days is moving towards this, the Git model where everybody  has a branch, right?  Right.  Everybody's forking all the time and then merging back.  So I think that you can defend that.  The difficulty is that the objections to the way they're behaving is that they are just  doing these monolithic releases and they're not taking patches from anyone else as far  as we know.  Unless they're doing that privately with some of these companies, but they don't seem  to be, you know, sitting there saying, oh yeah, Sanogen's done some, found some bugs  there.  We should merge that back into the tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they haven't done that at all yet.  That's interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Another I've seen.  I mean, have you seen a record of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't.  I honestly haven't looked through, I haven't looked through the open source repository,  but I just kind of, I just assumed that bug fixes were getting or patches were getting  back into the tree.  That would be a huge shame if they weren't.  I mean, that's kind of the whole point of, you know, open sourcing and to begin, to begin  with.  I mean, this part about some OEMs not being as equal as others.  I mean, this is, this is Google just giving incentives to, to release phones to their  specifications, which I think should be even tighter than they are.  Because we all want those, those vanilla phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we talked about the Amazon tablet, which is really the one to watch coming probably  next few months, but there are other new Android tablets at IFA in Berlin this week.  Samsung announced the Galaxy Tab 7.7, which Apple promptly forced them to pull from the  table.  Dual core 1.4 gigahertz processor and HSPA support.  HTC released a 4G tablet called the JetStream that is 10 plus inches, I think.  Toshiba announced a 10.1 inch honeycomb that's a little thinner than the Thrive, actually  thinner even than the Galaxy 7.7.  And then the Lenovo, which will be only $199.  The IdeaPad A1, $199.  How big is that one?  Seven inch.  You know, the, if MG Seegler is right, and I have every reason to believe he is, $250  for the Amazon and you get free Amazon Prime, which is worth $80.  That's really the price leader.  If you, if you're, if you're somebody's buy Amazon Prime, that's basically $170 tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What I so love about that, we mentioned this on Twitter, what I so love about that is it  also, it's so smart of Amazon because it also reduces the cost of Amazon shipping because  the more people buy digitally, the less they have to ship.  So they're using Prime to give a value and in the, in doing that, they're reducing the  cost structure of Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you could put it in the 7-Eleven and pick it up.  That's a good idea.  So bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is crazy.  Do you see those lockers?  They look so strange and small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a trial in Seattle.  The idea being, I guess if you're in a big city, you don't have Amazon deliver stuff  because it just sits on your doorstep where it gets stolen right away.  I don't know.  Because I, I love it.  I come to work every day.  I've got Amazon packages waiting for me.  Somebody sent me suspenders today.  Oktoberfest.  Is there, I don't know Oktoberfest well enough.  Maybe our German chatters will tell me.  Is there a style of suspender for Oktoberfest?  Because these are the goofiest looking suspenders.  Yeah, that's true.  Is that true?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Later hosing up.  Did they send you later hosing too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's no later hosing, just the suspenders.  Maybe the later hosing are coming in a separate box.  It probably has a thing here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but the thing behind it, a hunch, the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll pay to see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Definitely.  What is it?  Prosit, Prosit.  All right, I don't know.  You know what?  Let's do an Oktoberfest twig, Jeff.  We should.  We should.  We'll put a big mug in front of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll bring beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll bring beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm down for beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Anyway, this is so that if you don't want Amazon to leave something on your step,  they can leave it at the local 7-Eleven where you can check in and it'll pop it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love that the lockers have different sizes with different sized boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I take it you probably go up to that terminal, type in whatever it is,  and then it opens.  It goes...  Oh, I wonder if you have to put your pin numbers on your Amazon number.  Yeah, exactly.  And I hope Steam comes out when it opens up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And an Android powered robot arm will present you with your package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, a couple more stories and we're going to wrap it up.  I do have to mention G Drive because according to M.G.  Siegler, once again, Google may be on the verge of resurrecting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and this had to do with an issue filed in the Chromium or Chrome bug tracker.  Must have been the Chromium bug tracker because it was public.  But someone had filed an issue and said,  hey, you should add drive.google.com to the, I'm paraphrasing here,  white listed list of URLs.  And then someone else at Google responded,  took the patch, looks great to me and committed it.  And so everyone was going, what's drive.google.com,  which is not available to anyone right now.  And so now it's just this rumor that G Drive will be resurrected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be something else that's designed for in-car use.  They've already got that sort of fairly lame Android app  that is supposed to be your dashboard control thing.  I imagine they could be doing something like that.  I'd be surprised if they're bringing G Drive back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is what I love.  This is a new form of investigative journalism.  They read the code journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Read, well, this is right.  This is why Android's developed in private or the newest version of Android.  Is that you can't have civilians looking through the issue tracker.  Look at this variable.  Commit history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This proves, there's a guy, what's his name?  Florian Rawwer or something who did this with Google+.  He was parsing all the JavaScript code and coming up with features.  And Google hired him.  Oh, did they?  They did.  Nice.  Smart.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like games is launching.  There's movies going to be soon.  Exactly.  And he was right.  Yeah, with the Android market as well.  Like, oh, it looks like movies are coming soon.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there a problem with Google Places?  New York Times says it's too easy to close a store and not easy enough to reopen it.  And the number of stores have been closed on Google Places because malicious people  will come along and say, no, no, that place is closed.  But it can't just be one person that does it.  It has to be a number of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, some guy closed Google's HQ and it only took two of them, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It only took two of them to close Google?  OK, well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, somebody closed Google HQ?  Seriously?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  Just to make the points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That does make the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The drum beat is like, you know, need more humans making decisions versus algorithms.  Yeah.  Or need to make algorithms better, depending on who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something Python can't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, .py.  That .py file doesn't help on Google Places.  It's closed.  It's closed.  It's closed on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to Search Engine Land, actually according to Google,  Google's already figured it out, but it was published on Search Engine Land.  44% of searches for last-minute holiday gifts this year.  I don't know how this is another Python script will be on Android or mobile anyway.  They're expecting the total volume of all searches in the US  for holiday gifts last minute will be on smartphones.  That makes sense.  It makes total sense.  That's when I'm shopping.  Christmas Eve, I'm not going to have my laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Well, you're also in the store.  You're checking out the price.  It's price transparency.  This is another kick to the kidneys of local retail.  Yeah.  I'm reading a wonderful book right now.  Just picked up last week.  I remember the name of it now.  Getting my tablet out.  I just wanted everybody to know that I've, you know, drunk the Kool-Aid here.  Which tablet is it?  That's what I've got to do smart cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  You're a little late on the Kool-Aid.  We've all moved in.  I know I am.  I know I am.  It's a little stale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The great A&P in the struggle for small business in America.  It's reviewed the times like, well, it's wonderful that how the A&P was kind of the  internet and Walmart to mom and pop grocers across the country in the time.  And came up with all these new mechanisms of marketing and brands and  gross purchases and all that and lowered prices.  And it's just fascinating to see these waves of disruption.  What goes around comes around.  Yeah.  Yeah, la plus, ça change.  So, you know, what's going to happen next with using your phone to check on prices  is there's no price opacity anymore.  You can't take advantage of it.  It's gone.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  You basically have to guarantee that you'll match the lowest price.  You have to tell your customers if you scan the barcode or if you check online,  you get a lower price, we'll match it.  I mean, you know, to get the person to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a lot of that, though, when that used to happen was because nobody could  figure out what the lower price was.  So they didn't really expect that you would call them on it.  Now you're going to call them on it.  Now you're going to call them on it.  Right.  That may, maybe you won't see more of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But, Gina, at some point it's not even worth the effort to show them the lower price.  You might as well just click buy on Amazon.  That's right.  But also, yeah, especially if you're in California, the sales tax is 9%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon has an edge there.  That's part of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they don't.  And that's another problem.  That's one of the things that's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're trying to...  The state is saying you should actually collect the sales tax.  That's right.  In that context, it's defensible.  Somebody put it this way, was that when the internet was new,  we had this favorable tax treatment to help it not be choked.  But now it's the other way around.  The retailers are the ones who need some help  because having physical stores in your location is actually a useful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, that's part of the problem is that...  You're right, Kevin, is for there to be an uneven playing field.  That's true.  But one thing in this AMP book is that the courts favored legacy just to favor legacy.  It's part of what Eric Schmidt argues is all of our resources and regulation  go to favor the legacy, not the newcomer.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this was one example where they didn't.  It was the other way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I suppose it was the mail order example that had come before, right?  There was a deliberate effort to favor mail order early on.  In the same way that there was effort in the Constitution or shortly afterwards  to favor sending newspapers through the mail.  There was some presumption that this would help unite the country if they were able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, though...  Now, by the way, the New York Times yesterday in an editorial said that  the Amazon's no holds barred fight to avoid collecting sales taxes  is an abdication of corporate responsibility.  They slapped them around.  But I have to say, it's not completely clear.  For instance, we pay, as state law requires, use tax on our Amazon purchases here.  You know, it's in your yearly income tax for the state.  It says, well, did you buy anything online?  Pay us.  So really, the issue is only whether the retailer collects, not whether you owe it.  You owe it.  So we pay it.  We paid, I think, $6,000 last year in use tax.  And I should point out that we, as affiliates, I made...  Are you honest?  Well, I have to be honest.  You are. I'm very honest, Leo.  I have many friends who don't do that.  But this is why it's complicated.  So, okay, so the state got that use tax out of me.  And because I am an affiliate and made about $30,000 last year  in Amazon affiliate sales and paid taxes on that to the tune of about $10,000.  Actually, the state only got maybe $6,000 of that.  What they're going to lose now is they're going to lose that use tax.  They're going to lose that income tax because I'm no longer collecting affiliate fees.  And what they're going to gain is whatever Amazon collects, which,  as I note here, will not be until next year.  It's actually going to be a net loss for the state of California for some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon, though, just as trying to bribe California, they said that they would move,  I think it's something like 7,000 jobs to California.  If California delayed the collection of the state says it will generate $200 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in additional taxes.  The question is, is it really about making more money for the state of California  or about fairness for brick and mortar retailers?  And if it and I agree with you, Kevin, if it comes down to fairness for brick and mortar,  I think it's time perhaps to say, yeah, you know, let's make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, let me play the other end of it, Leo.  At some point, who says that retail is local?  Who says the state should have any call on what we buy?  The whole notion of saying that you get to tax what's bought down at the corner,  but there's no such thing as a corner store anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So have a VAT like Europe does, a national one.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then, of course, the other argument is this is a highly regressive tax,  which hits poor people harder than it hits wealthy people.  And so maybe the state should get out of the sales tax or the value added tax business  entirely. It's very complicated.  I don't think it's immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People buy more than what that's not particularly clear that one because  the sales tax has exemptions for, you know, food and necessary goods.  It's supposed to be it's supposed to be kind of a luxury tax, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, if you call gas luxury, then you're probably not really paying too much attention.  I think it's a great conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boy, is that a Californian talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need our gas.  It ain't no luxury.  My God, it's three miles to work.  And there's no transit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see the tax on gas in Europe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I know. I know.  We are we have no right to complain.  A couple of quick stories.  Reddit. I think this is great.  Reddit is is basically which was purchased by Conde Nast.  They said there was a culture clash and Yay.  Reddit is going to be basically still owned by Conde Nast,  but they're spinning it out as a separate company.  And I think that's fantastic and good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm my old boss, Steve Newhouse.  Smart man.  I worked for Steve for for almost 12 years.  And to his incredible credit,  Steve understands interactivity online, understood it before most anybody.  He beat it into my head that he understood that this was really a place to talk.  And people talk about high school wrestling and all kinds of stuff.  So he really respects all that.  And that's why he bought Reddit, because he he understood how great it was when he wanted to get.  Funny thing was, Steve was also Steve.  Well, I don't think I'm telling any stories out of school here.  Steve, when Facebook started,  but when it was just at Yale, he said, this is going to be huge.  This is big.  And Steve was he was a or started at Harvard and Steve was a Yale.  And he wanted to make contact.  And I tried as an executive in the company to get in contact with Facebook executives.  And I met what's his name?  The scorned friend.  Oh, yeah.  Severin Severin, Edwardo, Edwardo.  And I tried to say, you guys really want to talk to this big deal media executive?  And no, he can help you out.  I could never get any contact back.  Never.  And so Steve was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why Eduardo was forced out, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the same thing happened with with with Dig.  Steve saw the value of Dig and he couldn't get a piece of Dig.  So he saw Reddit and he said, I'm going to grab that smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When he bought Reddit, by the way, and read it one dig, dig is dead practically.  When when he bought Reddit in 2006,  700000 page views a day, which fairly small.  Now it's that much in 15 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what's interesting about it is that it is is that it is open source  to the extent that you can run.  It's federated in a way, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we have a Reddit.  We have a Reddit for TNT, our new show.  So we have our own.  What is it?  TNT dot Reddit dot com.  So we have our own something like that.  We have our own Reddit.  I've been thinking about doing that for the other shows.  I mean, that's so cool.  And you can do the up down voting and everything.  I'm watching carefully to see how that works for TNT  because I think it's a great idea.  I think it's a great idea.  Suggested user list.  You want it?  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where is it?  I can't find it.  I don't know where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't see it unless you're new to Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're all on it.  Are we?  I think all of you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know Gina is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina and Leo are, I think.  I'm sure.  So I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think if you go to plus dot google dot com slash follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jack, we'll be on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not follow.  Maybe suggest.  I went to it once.  If you look at all the threads about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I looked at it quickly and I didn't think we were on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're in tech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You two are.  I think Gina is.  I know Gina is.  This is the thing that killed Twitter, by the way.  I think.  It's what made Ashton Kutcher and his ilk superstars on Twitter.  We've got a Playboy Playmate on this, right?  So it's pretty clear that Google's going for the gold.  When you do that, Paris Hilton is on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Violet Blue, who they blocked for having a non-real name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Violet Blue really on it?  That's hysterical.  Yes, Violet Blue is on it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's weird because the suggested user list really benefits new users,  but it can mess with the community in general, right?  Because you have that.  That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's better ways to do it.  The problem with new users, I'm sure you've all heard this people.  They join Google+, they accept our invitation, they get in there, they eat crickets.  They say what?  I hate it.  They need a starter kit.  But to me, the starter kit should be shared lists.  I should be able to share a circle of my recommended people.  I have in the list there's a guy named Ralph Rotman, who's a German,  who did really nice service.  You'll find it there under the G Plus list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's the suggested user list that new users see.  Nobel Laureate, Muhammad Yunus is on it, right next to Paris Hilton.  I like that juxtaposition, by the way.  Then Mark Cuban.  Stephen Levy is there.  Do I have to write a book about Google, too?  Yeah, Stephen Levy, but not Jeff Jarvis, Taylor Swift, Tom Anderson, Thomas Hawk,  Trey Ratcliffe, Tom's boyfriend, and notice by the way, no Mark Zuckerberg,  Richard Branson, who's only posted three times, Ashton Kutcher.  Oh dear.  And by the way, Bradley did post on Twitter saying if you have more than 100,000  followers on Twitter, let me know.  Let's go to technology, which you have to scroll down, see we're at the bottom.  There's Veronica, Vic, Tom, Tim O'Reilly, MG,  O'Malley, Mike Elgin.  It's kind of the obvious.  I don't see everybody.  I don't see every.  Oh, how about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, with organic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's in news?  See, this is what's wrong.  Oh, by the way, fun and interesting.  April Summers, play by playmate.  I actually had to create a special sexy circle for her and Jesse June.  Hey, you know, it's my job.  Photography is a tough one because there's so many good photographers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, so the thing is that this is misguided is that actually plus isn't as good  for famous people as Twitter is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they want it to be.  Oh, you mean the functionality isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because if you follow a famous person on plus, you get sort of invaded by their  followers, right?  Which is the same problem we have with bars.  And if you follow Leo and accidentally comment on one of his posts, your inbox is spam  forever.  And plus still has a lot of that problem.  And it's something that Twitter actually gets right in that because every post is the same  level, but also because you don't get to see comments on something on somebody else's thing,  unless they they're sharing with you too, you don't get this sort of weird effect of one  person be able to take over the conversation that you get with classic mailing lists and  things and plus inherits that problem.  And that's something that they're going to have to iterate on before this actually makes  sense for celebrities.  And Neil Gaiman wrote a good post about this a month ago or so when he when he left plus  for this very reason, because he can happily flirt with his wife on Twitter and have a  million people watching him without it being annoying for him.  But more importantly, that being annoying for us who follow because we don't get all  the little silly responses that he can see if he chooses to.  They don't get inflicted on us.  So there's a bunch of stuff that is possible with Twitter because in some ways, Twitter  is optimized for bantering in a way that the plus isn't because plus tries to let you  post these sort of essays in there.  It means that you're always at the mercy of the person who wants to write the longest

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  post that Conan O'Brien puts his TV studio on Airbnb for one dollar a night.  Cozy and charming one bathroom studio celebrity, grace sleeper, sofa and a 40 ton industrial  air conditioning system, a kitchenette with its own intern, 25 LCD televisions, but no  HBO and a shower, although that has to be shared with guest bands.  Only four nights are available.  Do you think anybody's actually?  Yes, I think they actually are serious about this.  They're asking you to email team Coco saying why you'd like the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should go and do a share that layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love to do that.  It's only it's in Burbank.  I could get down there for that.  I think that's hysterical.  Triple X domains go on sale Wednesday.  Anybody buying one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a straight line for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Public parts dot x x x.  Groupon's putting off its IPO saying the stock market sucks.  They're never going to get up.  They're never going to get it off, are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it was that's been a one company bubble since the start.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the memo that the CEO wrote.  The private memo during their quiet period that somehow leaked out.  Debunking all the people who were saying bad things about Groupon.  I thought it showed spunk and I hate spunk.  All right, we're going to get our tip, our number and our tool of the week.  But first a plug, just a brief plug for NewTek.  Do some great NewTek transitions.  This is the video switcher that we use, the incredible TriCaster 8500 Extreme.  We're TriCaster powered.  Couldn't do it without them.  And we have just gone out to our designer to get some motion graphics design and double boxes.  And we're going to you're going to hate this.  You're going to hate twit by the time we're done with this.  There'll be things flying in and out and over and around.  Tart it up.  We're going to tart this place up like nobody's business.  You heard it here first.  You're going to hate twit.  Thanks to NewTek and the TriCaster 850 Extreme.  No, actually, we love it.  And if you are if you're looking at video production, people ask me all the time.  Do look at the TriCaster.  It is amazing.  New get NewTek.  Any WTK dot com slash TriCaster.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, Gina Tripani and her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually have a quick plug for something that Jeff and I worked on.  It's a book called End Malaria.  If you go to End Malaria day.com.  We're doing it.  It just went on sale through Amazon.  Seth Godin's Domino Project.  It's twenty dollar book.  Twenty dollars goes to Malaria.  No more, which is an organization which buys mosquito nets for folks who need them, which  prevents the spread of malaria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A cheap, inexpensive thing you can do that saves lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's got and it's a great book, too, which is I just got my copy yesterday.  It's a collection of essays.  I think it's 60, 60 writers, including Jeff and I.  Jeff did a great essay about beta think from people like David Allen and Dan Pink and Kevin Kelly.  So it's a really good book to begin with, but also twenty dollars of the purchase price,  which Amazon subsidized, is going to go to Malaria.  No more.  So check that out.  Buy a few for your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  End Malaria day.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  And so my real tip is that Google Voice, the data liberation front at Google has gotten its pause on  Google Voice.  So you can now take out your data from Google Voice.  If you go to, I believe it's google.com slash take out, which you should visit if you use any  Google products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Fitz did a great video here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So funny.  I swear to God.  So this was a little bit controversial because some people were saying, well, isn't this an  invasion of privacy?  I don't think so.  If you leave me a voicemail message and I want to download it, big deal.  It's, you know, I mean, you left it with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you left the voicemail in the end.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Jesus, what drives me nuts.  You could already right click them because they were MP3s.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So really, come on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you go on a Google take out, you can choose Google Voice.  You can export the MP3s and the transcription files.  I did it.  I had like 40 megabytes of Google Voice messages.  So it's just good to know you can get your data out.  I love it.  Great tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great tip.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google, this will go to Kevin's heart, says that Gmail is 80 times greener than in-house  mail.  And I hate to think how much greener it is than real mail because the cloud is greener  and better.  And having all these computers doing too little in too many places is using too much power.  And they say that on YouTube, for example, a play a minute of a YouTube video comes to  0.0002 kilowatt hours of energy.  And so you'd have to watch YouTube for three straight days for our servers to consume the  amount of energy required to manufacture, package and ship a single DVD.  Wow.  So the cloud is not white.  It's green, right?  It is green.  See?  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a post about this a couple of years back because somebody said that doing Google  searches uses as much energy as boiling a kettle because every query you do touches thousands  of servers.  Well, except that those servers are also serving several million other queries at the same  time.  And then if you actually did the math, if you just held your breath while doing the  search, you would save enough CO2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So everybody who wants to be green, hold your breath when you do a search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish Google searches were faster.  Which it works for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  Speed is good.  I want to mention as my tool of the week.  Now, Gina, please don't take this wrong.  I love to do dot text.  It's fantastic.  Everybody should go to to do text dot com.  A great, very straightforward command line based to do thing.  But I'm wanting some way to integrate with Google tasks because Google has a to do list.  And I found a really good way to do it on an Android phone.  It's called Astrid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Astrid is great.  It's got lots of features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want a feature, it's free.  They do have a power pack for $4 and a locale add on for $1.50.  But one of the things I like about it is Astrid.  And you could put this into a to do text.  Astrid says things like, come on, let's get something done.  The notifications in Astrid are fantastic.  They really make you want to do the thing on the to do list.  Great announcements.  And most importantly, I think which is fantastic, is it ties into Google tasks.  So finally, you can sync your Google tasks and get it into Astrid.  And you can dictate.  By the way, it takes voice dictation as well, which is I think great for to do lists.  A-S-T-R-I-D.  If you're not using to do text, this is another good choice for Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Astrid has tons and tons of features and it's got a cute little mascot.  So to do text is super stripped down by design.  But for anybody who really wants more features, Astrid is definitely the way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  To do text is if you like, keep your fingers on the keyboard at all times.  Right.  And there's a great Android version, which I purchased and I love.  This is more like, yeah, this is kind of crazy, personality driven.  It's got a widget.  If you buy the Power Pack, you can speak your to do's, which is fantastic.  And I do think the fact that it syncs to Gmail tasks is huge.  Great.  Yep. So that's my tool of the week.  Thank you so much, Kevin Marks, for being here.  Kevin works for Salesforce.  I think we could say that now.  He's also at Kevin Marks on Twitter and Kevin Marks on Google+.  You're on Google+, right?  Yes, yes, I'm on Google+.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't actually post much there because I find it not as useful as writing a blog post  because you can't actually indent anything or put links anywhere in it.  So I don't write much there, but I don't write much on my blog either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.  And by the way, you have a 2009 blog post, our chat room is so good,  called Hold Your Breath While Googling to Save the Planet.  You thought of this years ago.  Years ago.  I love that.  Thank you so much for being here, Kevin.  We really appreciate it.  It's always great to have you.  I always enjoy it.  It's great fun to talk to you guys.  Thanks.  We should make him a semi-regular, I think, really, because he's so good.  I think he already is.  He really is.  I kind of am.  I like him so much.  We love having him on.  In fact, when he's not on and we're having a discussion that he has an opinion on,  you'll see him in the chat room going, let me talk, let me talk.  Which I actually appreciate.  I love it.  Jeff Jarvis, his new book, Public Parts, is out September 27th.  Go pre-order it on Amazon.com.  Both Kindle and paper versions, and I hope audio versions soon.  Will it come out day and date on the audio?  I believe so.  Oh, that's great.  Very good news.  Yes, buzzmachine.com is his blog.  And finally, Gina Tripani at smarterware.org.  That's her blog.  She also writes for a lot of other great sites,  and occasionally on Google+, as well as Gina Tripani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great to be here.  And malaria day.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And malaria day.com.  Yeah, by the way, they were telling me in the chat room that Google Docs was down.  We use Google Docs for our show notes, and I had been using it,  but I just noticed it is down.  So I don't know how long it will be down for.  What is the dashboard for Google's uptime Google server?  I could probably Google that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can see you guys.  Can you see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is this because people are asking for Google Docs offline and they misunderstood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Google Docs offline started to roll out this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe there's something going on there.  And it just was very slow.  I think it just came.  No, it's just very slow, maybe.  Anyway.  Google.com app status it is.  There we go.  And what does the app status say for Google Docs right now?  It says service disruption.  Service disruption.  It's official.  You saw it here first.  Thank you, everybody, for joining us.  We do this show every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.  That's 2000UTC at twit.tv.  Check out our new website.  We appreciate the feedback on that.
