Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello, everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good to see you.  Professor Jeffrey Jarvis, the Leonard Tapp Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the  Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York is also  here.  BuzzMachine.com is just down the road a piece from Bedminster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I know when there's a disturbance in the force.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see Tim Cook's helicopter come in a couple of days ago?  Oh, no.  Yeah, he had dinner.  The funny thing about Tim Cook, this is actually a good CEO move.  He went, had dinner with the president at the golf course and explained to him that  tariffs would hurt Apple because their number one competitor Samsung doesn't have to pay  them.  But Apple would starting September 1st on a few of their products and by December 15th  on all of their products.  And the president said, oh, that's a good point.  I'll think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never mind.  I'll think about it.  Gun control.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  You know, I don't know.  I'll think about it may not mean anything.  They may actually.  We don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So did you watch the show Borgon or as they would say it there, bun?  Bun?  No, what is bun?  No, what?  It is.  It is a magnificent show about a woman who becomes the the Staatsminister, the prime  minister of Denmark.  I want to start a popular movement to get a sequel on just to have her deal with Trump.  Brilliant.  It's a brilliant show.  You know, Denmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, there is some strategic benefit to buying Greenland.  For sale.  Well, everything's for sale if you offer the right price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Twenty years from now, it's going to be prime farmland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's one good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's all going to be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you may note if you're watching the video that there are a surprisingly large number  of uneaten sweets in front of me.  Leo can't eat them.  And there is the number three for the 13th birthday of Stacey's daughter.  No, this is the technically the third exactly when we moved in.  Right.  Is that right?  Third anniversary of our move into the East Side Studios three years ago, which if my  calculations are correct means we have seven more years in the lease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're like Howard Stern counting down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, so we're celebrating.  We have a little party.  You can now ignore all those sweets, but you can't ignore that sign in front of me.  I just thank you, by the way, to Jason Howell for filling in for me last week.  Stacey's trying to read the sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, it's a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it says.  It's a podcast.  I was at a big podcast, the big podcast convention in the U.S.  in Orlando all week long, unfortunately named podcast movement, but it was a fine  movement and one of the things that people were saying is you can, you really  should call it a podcast.  15 years ago at the first podcast expo, I beseeched my fellow podcasters.  Let's please, let's not use Apple's trademark in this name.  It won't always be on an iPod.  Someday you'll be able to get shows elsewhere.  Somebody will invent something like YouTube.  I think I was right, but boy, nobody took up my suggestion of netcast at all.  In fact, one of the things I kind of am happy about, and I apparently, according to  I think it was the daily news, I can thank Conan O'Brien for this.  Everybody knows what podcasts are now.  So I can say I'm a podcaster and people don't go, what is that?  And we can call our shows not netcast because no one knows what that is.  If I say I'm a netcaster.  Are you changing your label?  Even the show will now say instead of netcasts you love from people who  trust podcasts you love.  Holy Hannah cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know I've given in a thousand episodes later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks to team Coco.  We now know podcasts exist.  So it's a podcast.  I feel so relieved.  Even though you can listen to it on your Echo.  Is that a podcast?  You can watch it on YouTube.  Is that a podcast?  You can even in some cases, listen to podcasts on the radio.  Is that a podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Dave Weiner and inventor of this doesn't like the term either.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one likes it.  In fact, Apple at one point was, uh, was going to, it was suing companies with the  word pod in their name, including podcasts.  Yeah.  The cover of variety Conan O'Brien, the podcast revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, this is a story from like recently today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's on the cover of variety magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it says and other top hosts though.  You're a top host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Audio boom, audios back, baby.  Audio boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like, I like podcasts.  Like the phrase, I like the word podcast.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's humble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's humble.  And it's, it's nicer than like radio show, which is basically what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, it's a radio show.  It's a, well, there was a guy.  It's so funny because what goes around comes around, uh, from Edison  research, Tom's a great guy, very smart guy was talking about his research.  And even he, at the end of his talk, the keynote at one of the  keynotes at this event, the podcast movement, uh, said it's a show.  Which is actually accurate.  It's just a show.  Yeah.  You know, it's, it's a show that doesn't come through an antenna,  but there's still a show.  And so anyway, it's a show.  It's a radio show.  I think you're right.  We do video.  So we're kind of like a radio, a TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe you should call it a netcast because it's going to come over the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I wanted to call it an act.  There was two reasons.  It was on the internet.  That's how we distributed you.  Yeah.  And it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As long as you did a blog, it's not a vlog.  I never liked blog.  I hate blog.  I hate blog.  I tried blog.  I told the blog to be, of course, I'll go Jeff.blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say one of my favorites is what is that?  Neil Patrick Harris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, a blog.  What's his name?  A Dr. Horrible's musical.  I can't remember.  He called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He talks about his blog, right?  Yeah.  Or he may even call it like a video blog.  God only knows it was a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dr. Horrible's sing along blog.  It was called.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need to show that to my daughter.  Oh yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That now is lost in the mists of time too, by the way.  That was the other thing I realized when I went to this podcast thing.  Nobody knows who I am.  Nobody knows what the, you know, the early days of podcasting might as well be a Blinken.  It's like, it's complete.  These young people have, you know, they don't know any of this stuff.  Adam Curry, who's that?  They don't know any of this stuff.  So it's fine.  I don't mind.  I don't care.  I'm happy.  We like our little show, don't we?  Whatever you want to call it.  We're glad you're here.  We're going to talk today about Google and Facebook and media and news and all of that  stuff, because that's what we do on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And audio is okay.  Audio is great.  The Telegraph had a story this week that the end of audiobook snobbery as scientists find  reading and listening activate the same parts of the brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been saying that also because I used to do the audible ads and I'd say, I read a  new book and people say, you didn't read it.  You listen to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said the same words.  I hate that when the on the audiobook, they say, well, in this audiobook, no, it's still  a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can say they can call it a book.  Yeah.  I don't like, I don't like audio books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're too slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can speed them up.  You just beat them up.  The problem at all.  You speed them up.  Yeah, I know.  Really easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it sounds okay after a while.  I have to, but then I have to work harder.  When I read a book, I don't feel like I'm working.  I'm the only person on earth who doesn't want to speed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like I'm working.  Oh my gosh, Jeff, it hurts.  I feel like I'm reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I'm working.  I never listened to the daily and I happened to turn on that.  I was playing with my Android audio because it got new.  You mean with Michael Barbera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He speaks so slowly.  Slow.  Yes.  This is Michael Barbera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've done the Bob and Ray routine on the show before.  Yes.  The slow talkers of America.  So I was also reading some papers from a 2013 paper from the journal Book History.  Talked about the book after Edison.  I know everyone thought that it was going to be going to be, everything was going to be recorded.  And the New York Times talked about how it was bottled speech.  Oh my gosh.  Bottled up for future use.  Oh my gosh.  Audiences would be able to purchase bottled orations and bottled sermons.  Sold in court bottles for 50 cents a piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a bottle cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now we have the name.  The man of taste would have a well-stocked oratorical seller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  It's on my, uh, oratorical seller phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish we had Mark Twain's actual voice.  So that is, it is an interesting watershed, isn't it?  James McWhorter talks about how everything changed with Edison's recording.  It's the first time a human voice had been recorded.  We know what Edison sounded like, but nobody prior.  And we don't know what Lincoln sounded like.  We prefer descriptions.  We don't know what he sounded like.  Uh, by the way, Stacey, you'll be happy to know this was from the Edison  research talk, uh, at podcast movement.  Uh, he compared people who've been listening to podcasts for a long time.  He calls them veterans with people who are just new to podcasting.  He called them rookies.  30% of rookies listen to podcasts at a higher speed than nominal.  Only 20, only 20% of the old timers do.  Have you tried it, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I listened to, I mean, I listen at 1.5.  I mean, it depends on who's speaking to.  I'm a slow speaker.  I, I, it's amazing how you get used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't, I mean, like, here's why I don't like it.  We'll get people visiting.  We have some nice visitors in studio today who have never listened to this  show, uh, at normal speed, Najee Ramon and Dana.  And they think we're being really slow now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They think we sound drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They think you all sound like Nancy Pelosi.  What's wrong with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all talking like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Jeff can apparently speed up quite a bit.  I don't think I can.  Maybe it's cause I'm from the South.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You, you, yeah, you got the y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, people, people in the South, they think I speak very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you a New Yorker?  Why are you talking so fast, Stacey?  You also have fewer syllables in your words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm, I'm, I have to go through actual thought here to slow down.  If you got me at normal speed, you're not thinking when you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  talking at normal speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  I have to think about slowing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you force yourself.  Oh, I do too.  Yeah.  Oh, I have that same exact problem.  In fact, the only time I've ever recorded an audio book, audible, let  me come in and record a short fairy tale.  Uh, only one I'm going to, but that's in my future.  Cause I would love to do audio, but you should do lots of them.  Yeah, I would love to, but, uh, I don't have time right now, but the one note I  kept getting from the producer who's sitting over your shoulder is slow down,  slow down, slow down.  You're speeding up, slow down.  Cause I, I try to get it's you and me are, I think are the same, Jeff.  We're trying to get all our words out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other thing you could do is you could volunteer for learning ally, formerly  known as recording for the blind and dyslexic.  Oh, I would do that.  It's a very good cause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you?  My, my mom's aunt or cousin, I can't remember, did it.  And so she had me go in and read at one point long, long time ago.  But yes, I, I too would like to do like audio work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could put it in a cork bottle.  Yes.  My oratorical bottle.  Oratorial oratorial bottle.  There we go.  Uh, I, yeah, I, I, I love reading out loud.  I did it to my kids.  This is why I think audio books work because it wasn't the first book you  ever read read to you by your parent.  Yeah, of course.  That's how we first read is we were read too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't love the idea that it changes the definition of literacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's true too.  Anybody can listen to a book.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So are we going to talk, we should talk about Google.  I actually have talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cause Stacey wants to go make some sticky rice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mango sticky rice and apple crisp.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Okay.  This maple caramel sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So delicious.  I have a Google story, but I don't, I bet it's not the one you want to talk about,  but I'm going to mention it because I put these nest cameras up.  There's two in our studio and then I have around our house.  We have nest cameras.  All of a sudden I have a big bright green light on all of them.  Nest.  I had them all turned off.  Uh, Google has decided for privacy reasons that all nest camera lights now  must be on.  You cannot turn them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm okay with this.  I guess.  Yeah.  Because, but, but, but my, I think my security cameras, I don't want bad guys to  know they're on camera.  I don't know what's, yeah, I don't want them to know where the camera is so  they can disconnect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if your camera can be disconnected that easily,  well, all cameras can, it's, you just take scissors to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, so, you know what they do in the movies, they take a spray paint and  they spray in the lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can see most of the cameras anyway, if you're looking for them, right?  Unless you're actively hiding them in the green light, them away.  I'm not.  I mean, the flip side is as someone who thinks about privacy and things like  that, and there's still tons of spy cameras.  So this doesn't solve that problem.  But Google's trying as an industry, a player in the industry to say, Hey,  here's a best practice.  It's also because Congress sent them that lovely letter saying, Hey, what about  that secret microphone you had in your products and what other privacy  violating things?  So Google's like, Oh, okay.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get it.  So in settings for Nest cameras, this should have been the change log, but I,  but I, I'm leading with it because it plucks the hell out of me.  In settings for Nest cameras and Nest Hello, you can no longer turn off the  status light, you can dim it, but it doesn't get very dim and it's bright green.  So especially at night, those security cameras, they pop out at you.  You know where they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now some people will put tape over their camera lens or their laptop.  Some will put it over the indicator light on the camera.  I could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was actually, so I will say when Eero launched that feature, and I don't  know if they're still an advertiser or not, but when they launched that feature  where it dimmed the little led on the, oh, it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I turned them off.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Who, everything that has LEDs, you should be able to turn the lights off because  they're often in bedrooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, who's put it, you don't put your IP camera in your bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but a beacon, but I have an Eero beacon near our bedroom and I don't  want that light.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that makes sense.  And I turn off all the lights or I stick things over them, tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You end up taping over it, which is fine, but it's, it's kind of ugly.  It should be, I mean, it's a reasonable thing to put us off for setting, but  anyway, all right, that's just my pet peeve of the week.  Okay.  You have it off your chest.  So while we're talking about it.  Yes, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can talk about the Google Nest home migration, which is coming  rapidly August 31st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's happening kind of as we speak, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes.  So it's an option now that you can do it.  Kevin actually did it.  And I put a link in the show notes to Kevin doing it.  Give us the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you bought a Nest device, it used to be Works with Nest was the thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  So back in May, Google said, Hey, we're going to kill our Works with Nest  program.  And instead of Nest having its own, all Nest devices work through the Nest app.  And Nest kind of is its own, call it a brain.  It's its own brain.  Google has decided Google home is now going to be the brains for Nest.  So all the commands that Nest devices could usually like send out to the  internet and do now all that's going to go through the Google home devices.  And Google did this till kind of locked down its ecosystem, make it a little less  confusing.  It makes a lot of sense, but people were really upset because if your Nest  thermostat, for example, if you have like an ift setting where when my Nest reaches,  I don't know, 77 degrees, turn on a fan.  Now your Nest can't tell that to ift.  If it, you would have your Google home say that to ift.  Is that an ift issue?  Well, no, no, no, that's how this program is designed to work now.  So basically it cuts down on the number of integrations that Google has to worry  about and manage like all these third parties with your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you'd rather do, you'd prefer to do it directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, let me, I don't because I'm going to have to rebuild everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's one, you have to redo everything.  But isn't there a convenience to having a third party like Nest, like if this and  that, because you can do more.  Yeah, well, you can have cross-platform integrations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And you can still have that.  It's just going to, Google gets more control over who gets access to certain  triggers in the Nest devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a privacy thing again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's both privacy.  It's also data security.  It's, it's preparation for the coming lockdown.  It's clear that Google thinks that people are going to, that Congress and regulators  are going to be paying attention to this.  And also it's kind of a best practice.  I mean, being able to really easily see who's got access to your data, makes a lot of  sense. And I'm talking about as a company who provides access to like consumer data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Completely agree.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's also, it's also harder nowadays to make your own IFTTT triggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's, that's a combination of IFTTT and third parties.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there, yeah, there's a lot happening here.  If did send out a thing saying, Hey, if you have Nest integrations that you like, do not  sign over.  And this is the thing.  Don't change over to a Google account from your Nest account, unless you are really  prepared to move forward.  There is no going back.  So that's one thing you need to know.  This is going to break your integrations.  So you're going to have to redo like the things with Madam A, your Amazon Echo.  If, if doesn't have an integration right now, so you can't do anything with that.  So, and it's also going to break some of like the other direct works with Nest  integrations, like with Hue lights and that sort of thing.  So you're going to have to redo a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In case you haven't noticed Stacey is an IOT expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, she is the IOT expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And has a strangely elaborate IOT setup at home.  Have you migrated most of that stuff that you had in Austin to Seattle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't.  This is like my own personal like guilt is I don't need a lot of it.  I don't want a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so funny that you say that because I put in Nest thermostats and all that stuff.  And then I moved and that they sat in a box.  I never, I just like, yeah.  And same thing with Hue lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I have, I don't even have like, and there's a lot of things in my house.  I don't have like, I don't have a doorbell at all.  What?  Well, I know I'm like, what happened on Halloween?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want anybody coming over.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, Oh, I should get a ring and just put it out there.  But I'm like, Oh, you know, in the last two months, people knocked.  I've got a dog.  She barks.  I know when people are at the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, and I have a ring, but I've been thinking that since I have so many  Nest things now and Google assistance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Nest hello doorbell is an excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it good?  Should I get a hello instead?  I'd have to take the ring out.  See, this is the whole problem with this whole IOT thing.  And if I moved, I'm not going to bring all that with me.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I left, I left a huge chunk of my stuff, but yes, I will say you open your

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  blinds with a string now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, yeah, I do.  Wow.  Now you're ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's rough.  You're ready.  I am renting.  So there is a good reason for that.  Maybe when you buy, you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I buy, I will.  The first thing I'm going to do is install Lutron switches everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I bet you, Andrew, your husband is very happy right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's actually a little frustrated because I don't have it's an old house.  So we have like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't have you have to have the weirdest light turn a knob to get  your faucet to come on like a savage.  I have this sitcom vision of Stacy sitting there telling them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  shades to go up and getting madder and madder and madder and screaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's up.  She's up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then she goes over.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not you, Jeff.  I don't get that angry about things.  I'm like, I have a pretty high threshold about that stuff.  But yes, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She used to folks wave at her kitchen faucet and if water would just come out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I touched that.  I had missed my touch faucet.  Like nobody's business.  I actually was like, I was ready to pay $500 and install it in my rental house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you have the one that you could touch a button that would like would say  two cups exactly would come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I could, I could tell Madam A to dispense two cups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dispense two cups of water into my hand, Madam A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you could program it to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is, that is Christ like that is like, let there be water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It didn't turn it into wine.  Oh, well, it's just, it's still water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's, that's a mere matter of configuration.  All you have to do is have a tube going into your, into your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you tell Madam A what temperature it should be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I did not have that setting.  You can do it so it's warmer or cooler if you have the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Madam A I would love a couple of cups of cool water to gush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Madam A as cool as a morning spring.  That's how cool I would like it to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The nice thing is you probably could stick all those extra words in and she  just go, yeah, here's some cold water.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just learned somebody, I did a podcast with someone that hasn't been released yet,  but he was like, he was talking about his kid interacts with Madam A and she  just says Madam A weather.  Yeah.  And I'm like, that works.  Of course it works.  It's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's so much better.  What will the weather be today?  Especially if you're very curt with her.  It works much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause she has to figure out what all those extra words are.  You humans are so verbose.  Can I, can I have you do it at one and a half X?  Yeah.  By the way, that voice appearing from nowhere, I should explain.  He's Karsten, our producer, Karsten Bondi.  Uh, cause I realize if you're watching video, you're seeing nobody's mouth  move when he talks, so that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm working on making Leo's voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we need a Karsten puppet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll just go.  And Jeff can make it talk.  That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Move my hand.  That's okay.  This is my Karsten puppet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You still in touch with the guys who did Dev?  No, we could just have me like,  Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put me in the suit.  We've mentioned this before, but in case you forgot, used to be my handler.  When I was the robot character on MSNBC's, the site, Dev, no, Karsten was the  guy that we took two people actually took three, if you include me to do it.  And, uh, what part of me did you, you did my eyebrows, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did your hair and your eyebrows and, uh, all the cameras and lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how I got this job kid.  So make sure you stay in school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That Harvard degree to work.  Do we have any pictures of Dev Nol to put up?  Oh, I can do that.  Sure.  I got many pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can even play a little clip if you really want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's do that.  That'll be fun.  So can I play that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But recently Soledad O'Brien was talking about Dev the other day.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And someone embarrassed her with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And she played a clip of it.  Um, on what?  How does she play it on Twitter?  That would know that he played her played it.  Oh, this is.  From 1997.  Uncle EO.  And let me turn up the sound so you can hear it on the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I gave the show great reviews.  Did you thank you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  From San Francisco, Soledad O'Brien.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds like you Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello and welcome to the site for Tuesday, June 10th.  These stories making high tech news today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That point in the show where we turn to Dev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would that be the high point or the low point?  I mean, where exactly?  What point exactly?  Oh, you're leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's so open for me.  I can't even go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I liked, I like to give you the opportunity to slam.  So she's staring not at a strangely attractive guy with purple hair, but at  a green dot on the wall, I am in another room and the other side of the studio  surrounded by sound blankets.  So it's sweltering hot.  Karsten and Christine are manipulating my hair and eyebrows and I'm talking in  a funny voice, wearing a rubber suit, like a wetsuit with dots taped to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was sensors, sensors, because you have a voice, you have a face for radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was because the network decided I should not be on TV.  And they said, well, cause they originally, I was promised, you know, managing  editor of the show and all that and regular spot every week and every day.  It was daily.  Uh, and then they decided, no, we don't want to go on TV.  So here, where this rubber suit, you know, network television, but so far you  have yet to take me up on this.  You're so polite.  So that I've hated you.  She hated you.  Just make me crazy.  Hey, I got a great fit for you.  This is a, this is a great, let's get your attention.  Hey, I know you're not exactly thrilled to be here.  So I'm just trying to get your attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm thrilled to be here.  Oh yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She sees her career flashing before her eyes.  This was, uh, that was basically it.  Uh, you get the, uh, the tension.  It wasn't exactly moonlighting.  It wasn't exactly a Sybil Shepherd and, uh, Bruce Willis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was, you know, every time you're out of town, I've been on that show, you know,  every time you're out of town, uh, you should be, you should be Dev Null.  I should just to the show like this in a virtual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay.  We're really digressing, but I will digress.  There's a guy named Greg Panos who worked at the company that did this character.  And in 1997, this was state of the art.  This, you couldn't do this because you could do it.  I don't know why you'd want to, but that's another question.  Nobody asked that question.  You could do it after the fact in rendering, but you couldn't do it in real time.  But you couldn't do it in real time.  We were doing this live in real time.  And so it took a half million dollars, Silicon graphics, Onyx workstation,  running specials, remember them SGI?  Yeah, it was purple.  It was a beautiful, I wish I had that SGI, although it has a 10th of the power in my  smartphone, but, uh, it was running software from chemical protozoa and Panos was an  expert in all this 3d stuff.  I met him maybe five or six years ago in the men's room at a Webby awards.  That was probably extraneous information.  And he said, you know, we could do what we did with that SGI today with any modern PC.  We were just about to build our studios.  And I said, Greg, it would be really cool if we could do some sort of thing instead  of having Jeff Jarvis in a TV screen and Stacy in a TV screen as they are today.  We could be Dev Null.  We could animate you without wearing a suit with it.  Standard PC, scan your, it's actually today.  You could have my Bitmoji.  Yeah.  Be like a Bitmoji or a Memoji for Apple.  And Stacy, you and I can be deep fakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  You could do that with your Note 10 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could do it with a smartphone.  So I, and I thought it'd be really cool to do it so that you'd be actually sitting at  the table in roughly equivalent 3d renderings of yourselves, but you know what?  This works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pictures of you in the rubber suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  Carson, did you take any pictures?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to see those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty funny.  It's like a wetsuit.  Basically it is a wetsuit.  Um, and I also, but I also have a headband on and how did they do my, how did they  lipstick my mouth?  There was no camera on it.  It was just, it was just sound, just sound that you're, you just flapped,  which is why the lipstick isn't very good.  If you, if you look at it, it's actually pretty, pretty, uh,  yeah, it's just volume.  I thought that sounds like, but I guess that to some of the, uh,  content providers weren't so thrilled.  The voice is very irritated.  Yeah, that was my creation.  Yeah.  I can tell all you.  I just didn't want anybody to think it was me, honestly.  Uh, so it could have been any number of things.  I should have made him like weirdly British or something or, oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  now you can also just make us into, uh, into deep fakes.  Yeah.  Well, that would be in the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll save that for the end of the show.  We're saving that.  Okay.  We'll keep that.  Is that the thing you're saving?  That's the thing I'm saving for the end of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we weren't able to show it last week because we didn't want  to get taken down on YouTube.  Yes.  So that's, that's, we'll get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have some more, more Google home devices if we want to talk about those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's that or Bedminster one of the other.  So you go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've added some other stuff, which is Karsten.  I may be back to the three a.  So, uh, CNET published a story about the features in the Google.  Oh, I'm going to screw this up.  Nest max mini max.  No.  Well, okay.  So there's that one.  There's the news that there's going to be a, a nest mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So with a built in wall mount, better sound in an OxJack, which actually is great.  The OxJack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is you mount any of your, or, or of your talking things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My wife doesn't like it when I'm out things.  So I pretty much don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's one of the most popular questions.  I'm going to go right over that.  And just, it's one of the most popular questions we get at the show.  She says it hurts the woodwork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so there's origin makes some lovely devices.  If you want to like ceiling or wall mount a Google or an echo device.  Um, anyway,  I'm sorry.  I really threw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I apologize.  I really apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google max apparently is going to have the solely chip in it, which  means I can use gesture.  Oh, so this is the don't have to buy a four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the new thing coming in the pixel four solely is.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the Google nest max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I'm saying that it was prior previously announced in this or leaked  in the pixel four phone, which is coming out in a month or two, but you're saying  they're going to put the same array and what is it's a 3d sensing camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So CNET put a story out today.  So they're saying it's going the 10 inch display is going to have.  Hold on.  I'm going to go through there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is really interesting news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nest cam facial recognition, and it's supposed to be able to follow you.  Um, around kind of like the, uh,  Facebooky thing, um, and then it's also going to have gesture control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Play the YouTube video that Google put out of, see now that the boss is back,  he can play them.  Well, I'm yeah.  I mean, so she, she's doing gestures.  So this isn't actually a rumor.  This is Google already announced these features in the pixel four.  So you can use gestures, uh, cause it's a, it's a 3d sensing camera, right?  But what could you do with it?  So it could follow you around with a max as you're making

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  phone calls, music playback.  Oh, by saying no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, no, you're like, yeah, by waving at it.  Yeah.  I was like, you don't have to say it.  That's beautiful.  Yeah.  Um, and yeah, so now I'm like, Hey, hey, I'm going to try this out.  So I still get solely and I can buy the pixel three a, which I thought  Karsten would appreciate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the solely is part of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the four comes out though.  Just, just in case.  I really want this new home max.  You want to, you want to give the, don't you want to give the two to today?  Is my child's birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to get rid of my, I told her she had to be patient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I completely agree with you.  I don't want to gesture to my phone, but I do want to gesture to a  best, your device or have it know where I am.  This is a much better place for solely frankly.  Did, did, did they say when this is going to be?  I, uh, this is September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This comes out in September.  Roughly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google's going to do one announcement with all of this stuff, right?  Probably.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think, is it the ninth?  Did I make that up?  Of what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  September?  Yeah.  So the 10th is when Apple's expected to announce its new iPhone.  So the ninth would be a very interesting day to announce it.  That's a Monday.  That would be very interesting.  That would be really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's not also a double edged sword because you only

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  get one day in your news cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no.  So the nest hub max will hit stores on September 9th.  It was going to be $229.  Is that it?  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is it.  Yeah.  September 9th.  I'm on it.  I already signed up for the pre, you know, on the website, but you know,  when you get an email, what does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe they'll give me money off my, uh, pixel thingy.  I wish, you know, does Google do the thing where if I turn in another one of  their devices, I get like Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You get like 35 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Samsung does it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, it gives you like 10 bucks for old dots and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this comes out of a tap, the advanced technology group and  projects group at Google.  They've been working this remember project era that you were so disappointed  about the modular phone that they abandoned.  Uh, Tango was also out of that.  It's a radar chip, the solely chip.  So it's a single chip solution.  It's radar.  I'm really curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's using 60 gigahertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not doing what Apple's array does, which is paint red dots in  infrared dots on my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's how it's not using time of flight.  It's using, because that's what's on the new note 10 is a time of flight sensor.  Yeah.  Think if this is radar or yeah, think of this as sonar with radio waves  as a post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry.  The Google nest hub max now on the Google store is that was doing everything  you're saying it's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should Google.  Oh, did you finish your question or

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I turned on my, I, my, she responded.  Responding, stop Google.  Stop.  John Legend woke up.  Okay.  Google, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, so, so Jeff, there is the, let me answer your question before you ask it.  There is the Google nest home max, right.  Google home max that is available now that does not do this.  The Google nest, the hub max that is coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the home hub, which is the original little one.  And I love, but this does not have a camera at all.  One of the reasons it's in my bedroom.  It's just basically a slideshow that I could talk to, but it's like I, yesterday  I said, set a weekday alarm for 7 30 AM and every, I mean, there's little things  like that, they're just so useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I love having.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so I, I won't put it in the bedroom because of that, but I think of the  kitchen, that's a perfect kitchen device.  And it's a bigger screen so you could watch stuff on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Kevin, Kevin, I know watches lots of stuff every now and then my daughter will come  in.  I only have the Google one in my office because no one in my family uses Google  when Madam A is available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm thinking of shifting everything to Google.  I have both, but I think that's why I was thinking maybe I should replace the ring,  which works better with Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I will say the, the doorbell, the hello doorbell is awesome.  On when, because you can set it up.  So when someone rings your doorbell, it just pops up on that screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  And it's, it's pretty handy.  So I'm thinking, and this is of course what Google's hoping we will all think.  Maybe it's time to become an all Google home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I wish, I wish I could be all one or all the other.  My, my brain would like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't, doesn't everything, I mean, the Lutrons would work with Google or no.  You have to have Echo for a lot.  It all works with Amazon.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lutron works with both.  Hue lights work with both.  Almost everything.  June oven does not work with Google.  I, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You command your toaster oven with your Amazon Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  What, why would you not do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know I could, to be honest.  Oh, okay.  I was like, it's really handy.  Okay.  So there you go.  There's one thing I can't use with a all Googled house, but that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're apparently not doing it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the irony of it is the June ovens running Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't, I'm trying to see if they, maybe they have it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here is the video.  I think this is two or three years old of project solely.  I've forgotten.  We saw this.  We talked about it.  Look at the size of the chip.  Remember?  Yeah.  I remember you were very excited, Stacey.  Look at the size of this original chip.  The idea is it's bouncing radar waves off of this hand and I don't know what it's doing.  It's, oh, so now gestures, it can interpret.  That's the, that's the Karsten puppet gesture.  It's almost like a wave, a wave form that it can interpret like sound.  So you can see the value of it.  You could see how, oh, well I can, I understand sound waves.  This is just another kind of wave.  Yep.  Very interesting.  Oh, I'm excited.  I want to get this thing.  Yeah.  And then I guess I have to get more Nest cameras, a hello doorbell.  What else is in the Nest by Yale lock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nest by Yale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I really have misgivings, especially we just learned now there's a new Bluetooth  attack called knob that makes Bluetooth supremely hackable because you can, you can  command Bluetooth to have a password of one, one, one bite, which means it's  you know, there's only 256 choices period, which means it's easy to brute force.  And I worry about having a Bluetooth enabled door lock for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the deal.  Bluetooth is not very secure.  On door locks.  Okay.  If you have like a quick set or some of the lower end door locks out there today, you  can open it with a screwdriver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.  A lock is really only a serving suggestion anyway.  Any idiot could get in by kicking a door in or going around back or breaking the  glass, you're right.  That requires a minimal, the lock is merely a suggestion.  Please don't go in my house.  It's more a social thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's one.  Now there are places where connected locks don't make sense.  And actually hotels are one because you can, there's, there's a huge motivation to  easily hack into it because your payoff's much higher than coming into like a  single house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if I replaced, I could replace a deadbolt with this lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a nice lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have, I have had that lock installed in my house.  It is a nice lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm concerned about the spousal acceptance factor on this, but the advantage is if  we're not home, we can open it.  So for instance, I, uh, we had to put off, uh, the plumber the other day cause nobody  was home.  Uh, but if I had, I could have just said, oh yeah, I'll open the door for you.  Go on in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then you have your cameras monitoring him to make sure he doesn't do anything  weird.  I guess we like this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's distrustful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, well then the guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Okay.  That's tempting.  But then you have to also have a nest connect or a nest guard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So with the lock, because it's Bluetooth, it needs wifi back out.  If you want to have remote control and that's what that device does.  You plug it in and it, and it's also my wifi, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's on my wifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's on your wifi and then it talks to the Bluetooth.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing is it has batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The lock does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Of course it does.  How do we get charged?  The nice thing about a doorbell is most doorbells have power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want a wifi doorbell that does solar charged Hamptons.  No solar.  No.  They have a soul.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, it is a big solar panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's, it's a little big, but it's not as big as you think it is.  Um, and it's auxiliary.  So it's Hampton products and it is called the array lock.  ARR.  Ay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the battery dies, how do you get in your house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, it depends on the lock.  Some locks, if you take a nine volt battery, it'll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they say.  You could charge it up with a nine volt battery or use a screwdriver.  There's the solar.  That's not that big.  That's not that big at all.  Yeah.  See, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cause it doesn't need a lot of juice.  I would like a lock like that, that has a keyhole.  So it doesn't look like the Yale has a keyhole.  It does not.  That's the override.  If you can't get in, you use a key.  But this one doesn't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe you should go for the array lock.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love having an IOT slash five G slash Qualcomm chip guru on the show.  Don't you, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now we can talk about other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a break and we will talk about other things, but first a word from Monday.  I know it's Wednesday, but monday.com is going to turn every day into a  great day in your office.  We just started using monday.com for a show planning for iOS today.  And Micah and I are just going, this is great.  This is great.  monday.com helps teams manage work and meet deadlines, but also they like to  call it a culture, builds a culture of transparency because everything is known.  So when you're working on a team, a lot of times there's stuff you don't know.  You're not sure about, but with Monday, you'll be motivated to put everything  in the Monday dashboard.  You can manage all your core business activities in one place.  I mean, everything, they have all kinds of templates, but you can create your own  as well, high level roadmaps down to specific day to day, even hour to hour  tasks monday.com is so cool.  Tailor the, any template to your team's workflow, automate them with  reminders, notifications.  Of course you can use Dropbox or Google drive for file upload directly from your  computer.  65,000 teams are now using monday.com to get things done.  I asked them, why do you call it Monday?  Cause we want Mondays to be a good day.  The day you're going into work is a good day.  Look, Discovery uses it.  That's pretty cool.  We just started using it.  I'm loving it.  It's great for big teams and little.  And you think from two freelancers working together to thousands  collaborating across the globe.  It replaces a lot of stuff, Excel files and whiteboards.  And most importantly, from my point of view, long meetings, there's  accountability.  You could say who's in charge of what, whose, whose job this is.  There's my week, which is a great way to see what you need to do.  You'll never miss another deadline.  It's kind of almost a personal assistant for you and your team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google.  I guess we could do a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The MIT media lab story.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what to think about this.  And in fact, we have booked Joey Ito for triangulation for an interview with Denise Howell.  And I've just been reading all of this.  So summarize, Jeff, what's, what's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Joey Ito, who's very well known.  And by the way, a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know him.  I have a lot of respect for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He is, uh, uh, he was one of the pioneers of social.  Well, we would now think of a social media going way back and he became without  a graduate degree, he became director of the MIT media lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And everybody who knows MIT media lab knows how important that is to everything  we do these days.  It all came out of the media lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, after Epstein, uh, killed himself, allegedly, uh, you know, had to come out  with an apology saying that, uh, five years after Epstein was, um, or, or, or,  what was he convicted?  He was convicted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He, he, he, he said convicted sex offender for sex with minors of children, of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  children, uh, five years after that.  Ito, uh, went to events with him, uh, raised money for the school from him and  even raised money for the companies in which he'd ho and his fund invest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And visited several of Epstein's residences.  And of course, yes.  The residences are where these things happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was also a story that, um, the founder of the MIT media lab, Marvin  Minsky, uh, who's now departed, uh, in one set of allegations, uh, was the, um,  uh, uh, received, um, I don't know how to say this, um, allegedly had sex with  minors under the ages of Epstein.  So all this is roiling around Epstein.  So Joy Eater writes an apology.  It doesn't say how much money he got for the school.  It doesn't say how much money he got for his companies.  He does say, let me read what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause I, it's important.  I want you to know in all my interactions with Epstein, I was never  involved in never, never heard him talk about and never saw any evidence of the  horrific acts that he was accused of.  That said, I take full responsibility for my error in judgment.  I'm deeply sorry to the survivors, to the media lab and the MIT community for  bringing such a person into our network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And, and the people are, I think you can take that at face value and believe that,  but it's still, why were you having any association whatsoever with the child?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a sex offender, child molester.  He was convicted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Last night, uh, Ethan Zuckerman, who heads one of the centers at the, at the  media lab, um, had sent a letter of apology to people he was involved with  about this and said that he was going to leave at the end of this term, see  through his work for this year and then leaked out to the Boston Globe.  And so he has resigned in protest.  Another scholar there who's also associated with associated with Cornell  has resigned and is taking his workout.  Um, Edo is also on the boards of, uh, the MacArthur foundation, the night  foundation and the New York times.  So this is a story that's just roiling right now in my world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was the Boston globe that broke this, by the way, not the New York  times, I should point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, the New York times did write a story about his apology, but I, I  complained that his head, the headline said MIT media director person  apologize for Epstein connections.  Uh, it didn't say New York times board director.  People, some people, some trolls came after me about that, but the, you  can bet the New York post said New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Uh, apologize.  Yeah.  It's in the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New York times board member apologizes for Epstein ties on the post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is all around.  It's a, it's a big story in my world.  It's a story in, you know, media and technology world.  Stacey, you were trying to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was just going to point out that there are plenty of convicted sex offenders.  It's hard.  Like I'm, this, I'm not excusing Epstein.  I am not excusing the media lab.  I will say that there are probably people you interact with on a daily basis that  may have had similar problems that you just haven't looked up.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody knew what Epstein had been convicted of.  That's the question.  I mean, did, did everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Let me see this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me see that.  Let me see this.  The, the, I have sympathy.  If you've, if you, you know, we had a case where we gave an honor to Charlie Rose.  And you didn't know about the meat.  And we didn't know about it.  And we withdrew it when the news came out, right?  We didn't have no knowledge.  I have sympathy for those who accept money or give honors to those who later  turn out to have had something bad in their past in this case.  Oh yeah.  I mean, and I also know that when giving honors and, and accepting money, you do  a background check on people.  That's what happens.  And so that is standard process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I should point out there are people convicted, convicted sex offenders  for peeing in public, but when you do the background research and you find out he  was convicted for pedophilia and that his, that the press had nicknamed his private  jet, the Lolita express, are you so desperate for money that you say, oh, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you know, and, and, and Ethan Zuckerman in 2014, Ethan said, I have a great  deal of respect for Ethan.  And I complimented him last night on his principles on this.  Joey tried to get Ethan to meet Epstein in 2014.  Ethan refused.  Ethan knew.  Joey, you should not meet him.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Joey knew too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Well then that's, yeah, then that's very different.  I have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In full disclosure, I knew Glenn Maxwell.  I worked for her father.  She was the enabler.  Glenn Maxwell is alleged to be the enabler of all this.  Right.  So just full disclosure there.  I very little contact with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So one thing that's becoming rapidly becoming very, very clear is that Epstein  was very active after his conviction in spreading philanthropy and getting in,  getting to know people and, and there were the connections to Epstein are everywhere.  Yeah.  So, and this was his MO, I believe that was part of the deal was this is how,  this is how I rehabilitate my reputation.  Uh, I, you know, so it's, what would you do, Jeff?  We, we have an interview scheduled with Joey.  I was surprised.  The media lab has not canceled it.  Uh, the media lab is very much our beat.  It's something we want to cover.  Did you say all the schedule do the interview?  I told Denise, I'm going to leave this up to you, but you absolutely have to bring it up.  It could be, it could be, but now this interview is a whole different story.  It's sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's okay.  I mean, that's not bad.  That's journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, what would I do if you ask him about, I mean, I would bring him on and ask him  about it and you have to have him talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fine to do that.  I don't have a problem with that.  I mean, uh, but you also think that's some on all these points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are these things that he has not said that's what I told Denise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said, you, of course, you know, we should bring him on, but if you do now you are,  and, and nobody here at twit is anxious to be, play the role of Mike Wallace and,  and it's not you, the hard questions.  It's not what we do.  It's not what we need to do.  Uh, well it is if I'm asking Microsoft or, you know, if I see,  yeah, but it was a kind of personal, but this kind of thing, that's a  news story, not a tech story.  Triangulation is not, that's not our, that's not the venue for it.  Yeah.  And I don't want to put Denise in that position, so I'm leaving it up to her.  I do believe that if we interview him, we have to ask the tough questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also would do some, some relevant like beforehand.  I mean, I would talk to Jenny Jordan, who has talked about this a lot on Twitter and,  and, and is, um, angry about this.  I would talk to some folks beforehand to get, get the perspective and, and, and,  and let them know that that perspective is going to be represented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, the other thing that happened around that around this whole Epstein story is  cause it's a bit up our alley.  Um, I don't know if you saw, there was a picture of Glenn Maxwell, the  enabler alleged enabler, uh, supposedly at an in and out murder in LA.  And then it came out this week that the photo was faked and it was fed to the  New York post by an Epstein lawyer.  This whole thing is just, it's just deep fakes.  So this is a fake picture.  If you look at the, well, if you look at the back, the, the, the bus, the bus  shelter there, for some reason, they changed the movie being advertised  in that bus shelter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the lawyer's dog.  They were trying to act like it was her dog.  So it's, wow.  Yeah.  It's all just, uh, wow.  Speaking of deep fakes and don't worry, Carson, I'm not going there.  Um, uh, my, my friend Claire Wardle, who heads first draft, which is an amazing  organization that brings together newsrooms to, to deal with misinformation,  disinformation.  She did a great video on deep fakes for the New York times because it's not a  YouTube video.  It's on the bottom of the rundown.  I actually think you'd enjoy watching it for a minute because it's also not  techno panicky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  About a new technology that's affecting famous people.  Remember when Obama called Trump a complete or the time Kardashian  wrapped because I'm always have naked or when Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonated  himself, get out of this is the bombing there.  Deep fake, deep fake, deep fake.  That's my favorite, by the way.  Pause that for a minute.  I'm not Adele, but I am an expert in online manipulation.  Isn't that great?  Wait a minute.  I thought that was Adele.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't, it was Claire Wardle.  Okay.  So, uh, we've been preparing the world for this for some time now.  There's been Photoshop fakes like that by Maxwell.  This has been going on for decades.  Um, are people so dumb that, well, I don't know what we're going to do.  We just can't believe your eyes anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No video.  That's hard.  Every part of our, every part of our brain trusts what we see.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, well, we, we, we believe people believe everything they read on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  internet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, that's, I feel like people, I will say.  My daughter has already learned how to spot Photoshop fakes and in ways that are  highly sophisticated, like she looks for like cinching in and like weird misalignments.  She takes pleasure in it now, right?  And yeah, it's, it's instinctive in a way that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And for now, deep fakes are, if you look at them, there's something a little odd  about them, but that's not going to last long.  So the question is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you, can you, can we find things that as humans we can see and say, Oh, but the  other thing is even though we know things are fake, they still have the power to  influence us and that's, that's just part of being human.  It's kind of like funky smells, right?  There is a visceral reaction to visual stimuli that really can change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go.  Yes.  I just saw that.  I saw it with my own eyes.  That's a phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Listening to Daniel Kahneman's thinking fast, thinking slow.  Yeah.  What a good book.  It is.  It's, it's, it's dense, but it, yeah, it's that, it's that instantaneous,  instinctual brain system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One with my own eyes and, and it just reacts like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's, that's how we, that's how we do things quickly.  That's we defend ourselves, doing all kinds of stuff, but yeah, it doesn't, it  doesn't bother to think things through.  That has to be triggered as a separate system.  And so, you know, I wonder how you'd remake media and including  journalism with that in mind, with knowing that there's a, because what  are the propagandists doing?  What are the bad guys doing?  They're going to that instinctual thing.  They're, they're trying to get the oxytocin, oxytocin flowing.  It feels good to be angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm angry and I can make you angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And actually that didn't feel good.  No, that's dopamine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oxytocin is the love drug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oxytocin is what you get when you hug a kid or you just have a baby or you pet your dog.  Any hug that lasts longer than...  By the way, did you see Keanu Reeves stop this robbery at a 7-Eleven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is, this is kind of amazing.  He's signing an autograph.  He is an amazing man.  Yeah.  I mean, Keanu is God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see that?  The guy pulled out a gun.  Wait a minute.  Keanu, what are you going to do?  Keanu, this isn't a movie.  You, you, there's no bullet time.  Ooh boy.  This is some guy, some guy, some guy, some guy, some guy, some guy.  Some guy in the alley in the aisles is shooting this with his camera.  You could tell because it's vertical video.  Keanu is talking to the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he switched perspective completely with no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he crossed the line.  Uh, watch this, watch this, watch this.  Keanu is so good.  He's going to, he's going to give the man a dollar.  Well, that's a bunch of Franklin's.  Anyway, that's a deep fake by the way.  Yeah.  And I think if you look at it, it's pretty obviously a deep fake.  Although I have to say kudos to the people who crafted this video.  It's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty good, you know, but they're just patient somehow.  It's a two camera shoot.  Yeah.  Somehow we got a two camera shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Can't really cross the line with one camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think I managed to edit it on the fly.  It's very impressive what these phones can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It must be a Samsung note 10, but honestly, if you showed this to a relative  who's not wise in the ways of the world, do you think they would believe it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, no, this is a little much.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, um, I don't think education's going to, I think that's the point you were  making, right, Stacey is that because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, I just, I think that some people will become more sophisticated.  I was making two points.  One, we're already becoming more sophisticated.  It's spotting manipulation.  I think the youngs are better than the olds.  At least they know it can be manipulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  And two, it's still going to have an effect because our brains aren't that smart.  We're going to see something and it's going to color our opinions, our  reactions to things, even if we intellectually know they're not true.  So if I see, if you all, if someone made a deep fake of me kicking puppy dogs,  and I explained how that was not true, you're still going to be like, when you  see me, you're going to, your brain's going to call it me kicking a puppy dog.  And you're going to be like, that person is not a good person, even though I  am a very good person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, here's the other piece.  Here's the other piece.  I want to do an experiment seriously about this.  So, so the condiment also talks about how you can prime the brain, right?  That if you, if you see a bunch of happy things and then you see a news item,  um, you're more likely to, to, to judge it positively than, than if you see  gruesome things, right?  What does media do all the time?  It shows you gruesome things.  I want to do a little experiment.  And, but however, what does the internet show you all the time?  Kittens and puppies.  Why are we so angry when we see kittens and puppies?  I wonder, I actually want to do a simple little dumb experiment where,  where you show one group kittens and puppies, and then the same headlines  and you show somebody else gruesome crap.  And then you show them the same headlines, what their  reaction to those headlines is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I avoid all gruesome crap on the internet.  I only look at, I only consume increasingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you this is a nationwide phenomenon.  I'm watching a lot less news.  I'm just, I'm burying myself in a, I don't think it's even escapism.  I just not focusing on that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also look, you got a brief shot of a puppy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then she, she moves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, she's Stacy's blood pressure is a hundred points lower than ours.  Just cause of that, that fuzzy Brown thing on the ground there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and as you can see, I have not kicked her at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sometimes she's over there in the corner, scared of you, trying to be as  far away from you as she can rubbing against the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes, sometimes though, it's a good thing when somebody's angry.  I love Scott Galloway.  I don't know.  How do you feel about professor Galloway?  Cause he's kind of, I know him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been at conference with him a lot.  I think this is, I think he's turned into pure showbiz.  I think this is awful.  It is show.  Yeah.  It's pure and he's, he's, it's sorry.  I'm going to say it.  Got to say it.  He is, is he's going toward techno panic to try to sell books.  Um, he's a nice guy, but he, I think he's gone over the edge where you compare  that to a strategist analysis, which is, is wise and mature and fact-filled.  I, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the same, uh, by the way, the same bottom line results.  Uh, we're talking about both.  We're talking about we work.  Scott calls it we what we WTF both point out that there are some, they're,  they're doing an IPO, both point out.  There's some serious, uh, issues in the financials that anybody considering, uh,  we work as an investment should consider Ben's more balanced cause he kind of  gives the we works point of view on this.  But ultimately concludes the same thing, which is, um, he says, Ben Thompson  says in short, there's a case that we work is both a symptom of software  eating the world as well as an enabler and driver of the same, which would  mean the company would still have access to the capital needs, even in a recession.  See, this is the fear is that we work going into a recession  has a mismatch of commitments.  It has long-term as long as 15 year leases.  But if there's a recession, its income could change in a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In a recession is when companies will more want to save money on things like  office space and they may end up getting more business as a result.  The problem is you just don't control how is it, you know, but it's an AWS model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What, what he really points out is the real thing that's letting we work,  perhaps skate through this is they can just walk away from those leases  and nobody's going to do anything.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which of course that others complain about, like how the company's structured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can't get to the leases is an LLC for each one, a separate LLC for each one.  And they can't get to the major, the big corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that's not, that is how we built big internet infrastructure back in the odds.  I mean, bankruptcy helps lower the costs of things like Akamai for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in the end, Ben's conclusion is the, the real concerns about duration  mismatch in a recession is a very good reason to stay away that in the sky.  That's like the last sentence, but he does go back and through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Scott, it's like the hot take the sense behind the model.  Yeah.  And as opposed to others who just dismiss it and make fun of it,  uh, he delves in and understands it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scott is very much the Jim Kramer now of this stuff.  It's a clown cost one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a fun read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He does brilliant presentations, but it's all shit.  This now he's gone kind of over the edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, and I mean, there's some self-dealing in the we work.  Uh, I've been, Oh, there's big self-dealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, good Lord, this thing, Adam's Adam sold the we trademark to we work  for $5.9 million.  He also took $700 million in stock off the table before the IPO.  Uh, which as Scott says is, is 700 million red flags, a spell words on the  field of football on the football field at halftime saying, get me the hell out  of this stock, but you should buy some.  I don't know.  I enjoyed it.  It's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny, but it's not wrong either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  No, because you enjoyed reading Ben Thompson's three times longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because he just dismissed, there's, there's something to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  understand here and Ben realizes that and explains it and does journalism.  Scott just makes fun of it from the moment, which is, which is, no, but he,  but he's, well, yeah, but that should include some facts and some,  and some, some sense to it.  He's just exploiting it for the yucks.  Uh, if he, if it were pure comedy, but that's not what he does.  That's not how he sells himself.  He sells himself as a business analyst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a matter, honestly, of just, uh, taste.  Like some people prefer one, some people prefer the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's a matter of substance and Scott's lacks it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think there's some substance in here.  Not very much.  And what it is, there's also cartoons, which I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have a very serious, very serious.  I have a very serious question.  No, I do have a, I don't know if it's a policy question, but this model, the AWS,  the someone sent me the server for server if vacation of everything.  Vacation.  I like that.  Yeah, it's terrible.  But this idea that we're turning our capital, basically all of our capital as a  business, even as like a individual into an operational expense.  So we're renting everything because in our country, historically wealth generation  has accrued to people who have capital investments, like a home or let's say a  car, but you can buy a car and make money off of it.  For example, if you want, it feels like a huge societal shift that we're  undergoing and I really wish we had more.  I want to read more books.  I want to understand where economists think how that's going to affect our  widening gap and wealth, how it's going to affect like assets over time.  And I feel like nobody's really talking very smartly about this.  So I throw this out there.  I would love to learn more about this.  I want to know who's thinking about this.  Send me because I'm thinking about it and I'm not smart enough to know  what it's going to mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I just realized that what's really going on in this show is the tension  between my Scott Galloway-esque antics and you two's thoughtful, measured  It works better, Leo, when you have purple hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fact-based journalism.  Well-animated eyebrows.  Yeah.  I kind of like that.  There was, I forget who I would juggle during this show if I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm the guy sitting in front of a giant Mylar three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you've got noisemakers right in front of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Do it.  Where's the noise?  No, in front of you, there's noisemakers.  Do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How appropriate is the show all about Google?  You know what the problem with modern noise makers, they make no noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was really sad.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey, since you're being serious, I'll be serious.  We'll ignore the clown.  So Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I dare you.  Try to make an important point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just try.  I dare you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got cupcakes and I'm not afraid to use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So,  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys, I'm going to take a nap.  Go ahead.  It's all yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So somebody tweeted, I can't remember who.  The CEOs who all got together last week and said supposedly, and we will take  this with a grain of salt the size of Utah, that the shareholders are no  longer shareholder return is no longer their primary value.  They deal with all these constituencies of which shareholders are one.  And we can read that as BS, sorry, because whoever has to cut that out,  that probably is.  But somebody pointed out that there's there to your point, Stacey, there's a  big transition going on now and you go from the industrial, from, from the  time of guilds to corporations, whoever was said now we're in the, in the, in  the age of networks and you have to operate differently with all these  constituencies.  I think that might be stretching it, but your, your, your Spidey sense here,  I think is quite right.  We're in a fundamental economic shift in a structural shift in how things are  done and we don't really understand it at all yet.  I agree.  Now you can have to know it's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can call it a paradigm shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I honestly, as somebody  because I'm on keto, I eat a lot of meat because I can't eat any carbs, zero carbs.  But I don't want to be a meat eater.  I'd rather be a vegetarian.  And when they can come up with that raised muscle matter or whatever, it's going to be.  But that's not what this is.  Yeah, that's not what this is.  This is this is not actual meat.  Chicken knobs are they meat?

Transcript:  Chicken knobs are Margaret Outwood wrote about them in Parks and Crate.  OK, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not real.  It was that grown chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That grown chicken.  That's what I'm ready for any time.  Because I want to get the nutritional value of meat without the sad fact  that you have to kill an animal to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We had guests the other day who were we had to go meet him in the city  at a restaurant, but I had to find a restaurant where they're  they're on keto and they're vegetarian.  That's hard. That's really possible.

This was this was one of the this was the very first cam.  The fog cam was on the roof at San Francisco State University.  For many, many years.  But they're taking it down.  It's time to say goodbye.  I think these are ads.  I'm sorry.  I don't know what this has to do with anything.  It's just random.  It's the most random show I've ever seen.  This is the perfect slideshow for Twink.  It's like a shock test.  I don't know what what is going on.  Help me. I'm trapped.  I don't know what's going on.

Vitamin K discovered in basil.  The element C Borguium was discovered.  What is this?  I don't know. I think the San Francisco Chronicle lost its mind.  I don't. It's all Berkeley.  It's educational.  Yeah. So back to the fog.  It started with Fog Cam Cam, which is the name of the story.  But the slideshow has nothing to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe. Well, it's a click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It got me a click. No kidding.  Here's a Rube Goldberg machine.  Here's some a woman staring at some computer screens.  A lot of computer screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The fog can't go all the way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank God we're free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you know, after Fog Cam, you know what I created? What?  Herbo Cam. Oh, urban street in New Orleans.  You did the first Bourbon Street Webcam.  OK, we did that. And and were you at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nola Observer and lose people's jobs?  Like, yeah, we know what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a lot of that on Bourbon Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you weren't above you weren't above pandering is what you say.  Oh, no. Oh, no. Clicks for clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like the pre mug shot.  You know, the mug shot websites.  This is like before the mug shots.  Bourbon, there they were.  And with facial recognition, you can actually create a timeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You create that for the Nola Observer or for advanced,  which owned at the time the Times Pick you know, the time or Nola dot com,  which is since times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually a timely story.  The Times Pick you and is gone. Yep. Yep.  One of the great local papers in New Orleans papers.  And by the way, they had a really credible digital strategy with Nola dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They got when they reduced frequency of delivery.  Yeah, the Baton Rouge paper took advantage of New Orleans  anger at this and came in and competed with them uneconomically.  But it finally became un-economical for the Times Pick you and keep going.  They sold the paper and the advocate laid off the entire newsroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sold the paper to one of those free weekly papers, which is well, no, the advocate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it was a real paper from the Rouge. Oh, OK. Oh, OK.  I thought it was one of the weeklies that bought them.  That wasn't like the examiner in San Francisco.  Oh, that did happen in San Francisco. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw. I would tell people I used to work on the examiner when it was a real paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was absorbed by the advocate. Isn't that sad that happened in July?  Yet another daily gone.  Yep. And the whole staff is no,  only a third of the staff is left, two thirds of the staff were gone.  Should we do a change log?  Let's play the pay the timpani's here.  All right. Go get the I wanted to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I actually know. OK, before that, before that, I wanted to talk.  Produce Karsten one story that's actually related to  to what we were just talking about. Yes.  The fact that  we just hit the era of  Google's that result in no clicks.  Oh, Google, another paradigm.  Shends traffic to to anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Yeah. Over 50 percent of Google's searches don't result in clicks to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, people do this search and then and then go get a hot dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they do the search and they get the blurb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is not good.  This is living.  This is evidence of the snippet war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the snippet war.  This is has been one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And this is actually good because this well, as long as we can figure out  or Google can figure out how to monetize this,  it's OK, because they needed a strategy for dealing with things like voice  in a world where screens are smaller or nonexistent.  And they're still serving their audience.  The question is, how does that affect their revenue?  Actually, the question is, how does it affect their profits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is publishers are going to complain that affects their profits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is publishers always complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. With Google's announcements about  Project Owl or no, this is something new.  So they had announced this.  They said this before.  It's only by the way, I misheard and heard you say 50.  It's 15, one five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Less than half of Google searches now result in a click.  So it is 50, 50, 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is not a Google.  Yeah, this isn't a Google number.  This is a a study from software company Spark Toro.  Oh, come on.  Spark's time last month, a majority of all browser based  Google searches resulted in zero.  How does Spark Toro know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm calling the authorities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spark Toro.  That sounds made up.  OK, all software companies sound made up.  That's true. All the good names are taken.  Speaking of made up stories, apparently, did you hear Google  manipulated millions of votes  and swayed the election?  Did you hear that? All their fault?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, they're just they're just to have it out for conservatives.  That's what they do all the time.  Right. Millions of votes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.  This just we should debunk it.  Actually, I have to say it with the irony label around those people.  Yeah. Devin Coldway at TechCrunch did a really, I thought, very quality job  of debunking it.  He starts with the president's tweet.  Coincidentally, Fox News had just mentioned that about five minutes earlier.  The report that Fox was talking about came out in 2017.  And it was a study of 95 people,  95 people over the 25 days preceding the election.  And even if even the results from the 95 people  didn't prove or demonstrate anything like the report,  there's no abstract, no introduction, no methods section  to show the statistics work and definition of terms, no discussion,  no references. It was not reviewed by any peers.  In fact, it was the creation of a guy who has written,  apparently, many, many opinion pieces against Google on outlets  like the Epoch Times, which is, of course, Falun Gong's bizarre  news source and The Daily Caller, as well as USA Today and Bloomberg Business Week.  Citing math he does not describe, he declared there was a pro-Clinton bias  in Google search results. No, he said it would over time.  Shift at least 2.6 million votes to Clinton.  We don't know how much time or how.  So it was bogus.  And I don't even know why I'm spending any energy on this.  Another tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you debunk things, you end up spreading.  Right. Another message.  Yeah. Right. Trapped. Trapped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't win. Trapped.  Trapped. That's why I don't watch the news anymore.  I'm just trapped. Here, quick.  Trapped. Have a cookie.  Puppy cam. Oh, puppy cam.  Oh, puppy cam.  Puppy. Oh, puppy wakes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You called. You rang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is she? A corgi?  No, she is a mutt. A mutt corgi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a corgi in there somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I tell my daughter, but she doesn't believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you see in the midst of the whole Portland  Antifa is going to go against the Proud Boys, blah, blah, blah, blah.  There was a parade of corgis.  Again, the solution to everything is a parade of corgis.  Corgis are the solution to everything, indeed.  Now I got a quick question for you, Stacey.  Before before. Real quick.  IKEA says they're going to go heavy in the IOT.  Oh, yeah. You're in student business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let us talk about this. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a standard's hell or does.  If you're if you're a fifth party like that,  how do you get in and make everybody happy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So IKEA has been doing this for a while.  And what they've done is created a separate business unit.  This isn't that weird, because what I learned when I visited IKEA  a couple of years ago is everything's a separate business unit in IKEA.  So that's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also learned that Swedish meatballs and lingonberry jam  are an amazing combination, contrary to what you think.  But you can't eat them because they have really good.  They are really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like the corporate IKEA meatballs are way better than the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ikea meatballs. Oh, you had the corporate IKEA meatballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I went because they promised me moose meatballs, but apparently  it was not hunting season, so they did not have moose in the cafeteria.  This was their excuse.  And I believe they were so good.  But still delicious meatballs.  The point here is  not meatballs.  They were making for instance, they were making coffee

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tables with built in wireless charging.  They've done for years.  I've been doing that. I think that's really cool.  I wish I could get it from restoration hardware, though, not IKEA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're so not.  I don't want to put I have had flat.  Though with room and board, it's nicer than restoration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't like putting it all together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used to I used to when we got married,  the first Ikea was in Philadelphia.  We drove my little Honda down.  We furnished almost our entire house.  Yeah. Out of out of.  Oh, I've done that great diner.  I've done that. I I thought this was so amazing.  I said, we've got to go to where this happens.  And we went to vacation on vacation to Sweden because of like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. That's nutty.  No, but I think Ikea has done a lot for the reputation of the Swedes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I set a place that has it has a special box of dishes for for for 20 year  old single people in an apartment.  I that's like socialism and dishes.  I love that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we want OK. So on the smart home front.  With the creation of this business, it's going to happen.  Since you asked, I will try to answer.  They work. Ikea has created.  They've done two things.  One, they're very focused on creating products that make sense for people  like mainstream consumers.  So they do things that are a little different.  So like their shot feed light bulbs, those will work with their hub  and their own wireless protocols. Right.  So you have to have that.  But hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm holding. They do support Google Assistant,  Amazon, Echo and for some products, Apple's HomeKit.  So what they're doing is they're creating what they feel  is an optimal solution for everybody.  But if you're really fancy and you want to work outside the box,  they're creating links to do so.  So that is that is the strategy.  It's not a completely terrible idea.  It's not. I like the Trot Free bulbs.  They're actually once everything got.  Working like it should.  They were actually really good.  They're friendly in the sense that you don't have to have an echo.  You don't have to know you're doing a smart home.  You can just screw these bulbs in, plug this device in and boom,  you have smart lights.  You know, there's a lot of value in that, and they're relatively inexpensive  and they're doing things that were doing products that people want.  And they have a sustainability angle associated with them, too.  So they don't they don't create a connected product  if it doesn't have a shelf life of a certain number of years.  So they're not going to do some stupid one off product.  How about the security angle?  How about the security angle?  They I mean, they've done the pen testing.  They're not I mean, nothing's over the air, updateable and all of that.  Oh, yeah, they they totally are. Yes.  To be fair, Ikea does have a hub, you guys.  It has the Trot Free hub.  So you have this tiny little hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's never going to sell in America if they don't come up with names  that don't sound like your future talking a lot of free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did a whole episode.  I've done two episodes actually with a guy who's heading this group up.  And in one of them, he's trying to teach me how to say Trot Free properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you do, apparently sometimes Trot Free Trot Free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only thing I learned was your school, your via heart and omelet.  I would like to like an omelet.  Well, I actually don't like them, but I learned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, the best thing about Sweden is Fika.  That's what I have. Oh, oh, ready, you guys.  We're going to go full circle. Watch it.  Watch it. Oh, yeah.  Is the three o'clock cake break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. It's a tiny cake.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am going to make that the title of this show, the three o'clock cake break.  It break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I wanted that.  Now we can. Can we please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's nothing, nothing, nothing.  Nothing in the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I managed to update my Android auto.  I didn't know that I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could force it. Thanks to Lifehacker, we now know you can force it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's well, it's very easy.  It's actually they want you to.  It just says, try it. Oh, and it's good.  The only complaint I have because now you now when you have your audio up,  it gives you the directions at the bottom.  It keeps that on the screen. Nice.  Which is very nice.  You can go to more applications more easily, which is very nice.  The UI is pretty good.  My one complaint remains. Google, are you listening? Yeah.  In ways you cannot get a the UI sucks.  You can't tell if a button is hot or not to push it because the colors  aren't different enough.  And it's really stupid UI design. That's one.  Be more irritating.  I can't get text turn by turn directions in ways.  Oh, I don't know if that's because they think you shouldn't be reading now,  but I don't know where I'm going next. Yeah.  I like to get that heads up in text. I like that. I like that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's only I can't get that, but otherwise you got the pop up that said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would you like to try it? And you said, yes. If you don't know,  I went to leave Lifehacker.  Yeah. Lifehacker says go into the settings and there should be now  a setting that says, try the new Android auto. Here, show my first thing.  Show my screen. There you go. There. Try the new Android.  So if you switch that on,  then you'll get the little pop up and you'll be able to try.  Do you like the dark mode? No. Okay. I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just checking.  Scares me. It's so dark. Too dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google is killing YouTube messages.  I didn't even know YouTube had messages.  It's a hidden messaging client. It's built into the tube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's one of Google seven messaging clients that if it's part of the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you're counting, it's going away after September 18th, 2019.  And then there were six. You hardly knew you. And then there were six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When is Hangouts going to be fully deprecated? What's happening there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay. It's not going away. At least,  at least for Google, for G Suite people, at least until next summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm a five person and I also have it.  But the problem is like the new Samsung phones,  I can't choose it as a default messaging app. I have to use the, uh,  either Android messages or Samsung messages, but I don't want to.  But if somebody sends a message to my phone by that and phone's number,  it'll go in there and I won't see it. But if they sent it to my Google voice  number, which is the number I give everybody, it will still go on Hangouts.  So that's, I just use Hangouts cause I'll see it if they use my proper  Google voice number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Hangouts video phone calls still continues, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's plenty of video.  I care about the fact that I want to be able to see messages on Android,  iOS and the desktop.  And right now the desktop solution is not great for Android messages.  There is no Mac solution as far as I know. Um, so I just, I,  I, I want them to keep Hangouts or something like it. Hangouts is not,  it's, it's, it's, if you don't, if I tell Google, no, I understand.  It's not an SMS messaging app. It's like, it's like WhatsApp.  It's a messaging app. Just keep that around. I'll be,  I'll be happy as long as if I can send messages to it, I'll be happy.  Mobile C. So there were, there were seven. Now there are six  messaging apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Hangouts is apparently,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  why did you ask to do the change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really boring. Okay. So now you can download.  Well, I'm just trying to move this show on cause we got cake.  You could have skipped it.  Well, no, I can't skip it. People say, where was the change log?  Just cause you have a big Mylar three behind you.  Doesn't mean you don't get to do not do the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't do the change log for like two or three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I know. But now once I've resurrected it, I can't kill it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're resurrected the chain. Now we're slaves to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google go is a mere seven megabytes.  It's the light version of the Google search app intended for the Google go  operating system, but you can now download it if you want on any Android  phone in the U S it's in the play store or anywhere in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Light. It's light.  There are members. If you, if you lose connectivity, it remembers your searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, I don't know why anybody wouldn't use it.  Is there anything missing from it? Seven megabytes.  It keeps your phone.  I use whatever in, sometimes I use the browser, probably not a standalone search

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  app. Well, yeah, but in, in Chrome, there's also a mobile or as data saving thing.  And I turned all those on and it's quite nice actually. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I appreciate that.  You can now, uh, you'll appreciate this. Now that you have a 13 year old,  you can assign reminders to family and friends from Google assistant.  So you could say, Hey Google, remind Stacey to take out the trash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be so terrible. My husband will abuse this. No one tell him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one.  What's worse is you'll get a notification on your smart display speaker and phone.  And already I tell my husband and he will get Andrew get notified at the exact  time you, uh, you asked your assistant to remind him.  You can see which reminders you've assigned to your husband,  or he can see which ones he's assigned to you more like.  You can even say, Hey, you know who, who, what are my reminders for Stacey?  I like this. There'll be location based reminders.  So he can say, remind Stacey when she's at Chipotle, not to eat the chip,  the queso that will pop up on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So those are actually, I did one of those. Well, I did an if reminder.  It would send me a text anytime my husband passed the grocery store.  And well, no, it wasn't an execution.  Cause by the time you got it, it was already gone. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was already got his privacy was majorly violent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Well I told him I was doing it and he was the grocery store,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is the name of the strip club in Seattle. Um, you can see,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you don't have to go.  Why don't you guys hit Leo with the big three please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody sneak out of the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every town has a bar called the office so that husbands,  wayward husbands can say, I'm going to the office.  To protect your privacy. You can send and receive a reminder. I tell you,  I'm the guy. I'm the guy with the, with the buttons.  You can send and receive reminders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter access a punch Leo button. Thanks.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can send and receive reminders only from people who are in your Google  family group or those who have their accounts linked to the same smart display  at speaker as you are in our voice match. So it's not going to be misused.  They also have to be in your Google contacts for parents who want to give their  kids access to the assistant on Google home.  You can create account for kids under 13 through family link.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And you can,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and you can also block anyone from sending you reminders at any time.  So you could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Noted. Noted. Noted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm making an executive decision.  I just produced our show today brought to you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm rapidly running out of steam. I need some queso in a jar.  Our show today rapidly brought to you by cap. Tara.  You want to go there because it is the number one,  number one free online resource to help you find software for your business.  So many businesses are using old out of the date software or pencil and paper.  No matter what you're doing, if you're running a hair salon,  if you're looking for sales software, if you need project management software,  email marketing software, if you're using software in business,  cap. Tara is a directory of the best. You can search in 700 categories.  You can narrow it down. You can say,  I only want to see the ones with the five star ratings.  I only want to see them if, you know, if it does this or that.  And you can then, and this is the best part about cap. Tara, you could,  actually before you do that, you can, you can make a chart,  a comparison chart of up to four different apps.  But then you can do the best part, which is read the reviews,  three to reviews.  There's 975,000 actual reviews from real people using the software.  They vet it very carefully.  So you are now going to be able to see what's out there and see what people were  actually using it. Think this is what you need.  No matter what kind of software your business needs,  cap. Tara makes it easy to discover the right solution fast.  The reason there's a thousand reviews every day is because millions of people  use cap. Tara every month and it's free. There's no charge.  In fact, the only thing I'd suggest,  if you try some software and you think well of it or poorly,  relieve a review so that the next person knows cap.  Tara believes software makes the world a better place because software can help  every organization become a more efficient, effective version of itself.  Is it cap. Tara.com slash twig for free to free, not freemium,  not like we'll pay you, you pay later or anything. No, it's just free.

Stacey you needn't, but you can, you may, if you wish,  share something with us. Oh, I have something. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's not a picture of my dog. Um, it is the fin,  a newly launched product today called the fin smart water assistant.  This is interesting because Finn a couple of years ago actually launched a  water monitoring system with up and or, which is a plumbing company.  Spelled P H Y N. Oh yes.  P H Y N and the fancy one turns off your water valve and it's actually really  cool. I wanted it, but it's like $699 and it just felt like plumber has to  install it. It's too much. It does that if there's a leak. Right.  If it detects a leak, it can auto shut off.  So this new product that was announced today and will be available in September  is only $299. It's, it fits under your sink.  It monitors all of your water so it can detect leaks that are like a sudden  outflow of water from something. It can detect slow leaks.  It also can detect on a device by device, faucet by faucet or toilet,  by toilet basis. Who's using water.  And you can self install it. And for $300,  that sort of leak detection,  cause a lot of the point leak sensors,  they cost between 30 and $40 for like the type of leak sensors you might stick  under your sink.  And you have to put them everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This one is one unit that does it for the whole house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. So how does it know?  It, it algorithms, it, it, um,  measures the water flow. It understands water flow.  And it also can detect actually,  this is interesting because it is measuring water flow.  If your pipes start to freeze,  it will actually send you an alert because that's going to also impact water  flow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a really good example of how software can make stuff do pretty amazing  things. Is it AI? Is it trained? How does it, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they've trained a model on, yes, but do we call the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we can call that AI. No, no, no. If you, so,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you think about it,  knowing this unit,  that's one place in your house could tell how much water is coming out of that  faucet. How would it know unless you set up a system and you,  and you gave it a lot of data and you said, this is what it looks like. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. I mean, that, that's what they have done. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's rules-based, but the, so that's what I call AI. If it's rules-based,  but not because some programmers said if this, then that,  but because a model was created by training.  I think that's AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, okay. I mean, it is, that's how you come up with,  that's how you come up with all kinds of algorithms, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does AI have to learn going forward too, to make it AI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, that's a really philosophical question. I don't have the answer to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Burke says it's not AI. So, okay, nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, I don't, I don't think of it as AI.  I just think of it as like anomaly detection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's why I call it AI because until recently, this was a hard,  this isn't something you could say, Oh, I can write,  I can write the code that will know if that faucet down at a hundred feet away  is linking.  You had to have some much more sophisticated techniques to figure that out.  This is where, this is what I mean by software is changing,  is going to change things. That's amazing.  If it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a very cool product. I'm getting a review unit. Um,  you will have to have, so to install it,  you have to put it under your kitchen sink and you'll have to install a little  sensor on your hot water line and your cold water line.  And you need an outlet to plug it in under your sink,  which most people will have if they have a garbage disposal or a dishwasher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what they say.  Developed over a decade by machine learning researchers at the university of  Washington and Belkin, I was Belkin.  Finn's proprietary leak detection technology utilizes high  definition ultrasonic sensors to sample the pressure  in your plumbing system 240 times every second.  This produces an unparalleled view of the unique signatures of each fixture in  your home. So it doesn't put sensors all over your house, right?  But it's listening and it knows, Oh, that faucet sounds like,  and that faucet sounds like, and though it knows that way.  Yes. Oh, I call it AI,  but you might just call it amazing.  Oh Lord.  If finger prints your fixtures, when you run a bath,  wash your hands or water your lawn, the pressure in your system changes. Yes.  Burke points out, you can put your ear to the pipe.  You know, somebody's running the water. Yes.  But Finn measures these microscopic changes in water pressure to fingerprint the  unique pressure profile of each fixture in your home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, a friend of mine did a business where he did that through all of your  electric sockets and everything that was plugged into them.  They all have unique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a company called sense does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I've seen a box you could put there that says that's all these things have,  yeah, they have signatures. Yep. Yeah. They're all unique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google is doing something with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is installed with the memory of hundreds of thousands of toilet  flushes, laundry loads,  and pipe leaks from the real homes of beta testers,  which serve as a baseline for when something's routine or something's wrong.  From there,  Finn starts to learn how water is uniquely to your use in your home,  asking occasional questions to improve accuracy over the time.  Was that you flushing or were you in the hot tub?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's AI. Okay. That is AI. Okay. Thank you. That is AI.  I did not understand that. That was what it was doing. It is definitely AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I win. Yes. Cause it's, it's running a model and it's updating that model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. That's pretty cool. You do not win a cupcake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, so this is my product. I want this for 300 bucks. This is amazing.  It's very exciting. That is amazing. So I'm going to, I'm getting,  I'm going to test it out. Okay. I'll let you know how it works.  I'll have to create a leak.  So if you want it to automatically shut off,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you want it to automatically shut off, you need the $700 model.  But if you don't mind, if you just get a pop up on your phone,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you could use a $300 model. Yes. And if you buy the more expensive model,  you need a plumber to come install it because you're going to install it on  your main water line outside your house. You also need wifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll be the only person in the water in Seattle that actually has one because  it doesn't freeze there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause yeah, that's a big thing in, in, in, in, you know, Bedminster.  That's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's lots of commonly, I mean, my old house had a bunch of slow leaks.  I mean, this water leaks are big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slow leaks are an issue. My mom found out that she, her,  her studio, which is outside the house had been leaking gallons a minute for  months. She had a huge water bill. Yeah.  When I was in college, we left a toilet running in the basement. We didn't know.  We were never down there and the landlady wasn't happy. It's very easy.  That can happen easily. You know, you flush it,  but it doesn't quite come up and it continues to run.  I think this is good. This is going to save water and we need water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We need more water. It's the internet of toilets.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you like Jeff Jarvis to give us a number?  Please.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I was just in Silicon Valley and whenever I drive up the one,  oh one, I love seeing the hanger one.  Oh yeah.  It is cool to see it's built in. So,  so Google has, has controlled this,  not quite owned it but controlled it because they can now land their jets on  Lufford field next to their offices, near their offices. And,  uh, the Navy was never knew what to do with this huge, huge hanger.  And now Google says they have a plan to clean it up.  They don't know what's going to go in. It was built in 1933.  The floor alone covers eight acres,  can accommodate six American football fields.  You could build entire buildings within it. Um,  it gets fog near the ceiling at times. Uh,  so they're going to do something with this amazing thing and you see it every  day. You go by a one-on-one. So I think it could be Google's biggest ad.  It could be something else. Could be some kind of research center.  I don't know what it will be,  but they're going to clean it up and they're going to make it into something on  a toxic waste to get rid of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not the hanger where Sergey Brin was building his blimps.  I don't think so.  Cause that's, those are all those old blimp hangers. And he,  he actually has a company to make, bring back blimps.  Dirigible. Yeah. This time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it dirigibles? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This there's a distinction between a blimp and a dirigible.  I can't remember what it is, but this time let's not use hydrogen. Okay.  I'm just saying.  I think Karsten was going to bring us a bit of a.  All right. Karsten is going to give us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But not all all dirigible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A syllogism. All blimps are dirigible,  but not all dirigible are blimps.  Summer zeppelins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Harvard education in a nutshell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Congratulations to Taylor Lawrence, who is moving from the Atlantic,  where she did such great reporting to the New York times,  where she will continue to do great reporting, including this tweet.  You've seen this. We've seen this over and over again.  Instagram is about to take over and all of your stuff will belong to them.  It's and then so people respond to it with a tweet or an Instagram post.  I do not give Instagram or any entities associated with Instagram permission to  use my pictures, information or pictures with this statement.  I give notice to Instagram is strictly forbidden.  This has been making the rounds again. It's not going to happen. It's a hoax.  Look who fell for it. Judd Apatow, Julianne Moore, Julia Roberts,  Deborah Messing, Tara G.  P. Henson, Beyonce's mother, Waka Waka Flame,  and the Secretary of Energy,  Governor Rick Perry. Oh no.  The man in charge of our nuclear weapons program.  So I just a little reminder.  You don't have to post something that says Instagram doesn't have  permission to share my messages or posts. You don't have to.  That was that's from 2012. That thing. It just doesn't die.  Here's here's the Rick Perry's post.  Don't forget tomorrow starts the new Instagram rule.  Don't forget.  And the channel 13 news that everybody quotes.  No, that's made up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's made up. So somebody somewhere is just chortling. Oh God.  Yeah. It's a, you know, I think Karsten has something to show you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do. I have a, a new, uh, and what I'd like to make.  Do we need to explain it first, Karsten?  Um, this is a Karsten's fan video of the week.  Um, a couple of weeks ago we had a fan, a fan found a video,  well, a studio crew found a video with Jeff Jarvis,  uh, apparently causing a car crash. Oh yes. That was good. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was good. Yes. This one. Okay. The car crash was not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wasn't in the car. Somebody was listening to Jeff to Howard Stern,  to Howard Stern on Jeff.  And that incidental audio was on the video of the, of getting him getting rear  banded. Anyway, so we watched that a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they use this to make fun of Jeff going over bridges. Yes.  It's like whatever bridge to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Last week, uh,  we wanted to show a video of, uh,  Bill Nye talking about Chromebooks. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause he's a big Chromebook fan now, right?  And he did a three minute video. Yes. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but I didn't want to show the video because I didn't want us getting taken  down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is lately YouTube's been doing a lot of take downs, uh, at,  at other people's behest. I don't think YouTube does it on a mat,  but it's the content detection. And so, and it hurts us a lot because when we,  you know, a lot of people watch our shows on YouTube and when it's,  when the show is taken down and usually it's a fairly lengthy,  like six week take down, we lose all that revenue. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so, uh,  Jeff was good enough to watch the video and narrate for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know I didn't just narrate. I, I, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dramatized. He dramatized it. Yes. So instead of watching the video,  we're now going to do an audio reenactment. But no, but it gets better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there's now a twig listener viewer has created a deep fake video of Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jarvis as Bill Nye. And this, we have the rights to use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They could probably take us down because we're using their video. I don't know.  It's this is, this is,  so give it a credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is worth it. Who did this? I'm geeky. Bill Nye. Trust me.  Cause I'm going to have a Dorton code on and things are going to move behind me  regularly. I'm going to talk about what's the topic here? Oh,  windows and how slow windows is. And I'm going to go to this car.  There's really beat up car, which has a funny windows license plate on it.  And I'm going to say, uh, but I love this car. I don't want to leave,  leave this car, even though the car is out of date and it's a mess and it's got  tape all over it. Oh, there it goes. The part of it falls off.  I put the tape back on. I get in the car and explodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You shouldn't be on old things like windows. You should get a nice,  is this an ad paid for by Google? This is a Chromebook app. This is me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chromebook is already booted. Now I'm going to pull out a Hawaiian shirt and  there's going to be a scene from Hawaii behind me. And I can't remember why.  Look at your hair is actually ruffling. I'm trying to teach you,  but it doesn't matter. All I'm going to do is just go by a Chromebook and,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  um, who did that? That was, that was Ziv Zoolander.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ziv Zoolander. That can't be his real name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ziv Zoolander taking footage from, uh, uh,  Twig and putting it on top of a Google Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm telling you, what's the software? How did he do that?  Cause the lip sync was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He apologized on YouTube for being his first deep fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was very impressed. He says first deep fake video.  So excuse the poor quality.  Also I didn't have time to run more iterations or properly.  And I'm not that experienced with editing or premiere done for the this week in  Google podcast on the Twit Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I thought they pulled that deep fake software,  but I guess either he has it or his, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  his video in our, um, in our show notes.  Here's everyone can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's on GitHub is a tool called deep face lab that is available for download  for free that utilizes machine learning to replace faces in video.  I wonder if he used that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want to understand. He got it. I mean the hair blue,  but he also got angles.  You don't see on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was Bill Nye's hair.  Bill Nye's hair.  Yeah. Right. Okay.  The angle is, is deep fake software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do have, by the way, I just want to say it. I do have good hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do. And it's brighter than Bill Nye's.  So when I go on to MSNBC,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that was the makeup people in the hair.  People always say you have good hair. Yeah. They tell it.  I have good hair. I may be pink, but I have good hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Jeff and I have great skin. That's what they always tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gosh. Yes, you do. I gotta have something. Stacy, something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got real. Hey, you write awesome books. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But seriously, if, if any other viewers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we will accept deep fakes of all sorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop. Stop. We will, we will, we will,  we will have, we will accept deep fakes. Don't encourage that.  That are viewable by a normal human beings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  We will accept deep fakes that are in the spirit of  humor and making people education and that are not obvious.  And our grandmothers could figure it out. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Send us nice videos, please. Actually, I'm looking,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's a lot of deep fake software out there. So ask yourself,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  does it pass the Stacy test? I feel like that's a good test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a perfect. This is a, actually,  I think an educational service we're providing to our audience,  helping them understand not all video you see is real.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is all fake. We are not real. This is the matrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The show does not exist.  I hate the blue pill. Ladies and gentlemen,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
