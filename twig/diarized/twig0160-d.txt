It's time for Twig. This week in Google. Do not let the name deceive you. This show may or may  not have anything to do with Google. It really is all about what our hosts want to talk about.  Whatever they want to talk about. From Chipotle to Glida Habermas.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Gina Trippani of SmarterWear.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello. Hello Gina. How's it going? Good. Excited about the show today. As always. I'm always

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  excited. I look forward to the show all week long. Best hour of the week. Yeah, I think so.  Don't tell the other show hosts. I was going to say don't tell your other show hosts. You say that to all the show hosts.  I do. I say it to all the hosts. That's Jeff Jarvis there. He is a... I do everything to be on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're on vacation at the beautiful Skytop Lodge at the Poconos and I interrupt the vacation to be  on the show because this show is a vacation. Please apologize to Mrs. Jarvis and the Jarvis clan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am sorry. Glad to get rid of you for an hour. He's in the Poconos baby. Jeff is a... No jokes.  Jeff is a professor of journalism. I guess school doesn't start for a while.  Next week. Next week. At the City University of New York, he's also the author of Public Parts  and What Would Google Do? and other great books. Oh also Gutenberg the Geek,  a 99 cent special from Amazon. He blogs at buzzmachine.com. Gutenberg the Geek now available

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in India. They just expanded Kindle singles to India. Oh that's interesting. So is that automatic,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like all Kindle singles now are available in India or did you have... I think so. If you have rights  to yes I think it goes there. If it's yours right. Yeah that makes sense. That's the advantage of  publishing it yourself. It's so amazing the interlocking publishing rights and what a mess  it is internationally. You see it all the time on Audible where there's a book on... in fact  one of the books we've been recommending on Audible was Stephen King's Salem's Lot which  they had for years all of a sudden. It's not there and it's just because the rights expired  and nobody renewed it at some point. I'm presuming. It's just weird. Rights are a bad idea.  All right let's talk. Let's talk Twitter. Is it been... was it this... is it... it feels like I've  been talking about this API change for a long time. It happened right after the last show when we had

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the discussion about App.net. Right after that is when all this stuff broke. Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dalton's timing is pretty darn good with App.net. Yeah it was Thursday last week. Yeah Marco... I  first became aware with Marco Arment's post. He's the creator of Instapaper interpreting some of  Twitter's API changes and this what I would say is arguably the gloomiest interpretation.  Yes. There are those including the guy at TapBots which is the one of the top iOS Twitter clients  who said, oh no it's fine. Don't worry about it. But here's... this all comes from a post on the  Twitter blog by Michael Sippy titled Changes Are Coming in version 1.1 of the Twitter API.  It gets weird after that. For instance, you can't detach photos in a Twitter stream and put them on  another window. No other third party or social actions could be attached to a tweet. In effect,  tweets have to be published exactly as Twitter specifies no matter where you're publishing them.  Tweets that are grouped together into a timeline may not be rendered with non-Twitter content.  Comments, updates from other networks or presumably circles, arrows or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoa but they said Spotify was fine. Not Spotify. Storify was fine but that's exactly what you can  do in Storify is annotate. Right. How could they do... it's not your content Twitter. It's ours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really what the battle is isn't it? Whose tweets are these anyway?  Flipboard's Mike McHugh left Twitter's board apparently recently and Marco assumes because  of these APIs because it would have... I imagine it's going to affect Flipboard.  This is quoting from the post. One of the key things we've learned over the past few years,  this is from Twitter, Michael Sippy, is that when developers begin to demand an increasingly  high volume of API calls, we can guide them towards area of value for users and their  businesses. To that end, and similar to some other companies, we will require you to work with us  directly if you believe your application will need more than 1 million individual user tokens.  And if 1 million sounds like a small number, you'll need our permission if your application  will require more than 100,000 individual user tokens if you're using our user streams product.  100,000. However, you could be grandfathered in. That's why the tap box guy is not upset. He says,  well, you get double what you've got now. And this is specific to traditional Twitter clients,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  not other kinds of Twitter products. Like Flipboard. Oh, it's just clients? Yeah,  traditional Twitter clients. The 100,000 user token permission kind of ceiling applies to  clients that make large amounts of calls to certain endpoints that map to traditional clients.  Does that make sense? So only Twitter clients, like traditional Twitter clients,  are going to get hit by this 100,000 user token. Well, that's significant because that means

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you, without Twitter's permission, you can't have more than 100,000 users. Right. If you make a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  traditional Twitter client. But so something like Starify isn't a traditional Twitter client, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a curation site. Favestar, Cloud. Go ahead. But let me understand though. But the  earlier things that Leo listed about how you can't intersperse other content, you must display the  tweet is the full tweet. You may not put any other social action upon it. That's not just  for Twitter clients. That's for any use of the API. That's for the Huffington Post or Storify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Display requirements do apply to all apps. But yeah, the user cap is targeted toward traditional  Twitter clients. I mean, Twitter's been telling us for 18 months that they are discouraging  developers from making new traditional clients. They're saying, this area is saturated and we  want you to build on Twitter, but we want you to make products that are not traditional Twitter  clients because we've got those already. That's basically what they've been saying for the past  18 months. And these guidelines changes are just kind of like, and this is how we're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  provide that guidance. Paul had added TapBot's response. Don't panic. There's been a lot of  fear, uncertainty and doubt generated by Twitter's latest announcement. I wanted everyone to know the  world isn't ending. Tweetbot for the Mac is still coming out. They're in beta now. Tweetbot for iOS  isn't going anywhere. He says the changes to the API won't affect Tweetbot. All current API calls  are made using Authentica. That's the authentication requirement. That's appropriate by the way, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, this is the thing. I'm a developer. I build Twitter product. I'm building. It uses  the Twitter API as one of its primary, part of its primary function, along with lots of other APIs,  Facebook and Bitly and Google+, et cetera. And I read these changes. There are about five major  bullet points. Three of them are great. Awesome. Per endpoint rate limiting, awesome. Verifying  pre-installed clients, awesome. OAuth across the board, awesome. There's one that's like,  because it really depends on how they enforce it. That's the display requirements. And then there's  one that's pretty yucky for traditional client developers, which is that user token ceiling.  But I got to tell you, as a developer, I was really frustrated with what I thought was wildly  sensationalized and oversimplified headline, which is that Twitter hates developers. Twitter's  turning its back on the people who made it what it is, and they've turned evil. I thought that was a  really, I just thought that was a mischaracterization of what's going on. I definitely think that there  are troubling parts to this announcement, but the majority of it is actually really great for  developers. And I felt like there was just a lot of misunderstanding there. And I thought, Marco has  a section in his post about how there's a lot of subjectivity and uncertainty here, because Twitter  very specifically, very purposefully made a lot of these guidelines broad and open to interpretation.  So we really have to see how they're going to interpret it. Do we really think that Twitter is  going to ban any app that has an email, this tweet link on it, just through, say, Android share menu?  I don't think they will. If they do, that's awful. And I think we have a right to go crazy.  But I think for the most part, these aren't, I don't know, I read these and I thought, like,  not that bad. And I'm building a company on Twitter API, so you could say that it's in my  best interest to be on their good side. No, but you would never do that. If you were pissed off,  you would say so. I absolutely would. That's absolutely true. I absolutely would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Gina is not mealy-mouthed. She's many things, but mealy-mouthed, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've had this conversation before, and Jeff and I have disagreed. I haven't been outraged  about anything that Twitter's done. I'm concerned. And there are bits of these guidelines that trouble  me because they could be enforced in really bad and onerous ways, but Twitter hasn't done that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You agree with your colleague who suggests that you should interpret these changes like you would,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  say, an app store, Apple's app store. This was the irony of Marco's post. Marco's a guy who  has built an entire business on the iOS platform. He's subject to Apple's whims.  How is this any different?  Really, how is this different? I think what's interesting about Twitter is that  because they built such an incredibly easy API and developers took to it so well,  and they're so good to developers through Bootstrap and the patent agreement and the  MySQL open source, that they were really good to developers, and now they're turning bad.  So I feel they're turning bad, quote unquote. So I think there's a sense of betrayal.  You know, like they used to be good to us, and now they're not. Apple was always sort of  jerks, right? So you don't get as outraged about them. Or Google+, which hasn't even  provided an API yet, or Facebook. Some of their terms of use in their API are insane.  So it's interesting to me to watch the reaction. And I think Twitter really has to prove. I mean,  Twitter's communications about this were not needed.  That's the key. That's the key. I was going to ask you that, Gina. So would you agree that  the communications just leave a lot to be desired? Yeah, they really did. I mean, I know Sippy, and  he's a really good writer. And it surprised me that it came across so kind of, the tone was  slightly doomsday from their point of view. Like, oh, we're about to lower the hammer. You're not  going to like this. I mean, it kind of came across that way. And so I love that Anil, my co-founder  rewrote the announcement and kind of with a positive spin, as like, oh, we could rewrite  this announcement this way. And I thought that was an interesting sort of intellectual exercise.  But yeah, I agree that the communications was not, could have been a lot better. And I think that  there were just parts of that announcement that were very developer specific. I think there are a  lot of people saying Twitter's turning their backs on developers who don't really understand  what per endpoint rate limiting really is, and why it really is superior to what they offer now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah. When they say per endpoint, they don't mean per app. They mean per user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They mean per API endpoint. So the Twitter API provides a set of endpoints. So an endpoint would  be like a kind of question you'd ask an API. So an endpoint might be the home timeline,  or the endpoint might be your direct messages or your profile. These are all different questions  that you can ask the API. So right now you get 350 calls per hour across all endpoints per user.  This change, you get 60 calls per endpoint per hour. So if you use more than six endpoints,  right? Because 6, 9, 60 is 360 and 360 is greater than 350. I know I'm doing this quickly.  Basically what Twitter's doing is they're saying you get more API calls per hour across a lot of  endpoints with this change, which puts the squeeze on traditional client apps, traditional Twitter  clients, which are constantly querying the home timeline endpoint, right? Primarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're using one endpoint over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're using one endpoint a lot over and over, exactly. Versus products that use lots of different  endpoints that do something interesting with favorites or do something interesting with pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which ThinkUp does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ThinkUp does do that. Yeah. So I mean, I didn't look for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good for you, bad for Tweetbot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. I mean, just off the top of my head, ThinkUp uses over nine endpoints, right? So  that ups our API call allocation from 315 an hour to 540 an hour. So that's great news. That's great  news for us. And Tweetbot doesn't seem too concerned about it. Honestly, even if you're a traditional  Twitter client and you're being conservative, you're being smart and conservative about your API call,  60 per hour per endpoint is totally reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Tweetbot could make one call and then feed all of its clients with that one call.  So they're saying every second or every minute you make-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's per user per endpoint, right? So like if Leo-  Per user per endpoint. Oh, that's-  Yeah, it's per user per endpoint. So you authenticated, you have tokens,  and your timeline is different than- If you hit the timeline endpoint, the response is going to  be the payload is going to be different than if I hit it, right? Because my timeline looks different  than yours. So it's per user per endpoint, 60 per hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in Anil's blog, he said, our biggest Twitter API upgrade ever. More API calls for almost  every kind of app. Better security by extending OAuth to all APIs. A clear roadmap for Twitter  app developers to know what's encouraged. A few new restrictions for people making traditional  Twitter clients. And when official 1.1 is released, you'll have six months to migrate.  Some have posited, as like Dan Fromer in ReadWriteWeb, this is Twitter saying we want to  survive. They have to do this. Does that seem reasonable, Gina? It's not a money grab. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  need to monetize. I don't know, but that seems to be-  It seems to be why they're doing this. This is one area where I think their communications could  have been different. You want to assume that they want to restrict the display of tweets because  they want to be able to insert advertising or insert links back to Twitter wherever they can,  because they need the eyeballs and they want to keep Twitter users using their tools for the  primary use of Twitter, which is your timeline, your replies, direct messages. So yeah, this seems  like this is about their business model. I agree that this isn't a money grab. I think this is  Twitter figuring out that it needs a business model and figuring out how it's going to do that.  They're taking the long view and saying, we're going to start this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they did anything wrong, it's that they didn't think of this ahead of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Well, look, they've been giving us this guy. For 18 months, they've been saying, hey,  we got the client area covered. Make other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fairness, the founders of Google said, we don't like advertising. We don't want advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said that when I started this network. Boy, that was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So I'll give them all that. I think what probably disturbs people is two things. One is,  yeah, the cultural attitude of it. People do feel as if they really contributed to Twitter's  success by creating conventions, by distributing Twitter, by helping make it popular. And so the  attitude was not, let me be fully open here and explain what we need to do and why we need to do  it. And yes, we're grateful for what you did, but this is the reality of what we have to deal with.  People would deal with that, I think. They should probably have said it that way.  Instead, it was a little bit dictatorial. The second part of this, I think, and this is from  my ignorant, non-developing view, I'm grappling with this in a lot of contexts,  is what's the responsibility of a platform and what's thus the reliability and trust you can  have in a platform to build your future on it. I'm reminded of, and I think I've told this story  before, when I took Daylife originally to Fred Wilson, he said to the founder, Upanishad and on,  can I build a profitable company on your platform? And let me tell you before you answer that the  right answer is yes. And when I complained about some features that were not existent  in Twitter, Fred responded publicly, well, that's what the clients are supposed to make,  the outside developers are supposed to make. So there's a compact there. There's a relationship  there, a covenant that can change and perhaps has to change. I'm not denying that at all,  but I just think it does come down to communication to say, okay, folks, we've tried a  lot of things, here's where we are and here's the reality of that. And we want to bring you along,  but you got to play by these rules to come along. And then I think it'd be a little bit different.  And Neil has a real good point then, but it's not just about gloss over what exists. It's also about  being transparent about the rationale of what's going on, A, and B, about trying to maintain  ongoing trust. Because what Marco's post says at the end, I believe it was his post, said,  I ain't building on Twitter. That's the issue at the end. If there's no trust there,  are they really willing to go alone? And the irony of this is, then Twitter does become a  media company. It becomes a very old fashioned media company. Well, just as I'm telling media  companies to make themselves embeddable and spread their stuff out on the web, Twitter's saying, no,  no, no, you all have to come to our website and we want our page views. That's so 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I mean, if developers interpret this announcement as a giant FU, which many have,  obviously Marco did, and said that he might just rip all the Twitter-related features out of  Instapaper because he can't bear to develop against Twitter's ever-changing rules anymore,  which again, I thought his reaction was extreme. If he interpreted it that way, the risk is that  you're not going to have a Twitter developer come along and say, you know what I want to do? I want  to build a business making a really awesome Twitter client that does all the things that none of the  official clients do. Right. I mean, that's how Tweety happened. That's how TweetDeck happened,  which got acquired by Twitter. Right. So that's how that innovation happened in the beginning.  That innovation is not going to happen now because a developer, no developer in a right mind is going  to build, going to try to build a company and a product with a cap of a hundred thousand user  tokens, at which point you have to kind of apply for permission from Twitter to continue. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Howard Linson and StockTwits and Twitter took over the convention. I would include Bitly on this.  The funny thing is that various of these people who still work with Twitter in some way or another,  I sense are being so cautious, but you know, I'm cautious in becoming hypercritical of Twitter here  because I've made mistakes before when it comes to Twitter. I didn't understand some of the good  work they were doing internationally when they came up with rules and I thought, well, that's a bad  rule. But in fact, you know, the idea that they would censor something in one country, but leave  it in other countries and make it transparent, I didn't get by that that what they were doing was  exposing censorship. You know, it was a good thing. But I'm also a little gun shy with Twitter  now after the Olympics and what they did with Guy Adams' account. That was a cultural problem of  not understanding their responsibility as a platform. And when I argue that media companies  now to become platforms, that's why I'm grappling with this. What does it mean to be a platform?  Son Jake says, you know, you build your business on somebody else's platform, you get what you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  deserve when they pull out the rug. Right. I kind of agree. It's funny, I was saying on Twitter that  we have to wait to see how Twitter actually enforces a lot of this stuff before we can truly  criticize. And Maciej from Pinboard and Jason Cocky, the stellar, they both said to me like,  well, what do you mean? You're not supposed to protest a law until someone gets arrested for it.  And I was like, but Twitter isn't a democracy. We're not voting about whether or not this is okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But with us, Twitter is nothing. The first rule, I wrote a post about kind of trying to explore  these notions of a platform and simply put, without users, a platform is nothing.  That's absolutely true. So it may not be a democracy, but it is a collaboration.  And if it's not collaborating two ways, then it doesn't work as a platform because there's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  two way trust. Right. Absolutely. Absolutely. That's true. You know, my point was like,  I'm going to be outraged if Twitter indeed bans an app for having an email this tweet link in it,  you know, that no social actions bit, which could be interpreted very broadly. Like I'll just,  I'll feel more outraged and I'll feel like they're truly evil if they really don't want us to email  tweets, you know, for example, or, or share a link to Instapaper from a tweet, which is what Marco  brought up in his post. And so, but, you know, but people were saying that I, that we should protest,  you know, these changes now before we actually start to see enforcement. I mean, I'm going to  learn a lot about enforcement because I'm building a Twitter product. So I'll let you know,  you know, if we get, if we get pulled over for something, but, but I think you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Gina, isn't it a weird thing you're saying you're, you're, you're saying that you,  you are not going to build it to the letter of the law because you're assuming they don't mean the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I know. I mean, I'm going to comply. I'm going to comply with the display requirements.  I'm going to comply with the, with the changes. What Twitter's asking me to do,  whatever terms I've accepted when I said I want to use this API, I'm going to comply with, but  like, for example, the, the Android example, I think is a good one. Android, you have a sort  of a built in share menu, right? You can tap something and say, share this to email, share  this to messaging. That's a social action. If you, if you interpret that very broadly, you know,  is Twitter really going to, am I going to take that, for example, menu, am I going to disable  that menu on tweets? Because if you interpret this guideline very, very strictly, you know,  the Twitter might ban the app. No, of course not. I'm going to leave it in there. And if Twitter  calls me out on it, then I'm going to pound my fists and say that they've gone evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm going to go back to your point about democracy. I, I, it's not a democracy.  You're absolutely right. But Twitter has to acknowledge publicly that it depends upon you  developers. And I think that they did at the beginning, I was at a conference where Biz  Stone was asked along with Chad Hurley and Reid Hoffman from, by Wall Street guy. Well,  what big company do you want to do a deal with? They looked at them like they were confused  German shepherds with their, their heads cocks. They said, why would we do that? No,  our, our users and our developers distribute us. We, we rely on our ecosystem. It's a member of an  ecosystem. And let me just do this real fast. But, but when I wrote the post, I, I tried to come up  with some rules for platforms, right? The first I think is that users come first. If, if you don't  believe in that, then you're creating a walled garden. You're creating a service. Hey, user or  loser, we don't care. It's, it's like a telephone company. Second, a platform is defined by its  users. If it's truly a platform, you don't necessarily know how everyone will use it.  Only through its use do you learn what it is. The platforms collaborate. If you don't collaborate,  it's a dead thing. A platform changes and the platforms need principles that a platform,  I think should be transparent. It should enable portability. These are principles  and that it has to be reliable. If you can't rely on it, if you cannot trust it to be what you think  it is going to be, if you can't rely on it to at least be transparent about its changes,  then is it really a platform? Now is Twitter a platform then? Or is it becoming  AOL? People always say, oh, Facebook is the next walled garden, the next AOL. Is Twitter trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to become the next AOL? Can you be a platform for people, but not a platform for developers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so because I think people are developers. Even if you don't write code,  people who put in hashtag or at sign in Twitter. That's true. But they're not disenfranchised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People would use it. So in other words, people argue, I would say, I would submit that  these API changes affect developers. And so Twitter might be saying, we don't want to be a  platform for developers. We want to be a platform for people. For users, for people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for Justin Bieber fans. And it's less about power users and developers and more about  regular people. That's not unreasonable, is it? Right. In fact, a lot of these changes empower  regular users. So getting your apps certified, apps that come pre-installed devices must be  certified. The display requirements are going to, those things are going to reduce confusion and  you know, make a consistent experience, right? Which is what Sippy's last blog post headline was,  creating a consistent user experience for regular people. I mean, I think this is just the tech  community reckoning with the fact that Twitter isn't for the elites anymore. We got app.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pay 100 bucks and join app.net if you want to learn more. I have $50.com.  Yeah, something like that. Yeah. But I mean, seriously, if the tech community wants,  there's plenty of places the tech community can go. Twitter is pretty much saying,  we want to be for real people. We want a business model. And I don't think real people know or care  about APIs, 50 bucks, stewardship platforms or anything else. Do you think regular people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  seeking out non-Twitter clients? I mean, regular people are typing Twitter into the app store  right? Search box, right? They're not typing in. No, they don't even have to because it comes with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the iPhone. Oh, right. So they don't, then that's what Twitter wants, by the way, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Twitter built itself on the back of those developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was my question is, should Twitter have thought of this earlier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could Twitter be what Twitter is without those developers? I would argue absolutely not.  No, I agree, too. Twitter without the at sign would be useless. Twitter without the hashtag  would not allow people to organize revolution. And all of that came from third parties, not from  Twitter. Absolutely. Twitter is smart, but it's not smart enough to have built Twitter. But putting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  myself in Twitter's shoes, I would say, well, that's true. But now we need to survive. We need to  monetize. And we need to be a less confusing, more consistent platform for the real people  who are using us. That was then this is now. And don't develop on it.  Right. And don't develop on it. We'll take it from here. Is it immoral or dishonorable to have built  a company on developers backs at five years later to say, hey, you know, that's nice. Thanks. We've  got enough clients. They're not saying to tap bots, don't make a tweet bot anymore. They're just saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  no more new ones. Although they're saying they're saying you can make it. But but you know, at 100,000  user tokens, you're going to have to talk to us if you want to go beyond that. Yeah. I think I know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not I'm not defending Twitter by any means, but I but I I think I understand what they're saying.  It's now what my question is, is it wrong? Is it bad? Is should they not be hubris? And it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hubristic. It's thinking that they can go it alone now. And it's a bit Weasley in that it  rejects a community that made them what they are. Weasley. They're saying we got this right. So the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  reason why Twitter was built on the backs of developers, really, it was users making up new  conventions like at replies and retweets and independent developers being faster than Twitter  proper to make clients to support those things because Twitter proper was so small and unproven  and was just dealing with stopping the fail whale every day. Right. But now Twitter's got  the infrastructure and the team and the clients and they're basically saying we got this any new  traditional client features we can handle where you know, we're building cards, we're innovating,  we're innovating kind of internally. So we got this, you guys do the other stuff. So it is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a little bit of hubris. Here's the analog. OS 10 is built on an open source kernel mock kernel and  BSD. So they built up now they never made it. Apple never made a promise to that community.  And they made a little bit of a promise we'll give back Darwin, blah, blah, blah. But they're  built on IMDB, CDDB, many there are many, many CDDB is actually the most most accurate analog,  which was a database of CD information that was created by users at which went basically private.  And they said, Okay, we got it. From here. It's happens a lot, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it is it immoral? Is it unethical for a company to grow and change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially if you accept the premise that they couldn't survive. That's, I think that's the  crux of it. Do they have to do this? Is it greed? Or was it necessity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't know because they haven't they really haven't told us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Dan from her says it was necessity. What's the downside of so I guess the downside is we  must put ads and tweets and if those ads don't appear. Right. Yeah, I mean, I wrote another post  this last week, trying to rethink copyright, not that it's hardly the first one doing that. There's  millions of people trying to rethink it. But but but it occurs to me that there's a notion of what  I call credit, right, the right to credit, right to move things on. And that that creates new models.  And so I saw a company I might have mentioned last week called repost dot us dimension them  that enables an article become embeddable. So that that I wanted to build this because no one  would build it. But luckily, along came a company that did it. And it's really very cool that an  article could travel and be embedded like a YouTube video with brand advertising, your own  advertising, the creators advertising, the creators analytics and the creators links associated with  it. So rather than trying to get everybody to come to your site, which is the old media model,  now you can go to where the readers are. And what that has embedded in it is the business model  that says, Yeah, you need advertising and analytics to travel with your content. If it's going to  travel anyway, let's take advantage of that leap on top of it. So, you know, I argue that, yes,  the creator has some rights to create those rules by which this can happen. So is Twitter  right to say we think these buttons have to travel with the stuff that we created? Okay,  the only thing is, but there is not one shred of content was on Twitter was made by Twitter  was made by its users. And so we asked you is it democracy or not? No, it's not. But it should act  a little bit more like one with an acknowledgement that if we left tomorrow, and this is why Google  says, don't be evil, not because they're virtuous, but because being evil is really bad business now.  Is this evil? No, I think it weasel is as high as I'll go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, evil, evil would be saying to Justin Bieber, hey, we can't afford you because we have to do a  five extra servers just for your content. So could you rate limit your tweets? Or evil might be  saying you can only have 1.5 million followers. Or we'll charge you from  or what? Well, I don't know if that's evil. Actually, that might make more sense. Maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's what's next. I don't know. Well, I guess that's what app that would argue. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. crappy is saying you can only retrieve 3200 of your your own tweets from the service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but has that slowed down growth of Twitter? And that's been this case all along  since almost the beginning has that slowed down the growth of Twitter at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, if a platform doesn't adhere to certain principles, it does not necessarily slow down  growth, right? If you make a great product, which Twitter has, you get huge adoption,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which they have, you know, yeah, you have Twitter, Twitter's looking at the number of people they have  on Twitter. And they're saying we're doing everything right. Now we just need to figure out a way to make

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  money. On the question of how tweets are displayed, you know, it's interesting, Jeff, like you're  saying, this is our content. So Twitter shouldn't dictate the way that tweets are displayed. But if  apps I mean, who should decide how tweets are displayed app makers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Exactly the right question, Gina. Yeah, I don't know. All I'm saying is that yes,  Twitter does have a right to say this, but it's not an exclusive right. It's not a right that  goes beyond the interests of its users. And so if there are apps that come down the pipe that I as  a user would like to exist, we users would like to exist, but they now can't because Twitter  exclusively said no, you can't do that for reasons that they have. That's Weasley behavior to its  users. See rule number one, a platform is its users. And the end of the day, a platform without

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  users is not a platform. Right. Right. That's what I'm saying. It's a platform for users now.  Thank you app developers. It's not a platform for you. The user, but the but what does Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  become? Twitter became what Twitter became because developers. Yeah, but it's done.  That's the real question, Leo. Is it done? Is Twitter is Twitter baked now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's baked. Yes, it's baked. You see it's hash. You see Twitter hashtags on every television show.  It made it. It's done. Thank you. We'll take it from here. I admit, you know, it's I believe  in you dance with the one that brung you but I can understand why they might say, hey, you know,  we've got investors, the ones that brung them are the people that put $150 million into Twitter's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  infrastructure. That's what made Yahoo thought it was baked. Google never interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll tell you the couple of apps that I'm really concerned about given these guidelines. Time hop.  You guys have used time hop. I think we talked about it. I love it. Yeah. So they email you a  year ago tweets. They're not going to be able to do it. Yeah. I mean, well, they just they even if  they comply with the display requirements, they just add a new feature where you can comment on  and ask somebody like so if I get your year ago tweet, I can ask for an explanation. I can be like,  Hey, what did this mean? But that's that's a comment on another service, you know, a third party  service. So I'm worried about that one. And I'm worried about stellar stellar that I owe which  which Jason cocky makes, which is kind of like a list of all your friends, favorite tweets.  It's awesome. There's always great content there. And it's favorites across several networks, flicker  YouTube, etc. But Jason, Jason's a designer, and he put a lot of thought and work into making tweets,  you know, to making the reading experience really nice and being really minimal about what meta  information it shows, you know, he shows in every tweet. And for him to comply with the display  requirements, it's going to add all the little the Twitter glitter, you know, the the the retweet  button, the reply button, the favorite button, the avatar and all that. So so I'm concerned,  I want to be clear with everyone that I am concerned about these changes. And I think it's  going to affect some apps that are even not traditional Twitter clients badly. And I'm really  hoping that Twitter is going to take that Facebook approach of like break things and then kind of,  you know, break things fast and then and then fix them later. I'm hoping that Twitter is going to  iterate on these changes and maybe clarify some of the guidelines or requirements and maybe be a  little little more lenient than the worst interpretation. And that's just a hope. And  we're going to see this this these changes roll out in the next few weeks, the coming weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I, Regina, I've made a mistake before. Emphasize this again, I've made a mistake before  thinking that Twitter took a wrong turn when it took right turns. And I'm not saying that these are  absolutely wrong terms, I may not understand. So the problem here may be a problem of communication  and transparency, or it may be a problem of culture and substance. I don't know yet. But I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but I want to know. Yeah, I do too. I'm just sad because besides using ThinkUp to archive my tweets,  I've been using a WordPress plugin for years that automatically archives my tweets. And I put up  there's a blog post every week, I don't think anybody ever reads it, because there's never any  comments on it. But on my blog, there's a post every Sunday night of my Twitter updates for the  week. And it's as much for me to be able to look back at that week, you know, 10 years from now,  because Twitter is not going to let me do that. So these are all archived. I mean, I don't think  Twitter is going to notice this plugin. But if they do, this is clearly a violation of their

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right? Because yeah, that definitely those don't don't comply. There's no reply. There's no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tweet. This is a pure case of this being your content. It's my content being archived from

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter. Absolutely. Absolutely. You should be able to display your tweets on your blog,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  however you want in any way you want. Yeah, I wrote it. So I guess if there were a lot of people like  me who really thought that was important, that could hurt Twitter. But I suspect that that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that that's not the case. It's just that goes into reading Twitter's TOS because are you granting  Twitter a non exclusive license of that content, in which case you're just exercising your own use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of that of your content? Well, and this is what I've always said is that for years, it's why I keep  quitting Twitter. Number one Twitter quitter, as I have been for years. In fact, we were going over  on app.net all of the places that I have left Twitter for, starting with Jaiku. Remember that  and pounce and plirk and buzz. And I can go on and on I keep I because I want somewhere that  will treat my and status net or Danica. I want somewhere that will tweet my content as my content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So when it was simple panda says don't forget spoloink is that actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think there's a splink. There could be I don't know. I like Jaiku you know,  john I really really Google bottom put them out of their misery. I guess you can open source the  code though. The code is open source, you could make your own Jaiku server. Because it had  threaded it was everything Twitter wasn't. But it didn't make it. And that's the that's really  the bottom line. Now was it the developers that may without guess it was it was developer  ecosystem that made Twitter Twitter. Why didn't pounce succeed pounce was great.  Why didn't Jaiku succeed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it because they came after Twitter? Maybe the network effect right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all critical mass and when you hit critical mass, then the rules change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter something changed on Twitter when Ashton Kutcher and Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber when the  celebrities discovered it that was the that was when they turned the corner right Britney Spears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that was that was a big part of it, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that to me was the first reason to get the hell out of there. As soon as Ashton Kutcher  was there. It's like I don't want to be here. Unfortunately, that's where everybody is.  I don't know. It's fascinating. I, I like app.net. I don't think that's gonna make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, but I really like where Jeff is getting where Jeff is what Jeff is poking out right now,  which is like what what makes a platform a platform? What should the principles of a  platform be? You know what what things out there really are platforms or what are just kind of  media companies? I know you don't know. But that's what I like about this is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you're what this show is kind of about. Right. Right.  Cloud is really possible because platforms is a platforms networks. The way I draw the world  now on the whiteboard is that you had vertically integrated industries that are now replaced by  three levels, platforms, entrepreneurial efforts that can start now because those platforms exist,  and then networks that are necessary oftentimes to bring those entrepreneurial efforts to critical  mass for things like purchasing or audience. And the network really is just a special case  of platform. Right. That's true. And value today falls to the platforms because that's that's who  adds together. So Google and Twitter and so on. I think I think it starts to shift over time.  So I've been arguing that newspapers should think of themselves as platforms for their communities.  Universities should think of themselves as platforms for students, futures and education.  Governments should be platforms. Tim O'Reilly, if he shows up, will probably talk about that.  That's what he was government 2.0 is all about. So in that case, it means people like Yochai  Benkler, who do brilliant work about networks and what networks are. But I think the network kind of  exists in an ecosystem on its own. They form like atoms and molecules. A platform is an explicit act  to create something that people use and thus depend upon to build something response.  Benefits come from that huge benefits flow that if you become a platform that makes critical mass,  you get huge benefit once you figure your business model. But responsibilities also flow. So that's  what I'm trying to get at. Gina is I'm trying to understand what we should expect those responsibilities  to be and can we ever depend upon them or, you know, Steve, but nothing. And I will argue about  whether Google has to be evil because the company, I don't think all companies have to be evil.  I think today, you know, it's bad business to be evil. But maybe platform, maybe we can't depend on  platforms. Maybe it's fools, Aaron, to ever depend on platforms because they must be what they must

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  be, which is companies and they will change. Unless they're open source, which is why I like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  open source. Which is, which is okay. So if you can build. So then the other question that came  about Twitter, could you really forget who wrote about this? So I apologize for not not citing,  but someone not me wrote that. Okay, smart asses. You think you want a Twitter to be federated.  But what if the tweets ended up coming, you know, 10 minutes or 10 days later?  You know, you, you, you have a high, you have a low tolerance for, yeah. And so you witness  the fail well. So, so you want a company to run this once a company runs it, folks,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  then the rules change again. I think some of this comes down to your definition of platform. And  this is what I was trying to get at was the traditional definition of platform is an operating  system as a platform. Microsoft created, in fact, you could really say that Microsoft created the  platform that powered the personal computer industry for many, many years because it provided  a reliable, stable API and service platform for developers to use. It was those apps on top of  Microsoft Windows that made it all work. That's it. To my mind, that's one kind of platform. But  I think we're seeing the emergence of a second kind of platform. And this kind of the point I  was making, which is Twitter was originally like Windows, that kind of a platform and developer  platform. But they quickly realized that really what they are is a platform for users, a content  platform. And that's, I don't, I don't think the rules are the same for a newspaper as platform  as they are for an operating system as platform. I think the rules are different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but I go back to that notion of, Gina brought it up, you know, the RT,  that the fact that it was users were not developers, but they acted like developers. They  created a function through a, you know, they had, they added to the API, they added a convention.  Yeah. And Gina, what do you think a platform is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, a platform enables users, enables people to do, to get things done, right? So I,  you know, it's interesting. I mean, I think that question that you and Siva talked about is whether  or not if a company is in charge of a platform, do the rules change? I mean, is Twitter's goal to  be a platform is Twitter's goal to stick around and provide a great service. You know, I mean,  and I think about the iOS app store, right? Is it platform? That's a platform for developers to sell  their apps and it's all and it's Apple's rules. It's not, it's not an open deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is the point Marco makes for a platform to be successful for developers has to be consistent.  Yes. And that's what Twitter's not been. You need, you need, you know, Microsoft succeeds  as a platform, particularly Microsoft, because it never changed the API and never changed the  rules. It was really consistent and you control the rules, but you didn't have to get approval.  Yeah. But you didn't have to get approval to come over the product.  And I don't know if approval is a disadvantage or not. As long as the,  as long as the environment is known and stable as it is with the app platform on iOS,  I don't think it's, it's a matter of control is really the issue. It's that we want to be,  it has to be consistent. That's what Marco was saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. You say, right. The inconsistency freaked him out. And he felt like if these changes are  being launched now, what happens next year or the year after? Do we really think that the app store  has been totally consistent? I mean, haven't there been enough sort of app store snafus this whole  time? And also it's just Apple's nature to be very controlling. They're the whole widget company,  right? I mean, Apple's never going to build something on top of an open platform. They want  to control the whole experience top to bottom and they've been very successful, you know, doing that.  And, you know, when they launched the iOS platform, they were also, they're also a  multi-billion dollar company. Twitter was a tiny little startup and would have done anything to  get anybody to use it, including developers in the beginning. And that's why they made an API that  was totally insecure. I mean, remember when you could pass your username and password along  access the API. I mean, they made it just so easy for anybody. And that's why some developers loved  it. I mean, I think tons of web developers really cut their teeth on API development on the Twitter  API because it was so easy. And so they went from very, very liberal to more restrictive and  people don't respond well to that. Right. But if you're Apple and you start very restrictive  and you set the tone, this is what it is. Then, you know, you feel more secure. You know, Marco  obviously feels that Apple's been very consistent this whole time. I don't know. I mean, things  change. I feel like things have changed in the app store as well. I mean, there's uncertainty about  everything. Whenever you're building something on someone else's business, that relies on someone  business, there's risk. I mean, there's risk when you cross the street, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's again, this is why consistency is so important. You have to make, you know, it's so,  I don't think it's a problem. Jeff, you seem to think it was a problem if a platform is owned by  a company. No, I agree with Siva that it has to be because it has to be a dictator. A platform is  ultimately a dictatorship because otherwise it's inconsistent. And so it has to be absolutely  consistent. But it's a collaborative. Well, it's a mix, isn't it? You have to be, you have to,  a platform means stable. I can build on this. If it's a moving, shifting sand, it's not stable.  It's not a platform. A platform doesn't move. That means it's a dictatorship. Now you can do all  sorts of loopy things on top of it, but that platform. Well, that's the, yeah, I mean,  that's why I think Microsoft is probably better at making platforms than Linux was.  And Apple too. But even Linux is somewhat of a dictatorship. And Melinus was smart enough  to say it's not Linux unless I say it's Linux. Oh, I mean, open source. Yeah. The key part of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  successful open source projects is a benevolent dictator, but dictator indeed. And, you know,  Apple introduced the Mac app store. I mean, I have to buy my apps through the Mac app store a certain  way. And now they're building into OS X ways to say, oh, this app hasn't been verified. I haven't  installed the latest update yet, but differentiating between official Apple apps and then Apple app,  apps that you just download off the web. I mean, they've gotten more restrictive over time as well.  I mean, I think there's just a lot of uncertainty around Twitter in general because people still  understand how they're going to make money and what they really are. And they don't make,  they're sort of indicating that they're not really sure what they are and their communications,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as we said, which is okay. Which is okay. I mean, again, Google shifted. I don't have any  objection to that at all. People have joked about, and I've joked about to Fred Wilson's face about,  you know, oh, Twitter now has a business model 10 times. I think everybody would understand that.  Everyone would say, listen, this is the reality. This is the path we're taking. You may not like  it. You may think advertising is corrupting or whatever, but it's the way we're going to go.  And I'm cool with that. I just think there's a cultural issue there of communication.  And it's all the worse when you hit that point of critical mass when you think you don't need  your developers anymore. That's what's weasely about it. And if you say, no, we still do,  or we're still, we still do in some extent, but in some cases we don't because we can't afford to.  And here's why. Here's the reality we have. I'd respect it a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's fair. I think a great conversation. We're going to move on, but  that was fun. I think this is kind of really key. Not just, it's not about Twitter at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is what this show was really about. When Gina said, the rule day one is it's not,  Gina, as I understood, said to you, I'll be on it if it's not really a show about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not, it's never been a show about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a show about the cloud. And what it really is about is platforms and networks and all that.  The cloud is just one, one substantiation of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that the conversation about the conversation about what a platform is,  what the rights and responsibilities are of a platform maker is fundamental to everything we  love in technology. I don't care if it's an operating system or, or a semiconductor or any

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of that stuff. Yeah. I was arguing for this week in the cloud, but clearly Leo made the superior

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  editorial decision. I knew that nobody would listen to a show about the cloud. About the cloud.  Yeah. Now they might, you know what? Now they might, but when we launched this show 160 episodes ago,  um, it was a much better branding to talk to. And we talk more mostly about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We do. We do. Well, Google is a big part of the cloud. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad I didn't title my book. What would the internet do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Specificity is, is good in titles, even if you, and by the way,  foolish consistency is a hobgoblin of small minds. So there, uh, we're going to take a break and  come back. You can parse that all you want. We're going to take a break. Come back in just a second  with more of Jeff and Gina and yes, Google news. Don't worry. We're not going to talk about  Apple Samsung on this show at all. I can promise you, I can promise you. Um, feist though, a word  about Ford. I will talk about Ford on this show. And this is something interesting Ford's doing.  That's kind of along these lines. They created a social site, social.ford.com.  And there's really, this is a company that really is thinking about, uh, what it means to be a car  company, what it means to be a business in the 21st century and, uh, is really responding to  that clue train manifesto where the dialogue has marketing is a conversation. Business is a  conversation between you and the customer. And this site is a perfect example. I mean,  they're making it fun. You can get a grab a, I don't even know what these bad, I guess people  use these badges on, uh, on Facebook and, uh, other places you can grab a badge, but that's part of it  is identity. Isn't it? You want to identify as a, I, a friend of mine says I'm a Ford family. We're  a Ford family. And I think that's what happens. People do that with their cars. Oh yeah. We're  Ford. We always, my dad was Ford. So you, if you're a Ford family, you can get a badge. I think this  is, you know, Ford, I drive one, or you can have a badge for your particular car, which is great.  I have the, uh, the Mustang badge and then they made one for us, which is funny. There's a geek  badge. We're, let me see if I can find it. It's because they're, they're very aware of a technology  as well. Actually, there's quite a few of these. I'm going through a lot of badges here. Here's the  geek badge. Nope. Here it is. Tech geek. We don't have hobbies. We have purpose. You're not just  ahead of the curve. You're the one leading it. You can take that badge right there and put it in,  stick it where the, the stories shine. You also can put your ideas on here or read other people's  ideas, which I think is really a cool idea. There are, for instance, in technologies slash  convenience, there are 1,540 ideas. There are 2,483 green ideas there. This is a good way to see  what's important to people. 2,926 infotainment idea. So you can see what really matters to people.  There's also articles. In fact, I wrote one, just a little one, uh, cause I had an interesting  conversation with, uh, one of Ford's engineers about autonomous vehicles. Uh, what Fort, what  kind of technologies Ford using? I actually want to talk to them again. I don't mean I'll get them  on the horn again and talk to them about, um, uh, security. Cause we were talking today about, uh,  the car computer and its security, but here's some interesting, uh, uh, stuff in here that I  posted recently on here. There's lots of, this is it. Ford social at social.ford.com ideas, images,  videos, articles, and yes, you can grab yourself a little, a little badge. It's Ford's social  site, social.ford.com. I admit it. I'm a Ford. We're a Ford family. You know, Leo, a badge is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the new bumper sticker. There we go. I'd love to see badges made into bumper stickers. Ah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so there that's interesting. So it's a, how appropriate for Ford. Yeah. And so, yeah, really.  And so what you put it on your website, you put it on your Facebook, that kind of thing. It's like  a bumper sticker for Facebook. That's interesting. Very interesting. Let's see. Let's talk about  Google. Google updates Android voice search to support 13 new languages. That gives it a hundred  million new users. That's non-trivial to add languages. It's incredible to add 13  languages. They have now 42 languages and regional accents in 46 countries. So localization is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  huge pain when you're dealing with text. I can't imagine voice recognition localization. You can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  use voice search in Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Portuguese, European, or South American. That's  two different ones. Finnish, Galatian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Norwegian, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and Swedish. Wow. That's really cool. Have you used the Google Translate voice to voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I know they just added that. Is it cool? I mean, it's really remarkable. When Eric Schmidt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  demoed it once, he said that it's the new Google Translate app. It'll bring world peace. So you can  be in a country and say to someone, but it now is voice to voice. So you can hold it for somebody  and say, speak, and it will come back and translate to you back into voice. And then you can speak to  it and it will translate back to them in voice. Wow. That's very useful. Very useful. Why don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have it? I should get it. It's a separate app, Jeff? It's the Google Translate app, yes.  Okay. Let me see how I got it here. You're right. It's a separate app. I saw it in the update. I'm  going to download it so I can play with it. So choose languages. I'll do English to German.  Yeah, because you know German. You can tell us how good this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll see. But my German is bad, so we'll see. So now I'm going to enter text below. Now I think I  can enter... Oh, yeah, I can enter text. I thought so. Why is it not doing that? Where's my microphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. So English to... I'm going to do English to French because I kind of can sort of understand  French. Do you see a microphone on there? Let me see. Yeah. You don't have the new one, dude.  Okay. Ready? Where is the pen of my aunt? Oh, I got it wrong. It got it. Now, how do I play it? Oh, here.  Where is the pen of my aunt?  Not even close. It got... It said... Let me do another one here. Give me a sentence to say.  My name is Leo and I am a television and... Sorry, I didn't finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The fastest way to get yourself thrown into an asylum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh? Let's do a different one. What else? What should I say? Where is the train station?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. See, that'd be great. Where is the train station?  Hold on here and let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Each tine a ballena.  Does it speak Pocono?  Is there a bathroom near here because I really need one?  That's good. That's good. I think any Frenchman would understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did it emphasize the really? Yeah. It said, je vraiment besoin d'un.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vraiment means I truly need one. And by the way, it translated mine with cuz as C-U-Z.  That's the English. That's funny.  Hold it up to the mic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Station. Train station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It got train station. This is good. This will be very handy when you travel.  This is the Babel fish that everybody... So it's not just that you can do search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can now tie languages together at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the languages it translates French, Spanish, Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Armenian,  Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarus, Bengali, Bulgarian. I mean, it's just a long list.  I want this in my Google glasses. Oh, Latin. It does Latin.  Here. Here's Latin for is there a bathroom near here because I really need one.  It is. That's actually pretty accurate. As I remember from my high school Latin.  I don't know how they had to pronounce it. Yeah. I was going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a dead language. I was like, there was a word for bathroom.  I guess it was just sort of the hole in the ground. That is kind of amazing.  Latrina. Latrina is the word for bathroom. If you're truly stranded in a country where  you don't speak the language and you're trusting Google to translate your English correctly or  your native language correctly, I mean, that's really putting a lot of trust into Google's hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say here's Vietnamese. If I don't speak Vietnamese, I'd have no idea how accurate this is.  I would just hope they'd point me to a bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. And you just come put in jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks good. Wow. So that's the other thing is that you can change the language.  You can say that once and change the language. Yeah. He hail me a tuk tuk.  Hail me a tuk tuk. It's a tuk tuk. Hail me a tuk tuk.  I don't know. It translated tuk tuk into Van Ban.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if you say taxi, if it'll translate into tuk tuk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll never know because I'm stopping right now.  That we'll leave as an exercise for the listener. I think that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't it? I want to have my Google glasses for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I have to say everybody, I am not kidding. This is a huge challenge for Apple.  The new iPhone comes out September 12th and I see more and more people who would nominally be  automatic iPhone purchasers seeing stuff like that and going, hmm. And Google now, I think Jelly Bean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is so compelling. It's really coming together. Right? Just Gmail and Calendar, the number of  people I know who rely on those who now prefer the experience of those things in Android.  It starts to come together. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And more importantly, the awareness is starting to rise among normal people.  I always kind of make this a habit looking as I walk around town iPhones and it has been  predominant like 90% iPhones, especially in Northern California. Until recently,  I'm seeing more and more Android phones and I'd say it's 50-50 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jake taught this summer at a great thing called ID Tech Camp. They do them in campuses around  Stanford and NYU and he was at Princeton. And he said all the fellow counselors were all geeks  teaching how to program. Jake taught how to program iOS apps. But all the counselors were  all using, the instructors were all using Android phones. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh. Yeah. But that's a bellwether  because those are the geeks. Those are the influencers.  I said we weren't going to talk about Apple Samsung, but really the truth is Apple Samsung,  the jury is now deliberating really Samsung is a proxy obviously for Google.  And Google has responded via its proxy, Motorola, patent infringement lawsuit against Apple  with the US International Trade Commission asking the ITC to block Apple from importing the iPhone,  iPad, iPod touch and various Apple computers.  Oh dear. It's getting ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, an ITC judge has already issued it previously a preliminary ruling in a previous  Motorola versus Apple case and said that Apple did indeed infringe on one of Motorola's patents.  So sometime next week, what kind of hell would break loose if the ITC said,  yeah, Apple, you can no longer sell any device in the US?  What kind of, you know, the backlash to Google and Motorola on this one is not worth winning this  case. Yeah. I mean, they better hope they don't get a judgment in their favor, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I thought that Google wasn't going to use patents offensively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Well, I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's interesting that Motorola's official statement worded it that we have little choice,  but to defend ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We would like to settle these patent matters, but Apple's unwillingness to work out a  license leaves us. This is what Apple said to Samsung, by the way. We would like to work out.  This is what we, this mutually assured destruction. This is what it's all about.  You buy patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, the same time this week, someone at Google, I didn't put on the rundown, I forgot,  argued in favor of getting rid of software patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. Oh, everybody's, everybody is an agreement.  Yeah.  It's just too expensive. It's too much money and time is wasted. It's a deathblow to innovation.  But as long as those laws exist, well have had it.  YouTube is going to let users decide whether they want to see ads on mobile.  I am shocked. Shocked. On Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what that says to the advertiser is this is a real view.  Right.  They can charge much more for it.  Ah, they armed it in.  Video is working on mobile and that, you know, the usage going to mobile is tremendous,  but it's known as a horrible place for advertising. Where do brand advertisers like to go? TV.  Bad rep on mobile. Put the two together. I think it's a clever move. Whether it works or not,  we'll see. But I think it's a very clever move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're right, because they're calling it true view. So that's, this really was viewed.  Right. That's the idea.  Do people really want to watch ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's this going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is from the New York Times, Bits blog, Claire Kane Miller writing,  do people really want to watch ads? Yes, the executives say.  Say they're lounging on their sofa, watching funny YouTube videos on their phone. By the way,  this is via the mobile site. This is not an app. They might want to watch a trailer for a new movie  from Paramount Pictures. Or if they're watching videos to get new style ideas and L'Oreal offers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a beauty video, they might be interested. You know, Leo, what occurs to me the second is  what Google did with AdSense was force the advertiser to create an ad that performed.  And then they were forced to do cost per click.  Right. And so it's almost the same here is that Google say to the advertiser,  you better have a good ad or nobody's going to want to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, Dig did this, didn't they? Dig said you could, Dig, you could opt out of ads on  Dig. And I thought that was quite innovative. And I think it's the same exact motivation, which is,  hey, if people don't opt out, they're really paying attention. It's a better ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought that Dig was that you could like Dig or bury an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the same thing. You could say, I don't ever want to see it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right. Right. But it'd be interesting to see if YouTube took this a step forward and  said the ads that get skipped the most, you know, don't get played at all. But that doesn't really  make sense. Right. Because if you haven't seen the ad, then you can't judge it. You know, it's not an

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  editorial judgment. According to YouTube on desktop computers, between 15 and 45% of YouTube  viewers, that's a big number, 15 to 45, that's a big range, generally choose to watch specific ads.  65% of video ads shown before videos pre-roll now offer the choice to skip. Right. You see that skip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I always skip. I always skip too. You shouldn't say that, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't skip. I don't always. I do almost always. But there are moments when I'll get hooked and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  say, oh, I actually care about that. You're right. And this is the challenges to the advertiser to  make the ads compelling. If the ads good and it's interesting and it's something I want to know more  about, or I just want to see, I'm going to watch it. I'll watch the app. Oh, by the way, Apple pulled  those genius ads they showed in the Olympics with the, they took them off YouTube and they took them  off their site. They said, well, we never intended for anybody to see it after the Olympics. I think  they were embarrassed. Phil Farhe, group product manager for monetization at YouTube. I want that  title. Oh yeah. I'm a product manager for monetization. Much better user experience,  says Phil, where the user actually feels in control of their advertising in the same way  as they feel in control of their content. I would completely agree actually. And content creators  are capable of earning more money in a more user friendly environment. Finally, they're realizing,  look, you can't force people to watch ads. You have to, you have to, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the other value to YouTube is that it becomes a more pleasant YouTube experience.  Right? Cause how often do you start watching stuff and say, okay, I've seen that five times now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hell with it. By the way, they're basically implying that they're not sure this is going to  work. They just, they're going to try this out. Yeah. So they don't know. Hey, if I could put a  skip ad button in our shows, I would. Absolutely. I would. It would, it would change the way we  charge. We'd have to track you. You wouldn't mind if we track you, would you? Not a bit, Leo.  That's, you know, all the people who ate tracking cookies, the problem is that for these things to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  work, you got to have metrics. A and B, one of the reasons, one of the benefits to the user for  tracking cookies is frequency control. Right. You'll get the same ad over and over and over  again. Frequency control says, I don't want to waste my money shortening to you again. And it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  tops out. It's really too bad that they don't call those ad preference cookies or something like that  because that's really what they are. They're ad preference cookies. Google play gift cards are here  just in time for Christmas or, you know, labor day. And you can get them at Target, Radio Shack,  and GameStop. So now this is parity with the iTunes. Of course, iTunes gift cards are a huge,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  huge revenue for Apple, I would guess. And it's a big grandma opportunity. That's, that's, that's  the opportunity. One of my kids wants now, they want iTunes gift cards. Absolutely. That's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we've always given the kids. They're great stocking stuffers. Everybody loves it. Now I don't know if,  now this will be a real test because let me ask Chad, would you rather get a Google play card

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or an iTunes card? That's a good question. 10 years 16. Now here's the thing is the Google play  card doesn't work with everything on the Google play store. So you can't buy say a Google device  with a play card. No, no, no, it's for content. Right. So you can, and, and you can't buy certain,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  buy a Macintosh with an iTunes card. Or I guess you could. Yeah. No, you can't. Not for an iTunes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  card. No, you can get Apple. But you don't, you don't see a Macintosh in the iTunes store. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, but I can't use, I have a, I have a, I have an Apple gift card. I can't use in the iTunes store.  I can only use it in the store. You can buy movies, music, books or apps, but not obviously a Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Or subscriptions, which I think you can do in the iTunes store. Ah, you can't get subscriptions.  Right. I'll figure that. Yeah. That's a, that's just, you know, but for me, I, my phone is an Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  phone. So you'd want this. So I'd want it. So grandma now has to know, oh, that's bad. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the thing. Grandma has to know about your Nexus 7. Yeah. Hey, Sonny boy, are you Android or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple? My parents, God bless them, get me a Barnes and Noble cards when Amazon would be better. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dear. Do you have a, hey, Jeffrey, do you have a Nook or a Kindle? Well, the other reason I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  find this compelling is that kids who have cash instead of credit cards can now go into Target by  a Play Store coupon and then, and now have credit. Oh, that may be the whole point of this. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chad Johnson, ladies and gentlemen, his hair may be red, but he's got stuff in his head,  but his matter is still gray. Matter is still gray. Very good point. So you wouldn't have to  have a credit card. Right. Oh, that's huge. That's, I think you're, I think you're exactly right. This  is a way of getting apps and stuff in there. Google and Boingo. Remember you could go,  last Christmas you could get on a Virgin America flight and they get free boingo thanks to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Golden age of free Wi-Fi on a plane. It was a golden age. It was a golden time. Well, now you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can do it at the mall. Google and Boingo have a, I didn't know this, there's a free Wi-Fi project

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in New York City. Oh, that was amazing. The first time I experienced that I was like, this is  Nirvana. It was like 14 street station, free, free Wi-Fi from Google. It was amazing. It was good  Wi-Fi. It was fast and everything. Yeah, it was great. I mean, you know, when you're trained,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're, you know, you're out. Marissa Myers, former Wi-Fi access point. They are going to do  this in malls. It will be ad supported eight malls across the country in San Francisco, Los Angeles,  Tampa and Seattle. They wouldn't say the specific malls. So they did that in two and six subway  stations and 200 hotspots. But that ended September, that's, will end September 7th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh no. Malls makes really, makes a lot of sense, right? Cause Google offers is going to show you  ads for stores that are near you in the mall. Makes sense. Well, but here's what's really going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  happen. What really happens of course, is that, is that retail is becoming a showroom for the  internet. And so what really happens is another easier, faster way to say, Oh, what does this  cost for online? And it's another needle into the kidney of retail in America. So I'm not,  I'm surprised the malls are going to go for it. I know it was a really weird needle in the kidney.  I was going to say a kick in the kidney. That was a little too much. I was going to do a  wood stake in that was too much. It was a little smaller. This is how my brain operates.  Ow. I've had too much surgery. I guess. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look behind the curtain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think that you can go too far with deals, the dealification of America. I mean, I guess I like,  I understand the idea of deals, but when I start seeing deals in my bank statement,  that's going a little far. I saw you tweet about this. Bank of America  started embedding. It looks like ads. And not only that, I mean, if people are upset about Google  looking at Gmail, these deals are tied to what I charged. Let me see if I can find the image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I do not want an ad supported bank. So Bank of America responded to me. Of course,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you tweet something Bank of America. Yeah. Every company watches. You tweet something  and they said, well, you know, you could turn them off. Yeah, you could turn them off, but,  on a per load basis. So the next time you come back, they're back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what Square is going to be. Mark my words. This is why Square has value. And we want to  argue about platforms and value and Jack Beane and both. That's why it's worth asking. Because  Square is going to get more. It recognizes the value of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh oh. Sorry. He's in the Poconos. He'll be back momentarily.  I wish folks, those of you listening at home could just see Jeff's expression right now.  He's, he's gone. Let me show you while you're calling Jeff back. I'll show you. So this is from  my check. And this is in the bank statement online. This is not like, okay. So this is in line with  your transaction. In line with my transaction. I bought sushi and boss and actually Jennifer did,  bought sushi and boss or maybe Henry. Earn 10% cash back when you dine at Burger King.  So they decided, cause I was eating sushi, maybe I'd like to dine at Burger King.  Which is a horrible target. Horrible. I went to a grocery store and it said rent new movies on DVD  and Blu-ray, earn 15% cash backs at Redbox, which of course is in grocery stores. Went to buy clothes  at the Grove Boutique, earn 15% cash back at Aero Postal, which is a clothing, online clothing store.  So they're not, not only the embedding these in my check statement, the bank of America is looking  at what I'm buying and then recommending deals. They call this by the way, a loyalty program.  I said it's a disloyalty programming and I'm getting a new bank. Bye. Unbelievable. Wow. Like  they need more money. Didn't, how much did the government give them? Wasn't that enough? You  need more for crying out loud? I already gave you money.  Anyway, I actually did. I actually went out and got a new bank because of that. I just thought  it just didn't seem appropriate. Now mint. So somebody's saying, doesn't mint do this? Yes,  but I'm signing up for mint and that's the deal I get. Mint's free. First of all, the bank is,  I'm paying a lot of money for my banking services. Mint's free and that's part of the deal. I  understand. I made that deal. I didn't make that deal with bank of America. Did you complain?  On Twitter and then I changed. And no one noticed. Nobody in bank of America. No, no,  I got lots of tweets from bank of America begging me to come back. But here's an interesting thing  because then I tweeted, well, I tweeted this and I said, this is Twitter. Boy, this is really  interesting case study in Twitter. I tweeted as I've been doing lately, well, what's a better bank?  And I got a lot of response of what's, what's a better bank and many banks that were mentioned,  TD America, Ally Bank, a couple of the banks were mentioned, then tweeted me saying, Leo,  we'd love to have you as a customer. And I don't think it's really interesting. And people are,  these companies, and it's not because it's Leo, I don't think, I think these companies are

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  constantly monitoring for their name. Yeah, they have tools to do that for sure. And they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people. They have tools and people and tools who are people. At least at bank of America. No,  I got a lot of tweets from Bank of America. They were not happy about me. They said, you know,  you could turn that off. You know, it's opt out. But it isn't not doubt you could turn it off,  but only but then you come back the next time it's there again. And I don't want them looking  at what I bought and giving me loyalty deals based on it. That doesn't seem right. Somehow,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  maybe I'm wrong. When you go when you go to the drugstore, do you do you have a grocery store?  Do you have a frequent buyer card? No, no, no, because, but again, that is okay. So that's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that is similar, isn't it? So I went to the grocery store, if I use it, and I don't use it  for that reason. And by the way, I feel screwed because everything costs like a lot more because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not using the loyalty card. Yeah, that's the thing. You want to pay the real price. The  only way to pay the real price is to use the loyalty card. Yeah. So, you know, Philip K Dick

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wrote a short story about a world where advertising is everywhere. It didn't seem possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Leo, why don't you use the loyalty card? Did you just do privacy reasons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you pissed me off. I don't know. I'm not going to do that every time. And boy, they,  there's one, I go to the CVS drugstore over here. They say, where's your loyalty cards? I don't have  one. And there's one clerk who will still scan in a loyalty. She has like a one tape. Like a spare  one, a spare one and still get the 5%. So that's good. So I'm happy. I'm happy with. You also have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to pay the cost of the like longer transaction of them asking, do you have one? Do you want one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And having to say no every time. Yeah. So, but no, but that's it. No. And, and, and, and  Taffer and you're pointing out exactly what's true. They're paying you for your data. That's exactly  right. I just choose not to give them data. So I get screwed because I have to pay more for my  groceries. I believe the truth is they are not paying you for your data. They're charging you  the actual value of the grocery, but only if you use the loyalty card. If not, they're going to  charge you more. Ha ha. So it's a little, it's a little different, but that's just my belief.  Anyway, I don't do it because it offends me. It offends my, I should say, they say, uh, Alex in  their chat room says, Oh, just use Jenny's number 8 6 7 5 3 0 9. That works everywhere. Use your user.  Vincent says it too. Apparently this is something people are doing. They say just use your area  code plus 8 6 7 5 3 0 9. And then Jenny will be the one eating hummus. I'm surprised that you're,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that you're not into that. You both use them. You're, well, I mean, I, I know that you're a Mr.  Public. You're a Mr. Like, what can we, you know, get out of aggregated data? I'm just surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just too much trouble to fill out the form and do the whole thing. I just want to pay for my  groceries and leave. But you know, here's the good news. Thursday is senior day over at the Petaluma  market. I get, I get 5% off just for looking old. You do not count as a senior. Come on.  What? Starting this year, I'm a senior. 55 and up. I think you're scamming them.  You know, what's depressing is like for the last three years, they've been saying you're a senior,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right? That's what's depressing. Gina, Gina, there's a horrible day awaiting you when you  realize that you're old enough for AARP. I don't look forward to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You join it right away because you know, they're protecting Medicare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank goodness. I'll be happy if I make it that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You will. You know, you young people, you always say stuff like that, right? Isn't that true,  Jeff? The young people go, Oh, I'm going to die young. Then get to our age. You're going to go,  God, I hope I don't die. Please keep me alive one more month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I want to live to a hundred. I will be grateful for the experience and the  wisdom that I have at that time. You will. Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to see that on Google plus behind over a picture of an old cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, you're going to the bathroom every half hour. Then see how wise you feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's by the way, the Nexus seven perfect size for bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God, I'm sorry. We brought this up a superior galaxy Nexus specs. This is from the Verge.  Evan Rogers writing rumored specs for the new galaxy Nexus. Sam Mobile is the blog.  Minor upgrade, I would say. Not a huge one. It's going to be 4.65 inches, super amyled.  The galaxy S3 is 4.8. It will be a one. So that's the same size, isn't it? Same size as the old one,  little bit faster. A nine and one point five at the pair opposed to one point two gigahertz dual core  better. You know, this they should have done in the first place. The thing that always galled me  about the Nexus is they actually had a five megapixel camera when everybody else had an eight.  It will go finally to the eight better front facing camera, one point nine megapixels. Really,  it's all about getting parity with the galaxy S3. And to get something out before the holidays, right?  Yep. I am going to predict that I will be sporting a galaxy note two before the end of September.  Oh, that's soon. That's well, it's no, no, we do know they're announcing it in one week.  Oh, I don't know when they'll ship, but I figure it'll be right about when Apple announces their  iPhone. So, note two versus Nexus seven, Leo. Well, that's the beauty of it. It's a phone and a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  phablet. Right. So do you stop carrying the Nexus seven at that point? I never carry the Nexus seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Wi-Fi. It's no good anywhere but where you live, right? You carry it around? Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah. Yeah, because I use it at the office. I use it at Starbucks. I, I, no, I feel my phone is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, I have the S3, which is that 4.8, which is fine. And I cannot wait to go back to the note.  I miss my note. So when the new, the new note's five and a half, that'll be, if it fits in my  pocket, which I think it will, I will not, I don't carry the iPad around either. It's too big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even the seven. Well, I used to carry my laptop around with my phone, with my iPad.  No. I then reduced to just the iPad. Now I've reduced to just the phone and the Nexus seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do love the Nexus seven, but I just feel the phone is sufficient. What about you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina? Do you carry a tablet with you? I mean, I mostly work at home. When I travel,  I do carry it in my bag, but I don't like carry it in a pocket. Yeah, yeah. Travel's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're going to, you say, I know I'm going to a coffee shop. Should I bring something with me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah. If I'll go to a coffee shop, I will take it with me just to do email or whatever. But,  and yeah, and if I, I think if I commuted to an office, I would take it just to read on the  train or whatever. I guess the train. Yeah, that's what I do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I listen to audiobooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's, you know, I can do that on my phone. Yeah. Is the Galaxy Note the one with the James  Franco? Yeah. I think it's, I think it's James Franco doing that. James Franco, that multitasking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  commercial. Is that the, is that the 10-2? Is that the one you're talking about? Tab 10-1. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the, that's the tablet. That's the 10-1 tablet. Gotcha. Gotcha. And then, then yeah. And then,  but they're going to do a note. They're all called the note now. This, that's why some of the confusion,  they've renamed the tablets to be notes. So I'm talking about the note, the phone. It'll be the  note, the next note, note two phone. Here's James Franco showing you how good he is at fablothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we got some weird audio. Oh, hold on. I can fix that. Watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I unplug it, I plug it back in and I make a sound cause I am that old.  This crucial is, is a little cheesy. It's real cheesy, but it,  compare it to these Siri ads, which are equally cheesy, right? This is true. Same idea. Oh gosh,  darn it. What? Woo. I didn't get to it loud enough. I wonder what that is all about. Is it still bad?  So popular. There we go. See, it works, but you got to do two whoop whoops. Let's go back to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  James Franco. I'm James Franco. Oh, hi. In the past few years, I've acted in a bunch of movies.  Yes. I've written some, produced some, and have directed some. And I got a PhD in English.  I've also appeared on the soap opera. I directed a theatrical dance company. So I'm thinking that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is how they pitch him. James, you can do an ad, but for the first, you know,  30 seconds of being ad for James and then we'll just how great you are. And he said, yeah,  I'll do that. Are you going to pay me? So anyway, eventually gets to the tablet. He's making eggs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for some reason. Wrote a book, a short story. Oh, he's still boasting. And I'm even directing  this commercial. Ah, Bruce, give me a little wider and cue the tiger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not, it's not a good ad. I don't even want to watch anymore. I'm done. It's like,  that's already 30 seconds. You haven't even told me what you're advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's already annoying. It's true. It's already annoying. Sorry, James. You're cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I like you and geeks and freaks, but no. So here's a guy, he's a guy who a Google  contractor part-timer whose job was looking at the worst of the internet. Did you see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. This is a Buzzfeed piece. It's a confessional by an anonymous. It's an ominous.  Yeah. A former contractor for Google who didn't get hired. So maybe he's bitter. Yeah. His job  was basically to look at child pornography, beheadings, murders, fetishes to judge whether

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or not content was 15,000 images a day from Google images, Picasso or could Google search on and on  he just, that was his whole day was looking at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You really don't think about these folks, right? When you, when you talk about somebody's got to  do it. Yeah. Someone's got to do it. And it's funny. You said that he didn't realize at the time how  much it was kind of affecting his outlook on life and the world, but that he got, they had some,  some auditors come in and just kind of test him, like give him some test images, kind of like a  Rorschach test to see what his reaction was. And he said that after a year of looking at all that  crap, he would see a picture of a father and a son and be like, that's messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can tell what's going through their minds. I know what he's thinking.  That's why he didn't get hired. You can't do this job for more than nine months. You'd go crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then there's mat cuts, I always say. Yes. But then that's true. That's true.  Doesn't have to look at that crap anymore. He has to, he has to think like all the evil scum  buckets of the world and what are they going to do next? And he is the nicest, most friendly,  wonderful guy we know. I, maybe he runs Michael Bick's puppy farm now. I don't know, but no, no,  but no, no, no, no, no. That's how he gets his, it gets his frustration out or as the world's  greatest therapist. But no, Matt, Matt worries about all the, all the worst slumbers of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's the nicest guy we know. So thank you for sharing this post from Google. I didn't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they had so many pluses for so many. Right. I mean, if Google, if Google divisions don't use  Google plus, then here come the arguments of the ghost town. So there's 81 different Google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  circles from Google maps, Google, Argentina to, you know, Google Chrome developers to something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  called big tent. Big tent, by the way. That's a, that's a, that's the thing that I went to one of  those events, right? I did two of those events by video. They're doing another one in New York on  creativity. They kind of do these think events, which are very good. Anyway, this is good. Thank

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you. I'm going to add that to a circle. I think I'll call it Google, a Google circle, Google with  three O's that way it's distinctive from my other Google circles. And then it just adds them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boom. Wow. How exciting for me overloaded with Google goodness. Now. Yeah, I should be able to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish they still don't have this in Google where you can look at an individual circle,  but I love if you could look at any combination of circles. Yeah. But I think you can also

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  demote a circle as they gave it to me less often. You could do that. I guess that's the closest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thing, right? Yeah. On live, we talked about this yesterday. It's actually on Sunday on  Twitter. It's an on online gaming system. It was kind of clever. All the work was done on the  servers so you could have a light, low, lightweight, low end client on the, on your end and you'd still  be able to play high end games. Weird thing happened. They fired everybody. They, but then  they sold to one person who was really into it. He said, I'm going to rehire most of yous eventually,  but right now I'm going to hire about a quarter of you back. Very strange. Yeah.  Tesla museum is funded. This is an Indiegogo. Yay. So this was an Indiegogo project, kind of Indiegogo  is like Kickstarter, maybe a little bit more open. They needed $850,000 to create a goddamn  tech Tesla museum. It's what it says. I'm just property is for sale right now on Long Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's one chance to kind of get it. And I think the government said that the local government  said that they'd match. So they needed 1.6, 1.65, whatever. And so they had to raise 850 to make the  match and get the property. And at the last bit, well, not the last minute, but it's still more  time to go and it was mixed for a better museum. But, uh, it's an anonymous $33,000 gift through the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  move. I bet you it's Paul Allen. Tesla's final laboratory located in the sleepy town of Shoreham,  New York is known as Wardenclyffe. He attempted to build a tower there that would provide free  wireless energy to the entire earth, but he lost his funding before the project was completed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are they going to resurrect the tower? I don't think it was a tower, but the buildings there,  it was sold to a photo company, you know, photo chemicals. There was all kinds of expenses of  cleaning up as a brown site. I think it was bought by AGFA then and they were going to sell it. And  they wanted a certain amount of money because they cleaned it up. And, uh, but the building is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  still there. So just a word of warning, they've raised enough money to buy the building.  But not to build a museum or anything else. I think so. So now they have the property. So  I guess we'll have to have another fundraiser, maybe a, maybe a bake sale or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or maybe how many days do they have to go on a Leo? Oh, maybe they could go over,  over and over and over. Yeah. 38 days left. 38 days left. You know, what he should do is set that,  you know, let's, let's have a goddamn billion dollar million. So for 25 bucks, you can get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an eight by 10 of a Tesla 33 bucks. You get a Tesla is greater than Edison bumper sticker,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  which I love that definitely wins you geek cred. Love that. Well, this is the oatmeal, right? And  the oatmeal like kind of put out that great homage to, uh, to Tesla that, that one comic about how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tesla was so much better than Edison. Right. Right. I mean, Edison killed an elephant, right?  So, so, uh, it's funny how you can, I, for reasons that may be justified or maybe not  become a geek icon. And then, you know, now, well, we got to spill the museum.  I don't know. Is it, was Tesla really? I'm going to, I'm going to pledge a play. I want,  I want the bumper sticker. 33 bucks. I want that bumper sticker. So everything is threes.  Yeah. Cause Tesla like three. Yeah. You could get a custom oatmeal portrait of you for $3,333.  So the guy's doing this as the oatmeal guy. Yeah. It's the oatmeal. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's his,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's his campaign. It's all Mr. Oatmeal. Dark Lord of the Oats. That's why it's let's build

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a goddamn Tesla. That's why I thought it was gratuitous profanity, but no, he's not merely  taking the Lord's name in vain. He's doing it all the time. So I'm going to give you this one and  then we're going to move on. This is for you, just for you, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, Germany,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Germany, your favorite country. Yeah. I'm going to use my Google translate now to translate what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the F they're doing. It's, it's kind of hard to believe. They, they basically want a law that says  if a search engine reproduces a newspaper's headline and or first paragraphs, you have to  pay the newspaper so you can link to them, but you can't link to the headline or any content from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  article. Right, right, right. And this is, this is called a  put that through your Google translate and smoke it. And it's various publishers coming together  and publishers have a bad business model. They've always been complaining that Google's making all  the money and we aren't, but now they're hiding behind the skirt of government trying to create  this, this law. And it's kind of the last minute of going through the Bundestag and now people are  raising alarms as well. They should. So, uh, Kai Oberbeck, uh, the, uh, policy guy for Google in  Germany just wrote a strong response to it, which I think is, is, is in due time should happen.  And other companies are, cause it's just ridiculous. It's just, there's also, uh, the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they were also talking about a kind of an ancillary copyright that would force companies  to pay publishers license fees for using their work in a commercial setting. So employers,  for instance, if I have people reading the internet here at the office, I would have to pay,  uh, the publisher for letting my employees read the news online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like music. Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's the absurdity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Got a bad business model. Go to the government. Yep. They're specializing,  fix up bad business models. Wow. Is that going to pass? Is there a chance in hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think now it's not going to, I think it's because they went through a second, there was enough  fewer went through a second, because I shouldn't use that word. They went through a second version  and, uh, uh, neither side likes it. So we're at that kind of impasse now.  And it's basically publishers, uh, uh, don't be in their chests about how they're being put upon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by this bad internet. Marissa Meyer has, uh, stuck it to Google now, not once, but twice,  according to business insider, she has hired a chief of staff that have, who used to held a  position at Google. In fact, has been there since 2007, most recently product manager and managed  Google plus marketing. His name is Andrew Schulte. It's not the first Google employee she's hired.  Actually, she's hired a number of Google employees and she's decided not to give all the Yahoo  employees Android phones. They're all getting iPhones. I think they have a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is what I saw. Oh, I didn't see that in the story. Most of them are stuck with Blackberry today,  which is so appropriate to Yahoo status. If they're getting her, if she's giving them a choice,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's a different story than the one I read, which just said they're getting iPhones. So they're,  they have a choice. I think I'll have a choice. That's what Google does. Google says you have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  choice. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. It's smarter too. You want people to be on these platforms.  That's one of the arguments about why Yahoo is behind in mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. They're using Blackberrys. Blackberrys. For crying out loud. Of course they're behind,  but their Blackberry client, awesome. Awesome. All right. We got to wrap this thing up. Has,  has Mr. Tim O'Reilly arrived yet? He's going to be on Skype. Well, then we better wrap it up anyway.  Let's, let's finish these things up with Gina's tip of the week. Gina.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google just launched a new mobile search experiment called HandWrite. So this is pretty  cool. It's popped up on my phone. I think they announced it earlier this week. You go to google.com  on your mobile device, on iOS or your tablet or Android. It doesn't work in Chrome. It works in  the stock Android browser. There's a, and you enable it in your settings. You go to g.co slash  handwrite. You tap the button, which is just looks like a G, like a handwritten G. When you enable  handwrite, you can actually just draw the letters that you want to search for on the screen.  I know this is so much faster. This is a little gimmicky. This is a little gimmicky.  But you know, if you're in a situation where you're on a bus or a train and it's kind of  moving and it's hard to pick up the keyboard or like in this video that we're watching,  if you're on the treadmill or whatever, and you just don't want to pick at your keyboard,  you don't want to use voice search. This is pretty cool. That's still when she's on the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on the treadmill. Well, that's, I think that was the point. It's all she had to do to search  for cupcakes was type C U P C and really big letters. Right. Because the instant search

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  auto completes the rest. Right. So this is, this is pretty, I have to say it is pretty needs a  little gimmicky. It's kind of like voice search. I don't use it very much, but when, but trying  it out was a lot of fun. And there might be some situations when I might use it. And actually one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of the things they show is somebody doing it in Japanese. And I think for ideograms for non,  you know, Arabic or Roman text, that would be non-Roman text. That would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, someone that I'm just corrected me. It does work in Chrome. Sorry. I didn't think it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  worked in Chrome. Okay. Yeah. So right on the Google homepage. We depend upon you and we're  never going to do to you what has been done to developers elsewhere. Yes. We love you. We need  you. We build on your wisdom. You see, and we understand that this ain't a platform. It's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  democracy. Jeff, your number of the week. All right. I could talk about the rumors of 4 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a month production for many seven and a half inch iPads, but I won't instead Mashable did a handy  collection of Google maps stats, meaningless, huge numbers that are just so huge. You can't get your  head around them. Google maps now has 20 petabytes of data. This was interesting to me. They say that  satellite and aerial images are updated usually every two weeks, which is really impressive to me.  Street view is documented more than 15 miles of roads and the cameras from street view have 15  lenses and produce 65 megapixel images. Even better than curiosity. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My product of the week or tool of the week is actually something that's not out yet,  but was announced by Nikon. You've heard, of course, about the fact that people are using  smartphones instead of point and shoot cameras. Nikon decided to respond by putting Android in  a point and shoot camera. Oh, wow. It's only gingerbread, but I like it. It's a $350 camera.  And if you look at it, it's even got on the back a full screen. Let me scroll through the image.  A full screen. Let me scroll through the images with the Android buttons on it. Look at that.  It's just like your phone, only you can't make calls on it. I think that's kind of an interesting  product. I'll certainly get one for review as soon as they come out. I never want to see a  force-closed dialogue on my phone. Now, it does support Wi-Fi, has GPS built in. You can online  sharing from Facebook and Twitter and other things. There's certain compelling  things about this. I think it's kind of intriguing. If Maxwell Smart were working today,  there'd be Android powered shoes. Android everywhere. That's the Nikon Coolpix S800C.  It'll be out next month. I will get one for review, of course. Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.  That's where he blogs, and you must read his blogs to understand what we're talking about.  He has a whole blog on platforms, a whole post on platforms. That was kind of the foundation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for what we were talking about today. Let me again thank Skytop Lodge for the use of the  facility. Look at that. The Poconos. This is just a meeting room, but it's a gorgeous place. My  daughter went on the zipline today. Oh, what fun. Zipline's fun. That is really neat. I would never  do it. I am chicken-esque the hilt. I wouldn't make it up. Ziplines are fun. They're safe.  The ladder. The thing I don't like about it is you have to belay on the ladder. I want that at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, then you couldn't fall. Yeah, my whole ladder would fall. His book is Public Parts  available now. And don't forget his kindle single Gutenberg the Geek. He's starting to look more  like Gutenberg. If you had that funny hat. Yeah, I know. I know.  Gina Trepani is at smarterware.org, founding editor of Lifehacker. She's also, of course,  the author of Think Up and works at Expert Labs on that. No more Expert Labs. Just Think Up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, really? Yeah. No more Expert Labs. Actually, we just bought thinkup.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good. It's a placeholder for now. So it was thinkupapp.com and now it's thinkup.com.  Right. Fantastic. Thank you, Gina. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you for joining us. We do this week  in Google, the cloud, Twitter, whatever we want to talk about. Really, that's really all the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  is. Whatever Jeff and Gina. This week in platforms. Platforms. Yeah. I could have called it that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe. Maybe. Anyway, you know what you're going to get now. Next time, you'll understand.  You can watch the show every Wednesday, 1pm Pacific, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4pm Eastern time,  2100 UTC on twit.tv. Or is it 2000? It's 2000 UTC. It'll be 2100 after the time change.  But you can also watch it on demand. After the fact, if all those time zones confuse you,  just go to twit.tv slash twig. Thanks for being here. Stay tuned. Triangulation.  Tim O'Reilly's coming up next. I'm Leo Laporte. We'll see you next time on twig.
