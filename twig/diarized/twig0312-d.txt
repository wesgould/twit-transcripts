Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like I must be...  It is! It's Gina Trippani!  Oh my goodness.  Gina Trippani is here as she is once a month  because she needed space and time to work on Think Up.  And it turns out another startup,  which we're going to find out about,  debuted yesterday at demo day at the White House.  Yes! Hello!  Welcome back.  We missed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And along with this embarrassment of riches,  Lynne D. Johnson is back.  Lynne D. Johnson, a community expert,  social media expert.  She's worked all over the place.  Nice to have you, Lynne. Welcome.  Hi.  LYNNE.com.  I don't know where to begin.  There's so many interesting  Google-y topics  to talk about. Why don't we start with Google Plus?  Wait, is Mike  in the studio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  You can speak freely. Mike, of course, a fan of Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, he wrote a rebuttal of  the Mashable article that really started  this conversation. Actually,  the news story that started the conversation  was that Google wasn't going to decouple  your Google account from your Google Plus account.  For a few years  now, you've been required to have a Google Plus account  whenever you created a Gmail account  or any other Google service. You needed that Google Plus account  to comment on YouTube,  to post on YouTube. Google announced  that they're decoupling it.  Vik Gundotra, who was the heart and soul  of it, left some time ago.  It's been a year now, right?  The article, which I think is well  researched by Seth Figerman,  at Mashable,  basically said Google Plus is  a failure and a very expensive failure  for Google,  came about, he says,  because Vik just wouldn't  give up. Pestered Larry  with words like, Facebook's going to kill us!  Facebook's going to kill us!  Until Larry just finally said,  okay, let's do something social. And boy,  when they did it, they went all in.  In fact,  threatened by Facebook,  spent hundreds of millions of dollars  to create Google Plus.  We're four years in  and it's,  according to this article anyway,  pretty clear it's over for Google Plus.  Photos has left the building.  Hangouts has left the building.  They've decoupled.  First of all, let's talk about  the premise. Is Google Plus  over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not there as much as I used to be.  I have a big sigh from Lin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there were sighs all around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was great. Lin, I want to hear  what you think about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean,  there's no there there, right?  I mean, no one is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But people have said that for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I mean, even when it, you know,  when it was supposed to be big,  but that was more about there were a lot  of people signing up, but not necessarily  a lot of people using it.  And you had some of those,  like Scobel types  using it for a while really  hard. And that made it look like  people were using it. Yeah, and Scobel was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one of the first to give up and has been  for two years now saying  but no, he's  been pretty consistent that Facebook  wins. And if you spend time  cultivating your Facebook  profile, you will win too.  And he's been very adamant about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think there are different things.  I still I still that's what Mike would say.  There are different things that he's right about Facebook.  But but I still  enjoyed Google Plus.  There are still people there.  But like any  social network, if you don't put yourself into it, if you don't  contribute to it, you're not going to get anything back.  And it's just one more thing to  do for me now. Mike's rebuttal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that  sorry, Tech Press, Google Plus  is alive and well essentially  said  well, yes, if you say  that the goal of Google Plus was to beat  Facebook, well, then you're right.  It failed. But  people still use it. Somebody still

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike's important point, I think was a very good point  is that is that the the tendency  of the tech press to extrapolate from a  data point of one  and say, well, this is what everybody  sees is what everybody gets. And  not to see that things are built around communities.  I mean, you know, if you  ask most people my age, whether Snapchat  were anything, they'd say, oh, no, it's nothing.  But it's obviously wrong.  There are people there.  There are people who enjoy it there.  He quotes Bradley Horowitz, who is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in charge of it. Bradley Horowitz says Google Plus  is not dead. We're still  all in on it.  What's this saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that a pivot is a failure? Right?  Like that's like making that leap from it  being a pivot. You know, zooming  out, I think about Google's products  and and this  whole idea that Vic was in Larry's  ear saying Facebook is going to get us.  You know, we have to beat Facebook.  That's really interesting to me. The idea that they were chasing  tail lights on this, because like if you look  at all the super successful Google products,  Google search, plenty of search engines  existed, right? They were all terrible.  Google search exploited that invulnerability  and was so good. And there's no cost in switching  search engines. Google Maps  so much better than the MapQuest.  Unlike anything we ever saw before,  blew the doors off. Everybody switched to Google Maps.  Now Gmail is an interesting  story, right? Because I was deeply  embedded in my Yahoo email address  when Gmail  launched. And again, that was  so innovative and did a thing that  no one else did, which was offer so much  space. I changed my email address,  which is something I wouldn't do. Now Gmail,  I think, is the closest thing comparator  you can make, right? Because all my contacts were in Yahoo,  all my email history was in Yahoo. Switching an email address  is a pain, whereas switching maps or search  isn't a pain. Yeah. So  Google Plus, I think, is comparable.  But the difference is that Google Plus didn't  do anything that was so  innovative and so different  that everyone was compelled to  switch, you know, en masse.  And also email. I could switch my  client.  Facebook is  as good as it gets. I shouldn't say it's as good as it gets.  That makes me...  Facebook is really  good. Twitter is really good.  And Google Plus didn't do anything that was  that innovative. Circles,  it turned out, were kind of complicated  and took a lot tedious to  maintain. The different public  and privacy levels, which everyone, you know,  wanted that on Facebook. That didn't really work  out, right? Like Hangouts was amazing.  Photos was amazing. They're separating those  out. So it's  interesting to me, like,  to see that Google tried kind of what  they've done so many times before, which was  make a product that already existed in the market  and, you know, they were trying to make a really superior  product. And in this case, it didn't... the stream  didn't  make it. It wasn't successful. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really insightful, Gina, as always,  as usual. But I think it  really is because...  But there are two  trajectories there  in that, in the sense that you're right, Google  didn't go far enough beyond Facebook, and Facebook kept developing  like crazy and doing amazing things.  And so it was the one time that Google  was caught behind from the  beginning and never  was ahead in any part of it. Though  I think there are wonderful things about Google+. If Mike were  here, he'd be sputtering. And  at this point, and, you know,  Mike and I have always had the conversation for us  is better on Google+, than it was  elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and this is kind of what  at the end of this Mashable  article, Seth Fiegerman quotes  Bradley Horowitz  as saying,  this is kind of what's happening, that  Google+, can now  focus... this is Bradley's  quote, can now focus on  doing what it's already doing quite well,  helping millions of users around  the world connect around the interests  they love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what he said at I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the strategy. And of course, they have  added new features. They added communities,  saying that's exactly what that does.  And so,  Mashable's saying Google's shifting,  Google+, is shifting from a Facebook clone  to more of a Pinterest look-alike.  Is that the pivot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not Pinterest. It's more groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I feel like Mashable was  very, was being quite dismissive.  Very dismissive. To call it a Pinterest  look-alike was sort of...  Hey, Pinterest is doing okay.  Well, yes.  But what I mean is, Pinterest is doing great. Pinterest is a  great product. What I mean is that the premise  of the article is that Google was chasing  Facebook, and now they're chasing Pinterest, right?  Which I think was a little unfair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a return to Google Groups.  Isn't that what Mike says?  Somebody said that.  I can't remember who. Maybe it was on Twitter on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing, too, the  geek bitterness about Reader continues.  Well, but this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is the peril for Google,  because Orkut,  Reader, Wave,  you know, there is  a long list of terminated projects.  People become more and more  reluctant to invest in  something Google does if they  continue to... Sorry, I'm not talking to you.  If they continue to...  I say the word Google now, it wakes up.  And since I say that like hundreds of times a day,  it's very annoying.  People might be getting some fatigue.  Some Google fatigue.  What about this  notion that Google should buy Twitter?  Twitter's stock  price continues to go down.  They're now worth less than $20 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just love that every  tech pundit is like, it's absolutely  going to happen, or it's absolutely not going to happen.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the thing  that would happen if they did  buy Twitter,  it would give them  more things to surface in  search, right, in terms of news, right?  And in real time news, right?  To add to the news features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they have renegotiated  with Twitter and have started that  firehose up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I mean, there's the possibility  of that. Maybe that's what this is about.  I mean, but the thing to Gina's  point about circles,  about circles not being really  intuitive or working that well, I mean,  I think the theory behind  circles though was  a really good theory in that  you keep families separate from friends,  from workmates, from  whomever, and I think that's the whole  thing back to Scoble. When Scoble talks  about how Facebook wins, that's  kind of how he uses Facebook  in a way. He talks differently  to different groups of people.  So, the  idea that Google  enabled you to do that, I think,  was a really great idea.  And if they could work around people's  interests, that could still, again,  it doesn't have to beat Facebook to be good  or to be successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  And actually, the idea of circles really  has kind of informed some of the  community stuff, right? I mean, I love  Android and I love Ronda Rousey and I  love, you know, Twitter, right?  And I'm going to tag those things differently  and I have different followers who enjoy  those topics. It's similar  to circles in a way, and that's how I split up  my circles in the beginning too. Like, these are  my tech friends and these are my  sports friends. You know, I never used circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just used Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you were right.  I mean, Mark Zuckerberg  very famously said that nobody  wants to make lists.  It's work.  It's a lot of work to get your circles just so.  And you're never  ahead. And Facebook really decided  to do it algorithmically, programmatically,  rather than have users put a lot of effort  into it, although you still do have that capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which the truth is, so did Google+.  I mean, you know, versus Twitter.  Twitter, when you ask for what you  get, what you ask for, and Google+, and Facebook  both, the algorithm just prioritizes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for you. So maybe the  failure is they just didn't do as good a job?  Is it an  is it a failure of execution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or timing. I think that's  part of, well,  there's three possibilities. Gina's point  is a failure of inspiration.  They didn't have that idea that was that far ahead.  There's a failure of timing that Facebook was just  too far ahead to attack.  Or there's a failure of execution that they didn't  kind of stay ahead. It's like the point  that Nashville made about Hangouts.  Or somebody made about Hangouts.  I miss Google Groups. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this might just be a more  better looking Google Groups is not  a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the key difference here, and I think it's the nature  of a decentralized network  where you're either on it or you're not.  Right? Like Gmail, I could change to Gmail  and I can still email you, Leo, and you could be using  whatever you want. Right?  But you basically had to go  to Google Plus and invest and be on  Google Plus. It's not like you could use another client.  I mean, you could. There are hacks to do it.  I said this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on Twitter. I said maybe  this, you know, if Google, maybe  Google should create a right API.  They never  did. They only  read only. What if now, okay,  yeah, maybe we couldn't figure  it out. Let's let the market,  or is it too late?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The window might close  for that. I think it's probably too late. Would you, as a developer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  would you even consider writing  something for the Google API at this point? I might.  Because  I might, because then you could use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If my audience was there,  that's the answer always to the question, whether or not  to use a particular API, particularly a distribution  API. If the audience is there,  you know, I would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what, Gina, the audience  that was always there from day one  was the photography audience. Yes.  And I think Thomas Haak's piece is somewhat damning  because photography worked  on Google+. It worked brilliantly. It made  stars. It was a wonderful gathering point.  Everything about Google Plus worked  well on photography. And then Thomas just says,  I feel abandoned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was, he posted it on Google+,  and then it later was  reposted  on a magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he posted it initially on Facebook.  And then somebody said, why don't you post this on Google+,  and so he went to Google+,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and put it there. And then it's on some

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  other magazine. They were like, you're talking so much about  Google+. Why didn't you put this there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right. Okay, so here's the Facebook  post, which is, by the way, where I saw it,  not Google+.  He also says, look, these are just some thoughts I'm  putting down.  He says it's more of a rambling list  than  anything else. But  he said,  again, Thomas is a photographer  who has used Google Plus a lot  for his images. By the way,  he's also used LO.co.  He's the last person still posting on LO.  I'm talking about lonely.  I'd like to know what Trey Radcliffe thinks.  I think Trey still likes Google+.  That's exactly the one to ask. Yeah, here's a guy who's  really made his career posting on  Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm having a senior moment. What was the other  service that was started as the open  Facebook?  Diaspora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Diaspora.  I don't know if that's anywhere.  I don't know. That was my first  Kickstarter contribution was Diaspora.  You schmuck you.  I think I gave him a hundred bucks talking  about a schmuck. You had Diaspora  Foundation. But this was a federated  It was federated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it still is. It still looks like it's still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still around. So you could create  your own Facebook  in effect. I think LO  is kind of  I'll log into LO.  I haven't been there in a year.  And by the way, if I do log into LO,  mostly what you'll see is pictures from  Thomas Hawk at this point.  That's mostly. But one of the reasons  Thomas likes this is the big images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And that's  mostly the photography community  and the arts community. They really like  LO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Having ads around this is kind of nice  and all of that.  Actually, you know what? I see a lot more than Thomas now.  The last time I was there was all Thomas. But  look at all these people posting here.  And you see how big these images are.  Maybe that's something about it.  And as you said, artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are all reshares by LO?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh. Oh, these are reshares  from LO. Hello.  Yeah, you're right. These are all LO's  reshares. Wow.  So that's partly my fault because I  haven't added enough people, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if that's the problem,  Leo. You don't think that's it, huh?  I question that premise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I really put  some effort into LO when it first  launched. But  I don't know. Maybe  I tried to follow new people, different  people than I follow on other networks,  just to have a different experience.  But again, it just  wasn't sticky enough.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think we as consumers are  real thoughtful  in how we choose  which social networks we're going to participate in  or not. It couldn't have as much to do  with how it looks.  Facebook's ugly as  sin.  But the only reason I'm there  is because family and friends are there, right?  And somebody named Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've really, I've taken  to Facebook and  I'm not going to say it because it's Scoble, but I  did it for other reasons and I just decided I'm going to  pay attention to Facebook. And  it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a really good experience. It's gotten better and better  too. That's the other thing I've noticed.  Scoble came here about a year ago. We did  a special on making your Facebook feed  work better and moving people into  acquaintances and friends and things like that and  tuning it a little bit. That didn't make such a  difference, but something Facebook's done in the last  three months has made a very  big difference. I see stuff now I want to  see in my Facebook feed and very little that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  don't. They've also gotten much, much better.  I thought, listen, I've now  hit peak Facebook. Everybody I know on  the earth I'm already a friend of. And then  there are recommendations for who to befriend.  I just found another one just now.  Oh, I'm not his friend.  I'm not his friend.  And so that's improved a lot.  I've come across people for  purposes of business and other things  that have worked. More organizations  are there with neat stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Incidentally, somebody like Trey  is going to always and has hedged his  bets. He posts not just  on Google+, but he does the same  thing on all the big social networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing is  when you spend time giving  any attention to one post, how it pops up  immediately below that with the other  recommended things. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've done a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook has been doing this for a really long  time. And the reality is that when  it comes to social product development,  they're the best.  They're the best out there. The best minds.  And they just have the head start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But don't we want to fight the  monopoly? I mean, it's not good for the  ecosystem for everything to be on Facebook.  Or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Follow the light, children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think it's good for the ecosystem.  And certainly I don't want to discourage any  young entrepreneurs or innovators  from thinking about what problems  it doesn't solve or solves  badly or what audiences  it's not good for and coming up  with different solutions.  As a generic social  network like Facebook  and Twitter, I mean,  I feel like we've kind of  reached,  we have that. We have that now.  I think there are other specialized social networks.  I basically built one myself.  You know what, Facebook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking back a few years  to the Facebook experience a few years ago.  It was jammed by Farmville and  Candy Crush. The games  have been deprecated, pushed aside.  The apps have been deprecated,  pushed aside. It's really the  newsfeed. I think Facebook realized  that's what people use Facebook for.  And they've worked very hard algorithmically  to make sure the newsfeed is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in major main. I met the head of the  newsfeed in New York a few weeks ago.  And I said,  you know, one thing that I'm thinking  this is because Facebook knows all, it knows  the best way. I see one thing that irritates me is the  repetition of memes. But I'll see the same  meme come up three weeks later and I'm like, I've seen it.  And he said, yeah, I know, we're working on that.  And I thought, oh,  they're human. Yeah.  It's okay. They're trying  to fix this. They're always trying to fix this. They're always trying  to improve it. You know, and I think there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  some. What's interesting is I feel like they have.  I don't see a repetition of  the same viral videos  and all of that. They must be paying attention  to that. I see  good stuff on Facebook. I used to feel bad  when I went on to Facebook.  After spending  time there, I would feel like,  ew. I don't feel that way anymore.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do you have the net politics

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  story up there? You want to talk  about that? Yes. I just said, no, was that on your  Facebook page? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where did I see that? I think I believe  that. I believe or not, I saw that on  Hacker News. Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can get to that later. No, no, no. I just  thought it was weird that it came up on Facebook. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But see, that's why it isn't.  You don't want a monoculture.  Because you're right. There's stuff  that's not going to appear on Facebook.  But then if you.  I love Hacker News.  And that's an example of. This is a  Y Combinator feed.  That for a while was getting gamed a lot, had a lot of  gamed. But it's kind of what Digg or  Slashdot was supposed to be.  People vote up comments and so forth.  And it's quirky  stuff that tech geeks like.  That seems  to me to be a good thing. There should be  many of these that cater to  niches, right? Yes.  Or niches. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should we talk about  this R's piece about  Hangouts? I think Jeff mentioned it  earlier saying that Google, speaking of  more specialized products,  that Google should invest in Hangouts.  Like put all the  effort and money that they've  spent on Plus in general into  Hangouts as a messaging app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's too. I hate to say it, but they're too late

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on that. You think it's too late?  I still feel like a unified  messaging platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so. Well, maybe on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not too late for Android users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Definitely. No. But that's just  Android users. And it ain't Skype.  Well, Skype is  Microsoft's all in on Skype for Windows  and Windows Phone. And I think  Skype, for people who use Windows,  is going to be the default messaging  system. We talked about this earlier  on Windows Weekly.  The Messenger app is going to be decoupled  from the Skype app, but you'll still be using  Skype messaging. And  I think, no, I think for Windows users  it's Skype. I think for  Android users it's Hangouts.  For iOS users it's Messenger.  And what's sad is that they're  siloed a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is back to the old AIM versus  ICQ days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now does Skype messaging  accept SMS? So I can SMS  an iOS user and it'll come up in  iMessage. Is it still called iMessage?  It's just messages.  But I get the green bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you get to be a green bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Hangouts too  will accept SMS, right? So there's some  interactivity, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're an iOS user there's all sorts of broken  bits of that that make it hard for  you to message people who are  in the Apple ecosystem.  It's kind of messed up.  And if you dare move from  iOS to Android you're screwed.  You'll never get messages again.  Not from your iPhone owning people.  And I didn't know this, but I've been told in no  uncertain terms that people discriminate  against the greenies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Paul Ford did that great piece  about... Yeah.  And I thought, oh, that's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And everybody tells me, oh no.  We don't like those green  people. No green bubbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, it's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lynn, you're an Android user or an iPhone user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm an Android user.  And the thing I was going to say about the Google  products, like talking about Hangouts, talking  about Google+, is that there's a core  group of people who, once they buy an Android  phone, whatever software Google  gives them, that's what they're going to use.  They're not going to look for  other things. So, there's  a core group of users who are not techies,  right, who that's what they use. They use the Google  products that come on the Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So... But Google still  kind of muddies the water by  providing both messages and Hangouts.  So they have a messaging  app. In fact, Google  users, they suggest  that they don't use Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is back to Laura's point about Hangouts.  They messed it up. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hangouts is too bloated, right?  So messages are more lightweight and easier to use.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like...  I'm all in on Hangouts.  That's what I use. And even on Google Fi, I didn't say...  I said, no, I like Hangouts.  Hangouts has the real merit  of being that you can use it on the desktop.  And I can  receive text messages from people who think  I'm texting my phone on my desktop and respond to it  as long as I have Chrome open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's stop working for me. For some reason, I can't figure out.  There's always some little complication about a Google  app. Really?  Yeah, well, it's also me. Even though I'm Google boy.  I tolerate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hangouts. That is my relationship with  Hangouts. I put up with it. What don't you like?  I mean,  I'm like... I guess I'm a specialist in all...  I have multiple Google accounts, right? So I have to be  signed in to two different  Chrome tabs in order to have Hangouts on the desktop  in both. You know, switching between  the two accounts is possible in the Android  app. It's just annoying, you know,  to switch back and forth. It's better on Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  than it is on Chrome. Yes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it is better on Android than it is on Chrome.  Yeah, just sometimes...  Some of the cutesy stuff, like when you message  somebody, yay, or whatever,  and the little guy comes up and dances.  I mean, you know, share your location is nice.  There are certain features I like. There's times  when it's just kind of laggy and just feels a little bit  bloated. And I feel like... The video quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  isn't as good as Skype  for calls.  But here's... Since you just... Since you raised  the Niagara Falls for me,  Gina, multiple  accounts, step by step,  is...  Is the other news report here that  Gmail is going to allow you to have domain  email. Does that  mean I get rid of my apps account because  it's really the reason I have apps is just to have my  domain email.  Can I become a full-fledged Gmail  regular Google blessed citizen  with my own address? Is that what that means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's... I was  wondering about that. This custom domain.  So Gmail is going to, at some  point, offer you the option to do a  custom domain with your Gmail. There were no other  details really offered, right?  But like, we all... We know how  domains work. You have to read... You know,  you have to own them or register them, or at least  Google has to do so for you if  they're available.  So I'm not sure what this means for Google Apps users.  I mean, this is essentially what  Google Apps does, but it sounds like this is going to  be a lot easier.  Forwarding... Right, map...  An invisible, easy kind  of mapping in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This domain's issue,  this Google Apps issue, is Google's  Achilles heel. This is  their mobile  me. And you would think  of all companies in the world that they would figure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this thing out. You can't consider our own dog  coding. This is the complaint of every single  employee in the place.  They have multiple accounts.  How would you solve this?  You would tell Google,  my technological genius, that  I am. Yes.  A, it's half solved on Android.  On Android, it's pretty easy. You can be  in different accounts on different apps, and it's  okay. It's very easy to switch.  Not a problem, that's one. And two,  I would tell how the means to tell  Google, that, that, that, are  easy. Right.  And here's how I want to use  those accounts across these various apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not merge them, but just say,  these are all me. Yeah, which

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would be good for Google. It's great for Google's business to say,  aha, that geeky  lady named Gina is also that mommy  with all the kids. Okay.  It's true. Would you have a unified

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  inbox, or would you have just multiple?  At choice. At choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I would love to have a unified inbox. That's what I would  love about Hangouts. I just want to have, you know, just  all come to the same place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we have, of course, we use Google  for work here at Twit, so we have  a Twit.tv Google  domain. And  I never,  I never use my Twit address.  Because it's just so much  easier to use my own personal Gmail  address.  I would love to see, you're  right, but I don't have the problems you do,  Jeff, because you use your domain  address. I do.  You're not at Gmail.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is my everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But my Google Play is  all still left, my  Google Plus and Google Photos  are all still left in my Gmail.  Seems like they could solve this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing is, Jeff, though, like, I  use both a Gmail account  and my domain, right?  But the thing is, so many features  don't come to apps  users first. Right.  So that's always the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The people who are paid, this is the only company on Earth,  the people who actually pay them are the second class  citizens. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slowly I turned  step by step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I missed the disgust around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this. Aren't you glad that nothing has changed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did, it's very comforting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You brought it up, Cheetah. You did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, I did, I did. I did.  I needed to be reassured and confident that nothing  too much would have happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody gets that reference, do they?  Do you get the reference? I get it.  Oh, you do? Slowly I turned

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  step by step.  But I remember it from the three  Stooges, which I don't think is the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cheetah, Lyn,  do you know what we're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I assumed  it was a pop culture reference that I missed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's generational. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not because I'm young or old, just because  I sometimes miss pop culture references a lot.  I did, you're Leo? Yeah, I'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll find it. I'm not that young,  but hey. Compared to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you and me, we're young. You're young.  Compared to Jeff and me, you're  young. Here's the three Stooges  version of this.  Are you hearing me? It was Abbott and Costello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which one was first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Abbott and Costello. You want to go to  the Abbott and Costello? I don't know which one was first. I think  Abbott and Costello started it, but I do  think the three Stooges, I don't know who started it.  Here's the Abbott and Costello

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bit. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Here it is  in Wikipedia, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's the Niagara Falls?  It's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This may not be worth it, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to revise my earlier statement and say, yes, I am too young.  I did not watch Abbott and Costello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a vaudeville. It's a vaudeville

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  root symbol. It's in  Wikipedia. What do they say?  It was actually started by  vaudeville  comedians Harry, Step, and Joey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fay. Oh, Harry and Joey Fay, of course.  So here is the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Watch.  Here we go.  This picture will go on forever.  As with many vaudeville

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  gags.  Oh, my God.  All right. I'm stopping now. Let's do the...  There's another one on YouTube. Let's do the  I Love Lucy version. I think that that's...  But the point is this is an old vaudeville  gag, right? Goes way, way back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just say the words Niagara Falls.  The guy goes wacky.  So if you say Google accounts...  I love Google accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Slowly I turn.  I step.  Multiple accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  That was a long way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now we need the opposite of that. We need a  safe word for when Lucy and Jeff is freaking out.  Like what's the... Like, you know, I don't know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Michigan or something. I don't know.  Michigan. Ah, Michigan.  How about this? Let's try  this. See what reaction  Jeff has to this.  Yeah.  Slowly I turn.  So Annette's Politik is  an independent news source in Germany. Is that correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They reported some stuff about  what the prosecutors were doing  in terms of spying in NSA.  A prosecutor in Germany was  investigating them for treason.  And I mean the word treason, which has not happened there  in 50 years. And  a huge, huge furor  about this. Same prosecutors

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who, by the way,  just declined to prosecute  the US and UK spy agencies  who were spying on  Angie's smartphone.  Chancellor Angela Merkel's  smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So much, much  furor about it. And then they kind of  backed off, but it was only temporary. We still didn't know where  it was going to go. We're still investigating. Don't know.  And then the  basically  the justice minister attempted to  fire, demand the resignation of the prosecutor  the state's attorney who'd done this. Prosecutors  now say no, you're meddling in a case.  And this is a constitutional crisis.  All around free press. What?  It's a constitutional crisis  now? Well, it's heading that way.  Yeah. And so Jake Applebaum  sent out a  tweet, you know, a bat signal.  And if you go to  netspolitik.us  there's a letter there signed by many, and you can  sign it too, that protests this  and demands this be stopped. It's a matter  of free press and free speech. So it's just our  little German moment for the day.  It's over now. Wow.  That was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I like Jacob. He's  a guy. Oh, he's the greatest. Unfortunately,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we'll never see him in America again. No,  I can't come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  All right. I'll add my name to that. I don't even understand  what's going on, but there's 654  of us. And I must  it must be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, did you add your name to that? I did indeed add  my name and I put it on my blog because the first  day didn't think it was good enough for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My affiliation.  I'm an American.  There. Okay.  Let's see if we can get Donald Trump to sign.  By the way,  we're all looking forward to tomorrow night. I bet you the  streets will be empty  tomorrow evening during the Republican debate  with how many hundreds  of candidates are there in this debate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When is Stuart's last night? Is it tonight

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or tomorrow night? Oh, I don't know. It is this week.  Is it tomorrow night? Okay. Yeah, I believe tomorrow  night's the last night. So he might wait till  after the debate to do his show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's the greatest material he could have in his career. I know,  right? It'll be recorded. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should be fun. It's  going to be fun.  Back to Google+.  Yonatan Zunger  says, we're not dead yet.  He's great.  He's one of my favorite people on Google+.  He's the guy who built it, right?  Yeah, he's chief architect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he's the current chief architect.  I mean, so, not to  discount, but I thought one of the interesting things about  Thomas's piece is he said, you know, for so  long there were all these Google employees.  It's so enthusiastically used Google.  I'd interact with them every day and they did these great  photo walks. And then all of a sudden  it stopped. And you know why it stopped?  Because it was no longer their job.  Right? Yeah, that's telling.  You know. So, okay.  Carry on. So, Yonatan, he's the chief architect.  Yeah, well, I mean, obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he's got, so this is the problem. Bradley  has a vested interest in this.  Yonatan has a vested interest in this.  But the users themselves, and when you see  somebody like Thomas Hawks say,  where are all the... That's the disturbing  part. Yeah, where are the Google users? Yeah, I've told the story in the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  before. I've told the story in the show before. Many, many years  ago, my daughter joined a safe community  of American girl fans.  And then Mattel just one day just  killed it. Aw. Crushing little girls  across the country. We lost their friends.  It was their only cause it was anonymous. There was only one other friends.  They lost friends. When you start  a platform for a community, you have  a responsibility to the community that grows.  It's like saying, I'm  Mr. Levitt. I'm going to build this whole town.  Oh, no, I'm bored with it. I think I'll tear down all those homes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the internet.  Move fast to break things.  Look at all  the initiatives, which nobody brings up, that Facebook  has abandoned. Partly because  Facebook abandoned them because nobody invested in them.  So there was nobody  to complain when they abandoned them.  Facebook does this more  What's the responsibility?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like the responsibility, I agree with you  that there is a responsibility, but I feel like the responsibility  is to give enough notice  so that folks can  find a place to go. You know, if I'm hosting  a party at my home and I say,  alright, everybody out.  People can kind of get together and decide,  okay, let's go meet down at the bar.  Or let's move to the so-and-so's house.  And give folks the time to do it.  But if I am hosting the party at my house  and I'm done,  it's a delicate balance.  For a social network,  for girls that's anonymous,  I mean, I feel terrible  about that. That's top-notch.  It was awful. It was really awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And luckily, she had violated the rules  enough that she managed to make a connection to one friend,  which you're not supposed to be able to do, and stayed  with one friend.  I certainly take your point  that it's my computers,  it's my effort, it's my investment,  it's not working out, it's not a business.  I absolutely understand that. I completely understand that.  But at some point you have to say that a community is not...  This is the real question. When is the community  owned by the community, not by the platform?  If you're making  a true platform, my argument  is always that a  true platform is that in which people  find a use  for what you created that you couldn't have imagined.  And they take it over  and use it for their purposes.  And when that happens, you succeed it.  You hit that magical moment of having a platform.  But it also means that you now have  a responsibility to those people who  brought this value to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I learned that  in a very small way when I decided  to kill the chat room.  And I heard from them, and I realized,  oh, this is not mine to kill. What am I thinking?  Well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean,  there's still a business.  Whoops, where's my head?  You're sinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's Google+. She's going away.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's still a business.  You know what I mean? Think about Ning.  Think about all those communities that people made  on Ning, right?  Still there. Ning's still there.  No.  How is it there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ning got bought by Glam  slash Mode. I thought you could still use  all the Ning tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't think so, because I remember  you being able to get all your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can. It says you can.  Oh, you can?  It's now NingNodeMedia.  NingNodeMedia.  Not a very  felicitous name. NingNodeMedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mode. Mode. I just  talked to Samir Arora.  Right before the show, I talked to Samir Arora.  And he used Ning  as the platform to build a top  build mode media. And on mode media, he  just put out 100 years of women's fashion,  100 years of men's fashion, 100 years of women's  fashion, a two minute video.  He got it to a million views in  six days and it's now 52 million  views in six weeks.  He's built this huge platform and he used Ning as the basis.  But Ning still sits there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a really interesting point. Had Google  Plus not been owned by Google,  it would have been a Ning.  It would just be kind of a little  corner of the net that persists, perhaps,  as long as somebody's willing to spend money on it.  But because it's part of Google,  it's a much bigger deal, right?  And what happens to it is a much bigger deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  But, I mean, Jeff, I see that  it's still here, but I remember  not being able to access communities  I had built. I had a community there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I was told to get it back.  I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  told I could, you know,  download all my data

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if I wanted to. I think maybe now, maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  maybe that was before the purchase.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. That's why I thought it wasn't  I didn't know it was purchased. Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just shows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so you could get it back after you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  So that raises  the interesting question. If somebody  were to buy Twitter,  if Google were to buy Twitter,  could they even keep it alive?  Would they be just throwing money and  I mean, do you rename it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you can't. You see the picture of  Ev Williams with Larry Page?  I forget whose storyhead it was. It was just the picture said everything.  Ev was just going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Google looked at him a couple of years ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right? Well, it happened with Blogger.  And Blogger is still there. I was going to say, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ev has sold Google before.  Oh, that's right. He knows what that's about.  Right? I don't even know if  does Ev own Twitter? I mean, he owns  the blogger. He's on the board. He's a bigger shareholder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it is, let's face it,  publicly held at this point and could easily  be hostilely taken over because of its  value is so low. All Google has  to do is offer 21 billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for it. Would Facebook take it over  and just let it be what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook doesn't need it, right? No,  it doesn't. Google, you could argue,  needs the social signals.  They are currently buying them  from Twitter, but maybe Twitter might  change its tune or if somebody else buys Twitter,  they'd cut off Google. That's the  real threat, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or watch what's going to happen. Microsoft will buy it  like everything else, not know what the hell to do with it.  Yeah, I could see Microsoft buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. And well, look, they  shouldn't change the name. They should let it be,  right? Give it the back end argument  protection that it needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'd be your best option, right, is to not even let  anybody know you bought it.  As much as you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nothing to see here, move it along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep Twitter, let Twitter  be Twitter. Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  AOL. Oh,  God. What about Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if Yahoo bought it?  Does Yahoo have any money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is Yahoo's cash position?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they've got all  the holdings in that other company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, they sold off that other company.  They're making that a sub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alibaba, they sold off. Was it Alibaba? They sold off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and they're turning that into a  you know,  see, because it was the  AOL thing  and mobile phones and streams.  Everybody needs a stream now.  That's where that to me is the real battle now.  It's all about streams, streams of attention.  Well, and I think it's legit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you're a search engine that you need those  signals somehow. You need to get those signals  in. Let me just see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're an ad company, you need them. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, who's an ad company that we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know? Can you imagine the  uproar if Twitter was taken, if there  was a hostile takeover or Twitter? That would be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it'd be good for us.  Fascinating.  Fascinating to watch.  I don't know where I find  the cash position on this. I can't  figure it out. I'm not  exactly a big stock investor.  Financials.  Income statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyone who did buy Twitter,  if they're smart at all, they would leave  it be. They would leave the name and most users would  have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Balance sheet. Let's see.  That's where the cash will be.  Cash. Yeah, it was  $2 billion. They ain't going to buy.  They won't be buying Twitter any times.  What's Twitter? No, I'm sorry.  That's in thousands. So that would be  yeah, $2 billion.  $2.6 billion.  This is why I'm going to zero's  throw them. There's zero's in there. Google's  got something like $80 billion cash so that  Twitter, they could actually buy in cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's Twitter's current market cap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Under 20.  16 or something? Yeah, well they keep going down. I don't know  what is current. It's gone down quite a bit.  Stock is not doing well.  Let's see how they're  doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh.  Hmm.  Market cap $18.79 billion.  And going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that means like a German media  company, you know, Axiospringer couldn't buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe they could.  So the most credible thing would be to come to the  shareholders with this cash offer that's  over the current value  of the stock. You know, give them a premium of  $5 or whatever. No shareholder in  their right mind would refuse it.  And that's a hostile take and then you're  done. It's a little harder  if you're offering stock in Axiospringer.  Apple could buy them?  I don't know what Apple would do with them. I don't think  Apple wants them.  Hmm. That's interesting. This is the  picture you were talking about that goes along with this  article from  Business Insider.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.  Oh, Eb's got a little bit of crazy eyes going on there.  Zoom in on Eb's face.  He's got a little bit of crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  eyes going on there.  Get your hand, where's your hand going, Larry?  Get your hand off me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  That's gritted teeth. Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yikes.  That's just a bad moment.  Yeah, I mean that was just a...  It does illustrate the article well.  The article's title by J.  Jero, Google's CEO reportedly does not give an  F, probably stands for FIG,  about Twitter.  Is this  based on fact or just J's  It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what's his name from the information.  And the argument is, well, he's  one of the best tech reporters on earth so he must be right.  Oh, Amir Afrati said it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He said it in a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's amazing how

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  you can turn that into a whole business

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  center article.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the entire premise of the article.  And I got a great picture.  It's all takes.  That's journalism, kids.  It is now.  Nowadays.  Let's take a break. We're having fun.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  Gina Trippani is back. Lindy Johnson joining us  as we talk about the world  of Google and Twitter  and social media. And there is plenty more  to talk about. But first a word from  Harry's.  You like a clean shave? Who doesn't?  And that's where I get  my clean shave each and every morning.  Harry's dot com. Harry's is a great  story. It's another one of those internet  disruption stories where a guy came  along and said, why am I paying  four dollars a blade for my Gillette Fusions  and why are they locked up at the drug store?  And they decided we could do a better job  and charge less.  They did a little research, raised some  capital and said, you know the best thing to do with this  would be to buy the company that  makes the blades. Turns out  there are really two companies in the world  that make great razor blades. They're both in Germany.  Harry's bought one of them. So now  they can specify to the  company, they say we want them to be engineered  for performance, for  sharpness, and because they're  selling direct from the factory they can cut the price  in half. Literally in half.  I get Harry's blades by mail  directly from Harry's.  You start with a kit because of course you need a  handle to match the blades. Everybody's got some  proprietary blade solutions.  But these handles are great.  And they're very affordable so it makes  it easy. For instance, this is the Truman  kit. It's fifteen dollars.  I'll tell you how you can get it for less. It includes the handle,  three blades,  the, I, they never talk  about this but I love these  travel covers because it keeps you from  cutting. You can put this in your  shaving kit  and you don't cut yourself.  And look at that. My doorbell's  ringing. I'm sorry. I have to  turn that off.  Everything now in my life rings  at me. You also get your choice  and these are not sample sizes.  This is full size between the  foaming shave gel or the cream. Now this is all for  fifteen dollars. By the way, I love  both the cream and foaming shave gel.  If you're, you know, one of those folks like  who uses Gillette Edge and you like  that kind of gel,  this is great. Really  smells good and gives you  a very smooth shave. I use  the cream at home. I love that. And that  just comes in a little tube  and smells good and conditions your skin.  This is all for a fraction of the  price of what you'd pay at a drug store.  Now what do I do?  I got gel on my fingers here.  Shave somebody. I should just shave?  Alright, let me just put it on.  That'll help.  And then, oh it smells good though.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then  you subscribe and you get the blades  in the mail. You're going to love it.  Now let's take five bucks off. This is ten  dollars when you use our offer code  twig at harrys.com.  The smoothest  shave you've ever had. You're going to love  it. harrys.com.  Spend less on your shave  means more for summer fun.  Harrys.  I don't know why I'm shaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you commit to  squirting the stuff on your hands  then you got to do something.  I'm all in on Harrys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I commit, I commit.  You've reminded me I've got to order more blades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well if you subscribe you won't have to ever think about it.  It just needs to arrive. That's what I do.  Actually, we had a little  error at the  blade factory.  Both Lisa and I subscribed without each other's  knowledge so now we have lots of blades.  You know what's good about, first of all  they're not very expensive and what's great about that is  you change the blade more often which means you  get a better shave. Yes.  Because I think that when the blades cost eight bucks  or whatever, there's a real temptation  to never change your blade.  With Harrys I change it at least every week  and I love it. I really do. harrys.com.  Use the offer code TWIG by the way  at checkout to save five bucks.  And when you do that you'll be letting Harrys know  you listen to TWIG and that's a good thing.  Let's talk phones.  You were at the...  Truth in advertising.  You went to the  one plus one  event, Jeff Jarvis,  but you only stood in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  I signed up.  I was official.  It was in New York. It was a hot day.  A woman fainted in front of us.  There were people there since seven o'clock the night before.  The first like six people  got a really nice one plus backpack.  Oh that's nice.  And the first I think fifty people got a bag with an invite in it  and so the presumption was that nobody after that was going to get an invite.  Though apparently I think everybody  did get an invite. You got a couple.  Well I went and talked to the founder.  But I had to go to work.  I went and did a phone call.  I put some pictures up.  And people were in a great mood and they were happy.  And I talked to them.  He was really quite charming.  It was the guy who was in the video.  I'm sorry I'm suddenly forgetting.  But it was in the Google Cardboard video.  And was charmed by this.  They said that only Apple gets lines.  And they were happy they had lines.  They did it at the same time.  I had like six cities around the world.  And people were happy and they were waiting just to see the phone.  That was it. It was celebrity phone.  And I thought it was nice.  It was not overdone in hype.  It was charming.  I'm glad they made the right specs.  And I don't care if it doesn't have NFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They make the point on that.  And I think it might not be a bad point.  Nobody is yet really using NFC for payments.  That's a year or two. By then they said you'll have a new phone.  A new phone.  Yeah exactly.  I don't know if that's true. But I have to say I very rarely use Touch2Pay.  And if I do I use it because I'm like  oh I've got to use this Apple Watch for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really glad on USB-C.  Only problem is there's no quick charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That to me is a little surprising.  Yeah it's USB-C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's a Snapdragon 810 processor  which isn't compatible with USB 3.1 spec.  Only 2.0 and 3.0.  So you won't get the high speed USB connection.  So you don't. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yes it's USB-C connector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you could do fast charging.  In fact USB-C is rated up to 100 watts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They could slam electrons into the phone.  But they just have decided not to.  Nor do they have wireless charging.  On the other hand  remember this is roughly the same screen  that they had last year.  So they're not going quad HD anymore  like some of these other guys.  And the last one got great battery life.  So this may be moot.  I mean if you can get through the day you get through the day.  You don't need a quick charging.  I'm very very tempted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And sorry folks I don't have any more invites.  You gave them to me and Jason.  That was very kind of you.  I was just about to ask for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry about that.  Though I think once you buy Leo you get an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will invite you.  Absolutely Lyn as soon as I get an invite.  Sounds great.  And Gina too if you want one.  Because I think Gina is using the OnePlus and is ready for the OnePlus 2.  I am ready for the OnePlus 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the question is Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the question I'm trying to figure out  as I said earlier is  OnePlus 2, Moto X.  Similar price.  I'm not sure what to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be honest. I really I'm truly  looking forward to the next Nexus.  Because I love the OnePlus 1.  The issue was I waited so long  for Lollipop.  And I just I want to be in the Nexus track.  So I get updates right away.  The Moto X looked really cool.  And I was saying Leo and Prisho I had the Moto G  in my cart. I stopped myself from the Moto G  just because I felt like it might be too underpowered  for me. Not for most users.  Just for me. And the Moto X looks really  good. But I don't know. I feel like there's a Nexus on the  horizon and I just want to hold on and wait for that.  Although you can say that forever as an

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android user. But Gina are you  waiting for the Nexus 6? Are you waiting  for the new Nexus 5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm waiting for the  Nexus 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't  know what the next Nexus is. I'm sort of betting  and I don't know actually you guys you guys may be at more  up to date than I am on this. I'm  assuming that there's going to be a new Nexus phone  in time for the holidays. I don't know though  there's not been any. I don't know. We haven't heard any rumors.  I'm basing this  idea solely on  the fact that like it's a holiday season and it's  been a while since there's been a  new device. I don't know. I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Lynn's not joking. There is a rumor that there's  going to be a Nexus 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's going to be two. There's a rumor that there's  two. Which has never really  happened before.  No larger one and a smaller one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This 5 would refer more to the size. Now IFA is coming up  in September. About a month from now.  So that's the rumor  that they'll announce it in a month.  So a new  Nexus 5. A new Nexus 5.  And I imagine if they announce a new Nexus 5  if there are two they'll announce them both at the same time.  Why would they spread that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The rumor says one by Huawei  which would be the larger one which would be  interesting. A phablet.  And one by LG which would be the new Nexus 5.  LG made the original Nexus 5.  Right. And Nexus 5 by  all accounts is one of the most popular  Nexus devices. Still very used  right now. Crappy camera.  Yeah. I mean  you could get some good results with the camera  with HDR on. But crappy camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty bad. Nowadays I think camera  is so important. You've got to have a good camera.  OnePlus 2 will have a good camera.  Actually so will the Motorola. So will the  G. The G is the same  camera as the Nexus 6.  The 6 without optical image stabilization.  And this is I think a pretty  good camera. I've been happy. How about you Jeff?  You're happy with this Nexus 6 camera. Yeah I think it's  pretty good. It's not as good as  this S6 or the LG 4  or the iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it's right up there. I think it would be very  surprising if Google released  M officially and didn't have  a phone to launch it with.  That's kind of the way they do that now.  That's in a couple of months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But remember a couple of things.  The OnePlus now using Oxygen  is a pretty pure version  almost as pure as  the Motorola version of Android.  So I would expect the OnePlus  the Motorola's both  to get updated pretty, almost  as quickly as a Nexus device.  So I don't know if you'll be  too far behind the curve on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But of course  it all pales to the iPhone  and the next OS 9.  And there was a preview of that  shown. Did you see the video there on the right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All hail to the great iPhone  in the sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see the video?  This is to die  for. Do you have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you do this yesterday and all about Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? I kept it out only because  I feared  that people would watch it and think  we were being too trollish with it.  Let's see here.  Is this the German YouTube?  No, that's different.  Where did you put this, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here it is. I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the CNET story, right?  Is it alright to say  what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they took  an iPhone, they put  Android on it and they told  iPhone fans that  it was iOS 9.  And so you  can guess the hilarity that ensued.  For those on audio, we'll have to  read the subtitles.  It's in German? Yeah, it's pretty much entirely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in Dutch. Not all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's some English ones. Dutch is the strangest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  language. I love it. It's beautiful.  It sounds like  an alien language to me.  There's a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My favorite is the newspaper, the telecraft.  It spit a lot.  That was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  really disappointing.  Apparently, I got to play it in the ad.  That was  my mistake. I clicked on the ad  instead of... And no wonder it was  all ad. Okay, that's good. Here we go.  Let's start over again.  This is Dit.  Dit is norma.  In a couple of weeks, Apple will be releasing iOS 9.  This update will include a lot of new functions,  a couple of which have been available on Android  for years. Still, many people  believe iOS is better than Android.  But what happens when we show people Android

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  on an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then tell them it's iOS 9.  This is like  Jay Leno. Anybody will fall for anything.  I know they will, but I don't like them.  What's your first impression?  It takes some getting used to. I like that thing with  the music a lot. It looks completely different,  doesn't it? It looks easier.  Nice icons for the apps.  I like it a lot.  When you're on a website, you can  still control your music with a widget.  When you go on your music  and you come off it, that's a great little thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The shaky thing.  Why is this better than Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Apple is just chill.  I think it looks a little smoother.  It's prettier.  Why is this better? For me, it's just because  it's a lot faster and smoother.  I think it looks a lot like Android.  We've got this exactly.  Yeah, in my opinion, it does look better and I would recommend to get it  if I could get one on an iPhone for myself, I would.  I just think Apple is always better.  I do think it looks better. I also prefer the way the apps  look, but I still remain a Samsung fanboy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Android guy didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Poor guy. Well, he's got  the Samsung skin.  How does iOS 9 compare to iOS 8?  Every time there's a new update, it takes some getting used to.  But it's always better.  Well, you definitely have a bit more, few things.  I think the rebooting thing is great.  It's a great invention.  It's an improvement, of course.  So how did they get this on an iPhone?  I don't know. That's kind of cool, too.  Maybe it's one of those Chinese knockoffs.  Things you can just pinch on your screen to turn the power off.  All in all, it does look better.  You know, I feel like this isn't, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Well, I thought I was amused.  It's amusing.  I like pawning Apple fanboys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Conclusion, it doesn't matter what Apple releases,  because people are going to think it's prettier, bigger, and better  than the competition no matter what.  And to all Apple users, don't forget to update  soon to Android.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was OK.  It was a good bit.  I feel bad for people when they get ambushed on the street.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like an hour's call.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to keep it on updates?  Did you see the news that hit today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  As far as updates are concerned?  Basically Google, Google Play, Google Play,  basically Google announced that they're going to be providing  monthly OTA over-the-air security updates for all their Nexus devices  down to the four to three years from launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they can do this. They should do it forever if it's security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  Samsung is also, well, Samsung says they're also going to be delivering  monthly over-the-air security updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is because of the stage fright vulnerability.  Everybody's up in arms about almost a billion  Android devices are vulnerable to it,  and a small fraction of those are up to date and will get or will get updated,  mainly because they're by manufacturers who don't care or carriers who don't care or both.  I mean, my Samsung Galaxy S6 was fixed almost immediately.  All Nexus devices have been fixed.  It's a nasty bug.  Your phone can be taken over by somebody sending you a MMS message,  even if you don't open it, even before you even know it came.  So it's a really nasty bug.  I don't know of anybody who's been bit by it yet,  although they do say I think it's in the wild now.  It certainly will be in the wild once we see the proof of concept code,  which will come out at Black Hat or DEF CON this week.  So that's what Google's trying to respond to.  And we've talked about this. Gina's talked about this.  One of the things Google's doing to try to fix this is move more and more of the operating system  out of the core AOSP code and into apps, which can be all the time.  Into apps, which can be updated, or modules, which can be updated on the Play Store.  So that's why your web services now get mod,  even though you never see an app for web services,  it gets updated from the Play Store.  That means Google can push out an update.  They can't right now. It's out of their hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. That update pipeline, I mean, the thing about Google Chrome that always stuck with me  was that the first thing that they built for Google Chrome was the updater,  like before they started building it.  And it was this idea that they could just push updates,  because Firefox had that thing where you had to restart it,  and it was a real pain to update.  So Google knows how important it is to be able to push updates aggressively to everyone.  And yeah, so this Android issue, that stage fright and vulnerability, man,  just the name alone, it's worthy of the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Even though Google named it.  It's a Google name for that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you didn't really have to go far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should have chose something a little bit, I feel like that was the developer, not a marketer.  Yeah.  A marketer would be like, don't worry about this vulnerability.  Like, you probably won't get hit with this.  This is like scary stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When people say, oh, well, you see the iPhone's more secure,  what they don't understand is the reason this is a problem in the Android world  is because it's an open source, freely distributed operating system,  and anybody can use AOSP, and so it makes it difficult to update  because it's being used by so many people in so many different ways.  That's a boon, as well as a security issue.  Apple, of course, can keep it secure because they control it entirely.  They control what updates go out when to which phones.  And so a closed system is going to be a more secure system in that respect.  But you give up so much.  I mean, I think the openness of AOSP really is to be praised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there something architecturally that Google should have done differently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think you can. If you're going to open source it, in other words, say,  anybody could take this code and make a phone with it, which they do.  Then you can't ensure that it will get updated ever again  because what you have is a lot of handset makers making $25 phones  in the developing world who there's no way or no desire to update it.  But that has put those phones in people's hands.  You don't see iPhones in those people's hands because they can't afford them.  Yeah.  There's a lot of good stuff in there, though.  And somebody's pointing out that address space randomization is in there,  which according to Android Central, putting ASLR means that 90% of phones  are protected from the issue.  You need to know if you're going to take advantage of a vulnerability  like stage fright, you need to be able to jump into,  you need to be able to put malicious code memory and jump to it.  But when you randomize address space, it makes it much more difficult.  So Alan Ludwig, who's a Google engineer, told NPR,  currently 90% of Android devices have a technology called ASLR enabled  that protects users from the issue.  So that's good news.  ASLR was enabled in the default Linux kernel in 2005  and was added to Android with version 4.  See, that's the problem.  So that's good.  That means 4 and 5 are safe.  But the gingerbread's not.  The big difference from 900 million Android devices over.  But all these people running gingerbread phones, you know what?  You might be in trouble.  You should...  And I don't know what the answer is to that.  Once you let it be open source, it's out of your control.  Samsung is going to fix it.  Alcatel is going to fix it.  Sony, HTC, and LG all say they'll be releasing patches this month.  We're going to...  The problem is it won't be until Black Hat that we'll see the details.  So one of the things Steve Gibson wants, and I agree this is something we need  and I hope that the security firms Imperium who discovered this will do,  is put out a website that would demonstrate this  and let people who have Android phones test their phone against it.  So you could go to a website and say, yes, send me a message.  It won't obviously hack your phone.  It'll say something like, yes, you're vulnerable or no, you're not.  That's what we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you are, if you do get hacked, what's the fix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put Cyanogen Mod 12 on your phone.  Really?  Well, that's one fix.  Cyanogen's been fixed already.  Get a new phone.  Get a new phone.  That's the real problem.  If you're somebody in New Delhi who bought a $25 phone,  you probably don't even know about this issue.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, but we don't know of mass attacks with this yet anyway,  so I don't know what's going on.  I don't know how big of a problem it's going to be.  August 6th.  I guess we'll find out.  Is that tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Tomorrow, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a bad one.  Let's see.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm curious what Lynn and Gina think of the Facebook kerfuffle.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break and we'll talk about that.  I have an article on Medium by Hank Green who's a Facebook star.  Theft, lies, and Facebook video.  Facebook says it's now streaming more video than YouTube.  They're able to make that claim because they cheat, lie, and steal.  What do you think?  We'll find out.  First, a word from Braintree.  If you're a mobile app developer,  if you've got a website where you do payments,  you should know about Braintree.  We love Braintree.  They, with a simple integration of 10 lines of code,  can actually put mobile payments for everything into your app.  We're talking credit cards, PayPal, Venmo, Bitcoin, Apple Pay.  I talked a couple of weeks ago to Juan Benitez, who's the CTO of Braintree,  and he said developers love Braintree.  Take a listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When we talk to iOS engineers,  they get really excited by how fast and easy it is to have Apple Pay through Braintree.  Just a ton of feedback from Android developers saying,  wow, great, now I can get Android Pay.  Then you see people really kind of responding and saying,  wow, I can do more than one of these through one integration, one SDK, and one report too.  Wow, that's going to make my finance guys happy.  Everybody's going to be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most importantly, your users, Uber uses Braintree.  So does Lyft.  Airbnb uses Braintree.  So does Hotel Tonight.  When you see competitors using the same mobile payment solution,  you know it must work.  Living Social, Muntree, GitHub.  Come on, developers.  If GitHub uses it, that's a pretty strong recommendation.  I want you to try it.  You can actually get, there's a sandbox.  You can give it a try, see what your app would look like using Braintree's integration.  They solved the problem of mobile card abandonment.  70% of mobile shopping carts are abandoned before the transaction.  You've got to capture those users.  You can.  And by the way, superior fraud protection, customer service, and fast payouts.  It is awesome.  That one touch is fantastic.  That's what Uber uses.  So you don't even have to do anything.  You just get out of the car.  Braintree gives you full stack payment solution.  I want you to try it and get your first $50,000 in transactions fee free.  BraintreePayments.com  slash twigbraintreepayments.com slash twig.  Try it today.  Hank Green has YouTube channels like SciShow, Crash Course.  He's one of the vlog brothers.  He organizes VidCon, which just ended.  So he's a well-respected, well-liked creator on YouTube.  And he's concerned about a few things.  Of course, Facebook's going to YouTube creators like him and others saying,  put your video on Facebook.  And I don't mean put a link to your YouTube on Facebook.  Put your video natively on Facebook.  He says the information they give us is, and they're giving out to the public, is lies, is cheats.  He says, if I embed a YouTube video or a Vine on Facebook,  only a tiny fraction of my audience will see it.  But if I post the same video natively on Facebook, suddenly it's in everyone's feed everywhere.  Facebook is happy to admit this strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because Facebook's argument is also that, and this is the same with instant articles,  that it is going to serve a lot better and faster and nicer, and people don't want delay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And I mean, that part is not surprising anyway.  I mean, with any third-party app, it just seems that that stuff is not shown to as many people.  They're just, anything that's natively done on Facebook, if you post directly to Facebook,  definitely more people are going to see it.  That's just the way that algorithm works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of like the complaints people make about Google's search terms favoring YouTube videos, though, right?  It's kind of like, well, Facebook shouldn't really promote, you know,  because they control what you see in your feed.  So that's the question. Is Facebook saying, oh, well, I see you linked to YouTube.  I guess we won't push you to your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And why is anyone shocked about either example?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's doing business.  Yeah.  In fact, he says, I guess that's their prerogative.  Yeah.  But as a creator, it seems like an abuse of power.  The other one, and this is to me more damning, is how you count a view.  Now, I don't...  Yeah, this is an issue that advertisers are going to give them hell about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an interesting, this is the most interesting part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook says, if you have that video visible on your screen for three seconds, you viewed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, of course, you didn't play or interact with it. You viewed it.  However, Facebook also says the numbers they pay attention to are if you turned up the sound, if you did something with it.  So they've got to shift to those more meaningful metrics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because he's saying they'll count you as a view even if you don't turn on the sound.  But the nature of Facebook, unless you've turned off autoplay video, is that the minute you start scrolling past something, it's playing.  One, one thousand, two, one thousand, three, one thousand, that's real quickly.  That's a view.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically, if it just shows up in your feed, you viewed it without doing anything.  Right. I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, of course, Len, you're right.  Of course, now the big deal in advertising is more than half the ads you didn't even actually ever see.  So now it's a big deal. Viewability means that the ad appeared on your screen before your eyeballs and now we can charge you for it.  So viewability has a very funny definition when it comes to advertising where we are kind of ripping off the advertisers for it.  And still, you don't make money that way.  X-Nay on the Ipping Ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not making money that way.  For years, radio has gotten away with...  Well, newspapers.  Yes.  There's newspapers.  And people sometimes ding podcasts for exactly the same thing.  Well, people downloaded it, but did they listen to it?  People bought the paper, but did they see every single ad in the paper? I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but in this case, Leo, we had ads.  Right.  But we had ads that were on pages that we know didn't ever scroll up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I'm just saying that's the nature of the world until you have a way of counting people where people are looking.  There's going to be some slop.  Yeah, we charge people for downloads, not for views, because we can't tell whether somebody actually listened to a show.  Only that they downloaded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook can tell and they've decided not to.  Right?  Yes.  That's Hank's point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've changed how they count it, right?  But you can make the argument that, well, they do that because otherwise their numbers are going to be grossly incomparable to other media, because other media is inflating their numbers.  So we need to do the same.  Yeah.  I'm not defending Facebook.  I'm just saying that might be the thinking.  So he's saying they should do what YouTube does.  The view is counted at the point where people seem to be actually engaging with the video, which is usually around 30 seconds, but it's different for videos of different lengths.  So in other words, YouTube and the two graphs are pretty telling.  Here's Facebook retention at 30 seconds, about 20 percent.  YouTube retention at 30 seconds, about 86 percent.  He says this might seem a little like a victimless crime.  By the way, Anil Dash underlined this.  I love this feature of medium where you can see others, people annotating and underlining and stuff.  This might seem a little like this is a victimless crime, but it fundamentally devalues the number one metric of online video.  The view is the thing that everyone talks about.  It's the thing creators sell to advertisers.  Applying that word to something far less valuable is going to be extremely disruptive to creators.  Ad agencies and brands are confused enough that Facebook muddying the waters by calling something a view when it is in no way a measurement of viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, does YouTube report only fully viewed videos or does it also count as a view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. No. In fact, it does not count fully viewed videos, but it doesn't count it as a view right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's degrees we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a matter of degree, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is Facebook defining what a view is or YouTube for that matter?  I mean, why is there a standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There isn't a standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there isn't in podcasting either. There has been for years in radio and television, but there have been competing standards.  There's been Arbitron and Nielsen. They're now all kind of unified.  But for years...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always been relative BS.  Well, that's...  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that's the thing...  Because it had to be.  That's the thing that kids like Hank don't realize is we've always been lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but because it was immeasurable before, but now it is measurable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe we need to rethink it. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen, I thought that Hank's framing of this, the lies, the stealing, the viciousness, however he put it, was extreme.  But I also feel like, look, you know, like Taylor Swift told Apple they were screwing up and Apple...  He got our attention.  We need creators like Hank who are really well known, who have been in this business and who are on the creative side to kind of, you know, speak truth to power in a way.  Like, hey, I'm building a business on this. This is confusing and hard.  And this freebooting... freebooting? Is that what it's called? This freebooting issue with Facebook video is also just infuriating.  And I'm like, information wants to be free. Hey, share my stuff.  I would be infuriated if someone took my video, stripped out attribution and ads and whatever else I put in it and then republished it under their own.  That would make me crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says, according to a report from Ogilvy and Tubular Labs, of the 1000 most popular Facebook videos in the first quarter,  725 were stolen and in a sense stolen because they were downloaded from YouTube or somewhere else and re-uploaded to Facebook.  And he says that's 17 billion views last quarter.  So, and by the way, if you complain to Facebook, they'll take... and he, I guess he's... maybe some of those videos are his.  He says you could complain to Facebook and in a couple of days they'll take it down.  You know, he says, once it's received 99.9% of the views it's ever going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are lessons that, you know, in some fairness here, YouTube had to go through all these lessons in its early days of video.  And Facebook has made this big push to video fairly recently.  So that obviously YouTube had to create an entire system.  Remember the Viacom suit, an entire system to recognize copyrighted material, to get rid of it, to deal with challenges.  It took building.  I think what might have been... I think Gene is right that he raises important points.  The positioning is rather harsh and extreme.  The better way to raise this might have been to say that as a growing industry, of which Hank is a real leader,  we need some standards.  And whoever the platform is, whoever comes down the line, when YouTube starts playing videos natively,  when Viacom, I mean when Verizon is doing the phones,  we as a new industry need standards so that we can know what our own data is and so we can give advertisers reliable things.  That's the more mature way I think to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He talks about Dustin Sandlin who runs a great channel called Smarter Every Day.  Spends a lot of money and time making his videos.  One of his videos was...  See, this is what happens. It's not Facebook doing this.  Some other company that wanted traffic on their page just took his video and put it on their page.  It got 17 million views.  Dustin has made a video that talks about this issue.  And I do think that that's unfair.  Although, couldn't you be just as upset about YouTube taking the vast majority of the profits  from you and on and on and on.  I mean, it's not like creators are well treated in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook would have to be really, really bad to make YouTube look good.  Apparently they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the other principle here is some means of rev share.  Yeah.  And again, I've talked to my friends, Samir Arora and Clam, and with all the videos they're doing,  they always pay a creator full stop.  If you natively just recommend something, they don't necessarily pay you.  But if you embed it, they will pay you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe this is what Hank's point is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's what the argument really is.  Facebook doesn't have a partnership with creators in the same way that YouTube does.  I think that's what it really comes down to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if Facebook were smart, they could actually, if they did it right and said,  you know what, we're going to do this right, we're going to share it with you, we're going to protect you.  They could beat YouTube easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could leapfrog.  Which is, by the way, exactly, and there's a precedent for this,  exactly Facebook's strategy with news organizations, with instant articles.  Where out of the gate they said, if you sell the ad, you keep 100 percent.  If we sell it, we keep 30 percent.  You get 70 percent.  There's the deal.  You're going to get better serving because you're natively done.  You're going to get more traffic because you're natively done.  And people complain about that.  But hey, it's our business.  They could make similar deals with video creators.  And the advantage that you're in right now, which I argue with the news industry,  which I would say the same thing to Hanken companies, rather than just saying, I'm a YouTube guy and Facebook's all bad.  The smarter thing to do, the clever thing to do is to play them off each other.  And to say, well, Facebook did that.  Why don't you do that?  Well, look, Facebook, YouTube did this.  And in a position where if content from these big guys does matter.  You know, when I called in to Stern, we talked about it on the last week show.  And he was aghast that there was somebody named PewDiePie making huge amounts of money.  But he was a gog.  He talked about Booker, one of his DJ friends, and he said, Booker's been in the industry for 34 years.  He's not making eight million dollars a year.  He should go to work for PewDiePie.  And it is amazing.  There are now 35 presenters on YouTube that have more than 10 million followers each.  That's a phenomenal ecosystem.  There is revenue sharing going on with there.  So they're each.  But meanwhile, Google is not revenue sharing.  It doesn't have the means to embed.  I yelled at them two years ago saying make content embeddable on Google plus.  Put ads in their start.  I see, you know, I thought they should listen to me.  But but this mechanism has been there.  And and content creators should see the opportunity to to negotiate.  And Hank, I think, has an opportunity because he he has a huge I was so impressed with VidCon and it's an incredible creation.  And that middle floor is creators.  And I'm not suggesting they start a union among them, but you can start a negotiation platform.  That's a great idea.  I union is the wrong word because it's going around a lot with Gawker and places like that.  But you look at what The Guardian did and bringing together eight publishers with Google and the Digital News Initiative.  There is a mechanism where the German publishers were going against Google.  Google needed friends.  The Guardian put together friends and said, OK, let's talk Turkey.  Let's get real about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that what makers should be doing, though?  Companies that are doing this kind of aggregation on YouTube.  These this this is that is a union.  In effect, shouldn't you be going to YouTube and say, yeah, killed.  And what should Facebook do about freebooting?  Because that's really nasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should do the same things that that YouTube eventually had to do, which is number one, you have a detection system content ID and content ID.  And number two, that when challenged, you operate pretty quickly and take stuff down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Content ID has worked on YouTube, has it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Finally, it took a long time to build.  And and you know, you could almost hope that Google would open source it for the sake of the entire nascent video industry.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook is working on a content ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need to. They need to.  So their product manager for Facebook Video responded to this medium post.  And it's the bottom of that post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead, then.  I was going to say the same thing you're saying.  It looks like Facebook is trying to do something.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it says my name is Matt Packers or Pakes and I'm a project manager at Facebook responsible for video products.  First, I want to be clear that we and I absolutely do care about digital video creators.  We also care about the people who watch videos and Facebook as well as advertisers.  Our goal is to build and support products for video creators and to create a sustainable video ecosystem that works well for everyone.  To that end, I'd like to address your concerns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, so he's to this product manager.  He defends autoplay by saying that people only see videos in their newsfeed if they have interacted with videos in the past, which means they're more likely to care about videos.  So they see more videos.  And so they know that they feel like autoplay is the best experience because forcing the user to actually interact and tap the play button doesn't doesn't make sense.  It's a better experience because their newsfeed is smarter.  I think now he says the data bears that out.  OK, he also says if you've stayed on a video for at least three seconds, it signals to us to Facebook that you are not simply scrolling through feed and that you've shown intent to watch the video.  So he's saying three seconds on a video shows intent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can, by the way, if you're a page owner, see a little bit more like how long people watch and so forth.  So the public view count is just one data point that they provide.  If you're if you own the video, you get a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And then he says that they've got an IP system.  They have an audible magic system that they that they've used and that they're working on it.  Significant technical challenge on our scale.  Have a team working on it.  You know, so look, this is the you know, this is the line, right?  But this is this is a decent response.  It's interesting that they defended autoplay this way over years of developing and tuning newsfeed.  We know that clicking on a link to play video is not a great user experience.  So 10 people tend to interact slightly less with non native video.  So the posts get less engagement.  Native video posts with autoplay tend to see better engagement, more watch time and higher view counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's an example on my page.  So Jim Cutler, our friend, posted a video of Billy Joel at the NASA Coliseum from YouTube in order to watch that.  I have to press the play button and it would then play.  At least I wouldn't have to leave the YouTube page.  But if I keep scrolling down, I'm sure I'll find some this Callie Lewis, some native video somewhere in here.  There's another YouTube.  Well, actually, I don't maybe I don't interact a lot with native video because they're not putting any native video in here.  Hey, here we go.  And then Felicia Day, who is smart enough to make that native video and you see and actually, you know, it does kind of make you stop a little bit.  A lot better.  Brilliant.  And the sound doesn't come up.  Right.  I have to have to click it for the sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you if you keep scrolling, it will stop unless you've done there's some kind of threshold that if you if you listen for a certain amount of time, if you turn the sound up, I think it'll keep going.  It's still going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think they learn that from Instagram, too, because it's the same thing.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They tried it first on Instagram.  Good point.  And the thing we all thought it would be about is forcing us to watch ads.  But they haven't really done that.  I don't think it is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's about making the experience better.  Better. And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're right.  It works. They're consistent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Instant articles in this.  They're quite consistent about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think the key for for Hank and others is I think they're right to put the screws to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And but but there's a case of here's my argument, though.  That's the German model.  You are stealing from us.  We are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think those words were too loaded.  That was those were the wrong word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think, you know, flies and honey, you know, even Facebook is human.  Right.  Whereas and one can argue it takes that to get their attention, you know.  Right.  But but having said that, then the way you're going to get somewhere is by having a reasonable discussion of mutual self-interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think really one thing Facebook could do is to is to show to step up and say, look, we really care.  We want you to have a great experience.  We're doing everything we can.  And we'd like to share the revenue with you in a equitable, equitable way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's the difference.  I think that right now they're not really doing revenue around video.  They're just building video.  Right.  They're building it.  This is what Facebook always does.  There was a great moment.  I tweeted it or I have Facebook.  I can't remember what the what the it was.  It was Mark talking about his numbers last time.  And and when I started in this business on digital, the old saw the early early on the 90s was well, you got to get to 100,000 users before the advertising pay attention to you.  That was a million.  That was three million.  Mark Zuckerberg said basically he doesn't deal with monetization until it hits a billion.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has a billion users.  So what they're doing right now with video is they're just building the hell out of it.  So there's no revenue to share yet.  Same exact thing happened at YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Glenn, are we going to start posting videos natively on Facebook or are we going to keep posting links?  He's in with somebody.  He's got the door closed.  Jason, don't you think we ought to just start?  Let's just let's do it.  Do it.  Because it will get like 10 times the engagement.  I mean, the numbers are significantly different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you were my client, I would advise you.  I'm your client.  I would advise you to post natively to have more engagement.  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then where else should Leo where all should one post videos now?  If you're a YouTube star, where else should you be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're a YouTube star, I think I think even just having a clip on Instagram.  Ah, smart vine vine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. Vine is different.  No, don't you think vine is really transmogrified into I don't know what vine is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be honest.  I don't look at it often, but I have friends who just love who I mean, apparently there are folks who just vine stars who just well, that's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's become a medium in and of itself, a six second medium, like a teaser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think people I think people who do well in vine are native to vine.  Yes.  Because six seconds, I can't post something in six seconds.  It's going to be compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. Right.  So Instagram, you don't do visual gags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a certain sameness, isn't there, to vines at this point?  Gives me a headache after enough time.  It's for it's for the youngsters.  It's not for us.  It's for the youngsters.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vine is one of those things that makes you really, really old.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The youngsters love it.  Tony tells me that we do TN2 on Facebook natively because it's shorter and the other shows that we have are too long to do it.  Twitbits we should do that way.  Yeah. Oh yeah.  Twitbits for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I didn't even try the whole show.  You know, I talked to Kevin Delaney at Quartz and they put up they started doing some video and they had this beautiful thing of deep undersea, strange sea monster things.  Monster being the theme of the day.  And so they put it up only on Facebook at first, nowhere else.  What they found was that people, a, watched it.  It was like a, you know, it was not an hour.  It was not like doing this, but it was it was it was just assumptions.  Wasn't fine.  And the number of likes went up.  People wanted to see more and they wanted to signal and say, yeah, show me more.  So I would try every possible I would try tidbits, but I would also try a couple full shows just to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, somewhere like Vine, you could do like, you know, quick clips of like funny outtakes or something, you know, just the word the vine crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not the vine crowd, but I know Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely Instagram.  I like that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's 15 seconds, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because you could do promo videos.  Yeah.  You know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But say again.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it doesn't know you're talking about 45 minutes is the length cut off for Facebook native video.  So I guess we do 10, 10, 10, 10 shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we could upload to it.  Tidbit, twitbits, not tidbits.  That's for somebody else.  We could upload twitbits and and clips.  I think we should probably.  But I don't know if Vine is going to really work for us.  I don't run into enough walls to make it to make it viable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'd have to have a blooper reel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a blooper reel at work.  Six seconds, six seconds blooper reel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I get a headache, too.  Maybe it's just you and me, Jeff.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're just old.  We're just old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do the kids, the kids still love Vine?  Lynn, is this still a viable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.  But I mean, they're they're more into Snapchat now.  You know, I mean, Vine is still viable.  As as I think Gina just said, they you know, there's some stars who are built there.  Some of those kids go on college tours.  They're huge.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we talked about that with YouTube, too.  I mean, there's there's these video stars from YouTube, but they don't even do anything.  They just show up, do selfies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got a question.  I got a question for all you guys.  So I decided to go into Facebook and throw myself in.  And I found that enriching.  I've been trying to do the same thing with YouTube.  It's hard to get a purchase on the mountain because it just recommends stuff to me based  on what I've known or stuff that's wildly popular.  That's not for me.  And I can't kind of it's hard to explore, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, have you seen you're on Android, right?  Have you seen the new layout on the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was trying to web.  But yeah, and that's still on the Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The new layout makes it a little bit easier because, well, if you subscribe to anything,  you can see your subscriptions separately now and the recommendations come separately  in a stream.  I think I think this new layout on Android has made it a little easier.  But yeah, they recommend things to you based on what you've watched in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think really, if you think of it, YouTube is like pulling a thread off a sweater.  The key is to start.  So pick something that you're interested in, because then afterwards, I feel like you could  just let it go because now it's just going to auto play more like that.  And it does kind of want it's like the old days when you like stumble upon when you would  wander through the web.  So I, for instance, I start I start watching fails video.  Our son's very interested in fails videos.  You know, people falling apart.  But here I was watching talk show talk show nightmares.  And and it just and then it just keeps going.  And then you'll get more and more and boom, boom, boom.  And it's like it really is like a thread off a sweater.  You just keep pulling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's the same problem that Twitter and Google Plus have in the early days.  You come on. What's here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Discover. I don't see anything here.  Well, this is the front. Let's see.  Let me go back to the front page.  I don't like this, by the way, this little thing.  I don't never know how to how do you get rid of the swipe it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Swipe it off. Yeah, that was easy.  But that but what you really don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because it keeps playing.  Even if I exit, even if I go back to the home, it keeps playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Because that's because they want you to remain engaged.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something I feel like they're going, hey, don't hey, don't stop.  No, no, we get away. I'm still talking here.  So I think the recommendations are pretty good, Jeff.  Look at the recommendations. They're good for me.  Maybe you just don't watch enough stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the problem. I've got to I've got to devote time to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you start watching music videos and you just never you can leave it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the other problem is it gives me nothing but frigging TED Talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's because you're that's you did that.  You did that. Nothing but Elmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's all my fault. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get the YouTube you deserve. You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You do. So, I mean, you have to subscribe to a few channels and you have to watch a few shows.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw I was on I had the honor.  It's now it's now available. I should plug this.  I had the honor to be on Neil deGrasse Tyson Star Talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I saw you sitting there. That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was really cool. He's just great.  So I've been for that and other reasons I'll say later.  I've been watching a lot of Neil deGrasse Tyson videos and he's just he's just compelling every single time.  Yeah. It's just phenomenal.  So that is picking up and giving me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So there you go. You probably subscribed, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's probably but in that case, it's not.  No, it's everybody in the world is putting Neil deGrasse Tyson moments they like.  So that's what the algorithm isn't that what I should do, Lynn, is subscribe to stuff that I think is good,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because that's the signal you need to send to YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, you have to subscribe to a few channels. Yeah.  I'm going to subscribe to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The young Turks. I like young Turks. See, you're you're good.  Oh, now this is so nice, Lynn. You just saved me a lot.  A lot of a lot of upset. Swipe it off.  Swipe it off. That's not intuitive.  I've been dragging it around, been messing with it.  It just drives me crazy.  So now that's there. See, I've been doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you were 12, you would know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was obvious. It's just like Tinder. You swipe right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen the the AP and movie tone videos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that exciting? I think we talked about a couple of weeks ago.  Actually, they put how many tens of thousands of old timey newsreels up on YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watch out, you kids. Well, references will be there with our Niagara Falls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. You know you want to talk about it, Jeff.  Spain joined. I think Germany started it.  Germany started it almost like Zunz, which wrecked where they got upset  because Google was putting snippets from the news in their Google News.  And that's stealing. So they then they created a tax, a Google News tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basically, you can't if you if you link, you must pay for the privilege of linking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Belgium did it first. So Google just took the publications out.  Then Germany did it. So they took the snippets out, which the publishers got upset about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then all went around and it was just a game.  So Spain said it's mandatory. You don't get to opt in or out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google said, however you say, if you want. I'm opting out of Spain.  Adios. And that's still the case. There's no Google News in Spain.  So a study by the Spanish Association of Publishers of Periodical Publications,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  who, by the way, have been the ones to pressure Google here.  So you'd think that they would be trying to sugarcoat this.  But there's no sugar to be found because they say, yes, indeed, it hurt the publishers.  And what's more tragic is it killed a whole bunch of little guys.  Just killed them because they said we can't afford to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Planeta, Ludico, Niagara, rank info, Alemant, Multi Freaky shut down entirely.  Gone. Niagara rank, ignoring the extent quantity methods followed to determine  whether they should pay the fee they preferred to close down.  Yeah. So everyone was worse off. The news ecosystem was worse off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those places were going to link to the big guys and couldn't afford to link to them.  And that's that. And it's tragic stupidity. It's techno panic.  Sigh. Links to your site are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it's just they are not theft. They are a gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a gift from Google.  So we have that spreading. And then we have the other wonder out of Europe,  which is the right to be forgotten spreading.  The New York Times just wrote fears that's going to spread all around.  I'm, as you know, appalled by that.  There was an argument in one of the clips up there that that well,  so Google is refusing to do worldwide takedowns on right to be forgotten.  And France and other European countries going after them.  And somebody said in a piece today, well, they take down copyright the world around.  But as Jonathan Zittrain from Harvard Law School,  so I'm trust and good old Jonathan said in the New York Times today,  that's because copyright generally has an agreed upon set of laws around the world.  It has a regime that works.  There's entire bodies that manage copyright around the world.  This notion of right to be forgotten is this freakoid idea that just came out  of a few politicians in Europe and is taking off there.  That doesn't mean they should run the Internet, run the world and determine what I can and cannot see.  But there's a danger that's going to keep spreading.  And it's as Zittrain said, we're going to end up with a Swiss cheese Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So are you you're featured in this documentary, this German documentary about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the only reason I put up there is I wouldn't bother because it goes on forever.  I can't find myself here, but you are too.  You're there. There's a picture of somebody found a screenshot.  Yeah, you know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I think that it looks like the clip they're using is from the old call for help we did in Canada  where Amber MacArthur discovered YouTube.  Leo and by the way, it's still airing in Canada, which makes us look like nitwits.  Leo, there's a new site around that lets you upload your own videos.  It's called YouTube.  And she does a whole demo, which you can see on YouTube.  But that won't ever work.  That'll never work. I think I did bring up copyright issues.  I think I said, you know, they're going to have trouble with copyright issues.  But at the time we were talking to Hurley and Chen and I mean, we were early advocates.  Amber was I should give Amber credit.  Amber was an early advocate of YouTube and really knew that this was going to be something big.  This is before Google bottom.  So, yeah, that's nice.  So it's a German YouTube documentary at ZDF dot D E, which is a big public broadcaster.  Yeah. Oh, it's so it's a public broadcaster.  We're on real TV there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Real TV. Wow. It's my dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love to watch. Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a new YouTube HTML5 player.  If you go to YouTube dot com slash test tube, you can experience ultra high definition 4K videos.  It's a little prettier.  Try out the redesigned. Is it?  Yeah.  So I'm already using it. I don't even know.  I'm going to sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't want me. I can tell you because I'm a leak it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell the world YouTube's trying a new electrification project or something.  And that we remember when you get if when you first upload a YouTube video and you start getting a lot of hits, it stops at three hundred and one.  That's going away.  They're going to do it.  Do something different.  They're ditching the three oh one plus video view counter.  And three one plus.  Oh, this is was this a bug?  No, no, it was on purpose.  At first, people thought it was.  So they'd see three hundred one plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then after a few hours, it would be updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now what they're going to do is they're going to do a three hundred one plus video.  Plus, and then after a few hours, it would be updated.  Now what they're going to do is just do it.  What was the rationale, though?  They couldn't keep up.  Was that all?  Oh, OK.  When a video. Well, actually, no spam.  When a video passed three hundred views, we'd freeze the video view count while we checked for spam.  They felt like people they wanted to verify they were real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was a bug.  This was not a feature for users.  This was a bug. Yeah, yeah, there's no.  OK, gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not exactly a bug.  Well, by the way, they announced this on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like is it twenty fifteen?  That sounds like it sounds crazy to me that YouTube, particularly like three oh one.  I'm not obviously don't use YouTube a whole lot, so I wasn't even aware of this.  It's just that's just interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says people and a few sneaky robots bad guys watch a video stored on many servers around the world.  Now we count views.  We're confident.  Come from real people as they're recorded.  And then we review the others.  So they have some sort of process that filters out the fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Turn the camera on on your machine and we look at you and make sure you're human and watch it.  We know who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google doesn't know I'm human.  Then they're not paying attention, right?  There's got to be plenty of signals that let you know whether it's real or a robot.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they freeze the counter at three one in order to run some sort of batch process.  They used to.  The views.  Yes.  And they used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now this is fixed.  Now they can do it in real time because they have many programmers working there.  But a lot of computers.  Do you think it's interesting they did not announce this on Google Plus, but used it YouTube instead?  I mean Twitter instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not even on their own blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say what about their blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a tweet.  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's buying Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon has created an API for Alexa.  If you want to put I'm sorry the lady who lives inside your Echo, you could put that inside your own device.  The matchstick is dead.  Remember this?  It was a Kickstarter campaign to create basically a competitor to the Chromecast.  And a lot of people put money into it.  Four hundred seventy thousand dollars.  Email went out to backers on Monday that you're going to get your money back because it's too hard to make this work with all the copy protection schemes required by content creators.  Google obviously could figure that out, but kind of hard to do this.  It was going to be based on Firefox OS and they were selling it for sixteen bucks.  They had partners like Phillips and the TV manufacturer TCL.  But the DRM defeated them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems like they would have figured that out before they even started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They might have underestimated the challenge of getting these content companies to go along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can go to Kickstarter with just an idea.  And you don't have that kind of due diligence built in until too late.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does Kickstarter support reimbursements?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think they'll have to send an email out saying, hey, can we give you your money back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's going to be something.  I don't think the Kickstarter supports reimbursements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's we're going to get we're going to wrap this thing up with your picks and your numbers and your stuff.  And Lynn, I don't know if you remember from last time, but oh, I see you do have a pick.  Never mind.  You're way ahead of me.  I showed it brought to you by FreshBooks.  Now that you're an entrepreneur, Lynn, you don't have some boss paying you.  You got an invoice, right?  That's the worst, the worst part of my month every month.  The last day when I said, oh, no, I got to get my invoices out.  But problem is, if you don't set up the invoices, you don't get the checks and you don't get the checks.  You don't really have much of a business.  FreshBooks changed my life.  Been 10 years now since I discovered FreshBooks.

We didn't ask you, Gina.  So MakerBase, which we have talked about before, MakerBA.se.  Yeah, it's a .se.  Thanks to the country of Sweden for that.  Yeah, yeah, thanks to Sweden.  It's a great site that lets makers, it's a database of people who create stuff, podcasts, books, art, whatever, music.  And it lets makers kind of create an entry.  It's kind of like a Wikipedia for makers.  Is that a good way to describe it?  What is the elevator pitch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's IMDB for apps and digital culture.  So it's the liner notes, it's the credits, it's the credits roll for apps.  And like you said, podcasts, web series, software services, websites, and it's live now and it's completely editable by everyone.  So it's just like Wikipedia in that I can add you and I can add you as and I have added you.  Thank you.  As the host of all the various shows at Twit.  So it's makers and projects.  And we really don't have a whole lot of guidelines about what makes a maker or project.  It's the most liberal use of the word maker you can imagine.  But only that a project is not a company.  So it's a thing.  So that's why on your page, Leo, we listed all your shows, for example, but not Twit the company.  OK, that makes sense.  Our only guideline is that it's a thing.  It's some sort of digital project.  So yeah, it's really a lot of fun.  It just opened up to the to the public yesterday and we've gotten really great response.  It's very simple.  This is an MVP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sits in the big chair.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You sit in the big chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was trying to figure out how to describe your role.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I sit in the big chair.  That's pretty much what I do.  Or the big ball.  One of the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This week in Google.  I want you to see what I put what I put down for Jeff on this week in Google page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rants about Germany and how hard it is to live with multiple Google accounts.  Pretty accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Slowly I turn.  Pretty accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Smiles a lot.  That's nice.  Jason runs the board.  This is good.  And we should manage it, too.  I mean, we can.  Unlike Wikipedia, we're allowed to enter our own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to be Wikipedia worthy.  Everybody.  We encourage everyone to add to their own page and to add their own roles and to change things and to clarify things.  Absolutely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I can easily change all this.  That's nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or you can archive things.  So yeah, it's been really fun.  You know, I just we wanted a way and Neil Dash and my co-founder and I and this is a think up product.  This is a product from Think Up.  So it's sort of Think Up sibling.  We wanted a way for people to give credit to the folks who who make the things that we love.  And, you know, you can go to any company page and see the founders and the and the C the C suite folks.  Right. But you don't get to see the designers and the copywriters and the particularly like community managers and, you know, the customer support folks.  We want everyone to kind of to be listed on all these pages.  So that's that's that's that's our goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, tell us you launched yesterday.  Yeah, we've seen it before in beta, but it's now out and anybody can use it.  Right.  Tell us where you launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had a really exciting day yesterday.  We were invited to the White House's first ever demo day, which was an event that was focused on diverse engineers or entrepreneurs.  Excuse me, diverse entrepreneurs.  So this was so cool.  Neil, my co-founder and I got to go to the White House and visit the East Wing where it happened to be the president's birthday yesterday also.  But there were several different companies that had their their products laid out, demo to the president in person.  He got up and made some amazing remarks about kind of the state of our industry, how abysmal the numbers are, how less than three percent of venture capital goes to  founding teams that are that are that are African-American people, underrepresented minorities or female founded.  And and how, you know, his message was like, you know, if we're going to win the game, we got to have everybody on the field that we have to create access and opportunities for everyone.  And that's one of our big goals with MakerBase is that people who who want to aspire to be a digital entrepreneur make apps can go to these pages and look up who made this app that I love.  How can I get in touch with this person?  How can I help?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you featured anywhere in this video?  I'd sure like to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neil and I didn't demo in front of the president.  There were lots of companies and very little time as you would as you would expect.  But yeah, this is this is amazing.  We were literally in the room, kind of right next to them and then after the demo and did some and made some remarks.  Yeah, here we go.  And then he spoke here and then we and then the whole room sang him happy birthday.  My favorite part of this, though, at the end of his remarks, he said, you know, it's so amazing to have all these smart people who are building businesses in this room.  I want you all to keep in mind that I'm going to be out of a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep in mind, just keep me in mind.  I wouldn't mind working for a startup.  You guys are pretty cool.  This is really neat.  This is really neat.  Congratulations for being invited.  Thank you.  What an honor that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a huge honor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a great event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And did Neil wear a tie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or a suit?  Neil wore a tie.  And Neil was OK to get in a tie.  I was in a business suit, which was very rarely happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you go buy a business suit just for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have my one suit for such occasions.  Yes, so do I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One suit.  That should be enough for any human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guy in the background didn't.  He's got the t-shirt on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's all right.  He's got the company t-shirt.  Yeah, that wasn't usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most people were very...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would dress up to meet the president, I think.  Yeah.  But he is, you know, I mean, it looks like...  Did he feel like he really got what was going on or was it a press opportunity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was really interesting to listen to the president take pitches because he doesn't  work in tech.  He's not a VC.  So, you know, really, I mean, I have to say he did such a good job of listening to the  pitch and then saying, OK, so if I'm this person and I have this problem, your product  helps me this way.  But, you know, you don't often hear the president speak kind of haltingly or ask questions.  You know, like you can tell that he was...  He was thinking.  He was thinking and it's not what he does.  He doesn't speak in tech terms.  It wasn't prepped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something very endearing about that, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a couple of years, Donald Trump will do this.  He'll just say, you're fired to everybody he meets.  It'll be very, very exciting.  I can't wait.  He told every entrepreneur...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you Mexican?  He said the opposite.  The president said to every entrepreneur, I'm proud of you.  Let's take a picture after every demo.  It was incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, neat.  Well, congratulations and everybody should go to MakerBay.se.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MakerBay is our users.  MakerBay.se.  Go there right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll love that.  And Gina, did you have a tip for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, kind of along these lines, I wanted to point out and Lyn was in on this as well.  This hashtag, I don't know if you guys have seen this, I look like engineer.  Yes.  What a great...  So it started with a medium post by an engineer at...  I think I log in.  I think his company called something like that.  And she was on a billboard that in an interview with the president,  she was on a billboard that in an ad campaign that ran on BART.  And she got all this.  There was all this feedback about this, this ad campaign, particularly about her photo where people were saying,  engineers don't look like this.  How insulting is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's too cute.  You know, it's too sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should have really found somebody who actually was an engineer.  She is actually an engineer.  So she wrote this medium piece and then kind of started this hashtag.  I look like an engineer.  Let me tell you, if you search for I look like an engineer on Twitter, it is really it's an amazing, amazing call.  It's an amazing, amazing collection of pictures of gorgeous humans.  I mean, just of all shapes and sizes and colors and genders and identities.  And it's really incredible.  So that's my tip for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It made me wish I were an engineer so I could...  Yeah, I'm afraid mine is I look like a doofus.  I look like a journalism professor.  I look like a...  As boring as I look.  A podcaster.  I should do a hashtag.  I look like a podcaster.  A podcaster.  I wonder what that would look like.  Here it is.  The first thing that comes up when you type I look like...  This is really, really neat.  The WordPress engine.  There she is again.  A lot of pictures of her and then a lot of other engineers.  See that one line.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think those are the top tweets.  So the top tweets are really focused on her.  Yeah, a lot of her.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But then, yeah, it gets as you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is...  And this is inspiring for any young women who are watching and saying,  gee, engineers don't look like me.  There's Lady Ada.  That's an engineer, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Yep, yep.  That's nice.  This is great.  Grace Hopper.  Yeah, she looks like an engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the name of the wonderful...  The picture that everybody's been loving,  the meme that keeps going around every two months.  The NASA engineer.  Oh, the young woman with the huge pile of code.  Oh yeah, Margaret Hamilton.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, Hamilton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my favorite.  This is so cool.  If you look like an engineer,  you should post a picture of yourself in that hashtag.  I mean, if you are an engineer.  If you look like...  Look at that.  My mom, Pearl Hacker and 20 years plus CISA analyst,  nuclear physicist, started coding on punch cards.  That's awesome.  Really, this is just...  I love this hashtag.  Love it.  It's so great.  Yeah, I can't stop.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's like Celebrity Kitchens.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  It's better than Celebrity Kitchens.  And Gina, you can go try to hire them all, which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Now I can know how to find an engineer.  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's working on Watson.  Love it.  Love it.  There you go.  So now any tech company that says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know where to find women...  Isn't paying attention.  Yes, that's a very good point.  Proof you're not paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a few here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got a file folder full of them, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've done Lisp, Erlang, Python and JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I make the NPM CLI work.  Never wear jeans and a T-shirt.  Love it.  Getting some NPM folks in here,  the node package manager.  That's awesome.  Nice.  Love this.  Augmented reality biometrics piloted drone.  All right.  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what we might as well do, given the week,  a bunch of Trump numbers.  We can bear it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where to go?  We're very excited about tomorrow's...  I'm excited and trepidatious.  Locked off time for the big GOP debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on.  I got the ad.  Come on.  Yes, all right.  No one wants to know.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I got the ad.  Well, come on.  I'm sorry.  No one wants the wrong link.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on.  Where is it?  How tall is Hillary Clinton?  Are these Google queries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  So only in New Hampshire, people asked about Donald Trump.  Donald Trump is the most asked about candidate in Google in 49 states.  Except in Vermont.  Bernie Sanders.  That's it.  Among the questions about his age, how much he's worth?  10 million.  Yeah.  Will Donald Trump be president?  Google's going to know.  You know, doesn't Google know these things?  If you type in, will Donald Trump, you'll see that I think the number one question, will  he be a good president?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how Google would know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think, folks, we need to Google bomb that, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will Donald Trump be president?  Will Donald Trump make a good president?  Will he win the presidency?  Will he run?  Will he run for president?  Those are old, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  3.3 million tweets in the past month.  100,000 tweets in the 24 hours ending Tuesday.  Meanwhile, Jeb Bush had only 27,000 during the same period and 727,000 in the past month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However, I should point out the number one trending story on Google last night was the  reported breakup of Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a PR bunch of hooey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I missed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're obviously not paying much attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I got a head start here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I presume this is to promote the new Muppet show, which will be launching any moment now.  OK.  Well, we fell for it.  Lynn, what's your pick of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's neither an app or a tip.  It's just basically, you know, kind of dovetails what Gina was talking about with I Look Like  an Engineer and also being at Demo Day where there's all this talk about increasing diversity  in tech.  Today, I noticed on Motherboard, which is one of VICE's sites, that the Congressional  Black Caucus went to Silicon Valley to talk to a bunch of tech companies like Apple and  Google and try to get some really concrete plans around kind of like the way Pinterest  has laid out numbers and goals for that diversity, for their inclusion plans.  I think, you know, and this to me is very laudable because now we can really start seeing  real plans around diversity, it's not just talk.  Or money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, a lot of people are putting money behind it.  Intel is, Google is.  But what does that mean?  What is that going to do?  It's not going to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just putting money at a school, you know, giving a school some money and saying, here,  train some students, right?  But what the Congressional Black Caucus is doing is they want to see long-term goals  as well as short-term goals so that there are really plans that create a pipeline for  folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, at our journalism school, we had a great program this summer.  We went to a bunch of colleges and areas where historically black colleges and universities  and others and said, give us your best students.  They came to New York, got an internship, got training, got paid, got here free.  Every company just went gaga.  And that's what you have to do.  You have to exactly what you just said, Lynn.  You have to feed the pipeline.  I talked to a big magazine company today that was a school unnamed that's trying to, well,  how do we try to appeal to more people?  You've got to hire different people so you do the right things in the beginning.  There's no cheap or easy or fast way around that.  You've got to meet it.  Yep.  And it's in every industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the organizations that was at Demo Day yesterday is Black Girls Code, which is  a fantastic org that does hackathons for girls, focused particularly on girls of color.  And they had a hackathon here in Brooklyn two or three weekends ago.  And I volunteered.  I volunteered.  And it was an incredible, incredible event.  These girls were so smart and so insightful.  And let me tell you, it is fascinating to watch 11 to 17 year olds design apps.  You know, being digital natives and growing up with phones in their pockets, so smart  and so interesting.  But Leo, I was going to say to you, if you're ever looking for someone for triangulation,  you should definitely invite Kimberly Bryant, who's the founder of Black Girls Code.  I will.  She's doing a lot to fix the pipeline problem.  And really, I saw firsthand that the events they're doing are amazing.  And I think I'm going to start mentoring a little bit more as well.  Really, really great stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell me if I'm wrong.  I don't want to insult you, Gina.  You're an engineer.  But coding is not like rocket science.  It's not that hard.  Nope.  And so really, it's a question of just choosing to do it.  It's not like, oh, I'm not good at something.  I couldn't, you know, I'm not brilliant.  I couldn't do it.  No, it's actually anybody can code.  Anybody can code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  But here's the thing, Leo.  It's knowing that it's something you can do.  Precisely.  I mean, you know, I was fortunate enough in high school, you know, to learn basic on Commodore 64, right?  Which led me to have an interest in coding, which I didn't continue to do.  But, you know, I did it for a while, Fortran, Pascal, Cobol, a bunch of old school languages.  But, you know, it's because it was in my high school.  Had it not been in my high school?  Yeah.  You know, I didn't know anyone else who coded.  Right.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the key.  Right.  People can do it.  They just have to know they can do it and be given the opportunity to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's access to the tools.  It's role models.  I mean, it's so many things.  I spoke to a woman at this event who said who, you know, has been coding for 30 years and said, you know, she started coding on paper tape.  And she said, I have been the only one in the room for years.  Right.  So it's, you know, it's this it's having role models, it's having mentors, it's having access.  It's having, you know, I have my own computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What it's not having is it's not not having ability because it has nothing to do with ability.  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's absolutely true.  It's access.  Right.  It's knowing you can do it and it's access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And here's why you want to do it.  People who can code are the powerful people going forward in this world.  They're the ones who will have an opportunity.  They'll have a lever that can make a massive difference.  Plus, it's fun.  It's a hell of a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing that's interesting, you know, and I don't know that this happens at every school, but I've had parents tell me that their daughters have been kind of persuaded not to follow math or not to follow science.  Right.  Have parents tell me that.  That's so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even by other women, which really makes me sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's this like specter of hard math.  I mean, you know, I'm not, I'm not, you know.  I'm not a huge mathematician.  Right.  Like it's not like there's not.  Are you using a lot of calculus on MakerBase?  No, I mean, it's logic and it's logic flows.  Right.  And I mean, it's really not.  It's not that.  So I think, I think a lot of it is just sort of busting those myths and access and showing girls in particular, like, hey, you want to be, you don't even want to, you don't want to be just the person using this stuff.  You want to be the person creating this stuff.  And also be in an atmosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of our, one of my, I'm very proud to have a woman named Ada Bernier as one of our graduates who started a company called Skill Crush.  And she's, she goes back and forth on this.  But the reason she started it really was she taught herself to code.  But the bro culture around it.  Yeah, that's sad.  Just was an issue.  And so she says it sometimes doesn't say it does, but it's basically a company aimed to teach women to code.  And that's not to say that the risk here is, well, no women aren't different in that sense.  And you're not trying to ghettoize their learning, which you are trying to say that maybe the way a guy's teaching guys and coming in, maybe it's not the natural and best way to teach.  And so we need other methods in other ways.  I also, I've been going through a little learning jig myself and I, you'll be amused at this.  So I signed up for the basic coding course, the Udacity Nanodegree.  Oh, good for you.  Oh, good for you.  That's great.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, you're gonna laugh because of course I wanted to be able to even even got even old journalist professors can learn to code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm also I'm also taking Spanish right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about that.  That's gonna be hard.  That's hard.  You're a German speaker.  It's gonna be tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Espanol.  Not working out.  Oh, this is good.  This is good.  You got to keep going.  And I said, I don't want to do it.  Oh, you can't do Udacity on a Chromebook.  No, because you need to download the stuff to do this off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's a bad language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What language what language are you learning?  Oh, I forget what they're going to do it in.  It was just starting.  You can do I can help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You so the nice thing about the Chromebook and I because I wanted to solve this too because I wanted to code on a Chromebook.  Yeah, K.O.D.I.N.G.  Oh, okay.  That's easy to remember.  Dot com.  Because you can't put Python on Chromebook, but you can log into a computer running go Python Ruby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem with Udacity is obviously to be able to teach everybody the same.  They're using some of the same tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will be shocked if you couldn't do unless it's Windows based or Mac based.  If you couldn't do this is you'll get a Unix instance.  It's very it's free for what you want to do.  You'll get a Unix instance with all the languages.  You'll get a very nice editor with syntax checking and coloring and all of that stuff.  You can it gives you a chance to play with all this kind of stuff.  This is pretty basic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the beginning of this is, you know, HTML, which even I can get you with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least to see if coding will do the things you need to do in order to take just to be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, because here I am when I scream about it.  And yeah, I've got some familiar with it.  I've been doing HTML for years.  That's not coding.  That's that's that's markup.  Markup. Yeah.  And yeah, I learned a bit of basic way back many years ago.  But that's if you don't learn, use that as the as the jumping off point for a life that I dropped.  So, yeah, I should I should try to do it.  And I want to be able to do it easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alan Kay says the first language you learn will imprint you for the rest of your life.  So it's really important that you don't learn basic whatever you do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I've got good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. Let's hope that those pathways never really took.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why don't you just put Linux on your Chromebook?  He did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The developer channel and it gets buggy.  Do this. I mean, serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's free. There is a paid version.  I use the paid version, but it's free.  And it's basically gives you a development environment that you log into on your Chromebook.  And so you I mean, I've been able to use this to write code.  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you know, you'd ask if he has these nanodegrees now in full stack development, IOS, Android, basic programming, data analysis.  And I think is one more.  But the Android one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to be with all these nano doctors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the intro to Android.  It's like it's intermediate Android or, you know, it's for it's for Java programmers, you know, people programmed in Java.  And it's great.  I've been really enjoying it.  You know, everything I make an Android app, everything I learned, I sort of taught myself piecemeal.  You know, I'd have contributors say, hey, this is a better way to do this.  Doing this course, I'm really learning.  I'm getting kind of the context and the and the and the back story.  So it's been really I've actually really learned a lot.  It's been great.  I think it's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Jake, son, Jake signed it up for the full stack development.  And so you're doing the you were doing the introduction to program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was really interested.  Yeah, that's fine.  It's Python and CSS, both of which you can do on coding unless they want you to have a Windows Python ID or something like that.  But I bet you they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They wanted they wanted to download certain programs to use and share stuff.  I might try it again and see if I can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to look at them looking.  I just don't want to have to carry it.  I want to be able to do it.  These are not free.  This is two hundred dollars a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to run some of those notes.  But but but as they say, it's a nanodegree.  The idea here is I'm doing something similar.  We're doing something similar at CUNY.  If you go to General Assembly, you know nothing and you go in and say, teach me Ruby.  I don't know how long it takes.  Six weeks, whatever you leave, you can get a job.  You are certified as saying, are you looking to get a job?  And I think I might need it.  Pythonista.  I thought I think I think I get Gina to hire me.  Yeah.  So but I think that's that's really important is training people for entirely new jobs that exist and be able to go in and come out with a job.  And you know what's happening in General Assembly is a lot of your art history majors are going in there saying, OK, now what do I do?  And they can create something.  So when journalism, we're going to do the same thing with product development, project management, data analysis, those kinds of things.  Udacity lets you go in and become an iOS developer or or an Android developer.  And I think that's that's it's it's competency based outcomes based education.  I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not bad. One of your instructors is Steve Hoffman, the guy who wrote Reddit and is actually now CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of my instructors is a Reno Myers doing a bunch of the videos for the Android thing.  And it's been interesting.  You know, I'm not I'm not putting myself on the market for a job as an Android developer, but that's this this course is very much focused that way.  So they're they're focusing on building up your LinkedIn and your GitHub and filling out your projects.  And what's your education and how do we connect to you?  Because I think I think Udacity does some of this like has some ties to recruitment sources.  So I've been really impressed with that.  And their and their idea is, hey, you come out of this, you finish this nanodegree and you are qualified to be hired as an Android developer.  Which is back to Lynn's point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The opportunity here is to take entirely new populations.  Yes.  We're told I can't do this or I can't do that to say not only can you do it, you know, give yourself a few months and you're going to get a job in it.  And what we need is is also for people who have lesser economic ability.  We need we need scholarships for these kinds of programs.  So the two hundred dollars a month is not much to me.  But some people would be a hell of a lot of money.  And, you know, you want to back something on Kickstarter is back sending a hundred kids from a poor school to a Udacity degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but there are free there's lots of free ways to learn to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's three ways to.  But I'm just saying in general, I think that I think that should be part of the industry's effort to say that no matter what the program, we should be trying to create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think one thing I will say to make it very clear, you do not have to pay a penny to learn how to program brilliantly, but you do need a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need a computer. You need a quiet room and maybe Internet connections for Internet connection.  But other than that, I think you don't have to pay money to a degree program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's plenty of ways to learn for free.  Lots of great languages.  And and Jeff, you should learn Lisp.  Stop learning Python.  All right.  I'm just because that'll get you a job.  All right.  Actually, Hoffman could teach you Lisp.  He wrote Reddit and Lisp at first.  Really? Yeah.  The first version of Reddit was written Lisp.  Not that that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't surprise me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't surprise me either.  Hey, this is a lot of fun.  I want to thank you, Lindy Johnson, for being here.  You're great.  Great to see you, Lynn.  Go to her website, Lynn, L-Y-N-N-E D Johnson dot com or follow her on the Twitter L-Y-N-N-E L-U-V-A-H because she's a Lynn lover.  Thank you so much for being here.  Thanks, Gina.  It's so great to see you.  Congratulations on the launch.  Gina.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Maker-Base.  Maker-Base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, go sign up.  Add all your projects.  Add all the people who you worked with.  Especially give credit to the folks who didn't get the credit they deserved.  I want to see more.  We want more than coders and founders.  We want designers and copywriters and user support folks.  All your great co-workers, I want to see them in MakerBase.  It's completely free.  Sign up with Twitter.  And yeah, hope to see you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, let's do this again next week.  What do you say?  We'll see you then.  Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at CUNY.  He's a blogger at BuzzMachine.com.  His latest book.  Well, he's got many.  I guess the latest is Geeks Bearing Gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going on Thursday to record the corrections in my audio read.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will that be on Audible or what?  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to Audible HQ.  Yeah, that's where it is.
