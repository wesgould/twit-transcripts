Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got the whiff of poofs in just for that graduate school of journalism at the  City University of New York. Hello, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Sam, that's a longstanding joke. We won't bother as

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poor Sam Lesson, I tell you.  Hey, so guess who's here? This is a thrill. I'm very excited. I've been a  fan of Sam's since he came up with drop.io, which was the greatest little  way to share files.  Facebook bought it. And then you worked at Facebook for how long were you at  Facebook, Sam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was there about almost exactly four years for the IPO and a lot of the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome. And now he general partner at his VC firm, slow.co SLOW.  Slow Ventures.  Slow Ventures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We couldn't get the dot com. I don't know what we're too cheap to buy the  dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like slow.co. I think that's very memorable. I love it slower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Sam, I'd love to know who whoever is Sam at slow.com gets a lot of  deal flow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty funny. Sam, your ears were burning last week, I'm sure,  because you were all the news all over town because of your investment in  creators. And we thought, well, we better get Sam on if we can to  explain this because, you know, traditionally venture capitalists  invest in companies. Although, as you pointed out, you know, you're always  investing in the team, you're always investing in the people as much as  the idea.  Yeah.  What gave you the idea to invest in the people directly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's actually, you know, ironically, an old idea. So, you know, I  guess, you know, we've known each other for what, 10 plus years now.  You never invested in me.  I'm just going to point that out.  No one gave me the opportunity. But when I was literally in senior year of  high school, you know, I was watching, if you remember way back in the day,  Martha Stewart, home living, going public and all this stuff.  And I was like, you know, and I started a company, I still own the domain,  lifecapital.com to try to do this.  Right.  In high school?  You always say, look, in high school, well, this is part of how I got into  college, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were so impressed by lifecapital.com, they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, at the time it wasn't, you know, back in those years, the  kids starting companies wasn't quite as common as it is today.  So I think it was a reasonably original thing to be trying to do.  And, you know, back then, I had the narrative I had was, look, debt's  terrible, right?  Debt forces you to, you go to law school, you have to become a corporate  lawyer to pay off your blah, blah, blah.  You know, it's stuck, it sticks you in paths.  The world is getting crazy and you want people to have as much freedom as  possible. That's how you get the biggest outcomes and the most interesting  stuff. So wouldn't it be cool if instead of, instead of just having debt for  people, you had debt options and equity options, just like you do for companies.  Back then, everyone thought I was crazy.  So, you know, really, other than a bunch of working with some lawyers and kind of  some ideas and kind of shopping, it never really went anywhere.  But fast forward, and it's now been almost, you know, it's been more than 20  years, I guess. And, you know, a bunch of trends have played out that make this  make all the sense in the world.  Right. One is everyone now understands how the Internet makes outcomes way more  discontinuous than they ever were before.  So gone are the days of, you know, you get a career, you have certain pay raises  every year, you know, your trajectory.  That's really easy to finance with debt.  But modern careers, you can have a great year, you have a terrible year.  You know, some people do amazingly well.  You have the, you know, Jeff Bezos of the world, a lot of people don't, there's a  lot of discontinuity.  It's super hard to finance well with debt.  But people all of a sudden say, oh, my God, you know, if I had equity, right, an  equity-based approach is way better suited to finance that.  That's the big picture.  Everyone's woken up to the fact that people piling on debt young in their lives is  really is really quite stifling in a lot of ways.  So there's got to be a better way to do this.  Right. And so there's a bunch of big picture things.  And then the specific thing we're starting with that makes it such an opportunity now  is the creator economy.  Right. Where you're seeing these people start effectively micro businesses, just  them. In a lot of cases, they're building a brand and a community long before  they're building a product.  But there's a lot of value being built.  And these people don't have access in general to true equity financing.  Right. They operate off of cash flow.  So what we've started to say is it's finally time to do this for real.  Let's finance creators as individuals, just like we would any other business.  But the really big thing, which I think causes maybe the controversy around us is  the way we look at this is if we're going to put five hundred thousand dollars, a  million, whatever dollars into a person versus a company, what we say is we're kind  of investing in the basket of what you do with that capital over time.  We say there are no restrictions on how you deploy it.  It's here to support you if you want to put it into audience building, great or  product development, whatever you want.  But all that money and capital we're putting in is building your brand and your  identity. Right.  And like the kind of the value of your community.  And so we want to be dealt in over the long term.  We say we take a very low percentage over a long period of time.  So 30 years. So basically your whole career.  And we say, look, you know, we'll give you the capital up front.  If you do great, if you're the next Jeff Bezos, you know, we get venture like  returns. Right.  But if you don't do well, it's fine.  I mean, you know, again, our firm is fundamentally a seed firm.  We're used to losing money.  We're losing things not working out.  We're not trying to monetize people that don't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it hard to convince the partners that that this made sense?  I mean, I don't think there's much of a precedent for it.  I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense.  But, you know, I mean, I think I have questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of people have talked about this.  So why?  Anyway, you want I mean, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, one thing people brought up is indentured servitude.  And you pretty. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who brought that up? Can I can I call out names?  I have to admit, I haven't I haven't seen it yet.  So nobody here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody here. But I think that the mother in the motherboard interview you did, I  think they that's true. They did invoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look, I'll be honest. I I think that that is I think that's lazy, honestly, to call  it indentured servitude. You know, there's no question that culturally, for good  reasons, especially in the United States, there's a lot of sensitivity around any of  these like long term capital oriented relationships.  Right. We know why we get the context.  But it's actually the opposite of indentured servitude.  Right. Because you're saying to people, you don't owe me anything.  This isn't a record label deal.  You know, if I invest in you and you decide to go sit on a beach for the next 30 years,  there's nothing I can do about it. That's one of my risks.  Right. I have no control over what you do at all.  So there's no contractual. I would actually argue debt.  I'd actually argue debt is a lot closer to indentured servitude than the model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. So you don't have a contractual agreement that they will continue to pursue  their creator path or, you know, that they'll keep making YouTube videos.  Nothing like that. Nothing to protect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. In fact, it's actually the opposite.  We say if you don't, let's pretend you go and flip burgers or a corporate lawyer.  We have a structure. We kind of come up with an idea of saying, like, that's not even  part of the deal. Like, if you just decide we take that risk, you know,  so you put a fence around the activities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You put a fence around the definition of the activities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We do. But the fence is basically defined like this, which says, if you go take a job  where there is a market price for the job, right, meaning other people that aren't  you make the same doing exactly the same thing that's out of the deal.  If you go and use your expertise, you've developed as, I don't know, a food celebrity  to work on a food channel show where they're paying you because it's you.  Right. Then we are obviously we were all dealt out in that part.  But we basically are saying, like, we'll invest in you in your in the equity of your  creator brand. In this case, we've also done entrepreneurs, by the way, separate,  separate structure, which I don't think was talked about in the motherboard article,  but it's also really cool. But for creators, we say, look, we'll we'll do it that way.  We ring fence things that are related to the brand you're building in a community  you're building and also the knowledge and IP you build right as a part of being  creator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, go ahead.  You first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you looking for venture style returns on this and like in terms of like, oh,  hey, I'm going to have five to six flame outs, a couple decent ones and then two or  one like 10 X returns?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think the long answer, the short answer is yes.  Right. And we actually even ring fences, not even ring fenced around.  We only monitor. We only we're looking for failures.  But actually, the way we structure these deals, we say if you make less than  actually in some cases, quite a bit of money, like a few hundred thousand dollars  a year, we don't even want a percentage of that.  Like, we're not even trying to monetize the OK cases.  But our view is that these are hits driven businesses like anything else.  And if you do super well because of the capital we put in or helped by the cap we  put in, we want to see a big return on it.  And the thing people I think need to recognize, which I think if you're an investor  around the VC because then you get but it's hard to understand, is that it's very  important that we are able to monetize fully the winners, right?  That we get our five percent of Jeff Bezos, our 10 billion dollars there, because  that makes the cost of capital cheaper for everyone else.  Right. And that's, I think, the really important thing and a lot of how the  structure is set up and why we care about it to be 30 years and why it has to be  kind of broad based, because what you really don't want, the only way the  structure fails is not if you have a bunch of losers because you will.  Right. And that's fine.  Like, that's part of the model.  That's actually part of the technology future we exist in today is that it's very  discontinuous in terms of who wins and who loses.  But you have to make sure you get paid on the winning cases so you can afford all  the losses and all the other cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I would think it be that's an issue just because the more successful you are,  the more money you can throw at lawyers to get you out of weird contracts that  require you to pay five percent of your earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think the question is, I don't think it's that weird for what it's worth,  but that point is it's certainly new.  But I wouldn't say it's weird.  What I would say is this. The thing you have to really protect against is the  Larry Ellison case, which is a lot of people say, look, we love the deal.  Can it be a 10 year deal?  Right. Can it be a five year deal?  We may get shorter because 30 is a big number.  We say, look, honestly, no, because the problem is it's super easy to borrow.  Right. Until you kind of get past the old terms and then you're big.  Yeah. It's very easy to do.  Whereas what we say is we don't ever want to make the people we invest in make  unnatural decisions because of the structure.  So take again, like we'll be silly and use, you know, let's pretend we didn't  bought five percent of Jeff Bezos at the before he was Jeff Bezos.  To this date, we only monetize when he sells.  Right. No profits for him, no profits for us.  So in his case, we'd still be waiting.  Right. Because he hasn't sold very much.  You know, he's just borrowed. But but honestly, I'm fine with that.  Right. Because the reality is, is we would still have a very monetizable asset  in what we have. And someday, in some level, he will sell.  Right. In some form.  It takes a generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd like to make it until death do you part, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I'd like to do.  But that's, I think, the spirit of what we do.  But in practice, even I got convinced of lawyers at 30 years is a good bound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Infinite. It's not good.  So so far, the one we know about is your investment in a YouTuber, Marina  Mulgoldko, 31 years old.  She's a YouTube personality.  You gave her one point seven million.  Yep. And and what else?  You know, I'm thinking about the traditional way of doing this is is kind of more like  an agent where or a manager where somebody would say, hey, look, I like you, kid.  You're going places.  Give me 10 percent or more of the bookings.  I get you and we'll work together.  And then the agent goes out and promotes this person with no risk.  The agent has no red. The engine has no risk and only has to end that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the agent has no risk.  He also has bad incentives, right?  Which is the other problem.  Well, doesn't he have good incentives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because he's only going to make 10 percent of what of the jobs he gets you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But the thing is, the problem with the agent model, and this is with respect  for agents, we love to work with a lot of them.  But again, it is a sweat equity role where your job is to basically make the person  as much money as you possibly can until you get fired and they move on.  Right. And so because, you know, it incentivizes a lot of short term thinking, bookings.  There's also no dollar investment.  Which in the end of the day, you think about what really unlocks growth and potential.  It's capital is pretty useful.  Right. I'll take 10 percent of whatever I bring in.  Let me go be a salesman for you. Right.  Which is effectively what agents do.  Right. Is a very different model.  In fact, you know, one thing we have to work really hard to educate people on is that we're  capitalists. We're not service people.  So I talked to a lot of creators and they say, great, like, we love the capital.  Like, what services do you provide?  Yes. What do I get?  Because science is the money.  Yeah. Someone telling you, I say nothing, nothing.  I give you nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But not even the traditional advisory role of a venture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, of course. Of course we do that.  Of course we do that. And like, we have a lot of incentives to do that.  But I think I actually do this with with our traditional investments as well as I really  don't believe in this hybrid service slash capital world.  I just don't think it makes any sense.  I mean, I started my career at Bain & Company.  I can tell you service businesses are not good businesses and they get competed to zero  marginal value.  And capital, you know, the reason to do this type of deal with us is because you can use  the capital and you know what to do with it.  You know, I find entrepreneurs who are asking for all the support and services, among  other things, same thing with creators, it's actually kind of a pretty negative signal  about what they know what they're getting themselves into.  Right. You're going to make it easy for me.  So we try to be, we try to say, look, this way you get your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you get to deploy more capital because you don't have to spend the time on, you  know, you want like a traditional VC gets limited to a couple of companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and also, I mean, I would argue that a VC probably doesn't know one knows how  to make a creator successful at this point.  It's so new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm very negative in general.  I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, go ahead.  I mean, I said, look, in general, look, are even our traditional seed practice, which  is, you know, I'm proud to say has been extremely successful at Slow Ventures.  We don't do board seats.  Right. We are very good at text messaging.  I think we're very good advocates.  We have a very high net promoter score with the people that we do investment with.  But we try to be very anti-service, partially for scalability, but partially because,  again, I just I think, you know, if people knew how to cookie cutter, make start up  successful or cookie cutter, make creators successful.  We live in a very different world.  This is hard. And, you know, there are things that are valuable, but I think you got to  call a spade a spade and say, you're doing something super hard.  We respect the talent. We respect what you've accomplished so far and what you can  respect. If you one point five million, five million, whatever the number is,  demonstrably changes your trajectory, helps you do way better.  You know how to deploy the capital. We're all ears.  If you want someone to cry to and to be your partner and everything, I think that's  just a misread of what capital does for people.  Right. It's still lonely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So, Sam, I want to get my head around this better if I can.  So at our little journalism school, the Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig Newmark  graduate school journalism, I started a program in entrepreneurial journalism and it was  basically, hey, kids, let's start a company.  But that didn't work for a while.  But starting a company is difficult.  It's more than journalists do.  It's not investable.  So we changed it recently because there are so many new ways for creators to make money,  substack, Kickstarter, Patreon at all.  And so it's now aimed at the individual journalist, most cases trying to serve directly  a market or a community using all these tools as a creator.  So I've got two questions for you.  The first is whether we should be looking at that as a model to support this kind of  journalism going forward.  And then the second question.  Go with that first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think the answer is probably.  I think the the the journalism world, obviously, you have to look at the economics of it.  My wife obviously started a pretty successful publication as a journalist, building a  business that now has 50 full time employees and it's profitable in the whole nine yards.  Candidly, it's another topic for another day.  But I think the question of how big of a business can you build on substack is an interesting  one. I think it's very easy to get started, but it asymptotes very quickly as an individual  journalism creator.  But so I think it's very hard to build serious revenue doing that.  It's very easy to kind of support a lifestyle or even a very good individual salary doing  that. You know, I think the thing to come back to for our financing model is it works  really well when there is a low probability chance of the outcome being enormous.  Right. You know, for a given creator, it's hard when it's very, very bounded.  So, for instance, you know, this model does not work very well if you want to go to a  doctor. Right.  Because I know you're going to make you're not going to make infinity.  You know, it's kind of like there's actually debt is actually pretty good structure for  that. The question about whether this works for journalism, I think, is a longer  conversation. It could.  But I think you'd have to look kind of more broadly at that.  I think it's hard for print journalism alone to support those types of outcomes, if that  makes sense.  Though possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, the second question related real quickly, if I can, is we talked about this last  week. I think you probably just answered the question.  I still want to try to push this.  Is there a model in which you could envision not your exact model, but is there a world  in which you could envision the reversal you created becoming the new model for  scholarships? That is to say, people pay back based on their success in life.  And in the total pool, you end up supporting more education and more success with less  debt and more sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I just I'll stick this in Yale did this and I signed up for it.  It did. It was called the tuition postponement option and it ended up being kind of  horrific because you know, I'm paid.  Yeah. Well, you borrowed as a pool, right?  And so your entire class borrowed a certain amount of money and the entire class paid  it back as a percentage of income, not as a flat amount or with interest as a  percentage of income until the entire class pool had been paid off, which often meant  this went on for a long time.  I didn't borrow that much money, but I borrowed some and we did finally pay it off.  It took us about 20 years to do it.  But it was a very odd.  It was a clever, I think, idea.  You're obviously familiar with it, Sam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I am. There have been several experiments in education around this actually over the  years. There was I'm not sure if this is the same one, but Yale also did a program like  this in a long, long time in the law school that was another flavor of this.  So it's been tried. There have been issues with repayment.  They've stopped doing it.  A bunch of issues that have come.  Yeah, I'm sure they did.  I think it was a short lived experiment.  I mean, look, people have been sniffing around versions of this idea forever.  And just stepping all the way back, if we're going to have a society where a small  number of people do extremely well and the average doesn't and it's hard to model those  outcomes, that is just a very bad capital product for that future.  Right. So you say, where does this go in the future?  I think there's a whole version.  If you told me that actually the right model for society was, and I'm making this up  obviously, but a version of UBI, which is like, you know, when you're 21, the government  just gives you a million dollars, right?  Every single person.  Right. And then you're getting paid, you're paying it back in the form of taxes.  That's not insane.  Right. In terms of actually raising overall productivity, freedom and like creating more  financial upside for everyone like that model.  Some in some version of UBI makes a lot of sense to me.  You know, then I think backing off of it, I think you get to different click stops.  But, you know, the answer is, I think there's a lot of things you can finance with it,  but not everything.  And I do think keep in mind the fact that even you look at traditional companies on  a relative basis, risk adjusted basis, if you can get debt in a way that makes sense,  that's a great product.  Right. I don't want to be like, you know, debt does make sense.  Like if there's, you know, even as a company, it's really wonderful if you raise some  equity that you can then borrow money in certain cases.  And it's a very capital efficient thing to do.  I just think that the reality is for a lot of people, especially creators, especially  solo entrepreneurs, there is a hole where there is not a capital product being offered  to them. And like, we'd love to offer it.  You know, it's kind of that simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To you. So, you see, it's just basically a not a grant, but it's a you give them a  certain flat amount of money.  Do you find it difficult to convince these creators?  Part of my problem is in my world, a creator is not necessarily a good business person.  And this is part of the problem is that I'm one of them.  So I can create content, you know, like crazy, but I couldn't run a business to save my  life. In my case, I got my wife to run the business for me.  Mr. Beast has his mom running the business.  That's part of the problem.  Very few Jessica Lessons in the world who are both great journalists and know how to  start and run a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, look, I think that the future is more and more creators, though, that are  really entrepreneurs and business people as well.  And this is not a product that today works for everyone.  I mean, people frequently ask me, like, well, how do you convince people to take this?  I like I don't.  Right. Like, I think you put it out there and a small number of people say this is  perfect for me. I get it.  And you meet them and you understand how they think about business and what they're  trying to build and how they think about content.  Like, yep, this makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But aren't you worried that you're going to self select for people who are good  business people, but that's not necessarily great creators?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that we're learning how to do both.  But I think there is there is an intersection of those two.  Like Marina, I think is a great first example of someone who is both.  And like, that's kind of what you're looking for now.  Now, over time in history, in the coming years, my sense is, is that a lot of these  creators are getting more and more business savvy, right?  Because they have to.  They have to. It's also, you know, again, like you think about the whole system of  you're the talent, I'm the agent, you know, the Hollywood style system is breaking  down. And instead, it's going to be, look, you're a content creator.  You blew up on TikTok.  You know, you're building independent brands.  Good for you. It's a hybrid model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked about that because I come from old media.  That's the shift. In the old days, you're a creator.  You went to work for a company that would then support your, you know, your efforts  and let you do what you do.  But I think that that maybe is that over?  That's kind of what journalism is to Jeff, right?  Is if you're a journalist, you also start a business.  You expected to go to work for a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you also leave, you know, my days at Time Inc.  You leave the I think we're leaving the the not completely, but we're leaving the era  of the blockbuster economy.  And there's more 15 minute celebrities and there's  fewer huge hits. And look what's happening in music industry.  There's more good, sustainable creativity going on than there was supported in more ways.  And but is there, you know, is there a next do you have to have Adele to make it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Sam seems to be saying he's investing in Adele's and that makes his model work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Well, I think it's look, the answer is we're figuring it out.  But I look obviously in Adele is great as an outcome.  I think it's hard to pick Adele, right, especially, you know, from zero.  And there aren't enough of them.  I would note that, you know, it's interesting as we move towards what I see as kind of a  cult driven future where there's no single mass media.  We're not all watching Seinfeld, right.  But but, you know, curb your enthusiasm for a niche is just as powerful and it's a big  niche and it's global. You know, there's a lot of very, very, very, very big that are  developing. I think it's you know, I think that, you know, there are enormous businesses being  built in these weird Internet niches.  I think that's only going to continue.  You know, we talk about quote unquote metaverses and whatever.  I mean, there's no question there's a fracturing of what was once the global single dialogue  in two thousands of smaller dialogues.  But those thousands at set with seven billion people online, they're still very big.  And the reality is the engagement with them is higher than ever.  Right. So, you know, it's not on CNBC, but Mr.  B says a hell of a following and can monetize the crap out of it.  Right. And so you can you can.  I actually think that's kind of more the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry. I got delayed.  Yeah. You can really be built for a post blockbuster creator economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's post. I think it's post blockbuster creator economy with every once in a while.  There will be a blockbuster.  Yeah. OK. Just because it happens.  And if you're on them, great. Right.  But I don't mean you can manufacture those necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. So if you put in one point seven million dollars, it doesn't take much of a return to  get that money back over 30 years, even if five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But remember, we're venture capitalists, so we need to make a lot more than our money back  to justify to our LPs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So what do you what do you expect?  What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, here's my here's my honest answer.  You know, we're trying to make this a strong IRR deal that works for us on a long term  basis. We're actually not actually targeting what would be traditionally considered venture  capital returns. You know, the stuff we do in crypto, the stuff we do with SAS, you know,  has a very different return signature because in five years, you know, we're going to have  markups from series A firms and then we're going to have public public public there.  We don't expect the same curves here.  For now, we're financing this kind of out of our own vehicles.  We're learning a lot. We think they're very strong deals and we're able to kind of work in  the ecosystem in cool ways. My bet is, is that for this to get really big, though, you will  have separate funds that are not actually venture capital.  Maybe they're run by venture capitalists like me, but they're they have different return  profiles and different return targets, not to mention like more technicalities like, for  instance, venture capitalists generally hate getting money back.  Like we hate profits.  Turns out that like creators generally do generate those, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want an exit. Are you saying you want an exit?  Is that what you're saying?  No, they want to build out your companies.  There's no exit with a creator unless they...  Not not yet. I think that and that's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Again, you talk about what you know.  Well, look, I think I wrote an article, you know, over the summer that I was I was pretty  proud, got pretty widely distributed and read about how kind of the end of this era of  venture capital. And what basically the point was, if you look at SaaS investing, consumer  investing, this was a weird niche thing being done on the West Coast where no one understood  the financial models.  And so venture capitalists who had an opinion about it could make a lot of money.  But just like any good industry, now everyone understands the models.  Everyone understands how to think about a SaaS evaluation.  There are public comps. Like there's a whole market apparatus around it, which is why you  see the big East Coast firms, you know, the hedge funds coming in like crazy.  And I'd actually argue that a lot of traditional internet investing is really not venture  capital anymore. Right.  So our job as real venture capitalists, right, is to go out and find the new things where  there's a capital gap where people could use money to do amazing things but don't have  access to it. Put money in.  And then the reality is the models have to be built.  The capital pipelines have to be built.  You know, you're going to need some version of a quote unquote public market.  Probably won't be the New York Stock Exchange.  Might be in crypto. Right.  Where you can kind of think about how these things eventually trade, things like that.  So, you know, what we envision here is just very first principles.  Two things. There's no question that from a first principles perspective, a  equity oriented product for creators, true equity makes a lot of sense and that there's  real demand for it.  There are great creators out there that can use the capital.  And then there's a whole bunch of missing things from models to, you know, liquidity  options, whatever that don't exist yet that we think will come to exist.  But we think the way you do that is by starting to just go and like help build the  ecosystem around it over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, would you have done, would you have sought this at a point when you were  starting your venture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I think venture capital is the devil for building any sort of business  that you want to be sustainable.  Like journalism is just not a business that fits with something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a venture capitalist.  Yeah. And for what it's worth, Stacey, I actually, I mean, like Jeff, I mean, I think  you know this, like my wife, you know, despite the fact that I am a venture  capitalist, you know, the information has never taken a dime of venture capital.  Right. It's been self-financed from day one because I generally agree.  Right. Which is that especially journalism is generally a very poor fit historically  for venture capital. It doesn't grow fast enough.  It creates weird pressures.  It's way better, especially with a long term mission to not have it.  But again, that doesn't mean there aren't exceptions to that.  You know, actually, it's done really well with venture capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You seem to thrive, Sam, in unstable environments.  Your point in your piece in the information was that venture capital is basically just  turning into finance and clearly investing in a creator ecosystem is something that's  you're throwing your money into a turbulent pool because it's so fastly changing, so  fast and it's so unknown.  Do you think that's where the opportunity lies, though, is in these eras of great

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  change? I mean, look, absolutely.  That's what I think. I mean, I think, you know, again, you know, look at our venture  firms. We have made far and away more money in the crypto ecosystem than anything else.  And why? It's because in the 2017 era, when no other venture firms were doing it or  very few, we heavily invested in a bunch of the layer one protocols like Solana that  have become some of the most important protocols at the moment in crypto and pretty  foundational. I think that it's pretty simple.  You know, putting capital where capital isn't is the way you make all the returns.  And also, frankly, it's how you have an impact.  It's how you have an impact, too. I mean, I do believe in having an impact and I believe  capitalism is good. You know, simply bidding on, you know, bidding up the same things  everyone else is investing in is both very boring and it's also very I don't think it's  that profitable. And I think it's very low impact.  Whereas using capital and kind of the freedom that venture capital allows you to have to  go with a new thesis into new spaces and push the envelope, you're going to lose money all  the time. Right. Like I joked, I think one of my maybe advantages is I don't mind losing  money as long as I make a lot of money sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sam's article in the information investing directly in people is the future of VC.  Here's how to do it really is a roadmap for this and fascinating.  And he's an intern at the information, which I think is hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would love to hear, Sam, what types of creators you're like.  Usually when people talk about creators, they think, you know, oh, it's a tick tock person.  It's someone in YouTube or Instagram.  But there are other I mean, you mentioned an entrepreneur's fund, too.  So I'd be curious, like what specifically you're looking for the creator side.  And if you actually could talk about the entrepreneur thing, I'd like to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. Yeah. So I mean, look, on the crater, especially in the last year, has been so overused  as a term. It basically means anyone doing anything.  Right. So it's a very diffuse term.  In general, we are not looking for the 15 minutes of fame folks in party houses in Los Angeles,  who want to quickly get a bunch of followers and do some silly videos and go from there.  I think we're much more interested in people that are developing potentially niche, but like deep  communities of like that are engaged with them and with the kind of products they're interested in  in potentially small verticals. So I'll give you an example.  It's like, you know, could be juggling, right? Someone who's like, you know, the king of that  or magic or, you know, in Marina's case, she's a very strong, like Russian, you know, base  looking at Silicon Valley and trying to be entrepreneurs, languages.  So basically, we're very interested in those kind of niches where you have like a real community  being built that might be instead of it being like a community that's just on one platform,  it actually has some currency to be cross platform. Right.  So if you see creators that have not just like a big YouTube channel, but have like  really shown the ability to move that audience between a few different platforms and potentially  engage them in a few different ways, that's the most exciting to us.  But yeah, I mean, I think, look, I think the other kind of angle to all of this is  another kind of catchphrase for this is I do think we're moving into what I call like a  cult driven economy in a lot of ways. And those kind of, when you think about those  cults or those networks investing in and supporting the people who are effectively the cult leaders  are building those interest groups and kind of maintaining them and driving them is kind of the  core, the core thesis. So it can be anyone. It's not just, you know, people on one network or,  you know, people who make a certain amount of content. It really is just about that,  that stickiness and relationship with their fans and the community that I think matters the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sam, you're, you're, we're going to have to let Sam go because we've, we only, we,  we'd said we'd take him for half an hour. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh hell, I thought we could hold over the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would love to come back. I, you know, as you know, a few things in the family front means I  have a little bit of a limited time. You just had a baby for Christ's sake. You

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  gotta spend some time, but I do want to say congratulations on finally finding a use for  that domain. You registered 20 years ago, lifecapital.com. You're going to have a  life capital event, life capital 2021, the future of the professional creator ecosystem  co-hosted by Slow Ventures and the information that's coming up in April.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Shocker who the co-hosts are. How did I get them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it that despite being married to a VC, Jessica took no money for the information.  That's, it's, that's a great, that's a great relationship you two have. Congratulations  on the, on your new addition to your family. It's really great to catch up with you again, Sam.  It's great to catch up as well. Thank you guys. I'm really, honestly, after you explained, I,  I am very impressed by what you're doing. Your willingness to take a big chance.  And when you describe it as kind of the alternative to debt for raising money for individuals,  that makes a lot of sense to me. You know, you say in your information piece, oh, I love this line.  Let me see. And especially because I'm old, you said,  why? Because young people have all the equity value in the form of their future sweat and ingenuity,  but without the ability to unlock it, we're stuck in a world where old people rule the roost.  I think you got a year onto something. Yep.  Congratulations, Sam. It's a real pleasure to see you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's great to see you guys. Thanks for having me. We'd love to do it again sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. We'll have you back anytime. Yeah. Slowcapital.com. All right. Take care, Sam.  Talk to you. Bye guys. Thank you. I hate to cut them off, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that was so great to have that opportunity. Thank you. So smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Oh, he's still. Thank you guys. Forget I said that. I'm still on.  Forget I said that. I will forget, but it is good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now's when we say the bad things. It's great to see you guys. And happy to do more on this  or whatever you guys want later. You know, I'm a big fan of all of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I love your Red Aftershocks headphones too. They're a sponsor. So thank you. I like them.  Yeah. They're great. Thanks, Sam. Take care. Bye.  Okay. Now you can say the good things. He really is very eloquent and I think well spoken. I think  he made it. I don't know. What do you guys think? You think he made a good case for what he's doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey? Yeah. I mean, I think for that sub segment,  it makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Like you, Jeff, I'm still like, ooh, how do you fund journalism  as a real business? And we still don't. Forget that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. Yeah. Well, I'm trying. I can't blame a guy for trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think, I will say as a lifestyle business, I do super well.  It's a great lifestyle business. Yes.  But if you could pool some resources to protect against things like lawsuits,  I think lifestyle people could go after more larger stories. I mean, like there are certain  things I probably would never take on. One, because it would take too much time away from  like what generates the most revenue for me. But also because it'd be terrifying if the  bigger company tried to sue me because I would just be like, yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if there's any argument I have against this is it does, frankly, it's going to foster,  they're going to invest in people who have a chance for explosive growth. And that's never  going to be lifestyle businesses like journalism. But that's okay.  And as he said, that being a physician, being a journalist, borrowing might be a good context  for that because you got a steady payback at a certain amount of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if journalists get a steady payback, but sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, then you got a bigger problem.  So switch to music.  You can't make a bad business model work by throwing money at it. If it's a bad business  model, it's a bad business model. Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this could work, but B2B is small. Switch to music. So the music industry is long tail  and making it work at that. So I guess part of the question is how big is big enough to make it work  in Sam's model? How many and what sizes does he need to make the model work? The question I was  going to ask is, in a sense, he becomes a new patriot of the arts. We talked about the difference  between this and the Middle Ages and the Renaissance last time. But it's a big wonder who he was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  supporting. Because a patriot of the arts gets no returns. All they get is Michelangelo's  Sistine ceiling and that's that. But he will end up supporting creativity,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  nonetheless. And so what kind of creativity will end up working best and being supported here?  And what will the impact of this be if this model takes off?  Well, that's what I mean. You can only speculate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you could look at what worked on Facebook. So you get a bunch of crazy, chaotic people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's got to have a strong upside over 30 years. So that's not a lot of things.  Okay. I love it. Can you think of any creator that you followed over 30 years?  Well, that's going to be interesting. I mean, there are some.  A lot of authors, certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are some people out there.  John Macarey, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's too early to know whether any of the successful YouTubers will have a 30-year career.  Nobody has yet. I mean, even PewDiePie, I would think is kind of on the wane.  Marquez Brownlee, he might have a career for 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Marquez's journalism and Marquez's value. Marquez has a different value perspective.  It's like yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what their metric is, but probably you're not going to see Marquez  or Twit have explosive growth. It's going to be more like slow but steady.  You have value. You're not a cult.  And that's why I kind of tried to ask him because you can get your money back on 1.7 million  over 30 years at 5%. That's not so hard to do.  Marquez would surely deliver those kind of returns. He wanted more than that, though.  He wanted a big hit. And that's interesting. I don't think it fosters journalism.  And we still, I don't think we're ever going to have to rely on the Craig Newmark's.  That's true patronage, by the way. That's not.  It is indeed.  That's not it. That's patronage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look when he gets back. A barbershop quartet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He gets love and adulation. And I think Jeff Bezos,  do you think he thinks he's going to make money on the Washington Post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is.  He's making money.  He is. But not on a cashflow basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's cash flowing, but he's not going to be rich on it.  No, no, no, but he didn't need to be. He didn't need to be.  So that's another kind of patronage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is.  Yeah, there's societal cache. He gets invited to some pretty cool parties because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He also demonstrated how you can make journalism successful and good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem I have is that if that's what we're counting on, that's not great, right?  Yeah, that's not great.  Much better if journalism had some sort of viable business model.  That's my life's calling. Yeah.  You can't rely on the kindness of strangers forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's where the individuals serving communities to me continues to make sense.  Because journalism as a whole is wildly inefficient.  We keep on repeating each other's stuff. We rewrite each other.  Whereas Stacey is doing unique reporting that has value.  The amount of unique reporting that is provided by the journalism broad tent that we call it  is a small percentage, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So-called enterprise journalism.  Enterprise reporting. Unfortunately, that's the most expensive, most complicated.  You mentioned lawsuits. I didn't even realize you were worried about that.  But it's risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It takes experience. The reporter that I am today versus the reporter I started out at 20 years ago,  even 10 years ago, is very different.  I don't know how many journalists make it all the way through the filter.  How many people are journalists for their entire career?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing is there are other ways to contribute to the public wheel.  You don't have to be a capital J journalist.  Somebody's talking about Phil DeFranco who's been doing YouTube for 15 years successfully.  And I think Marques Brownlee, it's kind of journalism,  but it's a little different flavor of journalism.  I think you can contribute to the conversation without being a traditional journalist.  That's why I was fascinated because Sam is really wading into a turbulent era  and saying, I'm going to pick winners.  It's kind of crazy.  But I like that. I like what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think he's trying to pick winners.  I think he's trying to spread some money to potential winners.  He's admitting that he's hoping for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Many of them will be losers, but you're still trying to pick ones that'll win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody throws money indiscriminately around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like making a movie. Most movies are flops.  It's the blockbuster model.  Enough make money that it's a good business to be in.  You still think about every script you produce.  You hope to make a blockbuster each time out.  I'm sure he doesn't throw money at creators he doesn't think are going to be successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just like a publisher, just like a record label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can be a blockbuster model, but that doesn't mean you just give money away.  You want a winner every single time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the difference is, with the capital that existed in, let's say, music, or in publishing,  or in movies, you could afford to make a lot of money.  Now, where Sam, I think, has something here, again, this is where the scale is so interesting,  is that, sorry, cliche, but long tail.  When you have so many more genres, in the Gutenberg book, I quoted numbers from a study,  or from an analyst, I think, about the number of genres that were supported  in mainstream music before and now.  Forget the number of artists within those genres then.  Each of those is a cult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I loved how he said that.  I think that's exactly right.  And that these niches will be big enough to support that kind of investment.  Which I love.  Yeah.  I love.  Yeah, I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's clear that's what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The more I study it, the more I realize how short term a phenomenon mass media was.  It was a blip.  In these past tense.  It was a blip.  It was steam power, penny press, magazines.  I just got another new book about this I'm about to dig into.  That argued that the magazines were the basis of mass media.  And it led to mass marketing, mass advertising, advertising and attention support for media.  It led to all these things.  Some good, supported a lot of creativity.  Some awful.  What we're seeing, I think, on the internet is the death throes of that model.  I agree.  The worst of Facebook, the worst of the internet, the worst of click bait  is the death throes of that model.  I agree.  So what are the new models that come along?  That's what interests me and that's what interests him.  And that's what I love about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Yeah, I tweeted it so none of us go to Wirecutter to buy some stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not me.  The Intelligencer, New York Magazine.  Here's the best strike for most people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Playing on the Wirecutter.  Cory Cica is brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if she wrote the headline.  He wrote the headline, but boy, that's a great headline.  He does find a former New York Times executive who said, yeah.  Many times staffers don't believe their work is journalism at all.  The pay scale is substantially different from Times' salaries.  They look down at the Wirecutter folks.  I guess I understand.  You know, I've seen this forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Having joined Time, Inc.  Yes, as part of their digital department.  They're like, oh yeah, you're great.  And then you would get these like snippy little things where they're like,  no, you're just like IKEA, we're the Ferrari.  And you're like, mother pluckers.  Oh yeah, we had the same experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When we had a website for a TV show, the website's like, oh you dirty web people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That made sense in like 2002.  It doesn't make sense in 2020 or 2015.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wirecutter recruited 10,000 subscribers in its first month behind the paywall.  That's the kind of revenue that makes a big difference to the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also interesting that Perpich, who's a family member,  who is in charge of this, and I've had him at events at the school,  because we have a community practice on commerce.  So Wirecutter has been there, been very helpful in helping other media companies understand how to do this.  It really struck me, I think it was about eight months ago or so,  I started seeing Wirecutter on the home page of the New York Times.  And I actually emailed them and said, well congratulations, that's amazing.  And they said, yeah, it was a very big deal that they were doing that.  And so part of the problem here, yeah, it's different.  Yes, it's commerce, it touches filthy, lucre, capitalism.  Nonetheless, if it helps support the journalism,  you'd think the journalists would be nicer to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, sometimes you have to stand up and say, we want to be treated better,  and that's what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So a strike is one thing.  I'm just asking this question, I don't really have an opinion on it.  A line too far?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whenever you go on strike, you say don't cross the picket line.  Now with a virtual property, there's no picket line to go into the world.  It's a wire cutter store.  So it's just saying don't cross our picket line, don't use the wire cutter.  Now it's interesting because it's not only behind the paywall,  although it's a pretty loose paywall.  I think you get 10 articles before you're dinged to pay for it.  Nevertheless, they also make, and I would bet the lion's share of the money  they make from affiliate fees from their links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if it even is behind the paywall,  because the whole point is to make money on the commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it is, but it's a loose paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's for people like me who go in and read the...  I actually read the wire cutter for fun.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  I've been paying for 30 years for Consumers Union, for Consumer Reports.  They don't have any advertising.  I think it's good to support this kind.  This is real journalism.  Should I buy that product?  You bet.  This is of course their biggest weekend because it's Black Friday and Cyber Monday.  So they're hitting the times where it hurts.  I'm surprised they couldn't come to an agreement before this strike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet mainstream America is not going to know.  We know because we're freaking journalists.  My mom, no idea.  Actually, she might shop just to spite the unions because she's somewhat evil sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you feel about crypto investors?  Boy, the people who tried to buy the Constitution, Constitution Dow.  It did not work out in so many ways.  First of all, they raised $40 million.  But they kind of got screwed by what they call the gas fees.  They were doing it in Ethereum.  And unfortunately, it's very expensive.  I didn't realize how high the gas fees are.  It's very expensive.  So much so...  In fact, there was one journalist.  I want to give him credit.  Is it Vice?  Yeah, it was Vice, I think.  They bought $200, put $200 into the...  So I should explain what's going on.  Sotheby's last week auctioned off one of the 13 remaining print copies of the US Constitution  printed in that era.  And it went for $43 million to, ironically, a hedge fund CEO, Ken Griffin, who...  And it all ties back in whose hedge fund was the hedge fund that put money into Robinhood  during the stonk GameStop short sell.  So it's all kind of coming around.  And I have to think there was a little bit of this revenge angle in him.  So a couple of lessons learned.  One, it's no good to go into an auction when everybody knows what your top bid is.  Yeah.  And why Kenneth Griffin offered any more than a dollar more than the top the Dow  folks could offer is beyond me, but maybe somebody else was in the bid.  A little big swing and I could throw in a few extra million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gotcha, you digital ninnies.  The other thing is you really got to consider the gas fees.  So the Vice put in $200 and effectively you can get a refund, but you have gas fees going in  and you had gas fees going out.  And ultimately a lot of people ended up upside down on their contribution.  So now they own...  And that was another crazy thing.  And thank you to Vice for getting this all sorted out.  When you bought into this, you got some purpose created cryptocurrency,  dollar sign people tokens, 1 million tokens per one ether donated.  Those tokens were originally going to be, here's how we vote on where the constitution is displayed  because they wanted to display it to the public.  At least they weren't going to tear it up into 12,000 pieces or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the million dollar webpage.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then because they lost the bid, they basically said, the token's worthless.  People have been trying to sell it by the way.  You were trying to sell their token.  It's just everything wrong with the crypto environment all bundled into one big blob.  Some people expected to be able to either flip their tiny ownership stake in the constitution.  Anytime you got crypto, you got speculation.  Yeah, you got the flippers.  Dollar people tokens for a profit.  This did start happening over the weekend according to Vice  with some investors selling tokens on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.  It wasn't against the rules.  Constitution DOW said, yeah, that's okay.  But then on Saturday, this past Saturday,  Constitution DAO announced that it would be moving away from the people token  to a new yet to be created token called We The People.  People would go by the wayside because we didn't get the constitution.  That was all about that.  Then a lot of people got upset because it crated the price of their dollar sign people.  Hundreds of angry messages on the Discord.  Then they changed their mind on Sunday night.  We're going to go back to the original plan.  Now people's worth something.  We're not going to create We The People.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a very fundamental dumb question here, which I tweeted, which is,  wouldn't this have worked on Kickstarter?  Yeah.  We only put in the money if you actually do this.  That would have been so much better.  We could actually put in fiat currency and we wouldn't have any gas.  Somebody said back in Twitter, that's just so Web2.0, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let me give you the-  You don't get the speculators, the dumb money that's like, yeah, what the hell.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the process Vice went through to contribute $200.  First, we had to buy Ethereum on an exchange.  We used Coinbase.  We bought $200 worth of Ethereum.  Coinbase took a $3 fee.  Then we had to send the Ethereum from Coinbase to a MetaMask crypto wallet.  To do this, we had to pay a $12 network fee.  Then we had to send the Ethereum from MetaMask to Juicebox,  which was running the constitutional DAO thing.  So-called gas fees vary wildly and depending on how busy the Ethereum network is  at any given moment in the complexity of the transaction,  right now gas fees in Ethereum are very high  and a highly complex operation could end up costing hundreds of dollars in fees.  In our case, they paid a $75 gas fee to contribute roughly $75 to the project.  Of the initial $200 we bought in Ether, $90 was eaten up in fees simply to donate.  And then if you wanted to get a refund, you have to do that all in reverse.  So to get our Ether back from Juicebox, we'd have to pay gas fees again,  meaning essentially the entirety of the amount invested would be wiped out.  Half of all the people who contributed are in this boat, according to the constitution DAO.  17,000 donors, median donation size $206.  A significant percentage of these donations came from wallets that were made  for the very first time.  That's to your point, Jeff. A lot of people go, oh, I'm going to get it on this one.  That means about half of the people who donated are now going to either lose basically everything  they put into Ethereum network fees. So who gets rich?  By the way, same thing with NFTs. Who makes money on NFTs?  The people who generate the NFTs, the miners who charge the gas fees.  That's who's making money on all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's not terrible. If you are a creator, then NFTs might be interesting to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because you can generate NFTs, get the fees. But if you can't sell that NFT, you still have to  pay the fee to generate it. My point is they're the people making the picks for the gold miners.  And they're going to be in the long run, the people who are going to make the money because  they make it on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not true. I mean, there will be the few gold miners who make money and some that will make  a little money and then you need picks and shovels. I mean, let's not, nobody was demonizing the  people making picks and shovels back then. It feels like you're kind of demonizing the platforms here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not the picks and shovels. It's the boat captain who's going to rip you off,  getting you up to the gold country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, okay. That's fair. I'm just, I'm like, I don't know if this metaphor works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think the folks who organized Constitution DAO made any money on the gas fees. I don't think  so. And in fact, they say it was a victory. If you go to the website, they say, this project has been  such an incredible experience and we are so honored and appreciative to have been on this journey with

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you. That's like when I fall down and I hop back up and I go, tada!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This project was a landmark event that showed the entire world that a group of internet friends  can use the power of Web 3, another buzzword, to face a seemingly insurmountable goal and achieve  incredible results on an impossible timeline. It is our sincere hope that this project will  spark many others that take inspiration from the enthusiasm and accomplishments of everyone involved  to use the power of Web 3 to make a positive impact on the world. We love you all and are

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  truly humbled to be part of this history together. I think there's a lot of potential to crypto and  cyber and blockchain, except that it got taken over by a bunch of crypto bros, male jerks. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. I don't have a dog in this hunt. I think probably if you bought into this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would hope you didn't expect to get your money back. I mean, what were you going to get if they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  won that? You would get nothing. Yeah, exactly. There was no way to get the money back. What were  you selling? There was no market for it. That's why it was a charitable thing. Start a 501C3,  contribute to it, and you get a tax deduction. At least you got that. Yeah. Do you? I guess you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because if you make money on crypto- Well, if you donate to charity, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But is this a charity? I don't think so. Well, you could have said, this is an effort to preserve  this for the country. We're going to give it to a university to make sure it doesn't fall in the  hands of an evil VC or whatever private equity guy. And we're going to do it through a fiscal  agent for a charity. Yeah. In that case, you could. But you don't get any money back. The only way you  make any money in that case back is tax deduction. Right. Niantic has raised $300 million, the Pokemon

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go folks, $9 billion valuation. Why? Because they're in the metaverse business.  It's a former Google company. They spun out of Google. I think it was the Maps team, wasn't it?  They spun out of Google. Their first project- Oh, I forgot that.  Yeah. It was Ingress. I assume we forgot.  Yeah. And then they did Pokemon Go, which is a huge success. They've done a few that have been less

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  successful. Did you do the- Was it Hogwarts? No. Harry Potter? Did they have a Harry Potter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. They had a good Harry Potter. Well, good in the sense that it was Harry Potter, bad in the  sense that it was incredibly boring. Yeah. And I stopped playing it. But Lisa is very much still  playing Pokemon Go. I think a lot of people are. I play it every once in a while. It's fun.  It is fun. Even I enjoyed it.  Yeah. And they're ready. I mean, some of the success is because it's Pokemon, right?  But they're ready to, they believe that the metaverse, John Hanke, who's the founder,  referred to the metaverse, the ones you saw already, Player One, the Facebook-style VR headsets,  as a dystopian nightmare. Niantic wants to develop technology that brings people closer  to the outside world. And that's kind of what Pokemon has done. In fact, billions of miles  walked by players playing this game because you have to walk around. You can't just sit at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think the collection angle and the fact that it's not like super skills-based  and there's a little bit of a, you know- It's fun.  And there's Pokemon. Yeah, it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. At Niantic said Hanke, we believe humans are the happiest when their virtual world leads  them to a physical one. That actually makes sense to me. Unlike a sci-fi metaverse, a real-world  metaverse will use technology to improve our experience of the world as we've known it for  thousands of years. I agree with him on that. That's exactly my objection to traditional VR,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is it's isolating. So they- It can't be. Although you can play with other people.  And I would say that Facebook's metaverse does have ways for you to interact with other people  and wants to bring real people into- Sure. Facebook sees it as social. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I like the idea of getting outside, enjoying the fresh air.  Yeah. I'm not going to be against that. Pokemon Go players have walked 10.9 billion miles  in there. Geez.  How many times around the earth is that? Lisa goes for a walk every night. And I swear to God,  she says, I got to get the sun on my head and I got to feel the fresh air. But she's playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pokemon Go the whole time. I swear to God. I'm about to go. I got to leave for a minute. I got

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to go buy some Croc stock. Geez. She's out there with her Pokemon ball and her Pokemon Go. I mean,  it really, it's playing the game. But it gets her outside. It's great. And when we've traveled,  we've played it. And it's really fun. I probably told this story. We were in Malta,  you know, a little island in the middle of the Mediterranean. And we're in, it's beautiful,  medieval town in downtown Malta. And we're playing Pokemon Go. And some Maltese kids come over,  but they don't speak English. We don't speak Maltese. And they go, they point at it. We go,  okay. And we follow them. Probably not the best idea. We follow them to up and down alleys around,  end up in front of the big cathedral. And it turns out they were looking for people to help  them in a raid. And so we all played together with so much. It was amazing. It was a great  communal experience. So I'm a big fan. Technology is not a bad thing. No, it's a good thing. Well,  maybe it's a good thing, except in the case of mouse jigglers. Well, that's a way to get back  at bad evil bosses. That's true. I, Dick DiBartolo had a mouse jiggler on his Gizway segment. He  brings in crappy gadgets for the radio show. And we were both baffled as to the purpose of this  thing. Well, Noah Veltman has explained it. Here's his tweet. Today in late capitalism, apparently,  there's a whole product category of mouse jigglers, devices to generate random movement  from your mouse. So your work from home surveillance software thinks you're working.  It's also to keep your computer from falling asleep. But maybe it's more for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I assume people, I mean, if you have a job that needs to get done,  the nice thing about working from home is you can get it done in however long a time it takes.  Right. And then you can go do whatever else. Are we paying for the hour or are we paying for the job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not what bosses are doing. There is. Yeah. There's software now.  It's really getting awful. I think if you look at the descriptions of these mouse jigglers  on Amazon, you'll realize the word undetectable shows up in every single description.  Undetectable mouse mover. I think that tells you what this is for. No one will know that you're,  they might wonder why is his mouse just kind of jiggling like that. But yeah, that's,  that's kind of sad if you work for a job like that. By the way, thank you to ScooterX who  has posted in our Discord, Pokemon Go creator Niantic launches Bitcoin hunting AR game.  I'm so confused. Let me see. I gotta, I gotta go to that. Yeah. I gotta think that through.  What is, what are you, how, huh? I'm going to put it in my browser and find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, that's not what I wanted. I have a, for some reason,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Firefox, when I click a link in Discord, it complains. Okay. Chrome. It squeaks at you.  No, it says, are you sure you want to go there? Yes. Trust this domain. And then Firefox.  You hang out with paranoid people. I'm already running. I'm not going to want,  Firefox already running to use Firefox. You must first close Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of Zen, isn't it? If you wish to use Firefox, little grasshopper, you must first close

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Firefox. Here it is. They must have, they've announced they're partnering with Bitcoin  rewards application fold to launch a Bitcoin hunting AR game. It's cut away. It's out November  23rd. It launched yesterday in the game. Players will hunt Bitcoin and other prizes in the wild  with their phone. They actually get Bitcoin players will be able to earn Satoshi's, which by the way,  is the penny of bitcoins is the smallest possible denomination, but also wind spins that could  allow them to earn more, but won't. The rewards will appear on screen as 3d coins and other items.  You know, I, you know, it might be as fun as playing Pokemon Go. I'm going to have to find  this game. What's it called? Does it say I got a new game? I'm earning Bitcoin.  I'm just going to search for Niantic and see. Is anybody playing this?  No, it's not. It's a bug in Firefox and probably my own Linux. I think somebody's saying, oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you have an update. No, no, no, no. Go to the terminal. Yeah, you can fix it in the terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know what? I bet you this is not available on iPhone. Come to think of it.  That's exactly the kind of thing Apple would say. Hey, where's our 30%?  All right. Let's take a little break. More to come. Lots of stories today. We got the change  log still around the corner, but before we go much farther, I'd like to talk to you about userway.org.  Userway is exactly, this is to me, this is exactly what a company that's trying to make  a difference should be doing. So it turns out that according to the federal and the US,  the federal ADA law, and I bet there's laws worldwide about this. Every website without  exception has to be accessible. Every website is a public entity. Now that's a challenge. Of course,  as anybody who owns a website starts thinking about it, how do you know what you need to do?  Well, I've got a recommendation. It's very affordable. It's very easy. It's called userway.  Userway is an incredible AI powered solution that tirelessly enforces the hundreds of WCAG  guidelines. And it's just a line, single line of JavaScript you put in your code. There's a plug-in  for WordPress and other sites. It's very easy. And with that userway can achieve more than an  entire team of developers. And look, 1.4 million sites now use userway. Big businesses like Coca  Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx. But just because these are best in class enterprise tools doesn't mean  you can't use it as a small and medium sized business. In fact, it's very, very affordable.  But the nice thing to know is when you take off, when you grow, userway will grow with you. I mean,  Coca Cola can do it. You can. And accessible and compliant websites, not just the right thing to  do, it also makes business sense. There are millions of users who can't use your shopping  cart or your nav menus or your forms, your registration forms. Millions of people who  require userway just to purchase your products. Userway remediates weird, complex nav menus. It  ensures all your pop-ups are accessible. It generates image alts, writes descriptions for  you. That's where the AI comes in and actually can understand the picture and tells people what it is.  It fixes vague link violations, broken links, makes sure your website uses accessible colors while  remaining true to your brand. You'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed.  Go to userway right now, userway.org slash twit. They've got a great scanning tool that'll tell you  if your website's compliant. And if it's not, and I bet it's not, it's easy to remediate. You can  use WordPress, Shopify, Wix, AEM, Sitecore, SharePoint. It's cost-effective, easy to add,  and it really works. Just ask the voice of Siri, the world's most popular voice assistant,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about userway. Userway is trusted by more than 1 million websites and 60 million users with  disabilities. Visit userway.org to learn how one line of code can make your website accessible.

It's also a great way to  showcase your brand's commitment to millions of people with disabilities. To me, that's the most  important reason to do this. You go to userway.org slash twit, you'll get 30% off Userway's AI-powered  accessibility solution. Userway, making the internet accessible for everyone. Userway.org  slash twit. Thank you for your support, Userway. And thank you for supporting us by using that  address so they know it's not here. So somebody said it is on an iPhone.  Fold Bitcoin cash back rewards. No, no, no, that's just the fold account thing. That's not  the game. I want the game. Moving on. Cannabis orders now available on UberEats in Ontario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of great. Perfect. The grass and the munchies come together. Yeah. And then you order

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  again because you want more. It's kind of a virtuous cycle. Yeah. FTC, this is really good.  And this article coming from the Neiman lab. So let's give them credit because of course,  great supporters of journalism. Is it the end of click to subscribe but call to cancel? The FTC

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  says that's illegal. Yay. California did this and it was great. So I am glad that the FTC has done

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this. And the reason it's in the Neiman lab website is because a lot of newspapers do this.  A study of 526 news organizations found that only 41% make it easy for people to cancel  subscriptions online. And of course you train your customer service reps in tactics to talk them out  of it. That's why you want them to call and make it harder to cancel. The FTC says the practice is  one of several dark quote, they even know about dark patterns, quote, dark patterns that track,  trick or trap customers into subscriptions. And it's straight up illegal. The FTC vowed to ramp  up enforcement companies must provide an easy and simple cancellation process, including an option  that's at least as easy as the one to subscribe. Yay. Yay. Yay. One click cancel. Wow. This thank  you Lena Kahn. This Lena Kahn at it again. She really has her, she's not a fan of big tech.  To comply with the law, she says, but this isn't big tech, this is big media. Well, you know what,  it's not just media. I mean, every, every subscript, this is one of the reasons,  one of the only reasons I think the iPhone is, is a, is a superior platform. Android  is that anytime you buy anything through Apple, it adds that to a list of subscriptions you can  easily find on the iPhone and it makes, and you can cancel right there. And that's part of Apple's  rules for subscriptions. And that's, that's a really good thing. I periodically go through it  and cancel subscriptions. It's actually good for everybody because if it's easy to cancel,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you're more likely to try it. Right. Well, and like, I don't know about you, but I have subscriptions  that I turn on and off basically on based on like a television, especially, but even stuff like  fitness apps, you know, I get bored. So I'm like, let's do two or three months of Peloton, then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  let's switch over. No, that's what they're afraid of. Churn is the worst thing that fights. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's the worst. I'm old enough to remember in the industry when, when presumed renewal through  your credit card came along, automatic renewal. That was a huge, huge revolution. So, but churn,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  okay. Just thinking about it logically from a business perspective, if you think about churn  for like a telco, it's a big deal because they've got to lay lines or give you hardware. Even a  media publication has to say, Hey, I've got X number subscribers. Thus I'm going to pay real  money to print physical copies of the paper and mail them out. Right. As you move to digital,  turning things on and off is actually pretty easy. And it's not expensive if your software works.  Correct. But your real cost. Go ahead. Well, that's what I'm saying. So I understand the  business model logic here, but the actual real costs of it are pretty low, which means eventually  they will, unless there's a monopoly, they will move to doing that because there's no reason not  to. Here's the thing. Someone will make it easier. Tell me. It's not a switch on and off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you call it when you, when you, when you start a phone line? Connect, disconnect? Well,  whatever. Yeah. Provision, unprovisioned. It's not a provision question. Thank you. To use the jargon.  It's a marketing question. Like, so how much do you think it costs to market, to get a new subscriber,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to entertain weekly back in my day? Oh, well, no, that's, that's true. But even the cost of marketing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is lower. Not necessarily because it's harder to get people. And it depends on what the cost of the  item is. When I, when I, you know, when I worked for Delphi internet way back in the day, the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the subscription cost was like $180. It was huge. Okay. Well, and, and then, yes, I mean, I'm not,  I mean, I get why people don't want people to stop paying the money every month, but I also get,  you know, flipping things back on and off in the digital world is way different than flipping it  back on and off in the physical world. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  So, but yes, yes, there's marketing expenses. I mean, if you're a newspaper, there's all the  journalists you hire. I mean, there's a good solution for that. Actually, the New York Times

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  had AI write the book review for a book that I don't think anybody wants to read the age of AI  and our human future by Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Hutenlocher. And I'm thinking  Hutenlocher probably did all the writing on this one. The reviewer, Kevin Ruse, we all know. Yeah,  love him. Said after finishing the age of AI, a new book about artificial intelligence by Henry  Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and then Daniel Hutenlocher, I found myself unmoved by the prospect of  reviewing it. I've read dozens of books about AI. And while the conceit of this one was intriguing,  bringing together a 98 year old diplomat and war criminal, a former Google, that was me, I added  that a former Google chief executive and MIT professor, the book itself was a fairly forgettable  entry in the genre. So he got GPT three to write it. I didn't know about this pseudo right,  SUDO right is a AI writing program that uses GPT three. I remember reading that OpenAI was  reluctant to release GPT three because it was too good. I don't know if that's the case.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait till you get to the first cuts below. Yeah. So it does this with the  help of a supercomputer containing some 285,000 processors, a multi layered neural network that  ranks among the world's most powerful AI engines. In fact, it's even mentioned in the book, the age  of AI is one of several promising technologies that are producing a revolution in human affairs.  So come over here, please. I pasted the first several paragraphs of this review into pseudo  right and asked the AI to finish. Here's what it wrote. Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel  Huttenlocker. I just like saying his name. That's why I keep reading it. The age of AI is a bold  new book on artificial intelligence that will become a go-to guide for anyone who wants to  understand this transformative technology. It's as if the AI knew, you know, it's like,  like log rolling here. The authors have examined the full range of AI technologies from computer  vision systems to natural language processing and written about them in a way that will appeal to  both experts and lay people. I mean, honestly, it does sound like a human wrote this kind of a  PR human. Yeah. One of the most inspiring aspects of this book is its scope. The authors delve  deeply into the potential of AI in all areas of human enterprise that described the impact of AI  in healthcare, economics, geopolitics, law, urban development, governance, journalism, the military,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  even the life. We had a hundred words yet. Do I have to keep going? This sounds like what I used

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to write in high school. Kissinger, Schmidt and Huttenlocker are not afraid to explore the darkest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  side of AI either. They're clear-eyed about the ways that AI could enable dictators to monitor  their citizens and manipulate- Oh, some of my best friends.  Yeah, to incite people to commit violence. Oh, that's interesting. Although AI is already making

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  our lives better in many ways, Kissinger, Schmidt and Huttenlocker, clearly GPT-3 enjoys his name  as well, caution that it will take us as a species many years to create a system as powerful as we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  deserve. So AI creates a bunch of me and this bladder. They wisely suggest we not lose sight

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of the values we want to instill in this new machine intelligence. Look, it got to a high

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  school level. Yeah, it did. Pretty good. Now read the earlier try. Did you read that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. That was the best try. On the first attempt, it spun out a series of run-out sentences  that hinted GPT-3 got stuck in some kind of odd recursive loop.  As an example, the book which you are reading at the moment is a book on a nook, which is a book  on a book, which is a book on a subject, which is a subject on a subject, which is a subject on a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  subject. What? Yeah. When it goes wrong, it goes wrong so hilariously. It's Dr. Seuss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The book which you're reading at the moment is a book on a nook, which is a book on a book,  which is a book on a subject, which is a subject on a subject, which is a subject on a subject.  A few tries later, it seemed to give up on the task of book reviewing altogether  and started merely listing the names of tech companies. Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, IBM,  Microsoft, Pidu, Tencent, Tesla, Uber, Airbnb, Twitter, Snap, Alibaba, WeChat, Slack.  Gutenbacher.  But it warmed up quickly and within a few minutes, the AI was coming up with impressively  cogent paragraphs of analysis, some frankly better than, says Mr. Roos, what I could have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  generated on my own. Well done, Kevin Roos. Well done. Yeah, well played. So let's see,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  did he, should he have been paid for writing that article if he had turned that in? And is it art  if a journalist makes an AI write him a story? It's art because of the way he made it a very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  much more interesting story than a review of this dopey book would have been. Yeah, absolutely.  I agree. Yeah. I mean, that's where, that's the, that's the art. He says, finally, GPT-3 did not  address the biggest question about the book, which is why it exists at all. Kissinger, who was 66  years old when the World Wide Web was invented, is not a full-time AI practitioner nor a particularly  savvy parser of tech hype. Remember he was on the board of Theranos. So anyway, yeah, you know what?  Who wasn't on the board of Theranos? Not me. I was not. The trial is getting interesting now. I think  she is on, Elizabeth Holmes is on the stand this week. Yes, she has been. I haven't, have you  followed the case? I haven't really. Yeah, you know, and it's gotten more and more damning as  they've gone on. I mean, essentially we were told that the strategy was going to be, because they  separated the trials of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder, and the man who was at the time her,  not only her paramour, but also ran the company, Sonny Bolwani, those trials were separated. His  trials later is next year. That it was thought that each trial would be each defendant blaming  the other one for everything. And it's kind of what happened is, you know, but they've been  bringing in a parade of people who are saying, well, they didn't put it in writing, but here's  what they told me. And it was all BS. Finally, last week, they had the recordings for reporters  interview with Elizabeth Holmes in which she repeated all of the lies and misdirections that  she had told the investors. They got it on tape. So I think that's kind of blockbuster.  And she can't really say, well, it's Sonny's fault. He said that, not me,  because they got her on tape saying it. I haven't read her testimony yet. It'll be  interesting to see what she says. All I saw was the TikTok of her holding hands with her  current romantic partner and her mother walking into the court and some guy in the background  saying, you go girl boss. That's all I have. You go girl boss. You tell them.  That's a good way to put it. California. So one of my favorite authors, Stacey Higginbotham,  wrote a piece called The Unbearable Fussiness of the Smart Home, finally admitting what we've  known for years. Tell us about your tale of woe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talk about how the smart home all the time is not smart enough. And I finally decided to  break down, I used examples. I talk about it being messy all the time. There's no reason to lie to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people about that. I don't sugar coat it. Let me give you the smart home, this is one quote,  is like a cat, mostly self-sufficient and nice to have, but also possessing a mind of its own that  can lead to frustration and confusion for its owner. I think that's a perfect analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is. And so I followed things that broke in my house as examples. And basically the whole point  of this article is you are no longer buying hardware, even though you think you're buying  software. And you're not only buying software, you're buying  interdependent software and services from different vendors. And it just constantly degrades.  You cannot get a device that's going to consistently, if you hook it up to anything else,  an update might break it, a new feature role might break it. You never know. And so I just  wrote this. I didn't think it would, it's done very well. I was like, fine, I'm just writing this  because I'm pissed off because banana leaf lights don't work. You got picked up 11 hours ago by

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hacker News, 288 comments, all of them pretty much agreeing with you. A lot of reinforcement.  I think there's always the guy said, well, I don't have those problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, there's a subset of people. There's the, well, this is why I never put any of this  stuff in my house to begin with. There's the, you would never have this problem if you installed  open source, home seer, pick, you know, CDA, whatever, professional installer, whatever.  And then there's the people who are like, yeah, this does suck. And who actually recognize that  it's a problem. And I'll, this isn't just a problem for like the smart home industry.  It's a problem for consumers. It's a problem for manufacturers. And it's going to be a legal problem  because we, like I said, everybody's hardware, your car, your corporate, I don't know,  manufacturing machines, they're all becoming software. And software has different ownership  require or different requirements by the manufacturers, like different obligations  for security and things like that. And it has a different product for the, it's a different  product for the consumer. And we don't realize that there's a good story actually this week from  Ars Technica on people buying the Nordic track. Something, something treadmill.  And hacking it. Yeah.  And hacking it. And then,  So they can watch Netflix.  Yeah, they hacked it. They were like, this thing has a 32 inch screen on it. I love it. I'm going  to hack it. And so we're going to base Android. We'll just sideload Netflix and YouTube and  whatever we want. And apparently Nordic track was like, you know what, we're going to update this.  It's too easy to like sideload stuff. And maybe Nordic track didn't realize it was  breaking a critical functionality that people loved. But Nordic track didn't offer it as a  formal functionality. So from their perspective, they're kind of in the clear and maybe they want  to do a business model where they do a deal with YouTube for exclusive access. I mean,  these are the sorts of things where a lot of the conflict about like the stuff we're buying today  is conflicts about, is it hardware or software? So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and more, even more, it's often you own the hardware, but you don't own the software.  And so as a result, you don't really own the device. You don't control it. And it's not  just home automation. Everything's your car. It's your car. It's your John Deere combine.  My favorite comment in the hacker news thread from Brian Rasmussen, very simple, there will come  soft rains, which if you're a Ray Bradbury fan, you know exactly what they're referring to.  Is that from the VELT? Or is that actually the name of the story? I'm trying to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You should tell everyone who doesn't know that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the VELT is a great example. Let's see. Oh, yeah, there will come soft rains  is the story and it's after the nuclear meltdown, there's nothing left except the automated devices,  which continue to operate forever. If you're not a Ray Bradbury fan, you got to read some,  you got to read some Ray Bradbury. If you're not a Ray Bradbury fan,  why not? Yeah, why not? Exactly. There will come soft rains. What a great simple comment to add.  So, I mean, look, the fact that you got not only picked up on hacker news, but 288 comments shows  that you touched a nerve. You definitely touched a nerve. This is something we're all experiencing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pete Worden retweeted it and I think he's just the best. So he's the tiny ML dude at Google.  Nice. I love his worldview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For me, it was a little bit of an antidote because you're always talking about how much you love your  Nanoleaf elements and your Wemo remotes and stuff to know that it's just as bad for you as it is for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  me. I have the only problem, I'm trying to think of the few problem-free devices and a lot of the  problems come in. The Nanoleaf issue was an update that broke my system and I'm still waiting to get  it fixed. The Wemo stuff is, that is like a weird ghost between Google and Wemo. They have these,  I think I called it this ebb and flow of working and non-working that's so hilarious to me.  I just, it's like living in a haunted house because sometimes my lights will turn off  like they're supposed to, but sometimes they won't and I never know what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently enrages your husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, he's like, hey G, turn on the plants. Turn on the plants. Stacey, it's broken.  I'm like, no, it's just not working this week. He's like,  give it a couple days. This week. That's my favorite. It does. It does. It's so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, you know what? We're going to give you a reward, Stacey,  for your excellent article because there are now some pretty strong rumors about the Pixel 6G

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and it's going to be- Oh wait, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  6A, I mean. What did you buy?  What did you buy? I bought a five on Swappa. And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How much was it? How good?  Oh, it was like $400. Maybe three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. And it has a headphone jack.  I think it was $400.  Which is something-  It has a headphone jack.  Yeah, because the rumors of the Pixel 6A say no headphone jack, but it is smaller  and lighter, but probably not as small and light as a 5A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, had I known, but I had to return my Google. Google has the crappiest return policy on phones.  It's 15 days. So I had to, you know, I wanted something.  So you're happy with the 5A?  And I got a cool camo case.  Look at that.  I'm like a finance bro now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For those who missed last week's episode, the  self-titled Princess Floppy Wrists episode, Stacey did not, and I meant that in only the  most loving way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did not take it as, I thought it was weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no. Yeah, you laughed heartily at it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I enjoyed the Princess. I was like, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey was not happy with the weight and heft of her Pixel 6 Pro.  I'm glad to see that you found something good.  And you know, I think honestly, except for the cameras, they're probably pretty comparable.  And you do have a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'll look at the 6. Maybe I'll get that.  And you know, my daughter can have the 5 and she won't have like, I just, I don't love this.  I wasn't as excited. Like I was genuinely excited to upgrade to the Pixel 6, but no.  I mean, it was, I mean, this is not exciting. It's functional.  Cause my other phone was kind of getting real laggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm amusing myself with visions of why Stacey couldn't be Queen Elizabeth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wave. I can't wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you were having trouble, Jeff, with your Pixel 6 and your Android Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. So I, and I was, I'm honored. I am absolutely honored that I was the celebrity  letter of the week on All About Android with its host, Energy Krebs.  So the beard's working. He's got, he's got a little beard.  He's got a tough beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's doing Movember where you grow, you grow a beard to support men's testicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I want to see it. We need a selfie. So Jason, put a selfie up.  So the problem is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can just watch All About Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say, I want to see it at the end of the month. I want to wait till,  you know, next week.  It's pretty darn close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We only got another week.  I don't think it's going to be a lot more, uh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I was like, maybe there's more growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not unless he takes a lot of hormones between now and Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When it made your G Krebs wear, did Krebs wear, did he wear a beret? He was a hipster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so. He had a, he had a goatee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. He was, of course we're talking about Dobie Gillis, which is the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. But I loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Um, so, so all right.  And it was, it was Gilligan who played Maynard G Krebs.  Yes.  And, uh, there is a certain, certain similarity.  Oh, it was bongos. That's right. Uh, you need some bongos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason, that would do it.  And a torn sweatshirt.  Yeah. Torn sweatshirt.  Work!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maynard G Krebs used to say that all the time. Work!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is, this is what network television thought of hippies or beatniks really.  Beatniks.  Beatniks. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, all right.  Oh, anyway, so my, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Sorry. My phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Phone. We got to talk to you.  Talk about your Android. So I, in response to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yours was no good. You had nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I pointed out that Android Auto did not work if you have a VPN or I was using Next DNS.  If you had a VPN of any kind turned on, uh, or ExpressVPN.  So I turned it off and it works just fine.  I even sent you a proof of concept picture.  To rub my nose in it.  To rub your nose in it.  But maybe that's because I have a Ford. I don't know, but it doesn't.  So others are reporting these, these problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lots of problems. And so, so what's happening is, um, it'll recognize the phone.  It'll recognize there's Android Auto.  But when I click on Android Auto on the, on the head unit on the car, it doesn't do anything.  It can't get anything out of the phone. I think is what's happening.  The phone's not responding. And so nothing happens.  And Ron said that that what he had heard on all about Android, he'd heard that, um, uh, there were,  there were issues with lots of different cars.  And, um, I also heard in Twitter, but maybe it's the cable.  It's very persnickety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be.  So I'm using wireless, uh, Android Auto.  I can't, there's no such thing.  Yeah. Yeah. You have to have it, but, uh, maybe that's why I can use it and you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm trying to be calm here and not have a cycle.  Are you using the cable that came with the phone? Try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, that's, it's, it's C to C.  Oh, and you don't have to see a, uh, there's the, oh, you have, it's a, yeah, it's a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Detroit's about 40 years behind.  That's right. Yeah.  So, um, yeah, so I had, I had, I had a hellish week trying to get my,  I decided to upgrade my files.  My files was working.  It was working beautifully for a whole.  Oh man. These tweets burned my eyeballs.  They were so angry.  I messed with it.  And I finally, a nice guy named Frank was here for four and a half hours.  This is important.  Stacy, this goes to your point, I think about the persnickety of these things,  you know, like one old, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, splitter that wasn't up to the right number  on it.  And that caused two to go down and something else caused others to go down.  And he said, yeah, these are a lot touchier.  State top boxes are the worst computers ever created.  They're just awful.  So anyway, so I got through all that and I said, I can't take another crisis.  I'm just going to tell myself to be calm.  I can still use my car.  I can still use my phone.  I hope Google will fix it.  Zen breath, Jeff, Zen breath.  So I'm pissed about it, but I'm, I'm trying not to get upset about it.  All that I'd let me know I wasn't alone.  I like it.  I'm, I'm, I'm a hair hair trigger away from a psycho fit, but I'm trying to not  hear Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, you seemed pretty, Jason has tweeted a picture of his, um, incipient beard,  nascent, nascent beard.  That's the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It came in just, it came in so nicely down there.  It's so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  It's so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it is better G crabs, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a beatnik.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Little gray in there too.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, Jason's a good looking fella.  And, uh, that's a nice beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said his wife is saying at the moment of the tick of the clock into the new month,  it's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  That's why I can't do it.  Cause Lisa wouldn't, it won't let me just full out.  Won't let me, which is fine.  Cause I think in my business, honestly, it's better not to have a beard because you want  to get as much expressiveness.  You know, you want all the emotions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And no, I think some people, like if you have a bad chin, you want a beard.  Well, there's cause not a bad chin.  I'm sorry.  If you have a weak chin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think my chin is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, so am I accused of having a weak chin or not being expressive enough right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  I mean, it go teas in too bad because it's still a lot of your faces exposed, but  I also think it's a strong statement.  Like, uh, well, just  it's just a statement.  It's like people go goatee.  And so I'm trying to be as neutral as possible.  Right?  Enjoy.  Goatee.  No, no, you make, don't you look at somebody.  I mean, when you see somebody with a beard, you pigeonhole them.  That's a Santa Claus.  That's a Maynard G.  Krebs.  You did it yourself, Jeff.  It's a, there's something because a beard, you see the beard.  Love and fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the actually the Android police story that said your pixel five could have  been a contender if they'd only had the tensor chip they had planned.  They had planned to put the tensor chip in the five, but they, it wasn't ready.  And according to Marques Brownlee, uh, he had conversations with people at Google saying  the company had been working on tensor for a long time.  They wanted the pixel fire to be the first phone to launch with a tensor chip.  They wanted the pixel fire to be the first phone to launch with it.  But because of COVID-19 and supply chain obstacles, this would explain why they were a little  bit lackluster in promoting the pixel five.  Right.  They were a little disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like the dog ate our homework.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They had to put a snapdragon into it at the last minute.  So that, that, that kind of explains, cause there was definitely this lack of energy  around the pixel five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not even excited to have it.  So, I mean, seriously, I'm just like,  it's a phone.  I mean, but phones are pretty utilitarian now for me anyway.  I used to get excited, but who cares now?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should we do a change log?  Cause we're getting close to the end of this program.  It's pretty light this week, according to Maynard G Krebs.  So just a word of warning.  Play the drums.  The Google change log.  Mac rumors rejoices that as soon as Google messages is updated, which should be happening  soon on most Google phones, no longer will you get that kind of pathetic user liked your message.  You'll actually get a happy go lucky thumbs up and emoji reaction.  We're starting to see it already in Google messages.  If you get an iMessage from an Apple user and the entire message anymore, it still does a message,  but it will add the thumbs up.  It'll look a lot more like it looks on the iPhone on the iPhone.  So what these are message reactions.  So I have the message and if I, you know, a lot of times people say, well, see at five,  I don't respond to it.  I just put a thumbs.  I long press it, put a thumbs up on it.  I guess I could, I could give a thumbs up to, I don't know,  my mom saying let's FaceTime now.  She's gonna be, she's gonna be really confused by this.  I'm going to do a thumbs up, right now because she's on an iPhone.  You didn't call me.  Yeah, I know.  Why is this?  You didn't call.  You said we were going to FaceTime.  So I did FaceTime her yesterday, but that's what this message is from.  So there's a little face times right now.  I'd love to meet.  Oh, wouldn't that be funny?  Oh, you haven't met her.  Oh yeah.  Yeah, she's great.  So now it puts that thumbs up on there, which is a way of acknowledging it.  And it used to be on Android messages.  If it was an Android person, they'd see, you know, something like Leo liked your message in text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, what it would do is it would say heart and then it would repeat the entire message.  Oh, it would.  Yeah, it's really irritating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yuck.  So now it's going to have the thumbs up, but it will also pop up,  which is unfortunate, a message saying translated from iPhone.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is really annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google giveth and Google taketh away.  Black Friday deals now live in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia.  These are the deals we actually talked about.  I don't know.  I can't speak to the Australian deals, but some really, really good news.  In fact, I'm very tempted.  We talked about this last week to get this Google Nest speaker because there's $50 off.  The Nest Hub Max, which I really like, is down $50 as well.  So these are all Black Friday deals at the Google Store.  30 bucks, 50 bucks.  I think this is fairly good savings.  Not a lot of Google things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I was kind of sad.  Like had I bought my Pixel and kept it, I would have been like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I took those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I canceled my earbud order since I returned the phone.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They sent me the earbuds before I got the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so then I wasn't allowed to return it when I turned the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Nest audio, which is normally a hundred dollars is down to 60 bucks.  Nest thermostat down to a hundred bucks.  There's some good deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those are some good deals if you want those particular...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wouldn't run out and buy them just because you got to deal with them.  But that's the problem with Black Friday in general.  If you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's like, okay.  Well, no, I'm not going to talk about this.  I've already been made fun of for my slippers.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not making fun of your slippers.  I celebrate your slippers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you had a cult of people following you in little fuzzy leather things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  LL Bean should send us a check for all the slippers they probably sold  because of you.  Yeah.  Google Stadia.  I'm not sure I'd buy into Stadia right at this moment.  Two years old.  They're celebrating with inexpensive or free hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really software and it might brick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if it's free, I guess, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can now buy the Stadia Premier Edition hardware kit,  which actually comes with the Chromecast Ultra, which is good.  And the Stadia controller for just $22.22  because it's their second anniversary.  Or get one free when you purchase a $30 or higher game in the Stadia store  until November 29th.  I'm not sure I could recommend buying Stadia at this point.  It seems like it's struggling a little bit.  And I did do this.  You can pre-order the second generation Pixel Stand.  It won't ship until next month.  I have the old Pixel Stand.  This is $79.  It's designed for the Pixel with a custom stand UI on the screen of your phone.  So you can control audio, adjust smart home devices.  And at the bottom, you can select quiet or performance charging modes.  The stand actually has a fan in it to keep it cool.  Yes.  While it's doing fast charging.  It looks kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it the Pixel 6 doesn't charge at 30 watts?  Yeah, it's 22.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's what you were complaining about, Jeff.  Or no, it was Paul Therot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Paul Therot was complaining about it.  That was one complaint I didn't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he was playing, oh, it takes two whole hours to charge up.  And it's like, oh, gee, however will you live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's kind of a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's long compared to things like the OnePlus, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Super fast.  My Pixel, I was using the Pixel 2 because that's the oldest phone we have.  Well, because there was like a two day lapse between Pixels.  And that thing charged at no time, probably because there wasn't much going on in it.  It's a smaller battery.  It's good though, because the battery is so old.  It was like, you have used me for an hour.  We're back at zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The new Pixel Stand has, and I'm quoting Google here,  approximately 39% recycled materials.  Why would you say approximately and then give such an oddly precise percentage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we're probably wrong about it anyway.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now I'm wondering, well, what is it really?  All right.  I always order these.  You should say we think.  We think.  Something like.  We hope.  Something like would be good.  Yeah, it only goes up to 23 watts for compatible Pixel phones.  That's fast though for wireless charging, which is much slower.  Wireless charging.  Yeah, yeah.  But the wired is not, yeah.  Apparently, you shouldn't buy one of those fancy high wattage charger wall warts  because you won't get the benefit of it on a Pixel, apparently.  And that is the Google change.  Samsung is going to build its factory in.  Taylor, Texas.  Tyler, Texas.  Taylor.  Taylor.  Taylor.  Oh, Taylor's not Tyler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, Tyler's by Dallas.  Taylor's by Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  You know it.  I do.  You know it well.  Actually, that's a good place.  Austin's a tech quarter.  17 billion dollar chip making factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's only like 20 or 30 miles from Samsung's Austin fab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they already have a fab down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a 300 millimeter one where they mix Exynos chips, actually.  It's a good fab.  I wonder what they're going to do in this one.  Probably make 300 millimeter other fancy chips.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our long time sponsor Casper, which had a kind of not a great IPO and the stock's been  going down, they've decided to go private.  They're buying back all their stock.  When it listed, it sold its stock for $10 to share, rising above $15 per share early,  then going down to $3.18 a share.  More recently, they're offering $6.90 a share.  That's a 94% premium to the closing price on November 12th.  I'm rooting for them.  I love my Casper mattresses.  And they were, I think, the first mattress in a box, Casper.  And they were, I think, the first mattress in a box company.  They've been advertising for a long time with us.  The problem is it's got to be a very crowded category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and it's a pretty niche market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you go down the streets of Main Street, USA, any town USA,  you'll see mattress store after mattress store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there must be some money in that.  So people don't buy mattresses.  Apparently, mattresses are somewhat of an impulse purchase for a lot of people.  So they actually design.  There's a whole article on this where you're like, oh, I need to get a mattress.  And then you see one and you're like, I guess today's a good day.  So they try to stagger them so they're easy to act.  They're like McDonald's, right?  You got to be able to enter and exit easily.  They're like a Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to quickly run in and get a mattress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's, I think it's weird, but I sure, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't feel like it should be an impulse purchase, but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, impulse is probably, it's just like, you don't plan to go to the mattress store.  You're like, you need a mattress.  You'll deal with it.  You know, you don't usually break your mattress.  You're just kind of, it's a feeling that grows over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then this guy named Jeff Jarvis put a poll up on Twitter.  He said the New York Times treats the iPhone as a luxury.  I hate to break it to them, but I think many people would say that these days,  a subscription to the Times is a luxury.  It costs you a thousand dollars a year for the New York Times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you go full rate to get home delivery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  That's why I just get the Sunday Times.  The Times itself was saying that what's the real cost of upgrading your phone?  A thousand dollars.  That's what a subscription costs to your time.  With the New York Times, you get a newspaper every day.  But you only get one for one year at that rate.  My phone lasted for four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, very good point.  How's that poll going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's stupid, but I just do it to be obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is more of a necessity, a phone or a newspaper?  Well, clearly a phone.  That's got to be, yeah, a 90% phone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Jeff-  Of course, I stacked the deck in the way I worded the question.  Of course, that's what all the questions do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're being hoisted by your own petard,  because you really want people to buy newspapers, don't you?  That is your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do, but I don't think that attitude is going to get us free.  Well, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But thank you to the New York Times, because they're the only place I saw this obituary  for a rebel who founded Silicon Valley and a name I did not know.  He did not get the credit he deserves.  Jay Last died at the age of 92.  He was one of the seven who left Shockley to form Fairchild Semiconductor.  And look at these guys in their white shirts and their black ties.  Gordon Moore, Sheldon Roberts, Eugene Kleiner, later Kleiner Perkins,  Robert Noyce, Victor Greenwich, Julius Blank,  Gene Herney, and Jay Last on the far right there.  He passed away this week at the age of 92.  Ripe old age.  That's a good age to make it to 92.  One of the founders.  The Trader is Eight, they called them in 1960, when they left Shockley.  Shockley, who invented the transistor,  and then later became a and won a Nobel Prize for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Noyce invented the transistor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, that's interesting.  He shared.  Hold on.  Shockley shared the Nobel Prize for the invention of the transistor.  So I don't know who the other person was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And what did Kirby do?  Jack Kirby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jack Kirby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He did something with transistors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a quick perusal of the Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello, Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say he's an American comic book artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, wait, maybe I'm thinking of saying, okay, hold on.  Kilby?  No.  Oh, oh, that's a spy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Kilby.  Yeah, Philby.  No, that's Philby.  Let's see.  All I know is these guys.  Moore, Roberts, Kleiner, Noyce, Greenwich, Blank, Herney, and Blast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no, Jack Kilby.  Kilby.  Yes, with Robert Noyce, built the first integrated circuit.  And he shared the Nobel Prize with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were at Texas Instruments in 1958 when they, along with Robert Noyce, created  the integrated circuit.  Kilby, we've talked about, because we were talking about last week,  the 50th anniversary of the 4004.  He was the inventor of the handheld calculator.  Yeah, we talked about it.  Oh, that's right.  We talked about Kilby, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, yes, not Kirby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is hard.  Anyway.  Close, close.  We're at that stage where a lot of these original creators are passing on.  Look at this, the Fairchild Semiconductor Lab in 1960.  One computer historian said there was nothing more important than Fairchild Semiconductor  to the Silicon Valley experience, as we know it today.  The Trader of State created transistors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who are those women in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're the ones really doing the work, right?  Only women are clean enough to be in our lab.  The guys are out there smoking cigarettes, like, waiting for the baby to be born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want a gif of that eye roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah.  With Dr. Last's death, Gordon Moore is the last surviving member.  Of the Traderous Eight.  Of course, he was the creator of Moore's Law.  Which we are still kind of true.  Although rapidly wearing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we're kind of, we're at the, I don't care what the freaking...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The number of transistors on a processor will double every 18 months.  Now, I have to say the new Apple M1 chip is more than just a processor,  but it has 57 billion transistors.  I don't know, are we going to see 114 billion transistor processor in a year and a half?  Does it matter?  Not at this point, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  All right.  Oh, should we mention Gordon, I mean, Rupert taking a swing at Google and Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just more of the same, but yeah.  It's just another week, another swing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  Are you watching Succession?  Hell yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I am.  I finally started, it's still not as, it's okay.  I don't love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, when you get to last week's episode, which is three years and six episodes in,  two years and six episodes in, you will see...  I'm most of the way through it.  The current episode is the payoff for the entire two and a half years.  It is the best episode of television I've ever seen.  Wow, I've only started.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got 20 minutes left.  I was kind of like, ugh, I'm just so sick of them still.  People hate them because they're all awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I know there are these periods where it's like,  you're still worried about the shareholders meeting?  Come on, get off it.  But this most recent one where they're picking the next president,  and that's what made me think of Rupert Murdoch, is fascinating.  And it's got some of the most, the funniest, most trenchant writing in television ever.  Jesse Armstrong is a genius.  It's fantastic.  In fact, I've watched it twice now and I'm still missing bits of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tend to watch now the episodes twice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in the Succession TV Reddit, they say turn on the closed captions  because whoever's writing the closed captions  catches all the little soto voce slights and jabs that you don't even hear.  And so it's like a third script.  You got to watch it twice then watch it a third time with the captions turned on.  It's really wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We watch everything with the captions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Because I got a kid.  Yeah.  Because, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Shiv and her husband, do you get that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom Wamsgans.  Shiv's Midwestern long tall drink of water is rapidly becoming my pick for the Emmy Award.  The actor who's British, he and Greg, Cousin Greg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, and Shiv is Australian.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you, Tom Wamsgans is my absolute favorite.  The actor is Matthew McFadden.  And he, I'm telling you, season three, episode six, just hold your horses till you get there  and watch his expressions, watch his, listen to his lines.  There is some of the, I don't want to, no spoilers,  but some of the best writing on TV.  It's incredible.  I just, it blows me away.  Aaron Sorkin times 10.  Oh, well that's not hard.  I know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Early Sorkin, I mean the West Wing was great.  Early Sorkin, West Bridge, West Wing was great.  West Wing was great, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like early Sorkin, even better.  Okay.  Even better.  You will love some of the lines in there.  You will just love it.  And it really does remind you of Murdoch.  The hero of succession is Logan Roy, who's a Scottish entrepreneur who started a media empire,  which includes a TV network called ATN that has certain resemblance to some network that  is very popular right now.  And ATN is so important, so powerful.  Basically, he gets to pick the next president, having destroyed the current president.  I just wish I could remember some of the lines.  They're so good.  Anyway, I don't want to spoil it.  Enjoy.  Let us take a break and then come back because you too, I forgot to mention Sam was here.  You may have said, well, where's, where's, where's Ant Pruitt?  Well, he's on vacation because it's Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he said it last week.  We should have said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.  I should have mentioned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He did say it last week.  He said he'd be sitting on the couch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope he's not watching.  Hi Ant.  Hope he's enjoying some South Carolina hospitality.  Our show today brought to you by Andela.  Oh, when I talked to these guys, I just got it.  I thought this is so great.  They're a global talent network with a mission to connect brilliance to opportunity.  Brilliance is global, but opportunity isn't.  And you will find there are some tech talent out there.  So good.  So good.  Andela gives them the opportunities.  Look, your company these days is expected to move faster than ever before  to stay ahead of the competition.  But how do you find the time to both build and onboard an amazing engineering team  that'll get you where you need to go?  This is where Andela can help.  They are the world's first talent network connecting innovative companies like yours  with top tier vetted engineers.  So you have more time to focus on your core business.  They use expert technical recruiters, proprietary matching algorithms.  They connect you with developers who are the best in the business,  enabling you to accelerate productivity, drive revenue, scale your business.  And I mean, the bottom line is brilliance is evenly distributed, but opportunity isn't.  And there are very talented people who are dying to work for you.  Andela finds them with a rigorous vetting process, which means it's easy for you.  Their hiring process is quick and efficient for you,  but they maintain the highest quality of mission standards.  So you're getting top quality engineers.  Global talent too, at your fingertips.  Companies that limit themselves to hiring locally are at a severe disadvantage.  With Andela, you could tap into their pool of highly qualified talent from around the world,  cut your hiring timelines down from months to days.  And the ramp up times are very efficient.  Companies obviously have to do more with less these days, justify ROI consistently.  When you hire Andela engineers, you can expect they'll be efficiently onboarded,  ready to deliver value for your team within days.  And these engineers, by the way, are not just part-time support.  They're fully embedded into your organization.  And they arrange it so there's at least five hours of overlapping working hours.  So it's not like, oh, they're working at night, you're working in the day.  No, there'll be at least five hours of overlap.  I'll give you an example.  A company called Mindshare, you might know, partnered with Andela to hire 10 new  digital experts, including, I mean, top of the line data scientists,  machine learning specialists, analysts, developers,  the executive director and head of business intelligence at Mindshare says,  as we continue to enhance the Synapse platform, time to value is very important.  Andela is a good partner in helping us identify the right talent  that is fit for different purposes.  It's time to tap into a wider talent pool.  Stop competing with a major tech company.  Spend less time interviewing.  You're going to find amazing talent through Andela.  Go to Andela.com.  For dash companies to schedule a complimentary consultation  and get a two week no risk trial with their vetted technical talent.  You can actually try them for two weeks and Della.com.  Slash for dash companies.  Andela.com slash for dash companies.  Do use that though so they know you saw it here.  Very important.  And you see at the bottom of the screen, if you go to the website,  all the companies that use Andela talent, including Casper, by the way,  and others of our sponsors like Jamf, Andela is really doing something remarkable.  And as you look into it, I think you'll see what a great boon this is both to your company  and to the engineers and the talent from all over the world.  They're giving a chance to Andela.com slash for dash companies.  It's time for Stacey's pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I just learned about pie caking, but that's not actually my pick.  Pie caking? What's pie caking?  Is it cake and pie?  It's a pie baked in a cake.  So really it looks more like the pie filling baked into the cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, what crust inside a cake would be a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, look at that.  That's a pumpkin pie inside a cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's old.  Yeah. So, I mean, given the holiday, you know what?  I'm going to make that my pick and keep my device the next.  Keep that device. Make some pie caking.  Conserve it.  Because, man, I don't have time to bake it for Thanksgiving, but now I got to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kelly Ripa said pie caking is pretty much the greatest thing  that's happened to me besides the birth of my children.  Look at this one from Goldbelly.  It's too late to get it for Thanksgiving, but what is that?  Pecan pie? Pumpkin pie?  Yeah. And what's the top?  It's the Turducken of cakes.  The epic four-in-one layered dessert led to a pumpkin puree shortage in New York when it  was invented in 2014, created by renowned pastry chef Zach Young, the pie cakin.  It's a favorite of celebrities.  And this is actually, I guess Goldbelly is selling Zach Young's pie cakin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  99 bucks for a cake.  Well, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're getting pie with it.  But it's cake and pie.  And it's coming in the mail.  Yeah. I wish they'd tell me what kind of pies are in this pie cakin.  I see the pumpkin. Looks like a spice cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that a pecan at the bottom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looks like pecan and looks like there's apple pie on the top.  Man, that looks good. Pie cakin.  Yeah. So that's my pick now.  Wow. Goldbelly has a whole pie cakin bake shop.  There's also a Christmas pie cakin.  That looks like red velvet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That looks like a heck of a lot of food coloring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do you make red velvet?  So you're welcome, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The red is not red dye number three unless you're taking a shortcut.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Red velvet cake is cocoa powder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Cocoa powder interacts with the baking soda, the alkalinity of the baking soda and  the cocoa powder interact to create a red kind of a thing.  Oh, science. You gotta love science.  Oh, this one, they tell you what's in the Christmas pie cakin.  Pecan pie, eggnog cheesecake and red velvet cake layered together with amaretto buttercream  and topped with a sweet and tart cherry pie filling.  Oh, that's a heart of take in a cake. Heart of take, we call it.  The shipping's free.  Yeah, for 99 bucks.  Can I order some marijuana?  I love it. They offer four interest-free payments of $24.75.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop paying off that cake from Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take out a loan for that pie cakin.  Mr. Jarvis, how about a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got all crappy ones this week, but I might as well go with the Thanksgiving thing with the  now traditional Google search Thanksgiving casserole, which tells me I have to leave  my state because I hate broccoli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. I'm trying to unpack this. This is basically side dishes by state. Is that right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The search resists. Yes. My other favorite here, so New Jersey is broccoli, along with New York  and Massachusetts. The amazing one is that the side dish casserole in Pennsylvania is  leftovers, which kind of seems like a time machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leftovers.  Trying to figure that out.  It's a nice covered dish. California, they say Mexican corn. Now, this is not just made up like,  oh, you're California, you must like Mexican corn. This is actual Google searches.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's differentiated. Most people in California probably search for stuffing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is casseroles. They call it uniquely searched Thanksgiving casserole. I guess you'd  have to say Thanksgiving casserole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. What happens is they look at like, most people in California probably serve stuffing,  but the most weird search thing that people search from California is Mexican corn.  But is stuffing a casserole?  It can be.  I just use that because everyone's stuff, sweet potato casserole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whichever.  Oh, so mac and cheese here. You know what I had today?  What?  I went to Popeyes because I had to try the Popeyes.  Oh, they're advertising the mac and cheese. Is it good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it cheesy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cheese-a-licious.  Cheese-a-licious. Yeah, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had at the fanciest restaurant in Petaluma the other night. We love this.  Central Market. I had cacio e pepe with bucatini pasta. It was fantastic.  They do a good microwave there?  Straight from TJ's.  No, I have a feeling they made it from scratch. I'm just saying.  I don't, you know what?  I think I might have that tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I might have it tonight.  It's cacio e pepe night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On top of Popeyes though, that could be very bad for me.  Wow.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is that the chief attribute of Popeyes mac and cheese is cheese?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they also, it comes in your basic fast food cardboard thing,  but somehow they get a baked crust on it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, probably they bake it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say there's a broiler.  So I mean, broilers, you can just stick it under there for like 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Broil it. Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I should have come, I came empty handed to this party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've been doing that for months. You have not played along with this.  Well, I'll be frank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Usually I have a pick and then I wait and see how long the show has gone.  And I stop myself. I mean, I have picks, but nothing I'm really crazy about.  I've forgotten a lot of them, but almost every week, Jason will back me up.  Almost every week I have a pick.  I put it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whereas I'm like sticking mine in at the last minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I just, I want to take a back seat to the brilliant people who are on this show with me.  And I, oh yeah. Nice try.  No, no, I do. Thank you very much.  That is what I am thankful for is the great people I get to work with each and every week  on shows like this, not necessarily this, but like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am grateful for both of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Knowing you, Jeff, all these years has been a great pleasure.  I just, I think the world of you and Stacy, I know it feels like, I mean,  you've been here years, but it feels like you're the new kid.  You're just fantastic. You had so much to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was what a blessing to have gotten you to know kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had big shoes to fill. Gina Trapani was a legend.  Pretty awesome.  But you have absolutely done it and we thank you so much.  I do have big feet.  Do you? I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wear a size 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. My husband and I have the same size shoe.  Wow. I'm tall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where do you get your slippers?  On that note, Stacy, you can buy them.  Do they make them that big there at LL Bean, Stacy?  You buy the men's wicked good slippers? I bet you do.  Stacy on iot.com. You should listen to her podcast with Kevin Topol.  Subscribe to her newsletter and of course check out the events.  There's always something interesting going on at Stacy on iot.com.  Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the  Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.  Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig Newmark.  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  I think for Christmas I am going to buy you the official chorale version of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Buy it for Craig.  Just for variety, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And share it with Craig because he did inspire the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  We do this week in Google every Wednesday at 2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern, 2200 UTC.  I say that because you can watch us make it live at live.twit.tv.  If you're watching live, chat live at irc.twit.tv or in our ClubTwit Discord,  which is always great fun.  They're fabulous with the animated GIFs and all sorts of other things.  If you want to join ClubTwit, it's seven bucks a month.  You get ad free versions of all of our shows, access to the Discord.  Stacey's book group I hear went really well.  Actually, we should, are you having a poll?  We blew out the room, man.  Yeah, we had overflow.  We figured out how to get more people in next time.  And you're still trying to decide what book.  You're not going to do Murderbots 2 for the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, we want to open you up to more worlds.  So there's a poll.  Yeah, I think we've got a week.  It's a week long poll.  So it's between Autonomous, Ken Lu's latest book of short stories,  Autonomous is by Annaleigh Newitz and then Ancillary Justice by Ann Lickey.  And then whatever the, I don't think anyone's voted for it.  So whatever the Ken Lu book is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you're in the club, go to the ClubTweet events channel in the Discord.  And there's a link there, the Stacey Higginbotham Book Club Vote on the Next Book.  It's a little complicated.  The way you vote is by clicking.  I don't know.  What do you do?  You click a link.  You're going down.  Is it the bottom?  I'm trying to get there.  All the way to the very, very bottom of the conversation.  Oh my God.  It's very long.  Well, it just shows you there was a severe demand for this.  Holy crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Y'all, we had a lot of fun.  I'm trying to find that.  Can you just search Autonomous and then maybe we'll get there?  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Click on the numbers at the bottom.  There it is.  I'm completely, you know what?  We got to come up with a better way to do this.  Keep going up.  Yeah.  To the top?  The middle?  All right.  Forget it.  This is not going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you go...  Okay.  If you search Autonomous...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There it is.  I got it.  It was a DinoBot poll, but it's stuck in the middle of the thing.  I don't even know how you find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So right now we've got 16 votes for Autonomous by Annalee Newitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We interviewed her, by the way, about the book on triangulation.  So she's great.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ancillary Justice has seven votes and The Hidden Girl and Other Stories by Ken Liu has five votes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now we know that this poll is here.  We have no way to find it.  I encourage you, if you can find it, vote.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think if you start here, try searching for Lekki.  L-E-K-I-E.  That's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I'm all clear what to search for.  Can you say it again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  L-E-K-K-I-E.  That works.  That works.  So there it is on the right under L-E-K-K-I-E.  Or Annalee Newitz.  You probably could find it with Newitz or Ken Liu, The Hidden Girl.  I just like that name.  I want to try that.  Anyway, there's three choices.  The next...  Oh, you can't vote on this?  You just...  Yeah, you can vote.  Yeah.  Oh.  I see what you're saying.  I haven't found the right thing.  Yeah.  So you click...  Then you click the search result.  It'll take you that part.  And then you click the icon at the bottom.  Jesus.  Could this get more confusing?  Wait until you try to unsubscribe to Club Twitter.  Then you're going to have some fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't require a phone call, but you have to juggle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we actually make it easy.  If you want to know more, go to www.twit.tv slash clubtwit.  I think this was possibly the worst ad we've ever done for Club Twitter.  It makes me want to quit, to be honest with you.  You get ad free versus all the shows.  Access to this...  Go ahead.  The Twist Plus Feed.  It's too much fun watching Leo screw up.  Which includes...  That alone is the reason to be there.  ...worth the price of admission.  And you do get things like the Stacey Book Club,  which is actually on the Twitter Plus Feed.  We're going to do Steve Gibson soon.  Mary Jo Foley is next week.  Ask me anything.  So there's lots of great events inside the club.  I think it's well worth your seven bucks, but I'm a little biased.  If you don't want to pay, it's fine too.  We have ad supported versions of everything we do.  You can get those at our website, twit.tv slash twig.  Or you can even subscribe in your favorite podcast client  and you can get it automatically.  And if you will, if you like the show,  please leave us a nice five-star review.  If you don't like the show, just please forget about it.  But if you like the show, five-star review would be very helpful.  We want to spread the word about the goodness that is this week in Google.  Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.  What are you doing for Thanksgiving, Jeff?  Anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My father is here.  So Jake is coming down and it's good.  The family's together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to have about 10 people.  Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.  We're doing a ham and steak and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Grilling or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to smoke the ham and I'm going to grill the steak,  sous vide and then grill the steak, making popovers, which I just love.  Oh, I know.  I got two 12-cup popover trays.  So I'll make 12 popovers.  Oh, I was wondering if you had the popover.  Oh, you have to.  Yeah, it's part of the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, I don't think you said, when I asked you the early part of the show,  what are you making?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I'm making chicken, green beans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, that you said, green beans.  Okay.  Gluten-free green beans, which is one of the things people search for,  or gluteny green beans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How can you get gluten in a green bean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know, but that's a specific search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could coat them in flour and fry them.  That's not a good idea.  Fried green beans are actually really good.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're quite a bit of a dip in ranch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that does sound good, actually.  I make mine with slivered almonds and then I sprinkle a little crispy onions on the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do them in ginger and garlic.  Oh, that sounds good.  Yeah, sprinkle sesame seeds on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My heritage, my hillbilly heritage is to cook green beans, believe it or not,  cook green beans.  We don't do this because my wife would kill me.  Well, no, ham hocks for like five hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I had any ham hocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'd fall apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But none of this crisp stuff.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no, they're so good when they're all crispy and like flash fried.  Oh, I've got a blanch to the green beans.  Oh, God, quick, get going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Green beans, I got a blanch too.  I'm doing that tonight too.  I'm making the popover dough and I'm making a German chocolate cake  because I won't have time tomorrow.  So got some work to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I am so jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I make a hell of a German chocolate cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, I don't care if you invite me to your house when I'm in California.  It's so surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only problem is because that icing, that is sweet,  but I'm making a double boiler with condensed milk and if I want to make it less sweet,  I put in pecans and shredded coconut.  The recipe calls for sweetened.  I use the best foods recipe for the icing,  but I use a listener's recipe for the chocolate cake,  which has a little bit of coffee in it to give it a nice little kick.  It's very delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you making the world's best mashed potatoes tomorrow?  Yes.  In my thermo mix.  Can't have them.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm making the New York Times mashed potatoes because I have never mastered mashed potatoes.  Nice thermo mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how it does it, but it really whips them  because it's kind of like a blender in there.  There's never any lumps.  It's very creamy.  The only problem is it's also sticky.  They're very, you need a lot of butter to make it go down.  It's good.  It's really good.  When you come over, we'll do thermo mix mania.  We'll do it all.  It'll be fun.  I love it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll shoot the show from your kitchen with Stacy playing with the thermo mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll get my son to come over to chop things really fast.  It'll be great.  It'll be great.  Actually, you are all going to get a holiday gift from my son this year.  So stay tuned.  He's got a new product line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Salty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little salty.  Yes.  Salt Hank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Salt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He already has it.  How quickly did he do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The speed with which this is all happening is kind of mind boggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shouldn't Sam Lesson invest in him?  Yeah.  Did you pitch Salt Hank to Sam Lesson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm staying out of it.  He's already signed a deal with DBA.  They're managing his sales.  He's got this salt deal.  You got to see his logo.  It's the cutest thing.  Let me see if I can find it here.  It's on my phone, so I don't know if I can blow it up enough for you to see it.  But I told him he's the next Chef Boyardee.  There's Salt Hank's logo for the Salt Hank.  Essential flaky sea salt.  There's the Calabrian pesto.  There's a truffle salt in here.  There it is.  It's going to be good.  It's going to be good.  Truffle and garlic and all of it featuring...  Salt Hank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Salt Hank.  Where did the moniker come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he used to be Sodium Deficiency, which wasn't the catchiest name ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's like a band name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what I love about it.  It's all been unconscious and just doing what he really loves.  And it's somehow kind of magically manifested.  Tweet was like that too in the early days.  It just kind of all came together.  Sometimes if you do something you're really passionate about it.  And it's just like you're doing what you love it.  The universe gets together.  It's a beautiful thing.  It's a beautiful thing.  Yeah.  Calls for Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you want to end the show, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I probably should wind this show up.  Thank you everybody.  John wants to go home.  Have a wonderful Thanksgiving.  We'll see you next week.  Actually, I'll see you on Saturday and we'll see you all next week on This Week in Google.  Bye-bye.
