She's in Seattle for Microsoft's build developer conference. Jeff Jarvis is at Google I.O  He'll join us from the press tent and Kevin Tofel of about Chromebooks.com. It's all coming up next on Twig

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Netcast you love from people you trust

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Twig. Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by Cashfly  C-A-C-H-E  FLY.com  This is Twig this week in Google episode 456 recorded Tuesday May 8th  2018 all the good stuff at Google I.O.  This week in Google is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans. Home plays a big role in your life  That's why Quicken Loans created Rocket Mortgage  It lets you apply simply and understand the entire mortgage process fully so you can be confident  You're getting the right mortgage for you get started at rocket mortgage.com slash twig  It's time for Twig this week in Google the show we cover the latest news from Google and there is a lot of news from Google  Today it's in fact not just from Google from everybody because developer conferences are going on simultaneously  That's why Stacey Higginbotham  We've we've sent her to Seattle to cover Microsoft's build for Stacey on IOT.com. Hi Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hello, I actually sat next to your Windows weekly people the other day. They told me they said it we met Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We crossed the streams  Indeed how nice  How nice so you're I take it you're there mostly because of the IOT any IOT announcements Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a big year for IOT for them. I'm sure you guys covered it yesterday, but a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I would love to hear more AI on IOT which is combining not one but two buzzwords

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  two acronyms

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two kind of meaningless buzzwords in one it's amazing now we sent Jeff  to  Mountain View because he's at Google I Oh Jeff Jarvis from Buzz Machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At the at the press tent which is noisy and I'll mute and not know what I'm talking but here we are  Journalists. Hello. Hello. Say people people. Hello. Look at that good-looking bunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's nice. I love it that Google does their events and I bet Stacey you're a little jealous. They didn't do their events at Shoreline  It's outside the weather's beautiful. In fact, I don't know if you knew Jeff, but all through the keynote  We heard bird song

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were their birds flying around, you know Sundar and all over like I'm wondering if was gonna land on the stage or poop

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also joining us we've assigned him to his own home base  Kevin Toffle  From by the way, Kevin, of course is Stacey's partner on the IOT podcast, but he has a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Enterprise he started last month about Chromebooks.com. Hi Kevin. Howdy. Howdy. Yeah. Thanks for sending me to my home office  I appreciate that  We're saving on the expenses today said anybody anywhere, but I'm pretending

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That we assigned people to these to these events  So but Kevin it's great to have you it's great to have all three of you here to talk about it  And I think this show we will if you wish talk about other things and I'm sure there's lots to talk about  In fact, I've been following your writing of and as posts about crustini  Which unfortunately Google did not announce at all  I they didn't say anything about Chrome OS and it's my guess that they may be doing that at another keynote  There's one starting in a little bit on for developers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is the developer keynote starts in  16 minutes so I'm gonna kind of cheat and watch it muted next to me because I want to see all the Chromebook stuff  maybe some Android things for me and Stacey on the IOT podcast and and  whatever else they want to talk about if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you have you know if something breaks you can just jump in and say hey they just announced something but but briefly  Because I know Jeff will be interested in this. He's a Chromebook user. I am too. I have the new pixel book  What is crustini?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cristini is a project that Google has been working on and we should see it on at least the pixel book with other devices to follow  In the next I'll say  Three to six weeks if you're on the developer channel, you can enable project crustini  what it is is it actually runs a container a separate sandbox container on your Chromebook and  It runs a full version of Linux and what that does is it helps bridge the the remaining app gap because we have Android app  Support now, but if you want to develop apps or do something else where an Android app isn't gonna cut it  You can run full Linux apps on your Chromebook  There's no security issue involved there because it's not you're not in developer mode you're actually running regular Chrome OS  Google's work really hard to make it seamless safe  I've already installed Android studios to developers if you use an IDE to create anything  Any kind of apps you can do that or we'll be able to do that soon on the pixel book  With other pic are there Chromebooks to follow as they continue to evolve that I love this idea because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, can you choose your Linux as you can with by the way apparently Google developers have a taste for toasted bread products because  crouton which is precedes crustini allowed you to using cheroot and and  defeating the secure boot  Install Linux a real Linux any version of Linux on your Chromebook. Does this is this any version of Linux or is it kind of?  A special version. How does it work? It's it comes with Debbie and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very nice. Yeah, they may they may change that but for now, it's Debbie and and I'm happy with that. That's that's that's a great choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So could you could you do anything you could do a Linux in that sandbox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Correct. Correct. You can you get a Linux terminal that works just the same as regular Linux  Wow, and install whatever packages you'd like from wherever you want that, you know that are supported  They don't have graphics or GPU acceleration yet  So don't get excited about if you play games on Steam that does work you can install it but the frame rates are terrible  They're working on that. And again, this is the kind of stuff  I've been tracking over it about Chromebooks now for the past month and really excited about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you use a GUI or is it is it so slow that it's not even no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I don't see any way to enable a GUI and to be honest  I don't think that would be a good idea because you really want to use interfaces, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Already have a GUI so just make it so the apps the Linux apps are really a window on top of Chrome OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I muted now or not you're not  So Kevin does it does it does it affect the overall operation of the Chromebook pixel? I mean is it  Is it taking up too much memory, you know too many tabs open you notice any other impact of running that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's that's a great question Jeff  I haven't really seen any impact and I've been monitoring some of the hardware resources doing this  But I don't want to I don't want to say too much because I suspect Google has not yet optimized for performance yet  Especially because it's only in the depth depth channel  I would say though you're not gonna want to you know  Spend $250 on a Chromebook and expect to do this and have it done  Well, you're gonna want gobs of memory and storage and so on and a good CPU to be on now for the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Time I'm sorry. I didn't get the high-end pixel book  I got the entry-level pixel book and I wish I had the faster processor and more RAM  That would that be nice, huh?  We'll talk more about that and Kevin if they say anything during the developer keynote that you want to jump in with please  Don't hesitate but obviously the big story this week  On this week in Google is Google I O and the keynote which just wrapped up minutes ago and  Started off with Sundar Pichai making a joke. I thought it was pretty funny. Actually the big the big  Emoji snafu at Google. He did say, you know, we got the cheeseburger wrong, but I got to say I'm a vegetarian  So I didn't know they fixed it put the cheese on top  But then he said I don't understand why the beer the foam was floating on the beer in our emoji  But we have fixed that as well  But he did it with good humor and I thought that was a great way to kick the keynote off

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would have rather that he kicked it off like such a kicked off build yesterday with a  nice little thing about ethics and privacy and actually pro GDPR kind of stuff, but yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounded like center was getting was going to yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right and what he was headed there because you think of you know Facebook had to do the  confession of sins and penance maya copas right and and and and  Microsoft did that and they never really one of the Europeans here  So they never mentioned privacy and with all these new features and all these new ways things gonna listen to you all the time  It is an issue and it would have been nice if they'd mentioned it more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It actually almost felt like with some of the features they talked about that Google was  Doing the opposite was saying look  We know a lot about you and we're going to make sure that we take advantage of that to surface useful tools  For you  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fairness they they didn't mention privacy specifically  But if you heard the right buzzwords they sort of did because when they talked about a lot of the features we're going to discuss  With machine learning they said this is either on device or this is on device and cloud with TPU  So when they say on device that lends itself to some aspect of privacy, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure that's why they're doing it. Although they didn't really even  They didn't really even acknowledge that they just it was more it sounded like more about performance and they were actually very interested I think to  Talk about the hybrid  They're even doing it on the self-driving vehicles a hybrid of having some intelligence on the device or on the car and still using  The cloud and GP and TPU to to add more  Smarts, which I think is not a bad way to go. It's a little scary in a car if you're if you lose your connection  I hope the car doesn't drive into a wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you have to plant that's why they have to add that intelligence at the the edge because connections and cars are right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  variable  All right. Well, let's see. I guess we could just go in order you do want to go in chronological order might as well  They did it's funny because Microsoft yesterday talked about  diabetic retinopathy and you would think this is like the the the  Illness of the moment because so did Sundar Pichai  predicting  Cardiovascular risk using your retina and really what it's about is machine learning. In fact, it can go beyond that it can actually  Using your retina do a lot more and I guess this I wonder if this ties into the live online  Times into the lively stuff they're doing with those smart contact lenses. I don't know. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Assume it's because they have an amazing database of training data, right?  So, I mean if you've been doing contact lens studies, for example, I bet you have a lot of pictures of retinas

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He showed the demo  We've showed actually on the show of multiple people talking at once and the AI's ability to distinguish the different voices  Funnily enough so that's in our Pichai yesterday  You know, this is a problem because the overlapping keynotes don't give them a chance to change  Oh, wait, wait, you keep saying Sundar Pichai, but I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it's not genitalia. Yes, you're me. Sorry SN not SP. Sorry. Yes, I apologize

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there wasn't I mean, did you notice that Stacy having been at the build a keynote yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are obviously big overlaps  machine learning at the edge bringing AI everywhere and the reason is because all of these companies have to  Find a way to adapt their business model to a world that doesn't have screens  Where you're gonna have to basically you're going to need an operating system that runs in the cloud on device  And mediate somewhere in a in a middle point, right a third place  So what is that going to look like? You know, I bet it's Google Kubernetes is kind of the sense here  but how do you  how do you adapt your business model to  Handle this Microsoft is betting on services that it pulls down from these  Google is betting on Kubernetes and  It's machine learning to just make better end consumer products. So, you know, we'll see  Yeah, they showed I thought a very heartwarming

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  segment about a  Young woman who is a developer, but also it looked like she had cerebral palsy. She had some sort of movement issues  Using G board and an Android phone and Morse code they've added Morse code to Google's  Keyboard for Android G board so she could use her head stick to communicate  That was really amazing. It was really touching. But what was the point Leo that it could predict the words better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  Was the machine learning part of the bus because the Morse code she could you know do every word she could  Part of the bus because the Morse code she could you know do every word if you wanted to write  But it seemed to be that it was predictive of the words  Which we'll get to in a minute about other get better at that  And is that how it worked? I couldn't tell what the ML part was. Well, that's an interesting point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah must have been that there was some  prediction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think it was the audio autocomplete the fact that they added Morse code  Understanding was one piece of it to G board  But then the autocomplete feature which is ML based and then that led into the  Gmail the new Gmail composition where it completes the sentences for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's been sending a lot of emails  To google employees much to their dismay about taco tuesday and stuff. That was a cool demo you hit tab  here's the the animated gif from uh  From uh, and gadgets website you hit tab and it will kind of guess what the not just the next word  But the rest of the sentence would say so you type let's and it would say do you mean get together soon?  And would and you hit tab and it would type that in  I don't have it yet in my gmail. So I can't vouch for how accurate it is, but it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As with all these demos very impressive on stage. Is it learning would it learn custom to you as well?  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seemed to i'll tell you why I think so because he typed taco tuesdays  In the subject and it did suggest after let's get together  It suggested four tacos  So it's clearly looking at what's going on and and and adding

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And stacy to answer the the question of personalization. You can start to type your home address or that's right  You know your phone number it filled it out. It has that information. It literally starts to auto fill that for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it knows it's you yeah, but i think stacy's also asking about the kind of grammar you use or other things  I always get freaked in the auto auto answer that it uses somebody exclamation points and I think I don't you have any exclamation points

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't see it's perfect for me. Jeff. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey and I are big on explanation. I find myself looking back at my email saying I have  I I have an exclamation point in every sentence. I really should pick and choose here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I talked to somebody the other day who said she dated a yale guy and he said  You should use only three exclamation points in life and i've used one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. However  Nowadays in modern communication. You don't have as many ways to show nuance  an exclamation point is one way to  Say go up at the end of the sentence, I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so I happen to be sitting next to a brilliant, uh journalist from a swiss newspaper during during the  the entire keynote and  It was really interesting to see the keynote from european's eyes  Because you see things like that auto complete and you and I say, oh, that's cool. It knows what it's in my brain  It was what i'm gonna say and the europeans are saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  It's in my brain. It knows what i'm gonna say  Uh, yeah, so does anybody here have it? I have the new gmail  I think everybody does but uh or can if they go to the settings

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't know what's up. Casey and I got a lot of twitter instructions from many people about how to set it up  Is he sweet? But yes, we do finally

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't have the auto complete yet, right or do you? No, I don't  Almost almost everything they talked about  Uh is rolling out in the next few weeks  Uh, except for one thing that I know jeff's gonna want to talk a lot about but let's let's we're gonna we're gonna hold off  on google news  Because I want to do this in chronological order as if you're watching the keynote live

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and now you're gonna hear in the background they have sound up for the other keynotes. So good  Great a lot, but i'll keep what's up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should mention that jeff is in the press tent. Uh, that's the that's where he's able to get the best bandwidth  Uh, and and uh, it's it's fine. I don't mind  He's just muting himself when he doesn't have anything to say so if it gets noisy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Many people wish I would do this more often. Yes, I know  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We do get a nice it's a nice indicator that you're about ready to talk  So the late it helps with latency issues doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that stacey on the other hand is in some sort of weird microsoft sound proof booth

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is not soundproof. I'm hoping that you guys like they didn't have any real setups for this  So there's like every now and then you hear the hand dryer from the bathroom go off because it's one of those big dice  And it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I like and I want to make this a trend, uh  Completely parenthetically. I was in japan as you know in japan on vacation last couple weeks, by the way. Thank you  Jason howell for filling in for me while I was gone  They don't have paper towels in the men's room or I presume the women's room all I didn't check  Uh, they do have sometimes blowers, but most of the time nothing  Yes, and and the expectation is well, you have your little handkerchief your pocket towel

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. You've got to bring your own towel. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I just ordered 14 handkerchiefs online  Because that's brilliant. I'm not going to use paper towels anymore at all. I think this is  This could change the world save the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you believe that the uh hand dryers in fact blow fecal matter onto your hand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a belief. I think it's a fact you only dry your hands though after you've washed them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why is there still fecal matter? The fecal matter is in the bathroom  And the dryer is sucking in air

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And blowing it on your hands. Oh my god, you guys just go live in your bubble. It's gonna be fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's gonna be this is why this is why I don't use the bathroom outside of the house

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's erotic weekly I don't I I there was a study there have been several studies that say it's actually doing that  Uh, I don't know if those dyson blade dryers do that  But uh, certainly the old-fashioned hand dryers, which don't work anyway  Uh, uh, that's what those tests were on but again your pocket hanky bring it with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I I think this is brilliant. I was really I watched a man yesterday who sat next to me  Blow his nose on his pocket hanky a couple times and then pull off his glasses stare speculatively  And then i'm like he's not gonna do it he's not doing it and then he did it he wiped his glasses

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there is the clean corner versus the dirty corner. I was done

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One for each pocket clean and dirty you knew he was gonna do that and you didn't get video

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did not I didn't want to keep that but yeah google photos has some new we'll have in the next few weeks  in the coming weeks  Some new features including what I really what I was really impressed with a colorized feature  Where you could take old family photos?  and turn them into color photos as well as  A feature that will turn a photo black and white except for a certain region  These are you know, there's third-party tools that will do all these things  But this is built into photos, which is nice. There's a suggested actions  Which will kind of say hey, we could make this better this way  Uh, they they pitched the sharing feature which they pitched last year again  I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they I don't know. Maybe it works better now. I don't know  Um, if the picture is too dark ai will recommend brightening it if it spots a document I love this  It will convert it to pdf  And uh, that is really cool and lens i'm jumping a little bit ahead because lens was a little later  But lens will also allow you if you take a picture of text to copy the text and  And paste it  Even though it's a picture of text

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I I had a question about this because didn't google last year say they were going to like remove weird stuff from your photos like  fences and  Trees growing out of people's heads or something like that. They had it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I you know, they uh, one of the things they did say and they have done is if it sees receipts  And things that you aren't really photos. You're just keeping track of it a little offer to archive those and it does yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That does happen but it never offered because I was really excited about taking oh, I know what you're talking about power lines and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they had a picture. They showed a kid playing baseball in little league and there was a fence over it. Wait a minute  What's happening here? Something strange has happened. Jeff's hair seems to have fallen out. Oh, no, it's  Wait a minute she's muted muted  Jeff has to push push the button

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, hello everybody welcome to google.io nice to see you. Are you just said sit down put this on i'm like, okay  Are you are you having fun?  Of course I am. It's pretty awesome  Uh, you know, it's it's kind of like the big playground for developers  This is definitely the most playground feeling conference if you're a developer ever so google knows how to do this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, since we've got you what was your favorite thing they talked about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think honestly so far, you know, I find the news are a little mad  But I do feel like the android p features they went went through are pretty exciting  And uh some of the lens stuff like being able to select text. Yeah, right. Wasn't that a mess wasn't it amazing?  Yeah, and then you know google maps like ar and google maps this visual positioning system they talked about I think is uh, yeah  It's pretty awesome. Um, there's definitely some good stuff here. I kind of felt the way most stuff is a little bit overconfident  You know, but the most autonomous car stuff is I mean, you know, i'm a big supporter of it  But at the same time, you know as a journalist have to kind of do diligence, right?  But um, yeah, I think it's been so far good. I oh there's a developer a keynote going on  I'm checking that out right now. And so yeah, jeff put me on the spot, but here I am  So, um, i'm gonna give it back to him and you guys can nice to see you tank girl. Miriam joir

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Host of the mobile tech podcast great to great to have you have fun at i.o  Bye-bye  so, uh  That took us takes us a little bit out of chronology, but i'm gonna be anal and put us back in the  In the chronology  So those are google photos features, uh, then let's see taco tuesday, uh  Google assistant actually there was some really a lot of sizzle in this keynote and as always some of this sizzle  Will not emerge or will emerge much later, but there was some interesting stuff with assisted that I look forward to seeing  Six new voices and they said that'll come soon including  A demo of john legend recording some stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's my question. What voices do you want them to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sean connery

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello stasher. I thought somebody suggested on twitter gilbert godfrey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want i'm i want scarlett joe hansen. Yes. Scarlett. Johansson was another good suggestion. Yep  Uh, so let me see if I can find the google assistant commercial  Uh john apparently john legend and kevin duran are getting big money  from uh  From uh google because they were all over  Let me see. Is this this is make google do it  Is this going to show off the voice? I don't think it is this is just john and chrissey  Uh just playing with stuff  Uh, yeah, that's it. That's their ad at home. Yeah, so they had john legend in the studio  He's saying happy birthday  But he also did some voice stuff and then sundar pachai  Uh actually showed that he could have  John legend's voice telling him he had an appointment  So somehow they're taking the voice and modifying the assistant's voice. So it sounds like john legend

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They showed that off remember how they could generate auto-generate  We talked about this a couple shows ago the auto-generation of different voices  So that's that's really crazy and we talked I think we even brought this up how this could be crazy for  Fake news and creating, you know, you know how people edit right now things like all the speeches of obama singing songs  And they just edit all his voices together something like this. You just grab somebody who has a lot of  Audio footage and you can just boom make a stacey sounding robot if you wanted to yeah those days are coming apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what i'd like to have is one thing that struck me about the six voices is they all sounded american and even white  There was no sense of a variety of voices

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that's why they showed john legend because right while he doesn't sound, you know, really urban  He does I mean he he doesn't sound like a a professional voice  Actually, I think I have the video if you want to uh, let's see if we can we can show it here  Um, am I getting audio from sundar the google assistant? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our vision for the perfect assistant is that it's naturally conversational  It's there when you need it so that you can get things done in the real world  And we are working to make it even better  We want the assistant to be something that's natural and comfortable to talk to  And to do that we need to start with the foundation of the google assistant the voice  Today, that's how most users interact with our system  Our current voice is code named holly. She was a real person  She spent months in our studio  And then we stitched those recordings together to create voice  But 18 months ago, we announced a breakthrough from our deep mind team called wave net  I think this is what we were talking about a couple of weeks ago  Wave net actually models the underlying raw audio to create a more natural voice  It's closer to how humans speak  the pitch the pace  Even all the pauses that convey meaning we want to get all of that, right?  So we've worked hard with wave net and we are adding as of today  Six new voices to the google assistant. Let's have them say hello

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good morning, everyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm your google assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome to shoreline amphitheater  We hope you'll enjoy google.io  Back to you soon dar. Yeah, they were very they're very kind of white  european  non-accented  Announcery voices, but that's that's where this gets more interesting when you could take real people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's you know, our goal is to get the right accents languages and dialects right globally  You know wave net can make this much easier  With this technology we started wondering who we could get into the studio  With an amazing voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take a look. This is the jodan luncheon kuz kuz a type of north african similina and granules made from crushed durum wheat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he does not have in any way  Kind of a polished voice. I mean, he's obviously a singer sweet eyes and a fluffy tail who likes my high, but he sounds like a normal person

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Happy birthday to the person whose birthday it is  Happy birthday  To you  John legend  He would probably tell you he don't want to brag  But he'll be the best assistant you ever had. Can you tell me where you live?  You can find me on all kinds of devices phones google homes  And if i'm lucky  in your heart  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's less impressive than what you're about to hear which is  Now that that's right modified john legend voice coming out of the assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All the time in the studio answering every possible question that you could ask  But wave net allowed us to shorten the studio time and the model can actually capture the richness of his voice  His voice will be coming later this year in certain contexts so that you can get responses like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good morning sundar right now in mountain view. It's 65 with clear skies  Today it's predicted to be 75 degrees and sunny at 10 a.m  You have an event called google i.o keynote then at 1 p.m. You have margaritas  Have a wonderful day that is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  natural sounding  You think it's creepy it's kind of like real fakes. I think the potential yeah, the potential for this is pretty disconcerting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You sound like a swiss journalist now, but you'll get yeah exactly, but I think you'll get used to the idea that that  Uh, sometimes the voices you you know computer voices sound wacky computer voices don't have to sound wacky  They can sound human and once they do they can sound like different humans and I think we'll just get used to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's fine as long as we build in kind of an as long as we build this with like an adversarial  Viewpoint on how it could be used. We're already talking about things like voice authentication  There was a thing here last night at microsoft build that talked about using voice as an authenticator  Something like this would just destroy that yeah, that's that's that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But is google actually rolling wave net out or are they just using it for their own products and services?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question, maybe they'll have to keep it to themselves because of like face recognition the danger

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Well, but a lot of their ai efforts will be I mean they're going to generate  reports and papers based on this  What in in one of the reasons why it probably sounds a bit generic is because their training data is probably  Like it's like the bbc english, except it's not it's it's a generic american english  Because that's the easiest thing for people to understand well, that's what they're gonna play

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, i'm sure I mean sundar pachai could do  His you know his voice and it could sound here. Let me play. This is the thing that I don't know if this is creepy  But this is very impressive. So this is now  another technology that google announced that is going to allow the  Assistant to actually place calls on your behalf. Watch this this this one is wild

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And is to help you get things done  It turns out a big part of getting things done is making a phone call  You may want to get an oil change schedule  Maybe call a plumber in the middle of the week or even schedule a haircut appointment  You know, we are working hard to help users through those moments  We want to connect users to businesses in a good way  Businesses actually rely a lot on this but even in the us  60 of small businesses don't have an online booking system set up  We think ai can help with this problem  So let's go back to this example. Let's say you want to ask google  To make you a haircut appointment on tuesday between 10 and noon  What happens is the google assistant makes the call seamlessly in the background for you  So what you're going to hear is the google assistant actually calling a real salon  To schedule the appointment for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's listen. Now this this is wild  You'll hear by the way, this sounds like a real assistant  They intentionally have her sticking in ums and and pauses  But the thing that's most impressive to me is not that but how she responds to a real human  And this is like the self-driving car problem and and sometimes humans steer you wrong  Or say I mean and it seemed to do and of course these are canned demos, but it seemed to do a very good job of  Handling real world situations. Listen to this  This is the assistant  That's a real salon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For something on may 3rd

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the assistant. Um, i'm looking for something on may 3rd. That's the that's that's a computer  This is a human she's up talking too she is she's up talking sure what time are you looking for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At 12 pm  We do not have a 12 pm available. The closest we have to that is a 115

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now how is the assistant going to deal with that one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have anything between 10 am and uh 12 pm  Depending on what service she would like what service is she looking for?  Just a woman's haircut for now  Okay, we have a 10 o'clock  10 am is fine. Okay. What's her first name?  The first name is lisa  Okay, perfect. So I will see lisa at 10 o'clock on may 3rd  Okay, great. Thanks. Great. Have a great day. Bye

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things that scares me about that is that it's clear they're trying to make it fool  The receptionist  Yeah, I mean I can imagine this technology in the wrong hands is terrifying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it also I get those all the time. Don't you I mean I get those whether they're trying to fake that they're human  Yeah, and you ask them are you a robot and they have some can't answer and and they're not sorry. Go ahead stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I was very excited from a business perspective google's talking about using this for calling restaurants to see if they're open for holiday hours  for example  in that  If you can imagine the automation of data collection at that kind of scale  That is  Mind-boggling how quickly google could gain an edge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and this is really an example to me. I i'm kind of lately on a kick saying stop calling it ai  That's a marketing term machine learning I can live with but ai is a marketing term except that this is  This is ai now. This is yeah, this is actually here. Listen to this one. This is a much more challenging

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't have done this phone call

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a small restaurant which is not easily available to book online  The call actually goes a bit differently than expected. So take a listen  Hi, um, i'd like to reserve a table for wednesday v seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For seven people okay, so the the human

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  misunderstood

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The assistant he was saying at 7 p.m. She thought he said for seven people  Maybe she's a robot  That would be she did a worse job of understanding him  Than she does he does have understanding or it  Does of understanding her she's actually pretty difficult to understand listen to how this continues  So she's already throwing him throwing it. I gotta say it. It's really tempting to say him. Isn't it it a curve?  Um, it's for four people  four people when  Um wednesday at 6 p.m  Oh, actually we need to for like opera like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know  Um next wednesday at 6 p.m

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, actually we need to for like opera like five people now if you uh are not watching the video and didn't see the caption  What the what the human just said is  We only allow reservations for more than five people  For so before you can come for four people you can come  How long is the wait usually to uh be seated now? That's actually the right  Response to that which is oh, oh, I don't need a reservation. Well, how long will I have to wait?  That's a very sophisticated  I think  response

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When tomorrow or week a or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For next wednesday, uh the seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, it's not too busy. It you can come for people. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I got you. Thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bye-bye

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is touring test level touring test level. This is yeah. This is very impressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to know something here for a moment. It's one o'clock in sundara's calendar and they just started serving margaritas. They're actually serving margaritas  I'm not really I shouldn't drink it drink it enjoy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't get any beverages until like six o'clock. Microsoft does not serve

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Margaritas, it's good and it has tequila in it. There's actually tequila  Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nice so so this is  When are they announcing this because this reminds me remember facebook m  But they put the person in the loop for as things got more complicated  Facebook actually killed that project with the people they kept the m ai efforts and they're bringing that back for their smart speaker  it sounds like but  This is  And and i've got a lot of questions about was this  Obviously, it's not a live demo. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said they had  A lot. I don't remember the number of calls in the can but my impression is this is an actual uh,  Project right so that means it's not it's something they're working on  And my duplex google duplex my it's my sense that this is something they're they're working on this  They didn't say coming soon to a phone near you. Well, well, but but about almost a year ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I talked on the show about beta works had a um  voice  Uh accelerator and demo session and and they showed exactly this where where it calls off and makes a web editor buys flowers or whatever  So they you know, these are companies outside google working on this. The other interesting thing is  Seriously, you also get the opportunity  At a really wacky level to have robot to robot in voice, right?  Rather than having to have any voice becomes the api

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you don't even need voice at that point if you got robot to robot they could go  Blah blah blah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've seen that with ai does kind of make up its own language, right?  They could make up an ai language, but you don't need a you don't need a data communication  You don't need an api audio becomes that connection, which is fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but that that's the way we understand it, but it's not the way computers understand it  So really what they'll do is create an analog equivalent to voice that computers can understand. So basically  I I know this is esoteric, but I hate when people try to think about humans  in or computers in human terms because  It it changed  It's ridiculously inefficient. Yes. Thank you. It's like we're not good at the things computers are good at

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No good at things. We're not good at there's no reason to have a computer translate it into human mode  So that it could talk to another computer who has to untranslate it into computer computer can call not knowing whether it's going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To get a human working. That's right. That's right. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right  so  More down to earth kevin i'm actually before I do that kevin  Do you sound like you want to say something about this technology? No, no, i'm i'm good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm kind of watching the keynote and listening along here. Okay, go right ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be my guess  They did mention that the google assistant will have a feature that amazon added to its echo a couple of months ago the ability to  Continue on you trigger it with you know, hey google, but then it would continue on you like stacy's doing a little stacy dance

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm like i'm excited about the customized smart routines even though I spent you know hours programming them into the amazon echo  But now I can spend hours programming them into the google assistant or yeah google home

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Custom and scheduled routines coming to assistant. This is very much like the blueprints feature of amazon echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, no, it's more like the what do they call it on? It's it's the same what you say like a good night command or oh  Watch a movie and it does all that now the scheduled aspect of it  I don't believe amazon has a schedule. So that's actually new

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, good. That's the missing piece because yeah, typically we talk about this on our show stacy  You need a a hub to kind of create these automations and schedules and I had said back in march  It's time for google to make a hub. Well, it looks like they're not doing that  It looks like they're bringing hub features to a voice user interface

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also had some smart. They also had something which I think is I have mixed feelings about pretty please

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like this. I'm not just for kids, but I think this too  I think it encourages civility

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The idea is the assistant can be taught to sit to wait until you ask it politely  And then can thank you for doing so and then says thank you for being so polite

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've heard all kinds of parents say that they see their kids burning into dictators yelling at siri

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my view on this maybe is that the kid could learn a more nuanced  Approach which is that machines do not need to be talked to politely their machines. I don't like the idea of  Mixing the distinction between humans and machines. I think it's important  Encouraging anthropomorphization is not a good point. That's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will disagree with you just because it is impossible for us not to anthropomorphize things  It that that is what we're wired to do  and so  training people to be  Polite and civil in their interactions with it just becomes a habit in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you you become less abrasive. I'm okay with that as long as there is also an effort to really  Help kids understand that this is not a human  There's not a person in there and that you do treat machines differently than you treat humans. I don't think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That they're in any danger of that children recognize machines and people and I think this isn't actually just for kids, too  I think part of you like if you just get used to belting out commands at things, right?  You do that as a default. It could become habitual and I understand that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even even before this rolls out or rolled out  The echo has a way now where it will listen for an extra five seconds and you can say thank you and she will say  You're welcome and so on and i've been using that feature. I mean I was saying  Thank you a year ago on that thing. So  You know, I think it depends on the person and  Kids that's a tough one. I mean, I know lots of little kids. How do they get the people on the tv?  They don't think they don't realize that you know, it is a device sometimes so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I like says like it's it's always nice because sometimes I say thank you to people regardless like I say thank you to my washing machine  Not because I feel like it's doing anything to have it. That's a big  Yeah, we learned something there. I just i'm like, oh, thank you. Okay, you know stacey and then stacey. I gotta know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the conversation you have with your june oven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, we have long deep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no voice interaction in the june oven, so it's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you know what my most common phrase actually to all of my devices  You are disappointing me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just i'm very disappointed right now. She's so polite. I say  F you siri is what I literally say about three times a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, should we do a little more kevin is there anything I I see it but I can't if they talk about anything interesting  You can tell them in topics

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the um, it's all it's all android so far. So I haven't okay  I'm listening i'm only watching so I by the way I uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks to the chat room have found the google ai blog post which just went up  Uh on uh, the google duplex system and it has some more examples and talks about how it works and they're saying  This is using something called a recurrent  neural network designed to cope with  challenging environments using extended tensorflow or tensorflow extensive extended tfx  and uh  Let me just play a little a couple more of these clips that will give you an idea of this is duplex

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Handling interruptions. Okay. What's your phone number?  The phone number is um  Wait, wait, can you start over?  The number is 607  Uh-huh. It's a little robotic two two three, but  two what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two two three. Oh, that's impressive. Okay, two two three. These are real conversations. Let me give you another one. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hi, um, I would like to reserve a table for may 25th  Sorry, what day?  For friday, um may 25th it added friday

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To help the human  Here's duplex responding to a sink

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you here?  Yeah, i'm here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you here? Yeah, i'm here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so imagine how this could be used in all kinds of other ways in in not just making appointments at first but  You know turning journalism into voice and asking questions in being able to call brands and stores and get help  Um, the opportunities just are just endless. Here's an here's a new word

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Negotiate on your behalf for like insurance companies. Here's a new word. Amen. Here's a new word that you like for you writers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Disfluencies  The uhs and ums that they add they call those speech  Disfluencies they're added when combining widely differing sound units in the concatenative tts or adding synthetic weights  Which allows the system to signal in a natural way that it is still processing in other words when you hear those ums  It's actually thinking  Oh, it's the spinning wheel. It's doing it's doing what humans do when you hear an um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I see the future very close when a parent says to a child saying um all the time you sound like a robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's better than working

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh someone in the chat room did this um, but this is true sales pitches to old pensioners from toad's life  Oh, yeah, the idea of scammers using this. Oh, it's gonna be terrible. Oh god, it's gonna be terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that? What's that jolly rogers site? I think it is where you can turn it on to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm and ripple collar. We've had him on a couple of times. He's great. And uh, yeah  Uh, here's another this is another again from this blog post. It's important for latency to match people's expectations  For example after people say something simple, for example, hello  They expect an instant response and are more sensitive to latency  When we detect that low latency is required. We use faster  low confidence models  In other words, they'd like to be more precise in their responses, but they can sense that the the human  Is impatient so they'll give them something that may be a little wrong, but at least it's something

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is just wild that's actually how I talk to people. Yeah, you look really impatient i'm like, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Potsicles see this is this is ai

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is ai this is really  Making a computer look human is what it is. It's okay. I mean, all right. All right. It's not really thinking. You're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not really thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leos is yours you do radio years ago when I used to be on ron. I wouldn't show  Ron would let a call go on and he started talking to me and I think what the hell he  Started talking to me. I think what are you doing?  Then how are they the guy he would just put his hand up hit the button and say why do you say that?  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was just showing off. He was just showing off jeff  I have to say though john c dvorak tells the story of being on the larry king show  And larry actually falling asleep  Because I remember it used to be an all-night late night show falling asleep during a call  John didn't know what to do. So he answered and he kind of extended the answer hoping larry would wake up  Finally, he just ran out of things to say so he stopped and king goes  Minneapolis next

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So  That is awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So humans have all sorts of tricks for handling these kinds of things. I'm really impressed by this google duplex  um  I know i'm not sure how it's going to get used  Obviously it says this summer. We'll start testing the duplex technology within google assistant  This summer to help users make reservations  For restaurants to schedule hair salon appointments and get holiday hours over the phone. They feel apparently confident enough  Here's a here's a there's a picture of yaniv leviyathan google duplex lead and matan kahlman engineering manager  Enjoying a meal booked through a call from duplex  Here's the call  They're actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, i'm calling to make reservations. I'm looking for a table on friday the fourth  It's friday  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, awesome, you sounded kind of like a jerk there. Yeah. Yeah a little robotic jerk like a like a  google bro  Maybe that's exactly how yaniv says. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So so listening to these calls which apparently are made to mostly like for ethnic restaurants, I guess  Well, those are challenging those are they are well, they're challenging if you're trained on on certain accents and data  so that's  It kind of emphasizes this weird classified. It's actually uncomfortable listening to a bunch of those in a row

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, because it's this white. Yeah, that's really true stacy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So many more well, I think they're showing uh linux on the Chromebooks in the uh developer conference. Oh, how exciting crostini

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crouton crostini is the next one bruschetta  bruschetta bruschetta

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ch is a c in italian. Oh, so so as impressive as all this is I mean to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, it's almost like the way that's exactly how bros talk to people  At work at restaurants, uh, I think you mean bruschetta go ahead kevin. I'm sorry  I'm just trying to get stacy to spit that perrier out through her nose

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It almost feels like a next generation chat bot in a sense only you're not doing the chatting at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well somebody somebody in the chat room said and I think this is accurate. It sounds  Um depressed  the bot doesn't sound  It sounds like it's something wrong with it. Like this is and this is it trying to say, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is where uncanny valley happens in audio as well as in  Visual elements, right where we're so well attuned to detecting, you know  Emotions and feelings in other people that I think when we hear these on these voices that's that we do we come to we say  What you said you sound like you're covering up depression

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's trying to offer up its own emotions and not react to yours  I I I get that. Yeah, it makes me wonder what would it like to redo eliza today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow  You're sounding depressed jeff  Are you wondering what it would be like to redo eliza today?  Why do you say that?  I say that because you said this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Guys we might be building marvin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Marvin the paranoid android  I have this pain all up and down the diodes on my back

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really freaked by european neighbor was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry no, go ahead jeff no and step on your punch line brain the size of a planet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So who who else is is google competing with here is anybody else even close no one's even close

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon i would agree amazon's the next closest right and and they they've been winning  Because of amazon's ubiquity because people like to shop that seems to be a good useful tool on this stuff  But ultimately if google can make this stuff real  It's all over frankly one of the problems I have with a lot of voice assistants is I use the  I use the the echoes in the homes because there's they're ambient. I rarely I don't know about you guys  Do you use voice assistants on your phones?  I do not I eat driving. Yeah driving maybe okay, that's a specific use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I even do it when i'm sitting around i'm sitting around people they say well to what time does that movie start?  I'll i'll say it they all hate me for doing it because it looks obnoxious, but i'll do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, google. Yeah, I do it sometimes like that  But I don't I don't use it an awful lot and I think these kinds of things might make you use it more  I you know  You gotta think of it you gotta remember you can do it what are they is they saying anything interesting about crostini kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they zipped around they went through pwas quickly. Um talked about uptake on that how to get more people using them  um amp and then  Yeah, it looks like they're just showing android ui stuff right now. Wow, they moved on fast. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. Wait, I want to go back to this duplex thing and other companies  Not in voice but in actually no in voice and then translating voice into a action item or service  Microsoft actually yesterday ran a really cool demo. I don't know if they talked about the future of work demo that they did  Oh the teams demo. Yeah, wasn't that amazing? Yeah  So they showed off basically they had this cone. I don't really know what all's in there with the camera and some voice stuff  So when you came into a meeting it was transcribing your meeting  As people talked and it knew who the people were based on like, I don't know their face and their employee id badge  I'm not sure which one but then it pulled out things that it thought were action items  So when you say words like oh i'll follow up on this or i'll send you an email  It actually pulled that into notes that you could like then pull into your outlook or whatever  but I actually thought that was  a really good way of augmenting human intelligence and  To like spare you what is it? Just a crappy robotic task, you know, yeah, so  I know it's not like an interaction with  a real human  At a restaurant but another question is how long are you going to have humans answering the phone as opposed to computers?  querying each other and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean to be fair. I I know sundar said only 60 percent of uh, you know, 60 percent of what is it?  Businesses don't have online booking but most of the restaurants I go to my hair salon  Most of the places I go are online booking. So I don't I never interact with a human  I don't want to interact with a human. It's much easier to do it. I hate doing online booking because you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I I well and maybe it's because you know, I I'm like, oh is it gonna be a haircut?  Is it gonna be the dye for the blue is gonna be bleach?  There's a lot of information that has to happen and then I can't ever remember my passwords. It's it's just just drama  And I have to remember to  Do it so like when I remember something right away and say, oh hey google just making me an appointment for  Redyeing my hair that would be  Super awesome if it just went and did it but that's kind of a lot of things to join

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know hopefully we'll get there you have different needs than I do apparently  I touched on briefly just the idea that your amazon did this a few months ago where you'd you trigger it once  And then you can have an ongoing conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just gonna say that's what freaked my European neighbor more than anything, you know  I was listening to you constantly and I said you often please listen to you constantly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it doesn't listen to you until you say the trigger word and then it says all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When does it go to shut off when you know it shuts off? Well, that's a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, I guess it's waiting for a pause. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's a it's supposed to be seven in a normal thing. It's seven seconds after you're done  Okay, and there's a there's a total limit as well, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if there's a total I think there's a total limit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So to be interesting so howard stern, uh this week had a what do you call a radio derby?  and he tried to get um  Uh to see how long you could keep a call going to a restaurant or something  It was exactly what's to your point stacey about about you know a class thing here  How you keep going by never answering somebody's question?  You could imagine doing derbies with this stuff and see how long you can keep. Oh in the hands of trolls. This stuff is a nightmare

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh  Amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's 40 phone calls and that's and that's why we need this  Um, I feel like it was a wired story ours or story that this adversarial model for  Building this stuff and testing it recognizing that humans when we program them  We program them to behave one way and expect them to behave one way  But when you start interacting more closely with people people are going to do just  Mean awful things to them and on the programming side. We actually have to start thinking about that and building for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm more worried about the robots moving doing mean awful things to the humans. I don't think I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, that's that's one way we could go but I really think it's important as we  We put our faith in this stuff. So think about things like people are talking about putting like little tiny pixels on stop signs just to  Screw with self-driving cars. Those are the kind of things people will consider and think of  And we need the people building this stuff to think of that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it goes both ways and of course, that's the the other side of that is the ethics conversation that  I think such an adela spent much more time on and appropriately so yesterday  But then sundar touched on a little bit, but but I I think that all  programmers now have to  For so many years and you're you're you're programming kevin, you know this  Your your whole mindset was just let me get the machine to do this thing  Now they really have to think about how will it be used and how will it be abused?  Both of those things are now very very important and and and we're missing and have been missing in the past

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right design and user experience user interface are all obviously things that you have to consider  but it's not just the people that are going to use your  Service your app your device. It's what are the other people around it who aren't going to use it  What might they do and how do you mitigate for things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't even know well and then abuse it would like to hit your hit your lidar with a baseball bat  Hit your eleven thousand dollar lidar with a baseball bat  So yeah, it's unfortunate, but I think it's a it's actually a maturation process in coding  That you have to start thinking about human factors much more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stacy back to your point, I think there's I think there's  now you have the  uh  Ethic and in some cases law that if you're being recorded you have to hear a beep  Right. Yeah. Uh, yeah, so I wonder if a robot's speaking do they have to start with a beep? They should I think it would be appropriate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you that the robots say I am an assistant an automated assistant calling on behalf of leo laporte before it does that  That would make sense. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's I mean that's something that good people will do and other people won't right but yeah, I agree  There's probably the polite thing to just like the polite thing to do  Even if in like a two-party consent state, I have to say that i'm recording but i'm recording from texas, which is not so  I could just record the phone call, but it's appropriate because i'm not a jerk. Yeah, I say i'm recording this. Is it okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello  I am an automated assistant calling for leo laporte

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, so then the harris salon when they get upset they say take me to your master

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, can I speak to a supervisor? Can I speak to your owner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about when this becomes commonplace though, let's think five ten years down the road assuming it does I mean right now it makes  Sense. Yes, I agree  The bot the ai should identify itself because it's a new thing and people have to get used to this  But what if it becomes widespread will we not want to know that will we care? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's some really cool things like what if you got a robot therapist in the future, right?  Like an ai-based therapist would you that in a way could open up a lot of opportunities for people who can't afford a  Like 150 or 200 therapy session, right? You could buy a robot one for 25 and see if it works for you  um  So I think you should have that really it's it's not crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it really kind of diminishes the importance of the the skill of a therapist  Because that's that is it's just to listen you're just here to listen shut up and i'm gonna tell you my dreams

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean there are definitely questions it could ask to help you. I guess anyway, the point is  I think you will have to have a truth in in labeling kind of when you're dealing with an ai at all times

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's gonna be very interesting. I agree with you. I think absolutely let's take a little break lots more to talk about  Stacey Higginbotham is here while she's actually in seattle where she's covering microsoft's developer conference build for stacey on iot.com  It's nice to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, let's see. Let's talk about this news by the way, I you they they did announce as they did last year that the  public  Beta for android p is now available. I immediately installed it on my pixel 2 xl  And i'm liking it. There's some nice new features. You probably have heard all about them though already  Uh from uh, jason howell and the all about android crew and i'm sure they'll talk more about that tonight jason actually  Is going to do all about android. I believe he's doing it from  Google i.o. Am I right? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's going to interview two top android people tomorrow morning

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're google loves all about android and they're giving him access to some big shots  Executives and so forth. So that will be i'll leave that android p discussion  Uh to all about android, but I have to say i'm i'm i'm liking it quite a bit already and one of the newest  Features that i'm I put a widget already google has replaced their news the google play news stand app  With something simply called google news  Which is confusing because they do have google news and whether i'm guessing that has been deprecated  but google news  Can still has the google news stand subscriptions as a tab on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But i'm very impressed. I think how do I get I can't I can't figure out where to get to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just so if you have newsstand installed it'll update that's all I did if you don't have newsstand installed  You probably have to just go to the android app store and download  Okay, got it. Thank you. So i'll show you it's hard to see I know but uh front page  First thing that shows up is leo's briefing top five stories right now and they implied that those were algorithmically  Chosen based on my interests in my case. Uh, the big story is the big story of the day the  iran nuclear deal  uh, then there's a  Another trump story kellyann conway  uh  The investigators back at rural petaluma home for death investigation. That's obviously something i'm interested in that's a local story  Uh, here's a new york post story. I probably would not use that as a source in future  I'm sure there's a way to turn that off  And nine to five max so it knows I like technology  And then below that there are additional stories and those you can you can  Categorize in the favorites section you can choose the topics you're interested in the sources you're interested in  It has my location. So that's why it knew about the petaluma story  And then magazines that I can or should subscribe to this is kind of apple's going to do this  They bought texture so apple's obviously going to have something like that in the apple news  So there's the for you one thing I think is really important in all of the stories is there's a button  It's a little one on here that gives you full what they call at google called full coverage  And in that case, it's not algorithmically chosen. They were very careful to say this is all the reporting  From all the best sources. I don't know how they choose those  Uh on that particular topic they do include tweets  Now somebody was saying and we weren't sure is it people you follow on twitter?  I don't follow the president. So it isn't just people I follow on twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure that they didn't say this wasn't algorithmically done. They said that you'd get this everybody would get the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they meant. That's what I meant. Yes, right, you know, of course it's algorithmically done, but it's not  Okay, it's not in the sense that it's it's tailored to my interests. Everybody gets the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well when you get to that story everybody gets the same full coverage of that story, right and note  Well, they're talking about quality. They're talking about the most trusted sources  We have both facebook and google working on that now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So latest updates now in the full coverage page latest updates top coverage. It's got social stuff. It's got video  Probably not all from youtube, by the way, there's cnn. There's cnbc  There's the cbs evening news a fact check section  I think that's telling  An opinion section which is interesting and then analysis and frequently asked questions. This is I think really  Nicely done. This is  Better than twitter moments. This is look how long this is all on that one story  It just it almost feels like an infinite scroll. I think it might be on that one story for full coverage  So I think this is I I have you know, i'll only play with it a little bit  There's headlines and then and then the headlines you can look at latest us world business  Technology entertainment so forth favorites as I said was where you customize they have kept the subscription feature the newsstand feature  But it's just a tab and I think  I'll defer to you in a moment jeff, but I think that this is exactly the kind of thing  Uh publications with paywalls want because it's very and they mentioned this on the stage very easy to  Oh, I want to subscribe los angeles times. It's a one button push and you're in using your google play  And then there's a lot of free stuff as well. There's a subscription sale here. So this is the old newsstand  But I think nicely done mixing  Uh, you know both free and paywall  Content in together vanity fare dollar 99 a month if I wanted to subscribe to that  I push a button

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Could google take that same infrastructure and do it for a per article basis?  Because that would be really interesting right just uh micro payments, you know, they're probably yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's everybody's thought micro payments are going to go with the world, but but they don't um  Did you I don't think the consumer demand is there for that  I don't think I don't think the business demand is there for that could they yeah they could  But but by adding a drag by adding a step in and no matter if it's a nickel or whatever  It is the cost of closing the transaction is much higher than the value of the transaction

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem with micro transactions right now. You got to get it. Well, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If I saw if I clicked on an article and it was something that I could only get there. It was the  I and I clicked through and google threw up a thing saying hey  It's going to cost you a quarter. They've already got my credit card  If I just hit yes, it'll run to my run through my credit card on my google pay or whatever the hell i've got  That would actually not be super frictiony. They could do what apple does they could bundle it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right you you take yeah apple does this with itunes you take all of the payments and you do them all at once to reduce the  total cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other issue is that if you're going to work on, you know  If you're going to have a a four hundred dollar subscription to wall street journal  And I can get by at the five times I care to in a quarter for you know, 25 cents each  Then the publisher is unlikely to want to offer up their stuff in that way, right?  It's it's always been the kind of one of the many messiah we keep waiting for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, but it's not quite there. I this is to me what apple I  Probably wants to do with apple news didn't do by the way. The widget is great every time I go to the widget  It's a slideshow. It says leo's briefing. It's got a brief weather and a headline  But every time I go to the slideshow it has a new slide  So they're they're just kind of updating that which I think is is this is really nicely done. I I have to say i'm very very  impressed and in fact immediately put it on a widget on my  Homepage because I think it's the kind of thing I will probably use as a main news source  so jeff you haven't seen it yet, so you probably don't have the ability to  review it but  unmute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, thank you. Sorry. Uh, no, I haven't I have it now. Um, I don't even know how to get a widget anymore  I haven't done it in so long. You press and long press

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. And then um, no, I think it's very nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One thing I don't wonder my wonder is just the first off is why why didn't they replace the swipe right?  On the end from the android home with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because swipe right still gives you google now cards, which are clearly getting deprecated

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, and and are basically new stuff and not very good news. Yeah, it's okay. I go through it, you know once a day but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I agree with you. I i'm hoping they'll do that. You have news got google.com which is different from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google news play stand which is different from now cards news  So there's a need for some consolidation here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But having having complained about that nothing new with google, right? How many messaging apps do they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, I think it is very nice  Um, I think that they're trying to what I want to know what i'll be talking to talk to some of them tomorrow  is  what  How they're making their decisions about quality  Uh  I've talked before in the show about the flight to quality that's occurring google says they're they're true  Google news, you know, let's basically any site in  Now how does something rise up in this?  There's a quality factor in there. What does that quality factor look like? I'm glad it's there  It'll be controversial in some in some cases. Uh same thing going on with facebook  Uh, so we'll see where this goes. But yeah, I think it's um  I can't really know until I  um  You know use it for day after day after day  But it looks very nice and I think that the ideas behind it are good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think google's right on google mentioned that they have now this new initiative. Tell us about this  Initiative they're putting what was it several million dollars into it kind of like the facebook news initiative or different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, they're different. Uh, google is investing not giving away  But investing 300 million dollars in the google news initiative after europe went after them the germans went after them with the leistung schutzrecht  um, and google did create a fund of 150 million euro that they gave away to  uh news innovators for for certain projects that are about to get to the last of giving away the last  euros of that and they also  Um have google news guys brought to europe and then this week i'm going to news guys lamb  And they have the google news lab around the world  So google did a lot of things around news and the european initiative was so successful  They've now made it global and in every way that we wanted in news except that they're not giving away money to news organizations  But I also think that that's kind of foolish to wish for  They are investing a lot of money. They care about it. This is the first time that google news was on the stage at io  This is a big deal for richard jingerson company  and um part of their initiative is also to help business models of news  The way they're doing it at first which is the way they have the highest pressure from especially german publishers is around subscriptions  So they announced a few weeks ago. I talked about it briefly on the show  That they've now made it extremely easy to subscribe using your google id using your google payment  You come across a challenge. You've seen five articles. Uh, do you want to subscribe?  Yes, I do one click your sign in is the same your payment is done and you're there  then further when you do a search on a topic  You will get the carousel of the most important things on top but below that you'll get a carousel of your news sources  And that includes the sources that is made up with the sources that you subscribe to  Now my fetching about that is I also want them to do this around a model of membership contribution  And when it comes to my sources, I should be able to put in sources there that are free  Um that I like not just things I pay for but those things can be done and can be done easily and they knock their heads at that  um, so  Yeah, I think this is a good thing for news. They're making friends with news  Uh, it's also their way to poke their eyes a little poke the eyes of facebook a little bit to say, you know  Look how friendly we can be and the fact that it came from the stage and from sundar personally  Endorsing news he has met with many many news executives in the industry over the last two years  And I think they're proving that they mean what they say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  good  One of the things that everybody's talking about these days apple in fact got challenged by its shareholders  A couple of activist shareholders a few months ago told apple you need to do something about the addictiveness of your iphone  so apple google and yesterday microsoft are all looking at ways to  Get people to use their products less  Or at least more healthfully google calls it digital  Well-being and this will be a feature also of android

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  P now you want to talk about creepy this stuff creep me out  I don't want anybody nannying me and telling me what I can turn it on. You don't have to yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have to opt into it  I think it's like no, I think it's great. You can mandatorily make it for your kids, right?  Yes, I think that'll train them into good habits  And if you're the type of person who knows  That I mean if you know that if you get on your phone after 10  You're going to sit there and scroll through and do worthless crap on it  Then you can set this up and it'll help you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a there's a dashboard that is kind of I already use something called instant that does the same thing as dashboard does  It shows you how long you've used the phone what apps you use the most and how long you've used them that kind of thing  But there's also I think a very odd thing  I think this is what you were talking about stacey that you you tell it that you go to bed at 10 for instance  And it will kind of shut down  At 10 turn off all notifications and go and fade to monochrome fade the black and white  Uh making it less attractive

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought that was kind of I love this because I I spend  you're already like you're  Sacked out on the couch or something. You're like  I really should get off my phone. I don't need to watch, you know the latest celebrity  Fight, but you're still there scrolling. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. Here's here's here's here's the here's the analog  Imagine that the samsung motorola back in the day zedith zena sold you a tv that said  After you've watched so many hours the tv won't go back on and you can't turn it on america would have were builtin

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they would offer that as an option and you're talking jeff to someone who actually programmed a smart plug to turn off  Like the tv and a smart plug so if I didn't take 10 000 steps today the tv would work. Oh good for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now how long before you turn that back on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it lasted like a day or two. Yeah. Okay. I just want I just want to point out. What is this drama? It's a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do have though. No, we use our router. I the euro turns off at 10 pm  Not for us, but for michael because kids will stay up all night  And so there's no internet after 10 pm. I I think these are all appropriate  Google calls that feature winds down by the way, I was trying to remember the name

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the equivalent of pre-prepping vegetables sticking them in your fridge when you're on a diet that is what this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do that. I have carrot sticks and celery sticks in my fridge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, my mother looks at me and says jeff you've been on that youtube a very long time today. You don't have to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube will also have that by the way. Yes, youtube will have the how long you've watched feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't and the dashboard telling what i've done all day, I don't want to know  You don't have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't have to this is why I like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good for you jeff just eat your spinach

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All this data was already there. It's it's it's been on there. It's on windows machines  It's all that information. They're just making it useful if you want to use it if you don't want to not a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sundar pichai coined a new acronym instead of fomo fear of missing out  He calls it jomo the joy of missing out jeff. You need to get jomo'd  You need more joy more joy miriam joir when she's on and don't you tell me to have more joy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want any of your damn

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I see the vitamin d from shoreline is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not enough sunshine. It's not even he's not even still pale as a ghost  One of the things miriam joir said she liked was the new maps feature. I really like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, this was this was a show winner was the walking really?  oh  Every time a new yorker every time I get out and I try to figure out the blue thing  Where am I going? Am I going this way? Am I going that way? This is the thing. I applaud it  This is the show winner is is visual  Here's where you are go this way. I agree 100

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Box, it's really I guess if you drive you're giving it enough direction information that that's not an issue  It's when you're walking and I invariably go the wrong way down the street  You'll see me if you see me around town  I'm always going like this  This is the figure eight gesture you do to supposedly  Calibrates the compass  And then I go like this, which way am I going? So what they're doing with google maps? I think it's great  They're going to use augmented reality  They're going to actually turn on the camera when you're looking at the maps and you're walking around  Show the street show where you're looking. I gotta hear a car. Oh, you got it. There you go  And and and superimpose the map on top of that. So it's very clear that it's time to turn right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're playing with the idea. You can even follow a nice little animal. They had a fox. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't mind that. I like that. I will turn on the fox if they turn that on  I think that's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh lens, I would love I was excited about the fox. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kids will love that. Yeah, anybody would I you know, uh, I think this is  Anyway, this will be a this will be a nice wonderful place to do merchandising tie-in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Imagine following b8 around or yeah, remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or and they and they once again they showed this last year and they didn't ever it never really came out the idea  That as you're looking on this augmented reality signs pop up, you know, you see the street and signs pop up where businesses are  They didn't implement it. Uh, they showed it again. Maybe they'll implement it this year  That's all kind of part of lens. In fact lens will now if you show it an outfit you can tap parts of the outfit and say  How do I get that bag or bags like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those features i've never been pleased with those features i've seen a lot of them  They remain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll test it and see if it's any good. It's like image search, but it's built in right? Uh, yeah  But yeah, most of them suck. Yeah, I agree. I do like, you know again  remember last year they demoed the  Instantaneous translation using pixel buds and then when we got the pixel buds, it was nothing like the demo

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is what I was worried about with duplex. Yeah, so we'll see it's always got to remember demos are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A different animal although this google lens demo where you could take a picture  She's got she's she's aiming her camera at a recipe book  taking a using lens to I'm not even taking a picture show  The text and then copying and pasting it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why don't you just send the picture to someone I send people recipes this way I do I do too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but then you can paste it into something. I don't know. I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

They showed a picture of people in inflatable dinosaur suits  And how the car knew that was people or something or something not I guess something you shouldn't hit maybe maybe that

Transcript:  Uh  It showed oh, I thought this was good how it can handle  Inclement weather they showed a snowy snowy  Street and this is all the noise caused by the snow which makes it very difficult to drive  but they showed how machine learning can strip the noise out  And actually give you a clearer view than you have as it as a human  I think that's exciting. I think that's very cool  So some some waymo, you know, they're moving along they they acted as if it's just around the corner  That you're going to be able to get a waymo. You don't think so kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Yes, but just one area  It's if this is going to take a long time to roll out where there's still a lot of laws to deal with  Amongst different states. So this is this is baby steps. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that in a nutshell is google io  Of course it continues on right now. They're doing the developer talk  Anything more to be said there? I remember how excited everybody was last year when they said the word cotlin

They still use go  um, I don't know if this all still has to do with oracle and java or what the deal is, but I mean  I think it started that way, but I think it's also an occupational hazard amongst

I can't start watching it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm catching up on silicon valley now, which is just stellar this season. Is it genius? Okay good  Because it was it went through a dip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I same thing. I watched the first episode. I was like, oh god

Transcript:  Yeah, I I it felt more torture porny and not  I was like, yeah, I don't need to see this at all. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I I i'm pretty much only watch comedies now  That's the way of the world now, yeah  I only want to watch comedies kevin tofu's got a great new website. You might want to spend some time checking that out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Forever there kevin is doing god's work  About supporting the most important kind of computer technology any shock can use today

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree about chromebooks.com and i'm sure we'll see more crostini coverage there  You will you will get ready for bruschetta or brosketta as the chat room calls it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a shame that the chrome chrome os chromebooks just don't get the coverage and treatment from all the major tech sites  It's always an afterthought. So that's why I launched the site to focus just on them. I'm seriously grateful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did kevin really and you said an interesting thing on this site. You said that you thought that  chrome tablets are going to be a game changer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do because uh  They're basically the first mobile device that has a full desktop browser experience, which is a big deal if you use web apps  Which still has the mobile app experience of in this case android apps. So nothing else does that  So this is this is why I sold the ipad pro that I love a great device and got the pixel book interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, i think what i have is my my skype app my netflix my showtime  They are very very flaky and don't work half the time on  um through chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I I I know that and in certain cases some of the apps aren't 100%  It's ironic. I was literally just talking to somebody on my old team at google yesterday  And we were chatting about android apps and how they're working for me and how they're not so I try and provide feedback  And that's one of the things I said

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think also there's not a lot of incentive for those companies because they don't feel copy protected on on  Platforms that they don't like not that aren't windows and macintosh  I'm sure they're just as copy protected

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you cannot use uh netflix or any drm type content  Uh app on on a chromebook if you're in developer mode for example a lot of those things won't work same if you uh, you know  Unlock the bootloader of your android phone same same deal for the drm keys. So I totally get that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think yeah, I think they're they're kind of they're they're on the fence a little bit about these. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, oh stacy. They're right now. They're starting the io android things scavenger hunt get in there get in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go go go. That's right. We didn't talk about android things. Well kevin. I'll talk about it on our show. That's fine. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything you want to say briefly?  About it. Is it a big big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  uh, it's a big deal that it's finally out but  It's a quick glance. Yeah, the quick glance I had it was like  It's a big deal for google, but I don't think they go far enough yet. So i'm kind of like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's just me. Okay kevin it helps it helps with the security aspect and updating devices  Because google will will keep these devices updated for at least three years and in iot keeping devices updated  There's no incentive for companies to do that either. So well didn't microsoft just announced 10 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so and qualcomm actually has announced seven years and 10 years respectively on their snapdragon for embedded  So I actually looked at this and kevin used  Kevin and I were aiming beforehand. I was like google this sucks  um, I think I did wtf google but can you pay to get additional support because  Honestly, that's not a game changer at all to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My understanding is yes that you can make your device maker. Yes after three years

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You probably talked about it on the show last week of the week before but didn't microsoft announce azure  What is it sphere spheres project sphere project sphere? Yes. Yes, we did a whole  I'm sure you did. Okay, because that I think is very is is it's timely  I'd like to see google do the same thing where and i'm sure qualcomm will where they kind of can reish a  Low-end chinese iot manufacturer can use something like that to make a device that is in fact  Updateable secure and reliable and and consumers could buy it with some confidence, right? Is that right? That's the idea now wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to ask because I saw that they showed the lenovo smart display. Yes, they announced availability. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's summer july i think july. Yeah, and there'll be three to choose from not just lgs  Although or lenovo and I think you and I both want the lenovo one. Yeah, well we should one of us should probably get a different one

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got i'll have my bot order a lenovo one it's got a bigger screen than the echo show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a big fan of the echo show. They have a 10 inch screen available  I think this is going to be and they did do a demo on it. I think this is going to be a very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A product, you know what was awesome about the echo show. I'm finding i'm liking it more and more and I think it's actually 160  Right now for mother's day, but I actually last night we were microsoft did a thing at the chaluli gardens, which is lovely  And I called my daughter on the echo show  And I just took her on a little tour with me kind of sir. Awesome. And that was really fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's awesome. I might have to get an echo show  for my daughter  Because my mother will only talk to her on facetime and abby no longer has an apple device of any kind  she's got a pixel and she's got a  Note 8 a samsung note 8 and so she can't use facetime and mom won't use duo  Uh, but I think but mom does have an echo show  I think if I got an echo show for abby, then they could they could still talk to each other. That's that's the solution. I just  Answered my own question

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  God that we have to even think that hard is just wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just annoys me that apple is is so siloed. It's really sad. Hello bijan  How are you today?  Oh normie is such a cute little doggie and you keep him so clean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, he does that himself. Oh  He does he needs a haircut though, they don't shed right bijons don't shed. That's correct. They're hypoallergenic  They do not shed but so it's good for people without allergies. But would you believe it? He has allergies  I believe it medicine every day

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem with purebreds. Hey, does does he smell like a dog?  Not really see because that's the objection lisa has  Is that dogs have a doggie smell they smell like dogs?  No, they don't but I remember our bijon always smelled like ivory soap and looks weird  All right, thank you. Thank you so much stacey.
