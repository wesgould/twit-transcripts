Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unbelievable. We've been doing tech dirt for 25 years. That's longer than twit. That's amazing  August of 97. Yeah  That's I'm old. I'm very old even for tech TV practically before there was an internet. I mean 97

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, that's what the internet was still young and wonderful and fresh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were you straight out of school when you started or what I started it when I was in school

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was I was in the process of graduating and I started it in order to try and help find a job  I didn't realize it would become my job major job

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well done. Bravo. What did you major in Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that was I was I was in business school. I was getting an MBA at that point. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so that's why you probably had to get a real job I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I  Was looking for a real job and I was trying to show enthusiasm for the technology industry  It could have been you're working at McKinsey or something. So it's good  Yeah, you could have made a lot of money I know right don't remind me of that part yes, I  Definitely I definitely probably make significantly less than almost all of my classmates. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not that's how we measure you have more soul left  Not how we measure success in life. Congratulations tech dirt is a must-read  Even if you weren't here we would have I believe I counted five stories in our rundown. Oh, I had them in there, too  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but the big story comes from Monday night when the California Senate passed three  horrible bills  And now the only question is will the governor make them law let's start with a B  2273 which passed 33 to nothing in the Senate  He'd already gotten through the house  The age appropriate design or the assembly as they call it here the age appropriate design code  Yeah, okay. The idea is I think laudable and that's probably why it passed 33 to not  No, it's not no, it's protected children you don't believe in protecting the children

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Explain what it is before we moral panicked sure sure so the the the I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would say the concept behind it is laudable the idea that you know the internet in some ways  There are children on there and occasionally children can wander into areas that are not safe for them  And that is a legitimate concern right in terms of in terms of how?  Children and the internet interact now in the US we have federal law that tries to deal with some of that right we have  coppa the  What is it children's online privacy protection act which has some rules for sites that are directed at those under 13?  What California is doing is really sort of trying to completely change the way the internet works and you know  I think effectively they're sort of trying to turn it into Disneyland where  Everything has to be appropriate for children at all times  That's not quite what the bill says and there's some some language in there that makes it pretend that it does not apply so broadly  But it but it really does if you want I can start to go through  The list of problems is so long it would take up well more than your entire show

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me show the  short version that assemblywoman Buffy Wicks  Published and my my college classmate Roger McNamee  Endorsed he said the big platforms are using disinformation to try to stop it  the California age-appropriate design code how it works  Companies must stop selling kids personal information  Okay, that's fair coppa does say that as well right mm-hmm  Set all default settings to the most private that sounds alright except  It's not just sites meant to be for 18 year old under 18s by the way kids is under 18 not under 13 as in coppa  It means all sites that an 18 year old might visit including mine  Which is everything including our IRC including our forums including tech dirt comm  Design kids experience based on their estimated age wait a minute  Estimated age there's already something interesting  We're supposed we're supposed to estimate how old the person is visiting our site

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes with near certainty there are some requirements that the you have to estimate the age of people who are visiting your site  And it has to be fairly accurate under the law which the the only way you can do that is with age verification

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can ask them, but then they might lie  As they do as one does as one does

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right well we already have with coppa right I mean so there are lots of sites that say you can't access it under 13 and that's  specifically because of because of the rules of coppa which is for sites targeting those under the age of 13 and the way we've  dealt with that is that you know basically every site says no one under 13 is supposed to use this site and then what happens is  Every kid lies and every parent teaches their kid to lie and you put in a date that that makes them over 13  And I don't know that it's necessarily a good idea that we're teaching  Well, maybe it depends on how you look at it might be a good idea that we're teaching kids to lie about who they are  on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's one of those perverse consequences many laws kind of have but but  Would it be enough for me just to put up a sign everywhere?  We are saying you must be 18. I hate to do this because we have a lot of  Smart high school kids who listen to our stuff you must be 18 to visit this site

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That that will not work under this law because the law is not for  For sites that are targeted at people under the age of 18. It's likely to be accessed by  Someone under the age of 18 and again like so there's multiple problems there immediately

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, so am I right? So judgment calls is what you're saying, right? It's just judgment

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not even judgments causes  It's if you if you make a mistake on that then then you're in trouble, right?  So, you know likely to be accessed by you know  If you think high school students might might access your website  Then suddenly you have to be concerned and you probably have to do something to try and get in compliance with this law now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so you said well, this means that we're gonna have to do face recognition to determine whether you're 18  That's that's not what I said  That's not what I said

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is what what this group the age verification  Association I forget providers Association told me right so, you know  I started to look into it because because the because of the requirement that you have to you know  Accurately estimate the age of people on your site, you know  The only way to do that is with different age verification tools  Now there is a company that has a near monopoly on the age verification tools and that is mind geek  Which is the parent company of Pornhub. So they're very good at this by the way  So  One solution here is that every website is going to have to give data  Including like, you know login data or facial recognition data to the company behind Pornhub  I don't quite see how that helps the privacy of children  Across California now  So so this group this  Age verification trade association reached out to me to say oh, no, no, no, don't worry about that  We have a better solution than the Pornhub solution. Oh, thank God  It just involves  when you visit a website we will need to scan your face and  use our special AI to determine whether you are 17 or 18 years old and  You know and then we'll decide whether or not you can visit these websites  So every website in according to this like these people are providing the tools and who are supporting this law  All all every website has to do is install that these companies  Systems to scan faces use AI which of course never makes mistakes and can't be tricked  And and it'll be fine. So people point out like well, you know, they're going to be ways around that  Everyone's gonna be holding up, you know that picture of Jeff Jarvis that you have on the desk

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they said don't don't worry about that  We have a solution to that if it's if if they're unsure  They may have to do a liveness test in which they will make you record a video in which you have to say  Phrases that they will present to you to prove that you're a live human being there  That's like it's like a hostage video just to visit websites in California

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or you could do what they propose in the UK and just go to a local pub and say here's my driver's license  I'm under 18. Am I okay?  It's over. Oh either way we got to know I don't care what age you are  I need to know your exact age. So everybody must go to the bar. Yeah, everybody must go to the pub

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, so the goal of this is I guess I I'm a little unclear on I know they're trying to  I get it. Okay, I can't protect the children  But like is it to protect them from going to sites with objectionable stuff?  Is it for us not to collect their data like I now I know the age of the person on my site

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is that? Right? So yeah, that's that's a good question  And it's amazing how much stuff you have to get to before you even get to kind of the meat of the law  Which is equally problematic. So basically if your site is likely to be accessed by anyone under the age of 18, which is  You know again almost every site  Then there are a bunch of requirements that you have and the biggest one and the most it's it's kind of ridiculous  Is that every feature for every feature on your website you have to  create a  Suddenly blanking on what the DP I a a data protection impact assessment

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's yeah something like it's like the environmental impact report right for every single feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And how we have to affect kids?  Right and there's a whole bunch of categories that of things that it must include in terms of you know  The likelihood that a child will see harmful content on your website is one of those things  So, you know and this raises questions too because harmful content lots of harmful content is clearly protected under the First Amendment  You know there is perhaps strong language on some websites perhaps mine  Is that harmful harmful is not defined in the bill? So we don't exactly know  Okay, just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is that wrote this bill and it is used almost entirely whole cloth

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  From there. This is a nice touch Mike by the way a very nice touch

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bridget Jones diaries movie and then she says gave up her career in Hollywood to protect the children

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she she made it. She made a documentary about kids  You know on their phones and decided that you know bit that documentary taught her about how evil  The you know internet and phones were and so she's sort of dedicated her life now to destroying making a cheesy public service

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  announcements like this  Play my sound. Oh, I turned it off. Hold on  What are we tired of go back I gotta hear what you're tired of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My generation have felt the negative consequences of being an unregulated online space you mean like my chat room

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, so wait a minute  It's time for the internet to be designed with kids teens and young people in mind design it for teens  By the way, that means my privacy policy has to be written for teens  that means I  Have to do a DPIA on every feature to see conduct a risk assessment  Of how it uses kids data make it easy for kids to report privacy concerns  Let kids know when they're being monitored or tracked provide all privacy notices and clear notice a clear language that young  Users can understand how young by the way, how young is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The how old is based on that because you're now tracking everyone's age and you will have a sense of what?  Age groups are visiting your site. You have to direct it towards the youngest of that crew  So as you determine that information then you have to sort of rewrite your policies and and Stacy's right, right?  There are ideas in there that are good ideas in general that website should do the question is how do you you know?  Enforcing that legally is  creating a real, you know a  real difficulty  Under this law and there's a whole bunch of sort of you know liability problems with the way it's structured  I think there there are a lot of things that websites could do to be better about the fact that sometimes children access their websites  But this is really designed to effectively, you know  Wipe out any website that that couldn't be visited by a child, right?  It's really designed to sort of make the entire web so that it's appropriate for children and that you know  Takes away a lot of what is kind of great about the Internet. So when you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Complained about this they said well, don't worry because the California Attorney General  Decides when to enforce this so they're not gonna do it for you. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would hope not, you know, but even that is it's just kind of a weird risk, right? Because it's like I I  Criticized the California Attorney General and lots of things if I keep doing that does suddenly he become interested in in  researching this and the way the law works is not only you have so you have to create these DP IAs for every feature  So we have search so I have to you know  hire a privacy lawyer to do an impact assessment of the search on tech dirt comments sharing  all the different features that we have every single one has to have a  DP IA written and because there's legal liability associated with it  You really have to hire a lawyer to do this  Then you have to store them and at any point the Attorney General of California can  Demand that you produce them and you have three business days  It was it was shorter than that, but they you know, they were nice and they made it something that 48 hours  No, it was originally 48 hours and now it's three business days. So you get a little bit of extra space  And you have to produce other state  Yeah  You have to produce all of those DP IA's to the Attorney General and with the DP IA's if you determine in any of those DP  IA's that a child might come across harmful content or there are a few other categories of things  You have to come up with a I think they say timed plan to mitigate this before a child may access it  and so, you know if I  You know hire a lawyer to go through the website and say well, you know  Somebody does a search if we're doing a  Control on a DP IA on our search function and they may come across  Swear words is that harmful? Well, it depends on the age. I would think it might be harmful for some some children

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't first don't define harm. No harm is not defined in the bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there's also very very use Larry Lester says it's the right to hire an attorney  This is yeah another this is right to hire an attorney

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a requirement  Because you have to go through all these things and you have to have them ready  Because at any moment the Attorney General could demand them and you have 72 hours to produce them for everything on your site  including the plan on how you will  Minimize or or get rid of that potential harm and so, you know  That's that's an impossible thing to comply with for most sites. I mean, I'm sure like, you know the biggest sites in the world  I'm sure Google and Facebook and whatever will have plans to deal with this but for everyone else, what are they gonna do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is a company  Okay, go ahead. Okay, you go  Well, I'm just want to clarify this says for companies with 25 or million more an annual gross revenue  So or buy or sell personal information of a hundred thousand or more users  Or derive 50% of annual revenue for selling or sharing consumers personal information  I think that lets me off the hook. It lets you off the hook, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not quite so I thought so too and lots of people point this out because it's because the law  Yeah, the law is included in the CPRA, which is the California privacy regulation, whatever thing  The California privacy law that came about a few years ago  So it becomes a part of that. So it only applies to companies that are applied there now  So most of that seems to exclude you  The thing is you only have to qualify for one of those things  Not all three of those things that you listed the 25 million excludes lots of people  But that second one says if you hunt if you buy sell or share  information on a hundred thousand users again  I would think that should exclude you and I because in theory I don't buy sell or share  Except when you start to look at the definition of buy sell and share  Which basically appears to include any sort of  Third party service that you have on your website  advertising if you have advertising on your website you end more than a hundred thousand annual users  Then you buy sell or share  Information on over a hundred thousand people and therefore you qualify under the law. So both you and I congratulations

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Qualify under the yes. All right, Stacey your turn. Sorry. I just wanted to  Say oh well, that's only for big companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you bracket off your site if you're doing the age verification?  Can you just say no 18 year olds and then they have to lie to get on because I could also see this  Kind of well, that's what people do with kappa, but it doesn't work this way, right? Right. So I know it doesn't work but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With with with kappa you could in theory get away with that with this because it's likely to be accessed by  You putting a disclaimer is not enough if they are still likely to visit your site, then you could be in trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it affects you too probably Stacey you have more than a hundred thousand visitors all year, right? Oh, yeah, and you would sell advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I do but I don't sell any information on my I don't either but apparently that doesn't matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The definition of sell is much more broad than the word sell implies

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's not in California. She doesn't visit the state of California and get locked up as she  What is her liability she has users in California, right? I know that but I'm asking how do they come after her that I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know how it will directly apply to companies outside of California  But I don't know. I mean that that you would have to hire a privacy lawyer

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To figure it all out that might be an out then it might only affect California companies, which is you and me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we are California companies or in theory companies that that do have users in California  So in theory Stacey if you want to block away and block out all of your California users and then we get back to the whole  Issue of sort of a much more fragmented internet, you know, there are already companies that don't allow  People in the EU to visit it because they don't want to deal with the GDPR  But now imagine that you have you have this in California and that's not even getting into like one  You know assuming that this goes through and assuming that that nobody challenges it or that if it is challenged somehow  It's found to be constitutional now  You have a blueprint for every other state to pass their laws and some of those laws might be contradictory  And in fact, like right now there are state privacy laws like Illinois is a big one  They have a state privacy law that I think the age verification  Requirements of the California law probably violate they violate Illinois privacy regulation  So I don't know, you know, do we just start blocking states one by one, you know, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So like yeah in Texas harmful content could be you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  LGBTQIA or yeah abortion or gay information

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So exactly right so so they can they can pass laws so other states will likely pass laws using nearly identical language  But because it's all within the determination of the Attorney General  Yes, you're right  So Texas could pass this exact law and determine that all sorts of content is harmful and go after websites for it  How close liberal content there literally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, how close is this to the law that be been baroness?  Beben kidron got passed in the UK because they have this law too, right? So so the the UK

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Design code which sounds the same and has basically the same name is not the same  Oh, and there are some some key differences  The first thing is that it's not really a regulation by itself  It is basically instructions to the regulators of the UK data data protection  It's not off com. It's the the ICO the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because it's like harmful stuff is going to be off come right this yes, but that's separate

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me get to that in a second because that's important  So so the the  UK, you know when they were still part of the EU they put in place laws to match the GDPR  So they have their own sort of version the GDPR now that they've you know, cleave themselves away from the EU  they still have their own data protection regime the  design code  Rules are basically an instruction for the regulators of the data protection on how to  How to apply it and and what's interesting is that?  The Baroness her organization has submitted  I think there was something like 250 complaints about websites in the UK that they say are not complying with the design code  So far as of like a week and a half ago  Which was the last that there was a report on this the regulator has gone after zero of those companies  However, so there's been no enforcement which is again. It's entirely up to the regulator there the data protection regulator in the UK  however, every time that any website makes any change these days to you know,  have better privacy rules or better functions for  teenagers and children her organization takes credit for it and claims they're only doing it because of the the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Design just like your classmate just like the parents teachers councils like all these  Moral entrepreneurs as they're called who make a living out of doing this the irony  I mean by the way, you know Mike Mike we wait  This is enough to make me want to go just drink hemlock and and and go off the earth  This is only one of the first of three bad laws Mike talked about  I know we only have an hour this is just the first one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and this is the worst one I'll say but but  The thing that I'll add is Jeff that you brought up that the  The online safety bill which is the other bill that is now making its way through the UK and the same person  Beban kid run who who you know  basically helped write the the design code in both the UK and in California has now said that that is her focus is getting that  Law passed and that will create a whole bunch of other  Ridiculous problems and you know and and it appears that her goal is to export it  And in fact, I would argue that the the California version of the design code is actually much closer to the online safety bill in the UK  Then it is to the actual  design code the age-appropriate design code in the UK because  There's actually an enforcement mechanism in the California one. It's not just up to the regulator to decide  But here it actually goes to the Attorney General and they have the ability to find companies for a variety of different failures

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Under this bill so this bill still has to be hold on. Let me I gotta move it along. Sorry  Sure, this bill has has to still be assigned by Governor Newsom  Seems likely he will since he's running for president apparently and he doesn't want anybody to say you're not in favor of kids  It doesn't go in effect till next year

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you it's actually a year and a half doesn't go into effect until 2024 summer of 2024

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I plan to just ignore it and if they go after me go out of business. What are you thinking Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's what most companies are gonna do right?  I mean there's there's no way to comply and and even if you tried to comply would be so ridiculously expensive  But I think most companies that are sort of you know  Small companies and mid-sized companies that qualify under the law will simply ignore it and hope that the Attorney General never decides to go  After them because that's that's the only way you can deal with it realistically and and that seems like a bad  Situation because you know what what good is a law if most of the people it applies to are going to ignore it  But that's that's what California wants to do right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The next bill  Wait there's more  A little faster because we already know about this bill because it's effectively the same as the ones Texas and Florida  passed and which were  Over turned not overturned but prevented blocked by the courts because it's a violation of the First Amendment. It's a  Tell me what a B 587 does so 587 again just like like 2273

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which you know, it's presented in this sort of noble fashion. That sounds good  587 is technically about transparency and the idea here is that it requires companies  You know social media companies to be transparent about their policies have them published  Where people can read them and they have to file them with the government and they have to sort of live up to the  To what is in their their content moderation policies and and that seems fair. That's mine  It's mild. It seems fair and in theory like there's some stuff that is good  But but the reality is again like I keep trying to explain this like transparency itself is a good thing, right?  And I'm super supportive and I want more companies to be more transparent and I often push companies to be more transparent  Mandated transparency begins to lead into a whole bunch of problems and so, you know again like  I don't have that much time to go through all the I can do it in one sentence  It's a roadmap for companies to game moderation  Yes, because you are filing these things and you have to live up to them and you can only change them every so often  it you know  people who don't run websites where they have to deal with the public or  Do not realize how many bad actors there are with malicious intent who just want to mess with you  Stay way ahead of you and and and and it might just be as simple as spammers, right?  That's the sort of most obvious one  You have people who are more malicious in other ways but spammers, right?  Spammers want to take advantage of your system to promote whatever it is that they're promoting and they are looking for any edge that they can have  Now under this law you are basically telling them here's exactly the right thing to do  Now under this law you are basically telling them here's exactly the rules for how to spam us and we will not be able to stop it  Because to make a change we sort of have to notify everyone that we're making a change and there's a period of time under which  You know, we can't make that change therefore like you have freedom to spam our site and we cannot take it down for for this long

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  past 31 to 3  Waiting to sign to be signed cousin to the show us your algorithm google. Yeah  Yes, finally finally  And well, this one's a little smaller we can get through this one a little quicker ab 2879  Who is it against cyberbullying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right again, it's another one of these it's framed. It's you know cyberbullying. It's a bad thing, right?  We should try and stop cyberbullying  But again, there are problems with this and that it basically is blaming the companies if anyone on their platform  Cyberbullying someone else right now we want we do want companies to try and stop that if companies are aware of people using their platforms  To cyber bully someone else. It's a good thing for them to try and do something about that to prevent that to to  prevent those kinds of things but this bill like effectively pins the blame on the company that  You know if cyberbullying happens on their platform that they are going to to have liability for that. And so, you know the end result is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead with this one it  230 come into play anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what's just in theory right in theory 230 should preempt this bill  I mean in theory 230 might preempt some of the other bills, too  It's a little tricky with that but with this one it seems fairly clear that 230 should preempt it  But again so far we've seen with florida and with texas and with a number of other states that are preparing similar bills  They are kind of banking on the fact that the courts are suddenly like a little bit afraid to  To rely on section 230 and are looking to cut back section 230  So to some extent I think this is an attempt to have this law in place in case section 230 disappears  And they can sort of jump right in and and you know and and what's like a trigger law liability  It's it's effective. I mean, I don't think anyone supporting it would say that directly, but that seems to be the way that this is playing out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As soon as 230 is gone, everybody's liable in other words

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can I ask a quick question? Yeah, I know you're trying to but um  So you've talked about companies your size and the possibility of this what about the big companies?  What about twitter and facebook and google? How do these laws if you're there and and you have any kind of?  Effort to comply. What does that look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I think I think it will be ridiculously difficult. I think that they're they're just going to be in trouble and and I don't  I don't know  You know and and you know these companies have really not taken any stand  On these bills at all. I think no, you know for the obvious reason that they don't they don't want the headline  You know, you know exactly what would happen if they had spoken out against any of these bills  Is that the new york times and the washington post would have huge giant headlines about you know, google is trying to you know  Allow cyberbullying or whatever whatever it would be  Uh, you know, and so there's there's been effectively no pushback on on any of these bills

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why we must defend the internet that's why you know, that's this is why folks I get panicky about moral panic  Is because we've got to defend the freedoms. We're there from this kind of stupidity stupidity

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I I mean  What what what happens realistically again?  They're sort of like what what what has to happen under the law and what happens realistically is my guess is that you know  basically these companies work with the attorney general and  You know try and sort of come to some sort of agreement on we're doing this this and this, you know  Like don't go after us now. I I don't remember  exactly where  Some of these bills turned out because there were there were late amendments on on some of them in terms of  Where the enforcement was and who could enforce it?  So some of these bills originally had a private right of action  There was another bill that actually didn't get this far, which was good, which was the the  Online addiction bill, which it said like  Company reliable  That one did not go through that one got dropped. Um, and so that one was you know, if if a website or you know  internet service  Addicts, you know addicts a child then  Originally parents could sue so all a parent would have to do and say is hey my kid is addicted to instagram. I'm suing  Um, that was a problem  They they took away the the the private right of action for the parents to sue but then they left it up to any  local official so that it was  You know, it could be the attorney general but could also be like a local prosecutor who might be  You know aiming for higher office and what better thing to do than to get a headline where you're taking on the big bad internet companies  Um, I think that that may have gotten limited more and more on some of the other bills  Um, I don't remember because we had like all of these bills happening at once and there were a few last minute changes  So I don't know exactly what all of the last minute amendments were on on all of them  So it might not be that anyone can I think all of the private rights of action were removed  but there is a question of like which which  You know law enforcement prosecutors can can make use of these laws and i'm not sure where that came out in the end

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i'm just looking at the final text of the  2022 73 the age appropriate design code and it looks that one's just the attorney just the ag. Yeah  And it says there uh, it would create a california children's data protection working group  Yes to determine best practices for implementations  so the the the nicest interpretation of this is it uh, it allows the legislator legislature to create a committee and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great like that that part like  Nice sure. I mean it would be great if there were some best practices  But but the fear is with best practices, of course is that like if any if any new company comes along and wants to do  Something different maybe they have a better way, but it's not considered one of the best practices then you're playing with fire, right?  You know then then you're you're you're basically just asking for the attorney general to come after you  And so best practices could be good in that there's you could learn something interesting  You could get such to do stuff  But but it takes away the ability for experimentation and maybe there are better ways to do things and again  You know a lot of the problems that people are discussing and the challenges and the risks are things that are highly dynamic  They're changing the bad actors are constantly adjusting and as a website you have to be able to adjust as well  And a lot of these don't really allow for that kind of adjustment  They assume there's this kind of static world and there's like things that are good for kids things that are bad for kids  And you have to only do the things that are good as you say this uh on at tech dirt.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The bills are fundamentally flawed written by people who do not understand how the internet works at all  I recommend people go to tech dirt.com  Read mike's very scathing article  There are lots of fact filled and filled lots of links  If you want to know more mike has a lot to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Podcasting I didn't even ask him about senator amy klobuchar's  Oh that bill because I knew this would have steam coming at your ears jeff jarvison  Jarvis

Transcript:  democratic members of congress, but  uh they uh  They are back with the jcpa the journalism competition and preservation act look  Who doesn't want competition and preservation among journalists for the kids for the kids for the kids  Uh, this is much I would say for the democracy for the democracy actually absolutely right for the newspaper hedge fund owners  Actually, well, this is the funny thing. So, you know, this is a new bill updated. The big change is  Uh, it no longer applies to big news organizations the idea of it's a link tax. So google  Facebook anybody who links to snippets a link blackmail more like it because well, this is what's funny about it  Yeah, because it's the murdoch australia thing  uh  it's uh, it says they they can demand a fee from these big tech companies for linking to them, right, but  She's she's smart. She's smart. She said well, you know what let's exempt  google and facebook and let's  I mean not not not i'm sorry not exempt them. Let's exempt the new york times  The washington post the fox the big organizations. They don't need the money. Let's make it for the little guy anybody with under 1500 employees  Right jeff. That's good. That supports

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Local journalism small like bed bugs biting at your ankles coming after the big company

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is gannett in her home district or in her home state?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what's there but what's what mike points out and tech dirt is all this bill basically says is buy up large newspapers  Cut down to under 1500 employees and step three profit  uh  You know just  She's he says she's basically saying you get free money as long as you fire enough people first fire enough people  Jeff come on now you do want to support small journalism organizations. I know you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is just this is just ridiculous. This is this is the worst of my  Our field my field i'll say it myself journalism should be independent of  The government and not lobbying to government and that's what this is from. This is the the newspapers association  This is this is the trade associations have turned into lobbying organizations purely and they're going after this they've been going after this  removal of antitrust so that they can all gang together  Which is a little ironic?  Because they're claiming antitrust everywhere else in the world  And they're trying to have backsheesh and blackmail against the big companies  and the interesting thing is I just recommended a book to a to a I had a bunch of  Internet researchers in the school last monday tuesday  and  As we were talking there. I i'm uh, we got into a weird conversation  I mentioned a book that I love called media at war by guinif jack away  You're not going to find it at any bookstore. It's out of print  But uh, it's about how the newspaper industry fought the entrance of radio and it's the exact same  game plan here  to use  Their clout to hash in with government and to try to disadvantage their new competitors because they don't know what they're doing  It's disgusting. It's wrong. It's  Protectionist it doesn't help news. It doesn't help democracy. It's bs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and then mike points out there's an even greater hazard  Because it allows smaller organizations to band together  to form the antitrust part  Yeah to without violating trust laws without adelaide violating antitrust band together to go to google and facebook and apple and microsoft  And say we want some money  and  You if you aren't carrying our journals, you must carry them. So as mike points out, this is essentially  giving  disinformation brokers the right to aggregate and go to google and say well  You the bill says platforms cannot refuse to link

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's compelled speech not is not free speech and the right wing is using just that they're trying to say you can't take down  Our tweets you can't take down our stuff at the same time. Uh, and we're gonna get to something later with about truth social  I suspect  Where the platforms end up in a bind the left is saying take down all the junk the right says that's our junk you took down  and  Compelled speech is not free speech. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's he says it's an end run around antitrust law copyright law and common carrier law  Yep, just to get google apple appers on and microsoft to give us some money for linking to us

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Once again, like the california law is setting terrible precedent. Yeah  Uh, it's awful. It's just awful. Why why klobuchar is not my  I I I wore her hat for about a week me too. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm it's it's I really like her but and he asked the question at the end  I used to just used to think klobuchar was ignorant about how the internet worked. But now  I'm beginning to realize she's deliberately seeking to destroy it. So that's my question is  What what what gives here is it is it the people are just a hot thing to do?  It's good, it's good for it's good for voting to get votes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The internet's evil and it's terrible and it's tearing apart democracy and it's awful and we have to kill it  We have to get rid of it just like every new medium before

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, and it's a certain age group of those politicians doing all of that too a lot of it. Yep. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, so  Nobody nobody lost an election by  By banning the internet in effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's how that's how you and nobody won one by by protecting the internet and protecting speech  It's it's not a popular thing to protect speech. You end up protecting pornography. You end up protecting nazis and skokie  The first amendment is not a popular  Piece of of law of constitutional law  But it's vital to the democracy and it needs our legislators to stand up for it instead of trying to cut through it  And and and it's very much in peril  jeff kossoff  Who wrote the wonderful 26 words that created the internet along with the united states of anonymous and has a new book coming out soon  um  Is also very worried about what's going to happen with sullivan in the supreme court, which is you know  Part of the first amendment and so bit by bit piece by piece  They're going after the most fundamental right in america from both sides because the internet is now the bad guy  Why is this a problem? Why do I find a problem with moral panic? This is why yeah i'm you're making me feel guilty now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel bad that all this time is good. I swore  Critical of the big of the tech giants when I should have been well, so it's not that no it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Equating the tech giants with right? You're right stacy the internet and I think  And I think that's the easy shorthand and I hear you saying this a lot with jeff jeff like for example talking about like  Content laws you're like we have to protect the internet. I would argue that we just have to protect the communication medium that we're  Predominantly using today instead of being like ah the internet like it's a special snowflake. It's not anymore. It's  It's an established method by which we communicate with everyone. It's our  It's our telephone network. It's our newspaper. It's all of this and  I don't know if it's a function of like nomenclature  but it's definitely we we keep  associating the internet with  You know the fang stocks for example or the internet with  Ad tech it it is all these things but it's also more and we've got to figure out how to  Divorce that or talk about it in a way that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I might I agree well said stacy and and and I think one of the questions that  The way I look at it and and I just had one of the professors who in my group of researchers last week  Scolded me for this, but I i'll still argue it  Is that the current proprietors of the net and they are the net's proprietors?  Let's be honest. They're running the infrastructure. They're running the functions we use but they're not forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well, and and and even google is not forever the re they're as big a threat to the to the  True real little internet as as government is and and everybody else that I think no, I think they are they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are a threat because they've totally  They've let ad tech run rampant over it and they they have not been good stewards of exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess what the internet was capable and this and this california law is a good example because they can easily adhere to this law  So this is something you talk about jeff with regulatory capture. They don't mind this law  But it's harmful to i'm a little internet guy. You're a little internet guy, too  stacy  This is harmful to us  And actually I wonder if

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I see happening. I mean, let's be real this happened with gdpr and we were like, ah  It's the end of the world. Um, what happened is we ended up, you know  In my case, it was mail chimp and other people it was wordpress  Other services will come up and they'll be like here we're going to handle this for you  And yes, you'll end up paying them and they'll do it but that that's realistically how something like this gets played out. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I hope so, but I think the other piece of this is what you're really complaining about leo is the  Outcroppings of an attention-based economy which was invented by media media still depends on it  It's still media and that that's what infected the internet  and and that's what infected the internet of going for scale and taking our data and  Abusing us with all kinds of junkie web pages and content  What we have to do what we have to encourage is the invention of the next generations  Um, and as you're gonna hear me i'm gonna do my goodberg moments because by the way folks  Ah, here's the manuscript going in  Yeah, 446 pages  um  The goodenburg parenthesis coming out next june from bloomsbury. Yeah. Um, yeah  um  I just forgot what I was gonna say because of that little exciting moment. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think what we have to let the next generation of the internet. Yes, this is my this is my hope  Is that it doesn't really none of this really matters because the internet  Is so vital and so disparate and so large that it can't really be shut down by these behemoths of government

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We can end up with a lot of bad stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's going to swim in the interstices of these laws and we've got to recognize the reflex to control

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the reflex for censorship for banning yes for um,  Protectionist legislation it happened with print it happened with radio it happened with tv

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tim wu said the the instinct to agglomerate the instinct to  Control is is really about finding all these little things and making one big thing. Well to monopolize

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, fine, that's the economy that's that's that's capitalism that's  Not just to monopolize things too much on that. It's also

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also to make it easier for people to access and make things more accessible to people  so like  think about I mean the perfect example of this was like the yahoo homepage pre google and then google, I mean that  Conglomeratized the internet in a way that made it easy to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Big word

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Conglomeratized. I well I I'm just like i'm like  You remember like we want deconglomeratization that's what we want  But you don't not as a user, I mean you remember having to like  Oh, let's see. What's on the internet. I'll go to my yahoo side of the day  A cool side of the day. Oh, let's look at finance. Let's look at some news. I mean so  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is could be you're right. It's not just about money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also about ease of use and and that's a constant. I mean look at apple versus android

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's that's what that's about. Here's what makes me optimistic is that uh, well I look at things like  The what cori doctorow calls the largest consumer boycott of all time, which is the the widespread use of ad blockers  I think humans  Uh are going to act in their own interest and and this conglomerate is what is it conglomeratization?  Which is what which is what business wants?  you know, uh  Ben thompson calls it his aggregation theory  Um, it's what business wants because it's more profitable  You know, it's what cori doctorow calls choke point capitalism where you have to give a dollar every time you want to you know  Do anything on the internet you have to give a dollar to google  That's the tendency there but humans are the opposite and you know  I have a feeling for instance that podcasting is going to get eaten alive  by big companies by  aggregation  Uh, and that pretty soon it'll be spotify iheart  Amazon apple a handful of companies that will really make all the money in podcasting and all the little independent companies like mine will be gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or worse leo that podcast like blogging when the new york times just like blogging then they took over blogs, right?  And then they missed blogs and now, you know, try to find blogs in rss. Yes, it's tougher  So do they do they ruin podcasting in the process exactly? But

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just as podcasting took over when blogs kind of went away. I think  This is what i'm where i'm agreeing with you jeff. I know it's hard to see but i'm kind of i think  that the the tendency is in the right direction regardless of  This attempt this tendency towards aggregation  That that in the long run innovation happens at a smaller scale and will always win because people are people  Yeah, I hope that's to me the only option now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What role does like the ftc have in buying up these because we will sit well hold up. They're ineffective  One second  so looking at  looking at innovation  think about facebook buying  whatsapp or instagram when they saw new forms of content sharing and social media kind of developing so they could crush it or  incorporate it  the ftc is now looking in their rules for like  Evaluating antitrust arguments. They're looking at things like hey, are you buying up future innovation?  We did a whole thing on amazon buying irobot about the future of it  That is a government action. Yes, but unfortunately

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The government changes every four years in the winds of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Politics that's actually fortunate. We we actually that's that's part of like democracy. No, I know peaceful transfer of power

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I support it  But that's why you're not going to get a monolithic ftc every four years new chairman new ideas  The last one goes out the window priorities. That's why we have to have good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Laws, I mean so you've got your laws the laws then dictate the regulations  The agencies haven't always been so politicized  Yes, they have I mean they always have yes. They always have the commissioners may have been  politicized but the actual like decision making like if I look at the ftc  Fcc the ftc all of those agencies  They have a whole layer of staff and experts that are actually trying to solve this and then they have the commissioners who are like  deciding on some cases and making statements and evaluating decision like a direction

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But trying to solve she's playing newt middle again this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think  I'm gonna have to say government is in the same boat as  Big tech all the all the all the aggregators  The power mongers the big guys and we're just going to have be the little minnows  or newts that swims through the gaps because  And and it's even more than ever before the winds of politics blow hither and yon and you cannot  There's no policy that will survive  To you know a new a new congress none

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could argue that historically our innovation has been around  Technology, what if our innovation is now moving into a political sphere?  So our innovation then becomes about you know  And this is what private equity has done for decades is kind of this regulatory arbitrage  So it could be that our innovation is just going to move from like cool stuff in physics to like really boring stuff in lawyers  If I had a choice that would suck. Yes. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you  You just you just said what I was gonna say if I have a choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd rather have innovation occur with the innovators not with the members of congress and the lawyers. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hard and expensive  And congress no longer funds it and meanwhile congress is putting all this money into these programs and these companies are like  Oh my god, if I could just play this regulatory arbitrage  I could get billions as opposed to going I feel like politics kind of got us into this by  Reallocating money from basic research funding to like weird programs and such. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's hard. I feel so mike masnick just tweeted if you want to see me getting  Increasingly exasperated and frustrated watch the first 45 minutes of today's this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we as I said, we're gonna make it for a good cause folks for good cause  I'm trying to be optimistic stacy if I thought that the future  our future depended on right-thinking members of congress and uh, and uh,  agency administrators  And uh and staff I would be very depressed  I think that I think in the long run our hope our best hope is with individual action and yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of individual action will not get you anywhere. That is such a lie  People are sold on this because we're we're taught to believe that i'm serious. This is this is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll argue with you in a minute. Keep going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay  It is a lie to make us powerless and and I say this we need  We need collective action one as as people but we also need  To get up and find politicians and people who actually can speak to us  Because this lie about individual action if you look at what's happening at a political level at a corporate level  There is no way that is a lie that they tell us to keep us

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I agree with you. I think we should stay politically active and aware and alert and we should write members of congress and all that stuff  I'm not saying give up on that and these people will die  I know new people will come in people will happen. Yeah  No, i'm not saying don't do that and I believe in collective action  But honestly, where does innovation come not from not from collective action?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You cannot have innovation at the scale that we need you cannot have physics innovation  And that's part of the problem at an individual or even a tiny company level  You need big bucks to make inroads into material science and to solve things like climate change  You cannot sit there in hope that some billionaire is going to be like, oh hell. Yeah mars  That's the future and because then you get people going to freaking mars instead of researching it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Researching useful. Well, I think elon musk is no longer our bat last best hope but but in the early days  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That philosophy is what gives him the that that no that but you're talking about today's like elon and so today's elon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is a horrible person but  Because elon wanted to become today's elon. He did innovate  He did do some amazing things and I think that's over and over again. You see that did he yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He did it as a team not just him. Oh, of course he created

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He created a team and yes, he got government subsidies. Absolutely. Nevertheless, it was his vision to do test  You know to move tesla for he didn't create tesla, but he moved tesla forward his vision. He moved spacex forward with his vision  uh now he's reaping the reward of it, which makes him a complete ass, but  But early elon was a mover and shaker and I think that you could say that in a lot of you know early henry ford  Transformed the world later henry ford not so nice  um, so  I this is that this is that  I think this is the way of the world, but I do think that individual action  That eventually becomes collective action, but it starts with the individual  You know, you gotta you know, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You gotta join in on that. Yeah  So in fact, I just wrote this paragraph the last paragraph  The book just today where I was trying to grapple with just that and stacey i'll pull stacey on stacey  Uh, you know, I think you're right, but i'm also going to disagree with you  That I think individual action matters to the extent that  Everything we choose to do on the internet everything we say and don't say everybody that we argue with or don't everybody we shun  Has an impact in the sense that it is a process of setting norms and it's slow  And it's maybe frustrating but we have a responsibility  If we share a whole bunch of junk on the internet, we're making the internet a worse place  If we share artful wonderful stuff on the internet, we're making the internet a better place  So we have that role, but that role is in fact, you're right very circumscribed very limited  And how does society make changes it make changes through institutions but institutions aren't just laws or governments or bodies. They're also  norms  writ large they're also larger views of how we see the society so things like free and fair elections as an institution that we stand behind  Until it gets attacked  Or the first amendment is institution. We stand to mind until it gets attacked  And and so then we have a responsibility as a society to protect those institutions to update them to build new ones  Whatever that might be so it gets fought out at a bigger level of institutions  But we contribute to that with our individual actions, which means we have individual responsibility. Here's how I would put it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are no norms without norma ray  Am I right leave it to leo if you don't get up on the table and you say union now  Then you can have collective action  But it starts with an individual it starts with an idea  So and I think that the big problem is looking to government or google or facebook or the california legislature for solutions  That's not where they start it starts with norma ray on the table  And by the way, I just said that so we'd have a picture title

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was hoping for d  Decompartmentalization or whatever the heck it was she said

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Norms start with norma ray, that's the one i'm voting for anyway  Uh, well, it's not a democracy. You have the only vote  Who's norma ray see how quickly they forget wow?

Transcript:  Now now musk is trying to delay the case  Uh, and you know, it's clear part of his thing bottom line

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Elon was always looking for a way to get out of this. He realized early on oops  And he's just been ever since what at grasping at any straw so that he could get out of this. So now we know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But but it looks like he can right with  Well, you know the the key no, no, no not according to mike stacey will know about this the key is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, oh event. Um event  The thing is why you're on law the thing that gets him out of that contract  With no uncertainty is an mae if if there's a material adverse effect  Then the bid he made for twitter can be abrogated because  It it doesn't you know, you know, if twitter suddenly says oh it turns out. Uh, we stole all our code  And and we have to go out of business. That's an m. A. It's like when hp bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Autonomy exactly that was autonomy was like I cooked my books for however many years. Yeah, we made it all up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there there is some thinking that zacco's revelations

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  qualify as a material adverse event  And so elon's now out off the hook whether zacco is well, but that's determined by a court or a lawyer  So it's not like they'll lower court of chance or he has to say so  But it's just you can make a strong case you can drop musk solicited him to do this  Yeah, he did. I think that was dodgy af. Yeah, you have to prove that  Uh, but I think that discovery  Notice they want is now throwing out. He's now throwing out the spam bots. He's now throwing out the m dows  He says let's let's step the pose this guy because I think we've got an mae here. That's what I think  Yeah, it's the force majeure of like it is yeah an act of god, yep an act of zacco an act of much  Actually is what act of much an act of much. Are you all gonna set up twitter circles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A force mudger. Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it was a mic drop. I think that's right. It was how much is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter circle. I like this idea. You could pick up to 150 people  That is your circle and tweet only to them and only they can respond and only they can read

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a good idea. It makes twitter a social network again. We've been talking about how the world is moving away from social towards creator creators  That's pretty good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good idea. I'm not saying I will do this  Uh, at least you know why I don't see the reason to but the only downside you gotta make this list

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a pain in the butt it's such a pain in the ass who's in my circle who's not in my circle

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, remember what that wasn't that the early days of facebook when you you created groups of people right?  Remember that yeah, it failed same thing with the miserable plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right circles. In fact, that was the term they used  Yeah, uh, I you know the one thing missing if you could monetize if you could say  Uh, I want to if you pay me 100 bucks a month you can be in my circle  I was thinking about this and I will tweet to you and you alone  The most important relevant stories of the day every single day

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Doesn't it seem like twitter already has something like that in their monetization plan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they were thinking of subscribers. They were thinking of doing twitter only fans. Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Super follows. That's what I was super follows. Yeah twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter uh  According to internal documents, uh in in the spring of this year twitter considered  Making a radical change to its platform. This is a scoop from the verge  After years of quietly allowing adult content the company would monetize it give adult content creators the ability to sell  Only fan style paid subscriptions with twitter keeping  some of the revenue  Now you can imagine the fewer that would have created maybe we could thank elon for that not happening  um  the verge says  Before the final go-ahead to launch twitter convened 84 employees  To form a red team to pressure test the decision to allow adult creators to monetize in the platform  By specifically focusing on what it would look like for twitter to do this  Safely and responsibly they knew that they would lose advertising support, but they figured they'd make more money

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Make it up and then up in additional advertising wasn't working so well. Yeah, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  only fans is uh is  Projecting 2.5 billion in revenue this year. So it's not a bad direction  The red team said though they gave they brought the bad news. Uh  we  Among everything else we can't figure out we can't figure out if it's if there's non-consensual nudity or see sam on our site  And since we can't verify that  We can't verify creators and consumers of adult content are of legal age  We can't do this  Uh saved by the bell i'd say saved by elon musk who then literally two weeks before  Said i'll buy the company then they immediately said okay never mind  Forget we even forget we even mentioned that put your clothes back on put your clothes back  Did we talk uh last week about jack dorsey's uh regret that twitter we did not  That he made the biggest issue and my biggest regret he tweeted  When asked what's your biggest regret you might imagine jack dorsey?  Having many regrets  But his biggest regret was kind of surprising is that twitter became a company  A company which he kind of said this before where the centralization

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Of the net was the problem that he regretted that but now we got he got down to it  To say that it should not be a company. It should be instead. He said it should be a protocol protocol

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Definitely can't be owned by a state or a company  And he says it's becoming clear to me every

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Day now that I got my billion dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah  And now that i've been subpoenaed into the case by the way  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I well I agree with him in fact  kevin marx  Said yeah  That was exactly our idea kevin tweeted. We were treating it as a protocol right up until chirp  when twitter  Rug pulled that chirp was a third party. I think oh, yeah, i remember chirp twitter client and killed all third party clients and most apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was that was the bad mistake right there. That was the cliff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter decided no, we don't want you to in fact your friend bill gross bill gross

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So bill  Was starting all kinds of companies and great things around  Twitter because he believed in twitter that was great and and tweet tweeted it treated it  Like a protocol because they had you know apis just like facebook in the early days  valued developers too because they grew on them and then and then threw them off off the boat  and so bill  Started very companies. I actually invested in one  Made that investment rest in peace. I think no actually it's restful around I think  But it morphed and pivoted into about a hundred different things  He started twitter advertising companies  Twitter other things remember the twitter search started not at twitter, but was bought by twitter  So then he was going to buy tweet deck, right?  And that's when twitter swept in and said no no no no nobody can have any apis  We're going to buy the only one that's out there tweet deck and nobody else can do this now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here from the wayback machine  This is also from kevin's tweet a link  to a twitter tool store  Where there were all these third party tools?  That you could use you remember these  Tweet dank, yeah that you could use with twitter  To make twitter better and uh, and oh that would be so great. So so in other words jack you killed that idea  Maybe now he regrets it. He regrets it. Yeah  Now that he has talks all the money talks. Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In the wells, well boards talk too and shareholders talk and investors talk and vcs talk. It's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Once you go public, it's hard for you to say. Oh, yeah, we're not going to make any money  We're just going to be a protocol. You can't do that. So well, well who did who did who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  WordPress, uh, god bless matt mullenweg  Matt mullenweg and i got called by polaris  Of vcs when they're going to invest wordpress and they said, um, we're just trying to figure out this this crazy idea he has  To have an open source piece and then it built on top of it and I said it's brilliant  Yeah, it's amazing and it shows how how um, six apart went wrong by trying to control everything  And that's when they fell apart is when they said no no  No, you can't have that many customers because you can't compete with us and wordpress said no, no  We're going to enable competitors so we can grow so we can get more open source coding  And now is a third of the pages on the internet assert by wordpress. It's huge. So maybe beautifully maybe there was a could have been that  Maybe jack could have done. I think that's the model. I think i think wordpress very quietly shows us a model of what can be  I've always loved matt  Matt is brilliant at mullenweg. Yep, and my son is applying for a job there right now  So i'm not saying that because of that matt but no good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and as you know wordpress was for a long time a sponsor, uh,  Matt's always been a big supporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's try i love that. It's a great idea  I mean, I think just to talk about that about the the twitter right now would be fascinating  Now the way matt could be the one to buy twitter and save us from all this  I don't think he's got 44 billion dollars. Well, it's not gonna be 44 billion dollars  It's gonna whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen and the price is gonna come way down and then somebody's gonna rescue them at that price

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's an interesting uh idea. Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The purchase is not gonna happen either musk is gonna be able to back out because of the mbba or whatever use that it was  the force majorie  majore  or  He gets out but has to settle and they get a few billion bucks  But they still but still the price is gonna go down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're pulling they're pulling through I mean because if you think about it, they've got the deal with comcast  So if you've got a network extender with comcast it's plume and then they've got to deal with samsung

So 41 million homes worldwide. That's pretty good  That's those are going to be useful stats. I think

Transcript:  I'm just looking through it  Basically, their contention is that t-mobile and verizon's  residential 5g services  Are growing fast enough to and we talked about this a couple of weeks ago to because your daughter uses it, right?  My daughter uses verizon and it's 25 bucks a month  Less than a third what comcast would charge her for better performance. It's like 150 megabits down  30 up it's great. Yeah, because now that your mileage may vary she's near the highway  Which means I think she's near a verizon cell tower  Uh that isn't maybe too jammed or has a lot of you know  I mean i'm sure it depends a lot on the quality of the service

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the wireless 5g or it's not just one tower. They actually have them all over the there's more cell  towers as it were  Acting to provide the signal. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Verizon stacy where you live i'm gonna guess because it's sylvan  It probably wouldn't work well for you true wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  um  It wouldn't it's not because it's sylvan. It's because we have nimbies who won't let cell towers. So i'm saying it's rich and sylvan

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, we don't want to we don't want to unsilver it's the sylvan nimbies. You gotta watch out for yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, it's a sylvan nimby. There we have pointer ears and little furry toes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, so apparently our city council  Call tried to get a tower for at&t on the island  Like an additional tower and at&t or maybe it was verizon said it just wasn't worth their money. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how's your cell coverage? Yeah, I was gonna ask who do you use and how is your coverage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Timo is probably the best one on the island. I still use verizon, but it's not great  So they do and there are parts of the island where yeah, they have it. There is a tower

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A tower well, you're gonna need uh to go to the satellite then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God no, there's too many trees here for satellite

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, well so much for that then let me just do a little research here  The total square mileage of your island is 65 square miles

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The history again, i'm so obsessed with this island the population

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is around around 25 000  So yeah, I think one tower should do for per per each right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but no because you got to remember we're surrounded by water and water is terrible for wireless  Oh, is that true? Oh really water mountains didn't know that. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the spectrum attenuates in water. Well, yeah, but so if you're in a boat, it's not gonna be good  But if you're on the island itself, it's not gonna yeah, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but we get some of our signals like some people on one side of the island that is close to oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah your bremerton signal would be pretty bad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no water is difficult federal airspace washington dc is actually one of the most complex places  To develop a cell network because of that in  That's federal airspace water and low low grade mountains. So who knew and cia strange things going on. Yeah  Well, that's the federal airspace  Let's just call federal craziness

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So stacy, I got a weird one for you that I wanted to hear your music because I don't understand this and it's down on law navy  Uh aws offering private 5g for offices. I don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Build your own private mobile network

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so stacy says okay. I got a w no no. No, i'm just like i'm like, oh, okay  so basically  There are okay. There's two kinds of private networks one  There was this whole auction a couple years ago where you could actually buy spectrum as a business or school or something  And some companies did like john deere  Bought their own spectrum to have a private network. I'm actually going to go visit it at the end of september  Is it nationwide or is it just in certain? Nope. It's only in near their factory. So they've got a 5g

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they have their own cell network for the factory basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have their own spectrum that they bought to run their own cell network  So that's one type of private network and like chevron has some spectrum of their own. Uh, mit I think has some  Fewer companies bought it than expected, but so that's one type that is not what aws is doing  there is also company like  Like at&t provides a private 5g network where you operate your own cell equipment  So but it's on their network  But it's on at&t's network. Yeah, we have a femto

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have a femto cell at twit because t-mobile we don't have any t-mobile  So we have a femto cell connects to our uh internet network, but gives us t-mobile service

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is your own equipment in your own tower, but it's running on their spectrum  So it's like if you had a femto cell plus a server that's running a core network

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it use your internet landline or does it use their 5g cell network? It would use

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean it could use either I guess but so with the aws  The weird thing about aws is and i'm not sure about this because  aws and microsoft has both partnered with at&t  And verizon so all of those companies have their own private 5g options. So you're running  I think you're running data from  It uses closest aws servers like because they've got their own central office and you're running that data there to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The cloud it uses the cbrs spectrum so it's not using okay it does yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so then the cbrs spectrum is private spectrum. So at&t did buy some cbr. So the cbrs spectrum is like what john deere bought  in  That's so that's 3.5 to 3.7 gigahertz

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's intended for exactly this right building private lte  Networks or public networks if you're a city or a government, right?  Yes, it is not the cb band despite its name  It has nothing to do with citizens band. No, okay  It's in the 3.5 gigahertz band breaker breaker breaker  Um the incumbents, okay, so then are the navy so it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes  But they're okay with it. You're sharing we've come a long way towards sharing spectrum. Right? We've gotten really good at that now, right?  Um, but yeah, okay  So then that's a dedicated spectrum that at&t owns that's in the cbrs band  So they're not running the same at&t network that you or I might be on it's your own dedicated or in this case aws

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  aws not at&t

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it atws it says aws private 5g runs on aws managed infrastructure

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, but it might be that might be at&t spectrum as opposed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because aws has a deal with both at&t and verizon for 5g private 5g networks, right?  So why do you do this?  Just so you have good phone coverage  No, no you do it because you want  um  Low latency you want to control the quality of the bandwidth basically  So you want to say only my factory robots can be on this this could be a for security reasons  It could be because you don't want other traffic getting in the way of your staff's phones  no, no, no, no, it's for like  industrial use cases where like

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like stacy's robot mutations. That was very good. Stacey. I like that. That was good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We used to have a jiff of that actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe this is also my monster and stacy angry stacy hungry. I think it is yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you but you have the firm wrist here as opposed to the floppy wrist as opposed to that  It was a variety of performance. It's very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually my wrists are very agile that brings me to another  Private spectrum for and this is another thing. You're an expert in the cv2x  Applications the the vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to everything else the national transportation safety board just wrote a letter to the fcc  Saying give us this spectrum  They left 30 megahertz of bandwidth for these vehicle to vehicle communications  And they haven't done anything they've they've saved the spectrum but despite keen interest i'm quoting ours technica  from some automakers and industry groups like the association of state highway and transportation officials and the  Intelligent transportation society of america. It hasn't been deployed  In fact, the fcc took some of that and reallocated it to wi-fi giving it to  Wi-fi 6e, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's because the trump administration way way back at the very beginning like 2016 they  Decline the department of transportation like declined to make rules or there was some sort of weird governmental decision  And I don't remember exactly what it was, but I could look it up. So since 1995 the ntsp has been lobbying for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A wireless collision avoidance technology. Wow cars nice  Cars talking to each other saying no you go alphonse. No after you alphonse, but uh, and it watch out here comes alphonse  Yeah, that this it would be huge  The ntsb said the connected vehicle technology would reduce the ever escalating carnage  On us roads. They urged the fcc to make sure wi-fi devices don't encroach on the remaining 30 megahertz  The good news is 30 megahertz is not as as small as that might sound it's not a huge amount of spectrum  But they do it in europe  With 40 megahertz for v2x and this year apparently a million v2x cars will be sold in europe  It'll be in the 10 million dollar range in the next couple of years  So they're going to have it in europe. Will we have it here? Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so it was the trump administration back in 2017  So all the way back in 2017 they said, um, we're not going to mess with this right now, um  And it was it was part of a i'm just reading gm dabbled with vehicle to vehicle in the 2017 catalax cts

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh in 2018 toyota publicly committed to deployment in all new cars for the 2021 model year  but  Shortly thereafter the trump fcc said the spectrum is under consideration for reallocation. So toyota  backed off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they stopped doing because they were the obama administration had said hey, we're gonna go forward with this and then  Very early on in trump. They said no. Um, and so then they were like the car makers were like, oh well never mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the ntsb traffic fatalities last year in the u.s  42,915 people died  Uh, the ntsb documented scenarios where vehicle to vehicle would have saved lives  Uh, I think we need this and I think it's time to move on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so here's I mean, there's a lot of issues there. There's everyone's favorite, which is spectrum sharing like, okay  How do we make sure this doesn't interfere with anything nearby?  Then there's like, okay now we've got cars with this  How what kind of protocols are we going to make it like how are they going to communicate?  How do you deal with and then there's also these ambitious not just vehicle to vehicle but like vehicle to infrastructure  so  How is that going to work? What are the standards that were going to be put in place? And then like qualcomm was fighting with?  um, I don't know who they're fighting with  anyway  It's it's been kind of a mess  As it always is when you're trying to like lay out some sort of regulatory standard everybody wants it to go their way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically and I know you're a big fan of dr  Doolittle I wonder if you could do a little rendition of he can talk to the animals to the animals just sing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why don't you keep trying to get me to do music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I know it makes you crazy to do a duet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even know what you're singing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you remember? I doctor do a little uh, do a little rex harrison like the eddie murphy. No, no  Well, I don't know rex harrison was dr. Doolittle and he sang  And the theme was he could we do no references after 1965 stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rex harrison was a my fair lady. Yes. He was he was also in other things believe it or not  Including dr. Doolittle. Uh, anyway, it was a long lead into an okay story

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a great story if you think talking to naked mole rats is a great thing. It's a great story  You know how they're doing it ai  Ai isn't that cool new york times  Tori called the animal gonna get an nft animal translators  Scientists are using machine learning to eavesdrop on naked mole rats fruit bats crows and whales and even the hope is to communicate back  Now i'm gonna play you  Uh some naked mole rats would you?  Oh boy bear hitties  Okay, listen, do you hear that?  so  So it turns out  That that's a conversation  when two  vole rats meet in a dark tunnel  They exchange a standard salutation. They make a shark. This is what you heard a shaft soft chirp  Then a repeating soft chirp  They have a little conversation  and according to uh  Somebody alison barker a neuroscientist spectrum. They do that on it's pretty high you want to hear it again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, I don't know alison barker is neuroscientist max plank institute for brain research. It's in germany  So, you know, it's good said they have a little conversation  Hidden in this everyday exchange is a wealth of social information. They discovered when they used machine learning algorithms to analyze  soft chirps  Recorded in seven mole rat colonies. Not only did each mole rat have its unique  sound  Each colony had its own dialect  Which was passed down  Culturally from generation to generation  Further horses do that horses do that. There's no organs killer whales

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a whole netflix. Was it netflix documentary or apple documentary?  Probably the ones in norway have their own like culture and dialect. Sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fascinating here  even with get ready for  Put your fascination hat on during times of social instability  Such as in the weeks after a colony's queen was violently deposed  The cohesive dialects fell apart when a new queen began to reign a new dialect appeared to take hold  Now what would you say?  Dr. Barker says the greeting call which I thought was going to be pretty basic turned out to be incredibly complicated  I think it's cool that they can use machine learning. It makes sense machine learning. What is it?  You apply a data set you collect a lot of information  Yeah, and then you turn it up and you try to create an algorithm to detect patterns, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They could mole rats are going to take over with the machine together

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because we can talk to them and say that don't say don't they're not your friends  We're your friends  We can give you a little tiny vol rat clothing pants  shirts little hats  Giving rise to voice assistants that recognize speech transcription software that turns vol rat chirps into text  And digital tools that translate between human languages. So you may not only are we hearing understanding for the first time what they're saying  We we can maybe even talk to them they can use machine learning algorithms to identify when squeaking mice are stressed  Or why fruit bats are shouting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You would too if you were a fruit bat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want to make a google translate for alphabets. This is dana rice  Who is an expert on dolphin cognition and communication at hunter college? I think this is pretty cool  You seem to have stacy to poo poo it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, i'm not completely it's just it's not the first time this has happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But oh i'm excited that we might actually be able to talk to the animals like dr. Doolittle  Several yo, this is the one you know about I think  Maybe not it's up your way researchers at the university of washington use machine learning to develop software called deep squeak  That can automatically detect analyze and categorize the ultrasonic vocalizations of rodents  Oh, wow  Deep squeak has now been repurposed for other species including lemurs and whales

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  While other teams have can they do it for cats and dogs? Yes, they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you do it for can they do it for cows and chickens anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't eat me  Don't eat me that would be bad if they said that you must stop killing us

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean do we want to know what I mean think about if you can talk to a whale or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you know that bats are pugilistic frequently quarreling in their crowded colonies?  And the vast majority of their vocalizations are aggressive  Basically, they're pushing each other imagine a big stadium and everyone wants to find a seat  Said doctors their hooligans their hooligans

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It makes perfect sense  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, all right. I just I feel like here's some fruit bats

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See they're punching I know they're wonderful they're cute actually but no they're not I don't mean they're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bats are adorable  They are actually how really where you got the cutest little faces?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's like stacey stacey found cute birds by the way or didn't you stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did I said I said jeff has this he has my permission to play this tiktok video

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  On the rundown, oh I should have done this before then okay, I thought you're gonna put on the rundown. Oh, I never put it  stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You haven't been posted in the tiktok corner sir, there's no tiktok corner today I've banned it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, where is tiktok corner? I don't see it starts online 55

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  shoot  Just found a line. I put it above

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You stuck it in above. Oh you quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why I don't do anything on the route. I'm like, no, not by the way, just watch look

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This account is private  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they went viral and they didn't want to be viral it was woo pancakes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they do what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were teaching a crow how to play the guitar  They they gave their they strummed their guitar with a guitar. She made it. She made it private

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Crows are pretty awesome. No good for her

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, we should have crows and longs. You could go to the next two lines. She only had 526 followers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were about to put her on the map

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And instead I think she might already have been on the map  I think because what usually when people show up on my poor you page, they're going viral

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she didn't want all that attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So i've got one on the next line 56  Because we did a bird thing. This is a tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's okay. It's okay. Okay. Everybody's the same as a bird. Uh, this tweet a bird telling a hedgehog to hurry because it's dangerous  And let's turn on the sound so we can hear this  Well, because they're here but you're gonna watch it I think the bird's trying to eat the hedgehog no no  No, look, it's the bird's saying no. It's definitely no you're anthropomorphizing. Yes, the bird wants to eat the hedgehog  He says get out of the road so I can eat you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That bird's like why is he pecking the hedgehog? Why is this lunch moving? Why is he pecking it? Crows are smart, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, crows are very smart. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  I think charlie jane anders or annalise newitz actually had a short story about using ai  To understand crows and then turning them into like delivery  birds for  Like hacked biologics. It was a good short story. Here is a parrot

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is something you don't ever want  This is something you don't ever want. This is a parrot who has learned to bark  And as a result barks at the dog  It's a cockatoo  The cockatoo is barking at the dog  The poor dog and the dog is just looking who taught who who taught this bird to talk  Machine learning talk this bird to talk. That's who

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You want to i'm going to give him a number while we're in tick tock corner. I'm going to give you an amazing one amazing  the the grumpy chef  Let me see which one I think it's one  130 i'm, hopefully let me see here. Let me see which one it is. Oh, this is one of your 130. Oh, okay  Well, you're giving up a pic. Okay, very nice. Oh, no actually no, i'm 131. Oh, I love this guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I follow him all the time  In fact, I just saw this tick tock. How funny  He normally he's there to dis  to dis horrible cooking videos of which there are many  On tick tock, but in this case, it's a chocolatier who he cannot  Cannot hear enough just listen

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right, it's time for some more chocolate self-loathing while I watch this genius at work  Get the f*** out of here he's making  It he's making it safe and it works  What kind of evil genius is this? Oh, you know what?  Oh, you think you're slick. I know what you're doing  You're practicing for an actual bank robbery off site like oceans 11  He made a chocolate safe that actually works now what  Caramel caramel like even the caramel just looks perfect. He does a lot of swearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's great. Yeah. Oh, no john's on vacation and uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Fully functioning safe gold bars inside that's awesome. I would eat it but I wouldn't want to because it's gorgeous

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's awesome. Yeah, play the next one too the next one. Yeah, he he can't hate on that. It's even better  No, no, no back on my back on the other rundown. Oh, okay next one down

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, okay, even even it's brilliant. Is this the one where he's making the connect four? Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He just thanks for the spoiler. Yes, okay ruin it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I swear to god, he's trying to take over the whole world  And you know what i'd let him this is definitely not stop. Is this a connect for younger kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We got it till 24 wait, dude

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I've gotten in some fights off of connect four back in the day. Wow  This is all chocolate are they each gonna have chocolate because that's  That's some balling

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're gonna have to get the uh, the bloop machine out for this the intricacy and just the attention is more

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Till it's just next level also the fact that this guy has like alien equipment to cut chocolate with like cncs  unreal, dude  That's three in a row go for one more go for it connect four ten out of ten

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or what's this? I love it how much he hates it when they're good, right? Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, I see that guy a lot. Oh never seen I love the chef

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But then the chef liking something is unusual. The chef is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So john john is uh john is traveling with umphries mcgee. So he did not hear any of those super fan  He's a super fan. Did you hear how many roger water shows he's going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like yeah including one on a tuesday in sacramento. Yeah, we almost went to that one. Are you going to that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, sir. He moved us to friday in san francisco. We're going on the 23rd to see roger waters

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, I have no interest in it, but I love his passion. I just love how much he he enjoys

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he's created a little roger water's shrine out here in the hall. Yeah, I got an instagram  It's incredible. Yeah, no, it really is  It's it's five feet by three feet it should make a tick tock out of it. What's his apartment like what's his home like? That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is shrines. Yeah. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And a couple macbooks and monitors and yeah, he has a cockpit with a bunch of monitors  It's like paradise  When he uh, he's been with us since almost uh the beginning, you know, he he retired he was a it guy  At cal state and retired moved next door to the studio the old the old cottage  Because he was such a fan of the show. He just wanted to live next door  And he would come over every day just to hang out stalker did you think did you fear he was a stalker?  Yeah a little bit or no, I never got a creepy vibe from john. Okay fine. He's a very nice guy  But finally lisa says well, we gotta do something with this guy  Why is he he could he could be there on saturday when you're doing the radio show and get you salads and stuff  And if you know, he slowly works his way up from that to he runs our whole studio  He's the only guy who knows everything works in here

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everything we are we're at a loss if there's no john. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of an amazing story. Uh, he has a pension from cal state  Yeah, he doesn't he doesn't really need to work, but he he likes doing it. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you john

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love you jammer b. Love you jammer b. Yeah, let's do the uh,  By the way benito is the new jammer b

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's going no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's do the google changelog bonita the google changelog  It's a change but it's also a transition robert kinsall who has been at youtube  As their chief business officer is leaving  To be spend more time with his money. He has been there 12 years  as a youtube exec  He really I mean if if you think about it, he's been there since what 2011?  Or 2010 that means he really put youtube on the map  He'll be leaving early next year to start the next chapter in his career. Do you know him?  Yeah, his name comes up a lot a davos, of course  He was kind of the the biz dev guy, right? That's kind of  Yeah, every company has to have a person who establishes relationships maintains them  I also saw a story that susan wajiski had talked to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Elon way back in the day about being number two at tesla  Didn't I wonder if he would have taken over if she had interesting. Yeah, he was kind of always next in line

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, um  What else changelog uh google search  maps  Will identify confirmed veterans hospitals  And abortion providers. That's an interesting  combination  veteran hospitals or abortion clinics near me

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, this is veterans hospitals provide abortions to veterans. No wonder do they no, do I don't know. They're federal facilities. They're hospitals

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. I bet you congress doesn't let them  I betcha betcha  Um  For example when you look up veterans hospitals near me  A veteran hospital chip with a check mark will appear and only places that have been confirmed by google to offer those services  Will get listed the reason this is a problem with abortion clinics is there are a lot of  anti-abortion  quote clinics  That will show up on the maps, but they don't in fact offer abortions. They may not even  Have medical personnel the pregnancy crisis centers. Yes  Uh, so  They will now say whether a place that provides abortions you might also see might not provide abortions  um  So, uh, you know the button will also appear for mental health clinics physiotherapy centers and travel clinic. What's a travel clinic?  traveling physician  Maybe I don't know. Yeah. I don't know  So google actually calls does a number of ways to verify including calling the businesses  Uh to see if they do what they say they do so that's good  There is a new made for fitbit accessory line including a pixel charging stand for the sense  Two versa four and charge five ridiculous charge your phone charge your headphones and charger  Well apple has a bunch of these right?
