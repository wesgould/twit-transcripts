Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw Padres back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Temporarily he was visiting.  Yeah, that's great.  From Rome. Well, he's going back in a week or two to Rome.  But yeah, it was nice to have him on Twitter.  It's always great to have Father Robert.  Yeah, he's great.  Just as he was at DEF CON, the hacker convention, he brought the DEF CON badge, which was very cool.  We talked about it on Twitter this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We got to come back to that.  The Padre at DEF CON, we got to hear more about.  I know. Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know.  Also here's Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IOT.com.  Hello.  She remembers so fondly those days at GigaOM.  She has not changed her Twitter handle.  She's still at GigaStacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would you want to change your Twitter handle?  It's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's done. It's cooked no matter what.  She was kind of gigging.  I like it.  Three jobs ago and still doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could be Yada Stacey now because there's even more data.  Even more data in my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yada Stacey. GigaStacey. Yada Stacey. Pettast... No, Pettastacey is not good.  Matthew Ingram is also here.  He's just at Matthew I on the Twitter.  Former GigaOM alumna.  Actually, you're always an alumnus of GigaOM.  He's currently chief digital writer at the Columbia Journalism Review.  Hi, Matthew.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good to see you.  So, Stacey, you, given an opportunity, and Google has been pretty forthright about this new Pixel 4 phone,  which they probably will announce in the next, probably in October.  We've seen leaks of the back and the front.  Google themselves have published a picture of the back.  We've heard a lot about the Soli engine, the new cameras, and you decided to take this week and buy a Pixel 3a.  What the what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. I know.  But, okay, hear me out.  I have really good reasons.  And I think there are a lot of other people are going to have these reasons.  And it's not just to make Karsten feel better and like get on the Karsten tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would it make Karsten feel better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He told me he wanted to like get people to buy the 3a.  You have a 3a?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love the 3a. It's an awesome phone.  Everyone should buy one.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Yeah, see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So here's my logic because, and this is important, when I went on to buy it today, the 3a cost $399.  Pretty good price.  And there are notice counts.  Pretty good price.  It's a good price for a really good phone.  It has night sight.  It has all the things that I love and want and currently have on my Pixel 2.  And I'm graduating from that.  It's a good upgrade to my Pixel 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  Yeah.  And you're giving your daughter the Pixel 2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She gets the Pixel 2.  But the three, just the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL are on sale.  So the Pixel 3 was $499.  So I sat there looking at the two phones and I'm like, which do I want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $300 off right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that was it.  But I didn't see a reason to pay $100 more for a phone.  And part of it is this phone is really good.  I love my 2a.  It takes great photos, which is the biggest thing I probably ask of my phone right now.  And when I look at the 4, because I know I was thinking about sticking around for that because I wanted to try Soli.  But the Google Nest Hub Max, so many words in such a random order, that's going to have projects Soli in it.  So now I can try it on a smartphone device, which is actually where it belongs.  Yeah, because that's all my logic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about that last week.  Gestures make a lot more sense on a device that's sitting on a counter than they do with your phone right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Are you using Fi?  What are you using for the carrier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually use Verizon.  I don't use Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, you're a Fi guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm a half Fi guy.  Half Fi.  My international phone is Fi.  But my this phone is AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty fly for a Fi guy.  I like it, Matthew.  Show title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I recently resurrected my, because I've been kind of going on a Samsung kick and just got the Note 10 plus and stuff.  But they pushed out an update to the beta of Android 10, which is now the official name, on the Pixel 3 XL.  And it actually fixed.  I was having problems with the betas, but this has been very stable.  I think we're getting close.  In fact, rumor has it September 3rd, we will get the final version of Android 10.  At least that's the smart money is betting on that.  And I have to say, this is a great phone.  I'm looking forward to the Pixel 4, though.  I will buy it as well as the new iPhone 11 Pro or whatever they call it, as well as the Note 10 Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just want my Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you buy everything, Liam.  I have to for review purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't, you know, I don't mind.  I mean, you know, I got a budget to do that.  That's part of the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should I give my Huawei P20?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a darn good phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Karsten went right on the mark.  Karsten says no.  Karsten has opinions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a darn good phone.  I have a P20 somewhere.  It has a great camera.  It's a little out of date now.  They have more recent cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, though, any modern phone is going to have a pretty good camera.  The Note 10 Plus is excellent.  Any good phone, any modern phone.  I'm curious, really curious what Google is going to do with the cameras in the Pixel 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to wait and see what happens.  Like, does the Huawei just stop updating suddenly?  Do Google Apps disappear and then I can't reinstall them?  What's going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, isn't Huawei in purgatory right now or is it limbo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google says the Mate 30 can't be sold with licensed Android or licensed Google Apps.  So the newer Huawei, and Huawei, by the way, says, that's okay.  We're ready with our own operating system.  But who would want that if you have a choice?  Well, if you're in China, maybe you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's real time, you know, live backup to China.  To China, yeah.  To China.  So all your files are kept safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you lose your phone, you can petition the government for all of them back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We make that joke about the NSA.  We've been doing that for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, nice to have two governments backing your data up.  I think it's going to be a very interesting fall.  There's really good phones out there.  And, you know, there isn't anything.  I think, Stacey, honestly, it's perfectly reasonable, especially at that price, to get a 3A,  because there isn't going to be anything that's going to make you go, oh, golly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that the problem with the phone market right now?  Like, there's lots of the phones that people have that are one generation, even two generations.  Yeah, there's still great phones.  And there's nothing really...  Wait a minute.  I think...  That's quite the sound, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is your dissent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you could make Stacey feel really awful if you want to do this.  I don't. That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go for it.  You're right. I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just because Stacey, more than anyone, anyone, period, I know, who understands and doesn't make fun of gestures,  I want to see you playing with gestures on a Pixel 4.  You can see me play with it on a hub.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not to say.  Because we make fun of you with the phone and all this, and you've got to say, no, Jeff, you're full of crap.  Let me show you.  I think you, more than anyone, should be that person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, this is... I don't believe in it on a phone.  But if, Leo, you want to send me the Pixel 4, then I will gesture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have gestures in the Note 10+, because that stylus has, in fact,  the very first part of the onboarding with the Note 10+, is they say, OK, now take out the stylus, press the button,  and you can go clockwise, counterclockwise, tap.  And use it once then?  And that, no. That's it. Once.  But you can have... I saw an ad where you can have a presentation on your Note 10+,  and while you're showing the client, who's got to, of course, get very close to your phone to see this presentation,  and you can just swipe in the air with your pen and go to the next slide. Next slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't want to be Debbie Downer, but are that many people really going to do gestures?  I mean, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe lots of people will do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not on the phone. That's why I'm like, eh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just don't see it. I just don't see it.  I do see, and I think you're right, Stacey, in the kitchen where your Hub Max will be,  I do see the idea that you've got your hands...  Page flipping.  Yeah, and you're going like that, or you're going to stop.  Sure.  I can see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I...  I mean, I know we can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Voice works well for that too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need a minority report thing where you have to put on a glove and then you can like...  No, no. That was... Al McLeabs had that.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had that forearm thing that actually did exactly that.  That was Rio's rubber suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And then, yeah. Don't talk about my rubber suit. Those are the bad old...  There was... Apple had a Magic Leap device that you put in front of your screen and you could gesture,  and it never caught on. Nobody was really that interested in it.  So, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I...  Somebody in the chat room did mention driving. It could be... I could see it being useful for that.  Put your hands on the wheel, young man.  Waze?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Put your hands on the wheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Waze has used that for some time. You know, one of the problems with Waze is they want you to report hazards,  police in the road, whatever, but you can't really do it without fiddling with the phone,  except they do have... I doubt anybody uses it, but they have a gesture.  Really?  Yeah. You can wave your... And they've had that for years. You wave your hand over the phone and it says,  oh, what would you like to report?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  What? You had to be open in the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Waze is running...  Can you just show up or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I can't remember what the gesture was. Waze is running in your phone, right?  Because you're using it, right?  Okay.  And then if... In there... And maybe they've taken it out since, but I've used it at least two or three years ago, the gesture.  Did it turn on or something?  Yeah. It's in the settings. Let me see if I can find it.  I can never... You know, I can never... The Waze interface... I don't know what...  I just said, it's not intuitive.  I don't know what to tap here. I always end up tapping carpool and I don't... No, I don't want a carpool.  I don't... So that... No. I don't know what to tap in here.  To start the... Select vehicle type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need a UX show just for stuff like this.  Although... So...  Just to critique UX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will say to you guys, and I don't know if you want to talk about this because it is not Google related at all, but last week on Thursday I was at Microsoft where I...  Imagine that ever bothers us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. That's how it is.  I've heard this show, Stacey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I tried to stick to the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry. Go ahead.  I tried on the Microsoft HoloLens 2 and if you want to see Stacey running around doing strange gestures, that is...  Part of it was getting used to like the gestures and the HoloLens 2 is actually really amazing compared to the HoloLens 1 and other VR experiences... Sorry, AR experiences I've had.  But they also have eye tracking.  So when I looked at things, I could click, you know, I click...  What's the word for that?  I could look at something and I didn't need to blink.  I just looked at it.  And if I looked at it for long enough, it would like go to the next slide.  So the word next is there.  I would look at it and it would go.  It was pretty cool.  Although I was very focused and I got so focused trying to like...  I am looking at you.  I started getting a headache.  So I had to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someone pointed out that you running around doing strange gestures would make a very successful YouTube channel.  So in case you're thinking of branching out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  IoT ballet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  Like I don't know about that.  My funny gestures are pretty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Learning gestures with Stacey Higginbottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it was very intuitive and they have this beautiful little bird that will fly to your hand.  It hangs out there and you're like, hello bird.  It's kind of weird though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it doesn't land quite right, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you look at it too long, it explodes.  It feels very primitive to me.  No, I thought it was...  I understand the benefit of it.  Of course it's primitive.  These gestures are...  Anyway, go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So those gestures, although I did, like if I looked at...  They had a thing where if I looked at something and I said explode, the thing would explode.  That's pretty cool.  So I was like...  And also if I went...  Not the bird, it was gems.  There were still exploding birds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, exploding gems?  Is that J-I-M or gem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  Sorry.  G-E-M.  Oh, gems.  Exploding gems.  Gemstones.  How about gems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so like a game like exploding gems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was the same thing you used to calibrate is you would watch them and then afterwards...  And there's an amazing silicon firepower in there.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool.  But...  You're such a geek.  Oh, I know.  But it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean like the processor they built for this is pretty awesome.  I'm going to write about it for sure because I am still excited.  Is it an ARM chip?  It is.  I don't know the architecture actually.  I feel like they did their own.  It was a...  Okay, don't ask me these questions yet because I'm still writing and until I finish writing,  I won't have all the words in my brain.  But I will come back to you and tell you about it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got to say exploding gems would also be pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is going to be not Android Quince Pie, Android Quince Jelly, Android...  It's going to be Android 10.  They're dumping the desserts and I have a little regret on that.  But I think Google's absolutely correct that that was a dopey idea and it didn't work globally.  It was cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on, it was cute.  Cute and dopey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what was cute was the unveiling of the statue on the Googleplex.  But the problem now is if you go back there now, they're all falling apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, are they really?  It is like a terrible...  Old amusement park.  A bad amusement park.  A bad amusement park.  It's been abandoned for 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Five Nights at Freddy's.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's depressing.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why didn't they build them to...  I guess they just didn't care to build them to last.  Technologies have been changing.  No, they were meant to be for...  Fiberglass, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fiberglass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  I wonder if there's any...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should turn it into a putt-putt course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you seen it?  I don't want a putt-putt course.  That's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I was writing a hot take, if I was still in the hot take business, I would be writing  about how this is a perfect example of how Google used to be fun and is now boring.  See this?  And I liked it a lot better when it was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the stick of the lollipop is rusty.  There's cupcake.  There's ice cream sandwich.  Looks fine.  Eclair, gingerbread, honeycomb.  No, up close.  Up close, they don't look so good?  No.  They're a little ratty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really does look like an abandoned amusement park or a roadside attraction that's seen  better days.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ice cream sundae.  Yeah, so that's it.  I forgot honeycomb.  Honeycomb, yeah.  That was the tablet OS that was only briefly used.  Kit Kat.  So Android 10 is just going to be a big number 10.  Just a 10, and I think that's the way it should be.  Boring.  What is it with a number 10, though, by the way?  Well, at least it's not a big X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mac OS 10, Windows 10, iPhone XS.  Note 10.  Note 10, and now Android 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wi-Fi 6, 5G.  Don't give me counter examples.  I'm on a roll.  I'm on a roll.  I'm on a roll.  I'm on a roll.  I'm on a roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm on a roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm on a roll.  I think I've come up with enough 10s to say that there seems to be, in the tech industry,  an affinity for 10, or is it just by accident?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's big round numbers, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Big round numbers.  And no one wants to go to 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sounds evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spinal tap wants it to go to 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This goes to 11.  Yeah, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, actually, if you think about it, knobs, volume knobs, pre-spinal tap.  Android goes to 11.  No, then that becomes a joke.  I think still most knobs stop at 10, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a show title for you.  Completely ambiguous.  We are actually already 10 minutes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are going to 11.  We are replete with show titles, including Pretty Fly for a Phi Guy and Exploding Gyms.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think we should just stop now and end the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someone pointed out that Twig could stand for this week in interactive gestures with Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they're not interactive if I can't see anyone else, though.  You could just stand there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be kind of like watching synchronized swimming.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Strike a pose. Vogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to have to work on my poses.  I'll get on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is the new thing, yeah.  Which beats the new show we came up with for Paul Therod earlier today, which is Day Drinking with Paul.  Oh, I like that show idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be good. I'd watch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a couple of those on YouTube already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Day Drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Day Drinking and Mukbang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's nothing much more to say about Android 10, except that's it.  And as I said, the rumor, and this comes from pretty flimsy sources, not as flimsy as the sources on MSNBC last night, but flimsy sources that September 3rd will be the day, which would make sense for Android 10.  Which means if you have your Pixel 3a or your Pixel XL or an essential phone, a number of other phones, you can just update and you'll have the latest, greatest new OS.  Enough to say about that. I think we should defer to the all about Android folks for the rest of that.  How about this for you, Jeff Jarvis?  And we've got to get Kevin Toffle's take on this, but Google has a new Chromebook, sort of.  Yeah.  They're teaming up with Dell to make enterprise grade Chromebooks based on the Dell Latitude 5300 and 5400.  And when I say enterprise, I mean these things are loaded. 13 and 14 inch screens respectively.  1080p. Up to 32 gigs of DDR4 RAM.  Up to a terabyte of enterprise class SSDs. LTE radios.  Ooh.  Yeah. Now they're not very attractive. These are the laptops you get from work that nobody ever got real excited about.  But hey, it'll be pretty robust. What do you think? Maybe that's your new...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's a good idea. I think going with Dell was a good idea. They're trying to push this beyond education into enterprises.  By the way, I'm pretty sure if you watch Succession that they use Chromebooks.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Billions is a much better show. I've never gotten into Succession.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I love Succession. In fact, season two...  I've cried.  It's the worst family in the world.  A little bit.  That's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, come on. And Roman's put downs? There's a whole now thing.  Apparently, he's encouraged to ad lib and the actor said I had to go around and apologize because I would go off on extras on the set.  And I had to afterwards say, you know, that's not me. That's Roman. It's not me.  So back to Dell.  All right. So you think they're using Chromebooks even though they're the richest people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think you make an interesting point about the kind of look of them, the Dell look of them.  I'm Jeff's book of the day. I'm reading an unbelievably fascinating book that you would...if you saw this title, you would never, never imagine you'd want to read it for more than two pages.  Track changes a literary history of word processing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my God. And even the typeface is horrific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow. It's brilliant. It's wonderful.  It's just so I can't wait to read it back to the earliest word.  It's from 2016. I found it in a used bookstore in Palo Alto.  Oh, it's out. And it's a Harvard Belknap book.  But it's I doubt it'll be on Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you have to read this one with your eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I hit control KS and my life changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I went through I found the old WordStar manual so I can put in examples.  I'm writing something now. That's going through memory lane about all this.  But it goes back to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the first word processor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's a debate about that. There's the IBM X. What was it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there was dedicated word processors like the Wang.  Oh, yeah.  But the first micro word processor was an electric pencil. I feel like that might have been the first one on micros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably. There was also the IBM MTS team.  Wow.  And this they marketed as a $10,000 thing. This has been a year.  So that was a standalone.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Len Dayton had one moved into his house and a crane moving into his house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Wait a minute. I want this. It's this IBM Selectric built into its own desk.  Yes.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It had magnetic tape recording and playback facilities.  That's the only way you could edit is you'd play back the tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this is it had automated word rep. There was no screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, none.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they talked in the book about how you had to think like a tape.  You had to realize that it was like a continuous string of characters.  And then when you wanted to insert something or delete something, you had to go back to that point with a printer and boom and stop.  And then you were editing the tape this way.  This is how you had to think. Very McClure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. This I've got to find out. This is we're going to be working for this here.  Looking for this Jim Henson in 1964.  Oh, yeah. There's an ad for it. You ready? Here we go. It's called this.  Yes. Jim Henson Muppet Guy before he was Muppet Guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the IBM. I don't believe we'll get taken down for showing this.  What? This is wild. This is Henson must have been on acid.  This is in the 60s. This is some dark crystal stuff right here. Wow.  You can't stop progress.  There's a train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a jet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  IBM is related to the paperwork explosion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The paperwork. Specifically the paperwork in an office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is Jim Henson. This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I can't hear you. What?  I can see all of these people in the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I can't hear you. What?  I can see all of these people as Muppets.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was Statler. Yes. Statler and Walden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was Statler. Wow. I am just. It's so loud. I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Paperwork explosion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's always been a lot of paperwork in an office.  That's a Muppet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But today there is more paperwork than ever before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's more than ever before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the former FBI director. That's Statler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That is Statler.  There always seem to be enough time and people to do the paperwork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There always seem to be enough time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you imagine seeing this in 1964?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is so creepy. It's like Clapham Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There always seem to be enough time and people to do the paperwork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is so.  But today there isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Today there isn't enough time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Avant-garde.  There aren't enough people.  Rocket launching.  Forty at moments.  Cars, helicopters, big office buildings, trains, planes, satellite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Today everyone has to spend more time on paperwork.  Management has to spend more time on paperwork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Secretaries have to spend more time on paperwork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Companies have to spend more time on paperwork.  Very freeform.  Salesmen, brokers, engineers, accountants, employers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like I took the brown ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is whatever it was. This is five years before Woodstock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Officers, office managers, bankers, office keepers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the Kingston Trio era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Everybody has to spend more time on paperwork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And again the exploding paperwork.  Is there a point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We haven't seen the MT yet. Here's Waldorf again.  Or Statler.  Or Statler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  When are we going to see the MT?  A cordless dictating unit.  A cordless dictating unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Under the Brooklyn Bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Is that John Turturro?  No, that's not John Turturro.  That's a fellow MTS team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have yet to show it.  IBM can help you with the time it takes to do the paperwork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I hear the Selectric typing.  There it is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With IBM dictation equipment, I can get four times as much thinking recorded as I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that was one of those dictaphones type of things, right?  Big band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has paper tape and a Selectric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder how many they sold of these.  Look at the size of this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's what they're best at.  People should do the thinking.  That's what they're best at.  Machines should work.  People should think.  Machines should work.  People should think.  Machines should work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is subversive as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I don't do much work anymore.  I'm too busy thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to know who that guy is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did he get IBM to pay for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they also, he previously, according to the book, he previously designed a mascot character for the electric typewriter division called Rolf.  R-O-W-L-F.  Rolf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like Rolf the dog?  Rolf.  Yeah, Rolf the dog plays the piano.  Rolf the dog is the piano player.  He's amazing.  Wow, this is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let me use it.  We just basically reused his old stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The music was composed by Raymond Scott.  He's deliberately jarring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is at OpenCulture.com a whole collection of the surreal 1960s films and commercials of Jim Henson.  Oh really?  I never knew.  I guess he did a lot of stuff like this.  And apparently IBM, when they hired him, knew what they were getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, if you look at, look up the IBM Muppet Show.  So he made a bunch of short films for IBM.  And in fact, he used the Cookie Monster in one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm loving it.  I'm just loving it.  That's...  No, that's McDonald's.  That's credit where it's due again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is wild.  Credit where it's due.  I discovered that in Track Changes, a literary history of word processing by Matthew Kirshenbaum.  I'm telling you, it's entertaining as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to get that, but you can't, it's probably out of print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you know Bookfinder.com?  Yes.  That's the best thing there is on the web.  Best thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, actually it's on Amazon in hardcover 2115.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I paid $26 for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got taken.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should have checked Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they even have an e-textbook version of it, which I think that means you only read it, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because this goes through...  So I did a lot of reminiscing then about my Osborne 1 and WordStar versus I hated WordPerfect  and Perfect Word and Xyright.  I hated Xyright.  Oh, Xyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember using Xyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My parents used it.  My wife had to train all the time using Xyright.  Thanks a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're so mean, Stacey.  Thanks a lot.  You're so mean.  My grandparents told me about Xyright.  Oh, yeah.  I think I saw a painting on a cave wall about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People who think Stacey's nice, just replay that moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's subtly mean.  That's what I love about it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just throwing my two cents in there for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm buying it.  You're showing me buy it, aren't you?  Wait a minute.  Our records show you already have track changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?  What?  Wait a minute.  I bought it twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How?  I should start tracking these changes a little bit better.  Apparently, I bought this book once before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The last time Jeff talked about it.  Is this real life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that...  Something happened with that movie and I've gone back in time or forward in time.  That's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, I was there.  I thought I was there at the invention of WYSIWYG.  Wow.  The term.  Turns out, it was actually used early by Stanford SRI people.  Yes.  Because you know what it's based on?  You know what you see is what you get came from?  Let's see if Stacey knows this.  Kid.  The kid.  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My grandparents used to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My guess would be the army because all good acronyms come from the army.  Come from the army.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  Flip Wilson, as Geraldine said, what you see is what you get.  What you see is what you get.  I remember that.  Who is Flip Wilson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Let's not go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know it.  So, a really, really old comedian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you heard of Laugh-In?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  That was from the 60s.  He was on Laugh-In.  Same time frame.  Okay.  I never...  I mean, I was not alive in the 60s.  Thanks a lot, Stacey.  I thought he was on the Sonny & Sherry Show.  I was protesting a war when you were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Giving up the sugar, sugar.  I ain't giving up nothing, honey.  What you see is what you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then why the diet's 70 percent?  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know.  Then why the diet's 7-up, mama?  Because diet 7-up doesn't have that stale diet taste.  It's crisp, light, and delicious.  Just like me.  Want a Terpsical or a Ram-Pan?  I don't remember.  You better watch your mouth.  I could kill after you.  Somebody hold my diet 7-up.  I hope you fall.  Diet 7-up, the only thing you give up.  And there you go.  A little trip back in time.  That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because I remember that.  Flip Wilson.  Harold Dean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What you see is what you get.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Harold Dean, yeah.  What you see is what you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Harold Dean.  Yeah, I was born in 1978.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to see another one?  No.  Come on.  More Flip Wilson.  No more Flip Wilson.  Here she is with Jim Brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no.  All right, we'll stop it right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, Google Flip Wilson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Google Flip Wilson, kids.  It's worth it.  Visit your local library.  So, yeah, so she said it first, but of course that was in a different context.  Right.  So then they talked about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Jeff, when did you think that you were...  You said you thought you were at the...  I was at a conference.  I don't know if you ever heard of these, Matthew, the Seibold conferences?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Seibold, yeah.  Seibold was a big deal back then.  My parents told me about that.  Yeah, I think they did.  Yeah.  And so this is where we talked about things like the first pagination.  This was way early days, my children.  And we finally saw a presentation of actually a couple of things that we talked about.  This is way early days, my children.  And we finally saw a presentation of actually showing you text on the screen, the way it  would look in print, even justified and changing as you typed.  This was miraculous.  Hyphenation justification was a big deal.  And John Seibold got up and he said, well, let's see what you got.  And he wrote down W-S...  W-Y-S.  W-Y-S, I, and so on.  And he got up and he said, I think that's pronounced W-Z-Wig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah.  He probably was.  That was the first time it was pronounced.  Although, as your book no doubt told you, it was Xerox Alto.  It was, exactly.  Yeah, the W-Z-Wig.  The first effort.  Screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were you there when Doug Engelbart demonstrated the mouse that time?  No, I wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The demo, what do they call it?  The greatest demo of all time.  The mother of all demos.  The greatest demo of all demos.  Mother of all demos.  And I did, Doug has passed away since, but he invented the mouse.  And we had him on the old screensaver show.  Wow.  When he was fairly old at the time.  And he brought the original mouse, which was a fairly large wooden box.  And he talked about this mother of all demos, which by the way is available if you want to see it on YouTube.  It's amazing.  Yeah, it's the first appearance of mice, W-Z-Wig, lots of the things that we take for granted today.  And at the time.  Mad news.  It was pretty forward thinking.  Well, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacy, what was the first word processing software you used?  Microsoft Word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember my mom used WordStar for writing her thesis when I was a little kid.  Oh, you did it again.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She can't help it.  WordStar was great.  She's a child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love WordStar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The world divided itself between WordPerfect and WordStar users.  And then along comes Microsoft Word and then sweeps everything off the table.  It's really took over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the first thing I used.  And I mean, like I hand wrote all of my assignments until I was probably in eighth or ninth grade, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't use a typewriter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, God, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You never had to do a typewriter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I did have to do.  I did it.  Was it a computer literacy class or was it a typing class that was actually computer literacy?  Oh, interesting.  But I remember Excel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's something you didn't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm in love with Stacey's mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the Stacey's mom has got it going on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's an amazing jazz version of that.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fountains of Wayne, isn't it?  Yes.  One of my favorite groups of all time and a great place to buy some fountains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a great store in Wayne, New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Just outside of Bedminster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shall I?  From the Word Star Manual, a dramatic reading of the instructions to move a block of text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait until you hear this, kids.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Put cursor, by the way, I had to explain to people what a cursor was.  It was a whole new concept.  Put cursor on first character.  Type control KB to mark start.  Number two, put cursor over last character.  Type control KK to mark end.  Parenthesis.  For end line, use start next line to include return.  There are entire philosophy classes trying to parse just that sentence.  Number three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can hear people unsubscribing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do this, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Put cursor at destination.  Type control KB to move the text or control KC to make a duplicate copy.  I remember all of these commands.  To undisplay markers afterwards, use control KH.  Control KB and control KK may be entered in either order with or without other intervening commands.  All above commands are on the control K menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need a hip hop track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is what got me through.  Easy script for the Commodore 64.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's advanced professional word processing.  Professional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you know where the term cursor came from, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thinking slide rules.  The first time I heard the word cursor was a slide rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the name for the little transparent thing.  Gizmo and the slide rule.  Well, that concludes this episode of This Week in Gizers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tune in next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poor Stacey.  We're going to have Stacey's mom on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just going to be back here recollecting the sound of the dot matrix printer.  And that's about it.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think about this Lewandowski story?  This is wild.  So we've been talking about this for a long time.  Anthony Lewandowski was a star at Google, left Google and went to Uber, actually to auto, right, which is a self-driving truck.  He was at Waymo, went to the self-driving truck company, Auto.  I guess he ended up at Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google complained at the time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google complained at the time and sued.  But it is rare that a civil suit turns into a criminal action.  Federal prosecutors yesterday charged Lewandowski with 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets from Google.  He was arraigned in San Jose, posted two million dollars bail and was ordered to wear an ankle monitor after prosecutors argued he's a flight risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is he could just call a truck to take him wherever he wants.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This I mean, they said he downloaded 14000 documents, I think.  And he claims that he did that for work.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But on his civil thing, Uber settled with Waymo.  Uber settled with Google.  So the civil suit was over.  Yeah.  They settled for 245 million.  It was a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So but then the judge was like, you know what?  This doesn't look civil.  This looks criminal.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so the judge, the judge decided, OK, we're going to continue to pursue this.  It is unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like to have not not just to have a civil suit that settled then picked up, but but made a criminal case.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Times says this rarely happens with software or intellectual property almost always has to do with a big hardware theft.  Silicon Valley, the FBI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess the value of it is huge.  Maybe they think it's necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So his next court date, September 4th, could face up to 10 years in prison and a quarter million dollar fine for every count.  You could do the math.  Thirty three times a quarter million.  It's still less than they settled for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But of course, it was Uber that settled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because a bunch of what he took with him was schematics for proprietary circuit boards, I think, and designs.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uber agreed to provide point three, four percent of its stock to Alphabet in the settlement.  But as you say, the federal judge referred the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office and they have decided to prosecute.  What a story that is.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and so, so sketchy, so dodgy.  And it just brings I mean, it's kind of brings back to the point of like that whole culture of Travis.  I can never say his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because apparently, I mean, there's some evidence it was Kalanick's idea that he went to Levin Daske said, come on over and bring some stuff with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're that kind of person, I mean, like if someone comes up to me and is like, hey, you say no, I would be like, yeah, no, you get my brain.  That's it.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But he originally like Otto was his attempt to take that stuff and create his own thing.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe he was doing it for himself initially.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Still dodgy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he may have thought it was his, you know, the fruits of his labor.  I'm sure he felt very entitled to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Even though he was probably being paid a butt ton of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's a classic case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A what?  A butt ton?  Is that a new measurement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one of my favorite measurements.  It's 53 Cardi B's, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nicer than shit.  Or crap ton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  From all this.  On that note.  And many, many tons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And talk about our wonderful sponsor.  And you know, it's funny because I told everybody before the show, we got a new sponsor at Zapier and everybody said, yay, we love Zapier, don't we?  Zapier is an automation tool for business or individuals.  I use it.  I have a, so they call the little scripts Zaps and they allow you to connect your apps.  And by the way, no one has more integrations than Zapier.  1500 plus apps.  They work with every app you use.  So for instance, my current Zap, in fact, I'll log into my Zapier so I could show you how easy it is to make and modify a Zapier.  One of the things that's cool about Zapier is you could do multi branches.  So there's no kind of no limit on how many steps a Zap can take.  So I'll show you my existing Zap, which is a pretty big one here.  This is a pin board bookmarks publish everywhere.  And this is what I use when I'm preparing this show and all the shows that we do.  If I star an article on my news reader or and I have also another Zap that does it, if I add it to pin board, it tweets about it.  And then it creates a row and a spreadsheet.  And look how elaborate these steps can be.  These are these are the actions and they have lots of actions.  They have built in apps.  They have popular apps.  You can have it do things like in a Google Sheet.  It creates a spreadsheet row and then you attach the account and then you have a template.  And so it has the information from the various steps.  And you say, I want this, this and this.  And what I've been able to do is duplicate the spreadsheet Karsten uses to build the show with another spreadsheet.  We call it links from Leo.  You test the step.  This is so incredibly useful.  You know, they always say if you're spending time doing anything more than once, you should spend a little time automating it.  Zapier makes that possible.  If you're in sales, you can engage your leads instantly.  You can automatically import new customers.  You can notify your team about opportunities because they support multi-step zaps like my zap.  The possibilities are endless.  And you don't have to be a programmer.  You don't have to be a geek.  It's very straightforward.  You could build a solution you need in minutes.  Test it.  They have great testing facilities built in.  So you know exactly what works and what doesn't work.  No more wasting your time on tasks.  You know, it could be automated, but it's just too much work to do it.  I don't know.  I don't want to spend.  No, you could totally do it.  Zapier.  Z-A-P-I-E-R.  Go to zapier.com slash twig.  Connect the apps you use most.  Let Zapier take it from there.  You don't have to be a coder.  You don't have to ask a developer for help.  We love Zapier.  Anybody who's using it, processing information, using for IOT, all kinds of things.  More than four and a half million people on Zapier right now, saving an average of more  than 40 hours a month.  That's like a work week every month.  You can see I have a lot of zaps over times that I've done in the past.  And some are turned on and some are turned off right now.  But I just love it.  I had bots set up, little chat bots.  It's really great.  Z-A-P-I-E-R.  Zapier.  14 day free trial when you go to zapier.com slash twig.  And there is a free tier.  I pay for the, they call it the starter, but it's more than enough for me.  I think you get 20 zaps.  But maybe for your business, you'd want to, you'd want to be, you'd want to have more.  It's really fantastic.  Zapier.  Can't recommend it more highly.  Then there's a professional and then there's professional plus.  So depending on how you use Zapier or maybe use it in the office, there's team and company  Zapier accounts as well.  Really, really powerful.  Love it.  Zapier.com slash twig.  Okay.  I think we've, this was, that was our cooling off period.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just set up a thing that anytime anyone emails our new show, ask the tech guy, anytime  anyone sends us a question, it automatically populates a spreadsheet for us.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a great way to handle email.  Email is so out of control.  Anything you can do to handle email is great and it's fantastic for that.  Google, this is interesting.  Paul Thuron had this reportedly planning to move its smartphone production out of China  into Vietnam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good thing you bought that three a now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last, the last Chinese version.  They're going to have problems with the ramp up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then some of it will go to Thailand.  Now the good news is Samsung uses South Korea, but also Thailand to manufacture its phones.  So there is some manufacturing base.  I don't know about Vietnam.  How much of this is economic and how much of it is political?  It's, it's completely political, but, but let's, but well, it's in response to tariffs.  So it's both that.  Which could become economic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Both.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  It's just tariffs, new tariffs begin September 1st and then there's another set going in  December at, at, I mean, it changes all the time.  That's the last time I checked.  There's also this greater threat from a presidential tweet a few days ago that he's going to ban  companies in the U S from doing business in China at all.  Which he can apparently enforce.  Legally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Under what law?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Under the law that he's the president.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just going to keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He five days ago, he tweeted, I hear, I hear by, what did he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here by order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Order.  I hear by order.  All of the, this was during the G seven.  Now he doesn't have the authority to duly order companies to leave China, according  to a Georgetown university law professor, but he could prevent future transfers of funds  to China.  In other words, he could cut off the financial transactions, which would effectively cut  off manufacturer.  But according to this professor, he would first have to make a lawful declaration that  a national emergency exists.  Congress could terminate that.  It's, it's, it's, it would be, it would be disastrous.  It would be kind of nutty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meanwhile, parliament has prorogued what has happened to democracies around the world.  Yeah, that's a wild one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, I know I can't pretend to really understand what a no deal Brexit means, but apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's kind of the equivalent of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's got her hands over his, I can't hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boris is basically going to try and shove it through while parliament is dismantling  prorogue.  Yeah.  By putting off, so then they don't have to cut a deal or vote on it.  So they could have a no deal Brexit because the deadline's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they don't have a deal, then it doesn't matter.  It's going to happen.  No wonder we're heading into economic chaos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What else can we talk about about Google?  That's a Google story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we're getting into this area.  They're moving their phones out from smartphone production in Vietnam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a Google story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When we talk about the underlying issues, these are underlying issues that they're  so intractable.  They're intractable and frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm not, I'm not.  Demoralizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has decided because of these intractable demoralizing issues, they're not going to  let anybody talk about embarrassing stuff that gets leaked from their internal message  boards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They say Google becomes a grownup company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that normal in a company?  Yeah, we certainly wouldn't allow that kind of thing.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I know, I mean, depending on your employee base, you wouldn't do it anyway, because,  I mean, you're kind of poisoning the well there, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Many large companies have a code of conduct.  The Google guidelines, which are on top of the code of conduct, say our primary responsibility  is to do the work we've each been hired to do, not spend time working on debates about  non-work topics.  That's fair enough.  It is.  I would tell my employees that too.  But, I mean, you can't stop people from gathering in the lunchroom and having conversations  with human beings.  Or talking about it offline.  So you can't be prevented from discussing certain topics in the workplace, but you could  keep it off of company run discussion boards, Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, and let's look what's happened here.  It's been manipulated.  Like everything in life, it has been manipulated.  So you have some players.  What's his name?  Who was the guy who wrote the horrible memo?  Daymore, James Daymore.  Daymore, right?  He knew what was going to happen with that.  The goal was to get pulled down and then complain about this horrible liberal behemoth.  And so at that point, what choice do you have when you're manipulated that way, but to say  let's cut off that path?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's also, I think there's allegations that Google retaliated against the leaders  of the B2.  That's a different matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, not just the YouTube thing, but also the walkouts.  And that's a very different matter because that goes to labor law around organization  and other things.  That's different.  That then, Matthew, is still about the workplace as opposed to Daymore talking about wars against  men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  I'm just saying that in that case, the allegation is that Google is trying to penalize people  for speech that it doesn't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  And there's an issue there.  I agree that that's not the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a perfect example of HR stepping in and saying, oh, we're just going to ban the  whole thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and there's, I mean, to be honest, I mean, Matthew, when we were on Slack, both  in Fortune and in GigaOM, I don't think either of us were like, hey, hey, hey, let's plot  something.  Right.  You know, so we can make our companies look bad.  Neither company was as huge as Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  But I could see if we had, let's say there was a protest, we might have dropped something  into a Slack room saying, hey, there's a protest.  Yeah.  You know, come on out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.  We did talk about in this timing, because a decent size, I mean, no, it's not Google  sized, but it was a fair sized company.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember that protest I was trying to get going when they took away the peanut butter  machine?  Remember that?  Damn, I love that peanut butter machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I was, I left after the peanut butter incident.  The peanut butter machine was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a huge fiasco.  You know what we're going to put in is a peanut butter machine and a peanut butter hazelnut  machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It made peanut butter like right in front of you.  Yeah.  I heard about the peanut butter machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My goodness.  I didn't know about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then at one point there was like police tape across it.  You couldn't use it because because people were allergic.  I'm using the peanut butter privilege.  Oh, they were allergic.  So people who were allergic to the machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should have made it almond butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Our editors would die if we had that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do have editors who die if we had the peanut butter machine.  So that's why we have the roadie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I could totally see that, but I loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ain't nobody don't like roadie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube Kids introduces content filter for preschoolers, which will launch this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it sad?  If you're age four and under, this is designed to allow kids to watch videos that promote  creativity, playfulness, learning and exploration.  Five to seven, explore interest search for wide variety of topics, including songs, cartoons,  crafts, and more.  If you're eight, I'm really trying to do this straight.  And if you're 12, allow kids with growing independence to search and explore additional  music videos, gaming, family, vlogs, science and more.  When you pick a filter, you'll see a preview of the type of content that's associated with it.  Parents, of course, will be the ones implementing the filters, not the kids.  So when you sign up the kid for YouTube, you know, you'll see what they're allowed to see.  Is this a good solution?  Will it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it'll work, but it says I don't think it'll work.  Why won't it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will people design stuff to get through?  Yeah, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, kids will design things to get through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, a four year old really does.  A four year old is, you know, not looking for.  But there are people who will design stuff to get through.  And there are things.  And the other thing to think about is everybody's standards of what they want their kids to watch is going to be a little bit different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's parental controls.  So you get to choose, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you get to choose somewhat.  But some people are probably going to find some things a little more offensive than other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I didn't mention, but there is a fourth choice, which is approved content yourself.  That's effectively a parental whitelist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that I'm pro, but it does take a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  It's work. Yeah.  You'd have to go through each video yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most people don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to. I don't anymore.  Now I do spot checks.  I do spot checks.  My daughter knows I do spot checks, but I spot check what she's been looking at on YouTube.  But beforehand, I actually did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have access to her history, Stacey?  Yes.  How do you do the spot check?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  I have access to her history.  And you know she's not wiping history.  That's true.  She might be wiping her history.  She has a, if she is, she has a very good, dedicated, you know, and I trust her.  She's got a script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She wrote a JavaScript.  I would be very proud.  You know, she did that.  I'd be like, yeah, OK.  Showed her how to do it.  She asked me that.  I gave her some tips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If my restrictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Grandpa Matthew, do you speak JavaScript?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember when they invented Java.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm kind of doing that with my kids on their TV watching stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do a pre-approved?  Or you post scan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm loading stuff into the TV that we own that I know is good for them to watch just to make it easier for them.  There you go.  Just kind of make a path.  Even if it's stuff that's on Netflix anyways, like here's a database of all the stuff that I know is good TV and fun stuff to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I don't get is why YouTube is in one spot.  I had this parental control before.  This seems like the obvious thing to do.  It was pretty obvious.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they didn't care, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't think they cared.  And I think they put a lot of blame on the not blame a lot of the onus on the user.  Hey, if this is an under 13 year old, they shouldn't even be here anyway.  Screw you.  And basically the market said, OK, real talk, Google.  Yeah.  Our kids are watching this.  People are putting content.  You're making money.  Own up and do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you remember when I when I wrote about surveilling my kids?  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Because you had a keystroke logger on your kids.  What?  Yeah, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was shocked.  We had this debate.  But I wrote about.  Although, yeah, Matthew, my daughter wrote about it last week.  And now I'm like, should I put a keystroke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now you're thinking, Matthew wasn't so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm fortunate because even though we had the Internet when my kids were reading, I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was on the Internet when my kids were young.  It was early days and there really wasn't much that they much trouble they could get  into.  I don't know what I would do as a parent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was mostly what I was interested in was mostly at the time it was AOL Instant Messenger  and MSN and ICQ and stuff like that.  And I wanted to be able to see who they were talking to and what, you know, if they were  saying, yeah, let's I'll meet you at the mall parking lot and take off to Colorado.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't feel good about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did.  How does your daughter feel about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so she's an adult now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the last part of it was my our middle daughter.  I did it with I think the two oldest ones mostly.  But the our middle daughter wrote something about it and about how she felt about it,  which I thought was great.  Yeah.  And she said at first it bothered her and then she felt because I told her I was doing  it.  And she said it made her feel more comfortable because she knew that I was watching and  looking out for her or whatever.  Maybe she just said that to be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  She was writing the story on on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On Giga.  She didn't want me to get fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't do as much Facebook coverage as I used to because I just feel like who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it doesn't bother me.  I'm not on either.  I think that that so we're going to have to let Jeff take the lead on this.  Here's the story from The Washington Post.  Facebook tightens rules on political advertisers requiring further identity proof such as  federal election communications registration.  This is seems like a good thing.  Jeff, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it is.  I think it is.  They they they where they got in hot water here was that any ad that has political subject  matter was subject to this.  Thus, when newspapers advertise their political coverage, they were subject to it and they  got quite pissy about it.  But I think the mistake there was not making the requirement broader than just political  ads.  I think that having transparency around who places ads and who wants to manipulate your  brain is a fine standard.  And there should be transparency around it.  And I think the more there is, the better.  I think, you know, as Facebook's want is they by limiting it, I think they kind of  got in hot water.  They didn't need to get into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So on the downside for for media companies was they in order to I actually interviewed  a bunch of small publishers about this and like big media companies.  It wasn't a problem, but you had to register in order to be allowed to to basically promote  your news story about a political topic and the political topics were incredibly broad.  So you could if it was a story that was interpreted to be about a mayor or, you know, someone  in the legislature, someone in Congress, then then by definition, it was political, even  if the issue itself wasn't political and to register was incredibly time consuming.  Right.  So the problem was it was a very time consuming process to get authorized.  And you had to take that out of personal information and your address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have any objection to it on principle, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. I mean, if it's my biggest problem with it was that it was so broad that lots of things  were lumped in there.  So this one woman I was talking to said they did a story about water quality and somehow  they it was denied.  They couldn't promote the story on their page because Facebook said, well, that's a political  topic.  And let's not forget, most of these publishers have to promote their stories because the  algorithm doesn't surface them for people because Facebook has tuned it to the point  where lots of people, their stuff doesn't even show up.  And then they're told they can't promote it because we already have a model for this in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the broadcast rules.  So, I mean, really, the problem here is that these rules exist and are strictly enforced  for broadcast advertising, but they were never made for digital advertising.  Couldn't we apply the broadcast model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to get nervous about ever trying to make the Internet into broadcast as well  as what's happening in Europe.  So I don't want I want to avoid that kind of language.  But I think that voluntarily for Facebook to do this.  Another way to have done this is to say, I'm here in Austin because organizations like  Trust Project and Reporters Without Borders Journalism Trust Initiative are here and we're  having a meeting around research around trust.  One thing that the industry is pushing on itself is to be transparent about ownership  and contact and who's in charge and all of that.  The FCC doesn't regulate online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I guess online has to do it, although Congress could pass.  Let me read you the FCC regulation.  This strikes me as eminently reasonable and fair when a broadcast station transmits any  matter for which money, service or other valuable consideration is either directly or indirectly  paid or promised to or charged or accepted by such a station.  The station at the time of the broadcast shall announce that such matter is sponsored,  paid for, furnished, either whole in part, and by whom or on whose behalf such consideration  was supplied.  Is this just politically?  This is for everything.  All advertising.  They don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't do that.  They don't announce it on the air that this toothpaste is brought to you by.  In the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that as long as the sponsor's name, but you're right in political advertising,  that's why you see I approve this message.  Yes, right.  In the case of any television political advertisement concerning candidates for public office, the  sponsor should be identified with letters equal to or greater than 4% of the vertical  picture.  I mean, there are rules.  There are rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And be careful, my friend, about trying to bring broadcast rules to the end.  No, you'd have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd have to.  Obviously, you can't.  Some of this stuff you can't say.  But yeah, that's interesting.  I think that's interesting.  In the case of a commercial product or service, an announcement stating the sponsor's corporate  or trade name or the name of the sponsor's product, when it's clear that the mention  of the name of the product constitutes a sponsorship identification, should be deemed sufficient.  So, when we do an ad for Zapier, we don't have to say this is paid for by Zapier.  The name, saying the name Zapier and it's clearly in a commercial context is sufficient.  It's, there's just the higher standard for political advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was trying to say something else, too.  I think that the journalistic organization should set the standard of transparency.  And they should have sat down with Facebook and said, okay, we'll show the way.  We will be transparent about our ads.  But to Matthew's point, make it easy on us.  You know, don't put us through hassle to do that.  But I think there's nothing wrong with requiring transparency in our own business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I'm doing it, if I buy an ad to promote an article or a piece in a journalistic entity,  that's not a political ad.  Why is that being confused with a political ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because you might have Breitbart or Infowars or Jeff's political newsletter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is where we get in trouble, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I make a faux view of what a news organization is to just to get around the rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a huge battle going on right now because Beto O'Rourke's campaign kicked Breitbart out of an appearance.  Right.  Saying they're not a news organization.  And Breitbart says, well, of course we are.  And I'm seeing both sides argued out on Twitter.  I don't. I think it's a bad look to kick any organization out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think regardless of what you think of Breitbart, that was a dumb move.  It seems like a dumb move.  That just provides so much ammunition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I agree that that's a problem for Facebook.  So if.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Facebook just said, if you're talking about issues, you're registering.  Because because I can see why the New York Times would bridle at that.  So the.  I think the New York Times should not have anything against transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Facebook has started talking about having if you are an accredited news organization, you're in a specific category.  Those organizations might not have to put their promoted stories into the ad.  I think they're discussing that, or at least they've talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And full disclosure moment is that I raised money for Facebook for the school to try to aggregate the signals of quality and news so we can help the platforms, all of them and advertisers start to determine what our news organizations.  That's that's part of the issue.  It's not clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and I will say so I'm going to throw this out here as a very small.  What I feel is I'm still a news organization.  I follow traditional journalistic ethics and all of that good stuff.  Right.  I will say that there is a concerted effort to muddy the waters and it is very hard to to to not get co-opted into becoming, I guess, an influencer is what I tend to get called.  And every every day I get requests from people who want to buy access basically to my like to my brand.  I don't really know.  And as a publisher who does, I post my stuff on Facebook and sometimes I have paid to promote it to people who might be interested.  This would be really onerous because I, I am a journalist, but I don't look necessarily like a journalist.  And if you're not in the small group of people who know me, you may not think that.  So this is I there are lots of pressures, though, for people who are like me to not be journalists anymore.  And so I really I can see both sides in as someone who's constantly pulled between both sides.  I'm not pulled.  I know exactly where I stand, but I could easily be pulled the other way if I wanted to make a lot more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think there is no you don't have to get a you don't have to be called to the bar to be a journalist.  You don't have to you know, you don't have to have a license.  You don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You shouldn't have them because that would be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You shouldn't have to.  Amen.  But that means Breitbart can say we're all journalists.  And then when they get kicked out of a campaign meeting, they can turn it into a huge deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's also why Facebook had to say, we don't care who you are.  If you're advertised around issues, you're going to register.  We got into such hot water, said Facebook, because people said Russians were coming after.  Everybody else was coming up.  We don't know who is trying to influence people about issues.  So if you're going to advertise an issue, you're identifying, you're verifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the risk of their of their the risk of their plan that I was describing is that they effectively become the entity that says this is a quote unquote  journalistic organization and this is not.  And I'm not sure we want Facebook to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not they don't want to be in that position either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we already have that, though, with things like Google News.  I mean, you have to apply to get your site on Google News and it can be challenging to get accredited.  And that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I don't think that's good.  I remember a big debate about whether blogs should be in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but Matthew, on the other hand, on the other hand, they're going to do the news.  On the other hand, they're going to do the new news surface at Facebook, the new news tab.  Right. And they're going to have a limited number of what they've said is they're going to have a limited number of sites.  Pick a number out of the hat.  Two hundred, three hundred.  You know, some some number.  So they're going to select as does Apple News, I believe.  Right. Who is in there and who is news because there's such noise and they've been people been yelling at them.  And what one person on Facebook said to me was I can't control your uncle on News Feed, but I need a space I can control where we can put news that's a good environment.  What do you think of that?  Which? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I thought at first my impression was they were going to do what they that experiment they tried before that where they took news out of the news completely and put it in a separate tab, which was a disaster.  They said it's supposed to be no.  So they said that they're not taking it out of the news feed.  It will still exist there, but they're creating a separate place where you can get sort of top headlines and, you know, Google News, Apple News type of thing, which makes complete sense to me.  I'm not convinced anyone is going to go there, but nobody asked me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I just did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeb Rubenfeld writing in the National Review, the right way to regulate big tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, wait, wait, wait. I don't think this is bad.  I don't even know what it says. I just get so tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is an interesting one.  By the way, I love the lead.  He says, imagine you're living a millennium ago in 1980.  You get off a call with an old friend.  A moment later, the phone rings again.  It's an operator from AT&T.  Good news is the operator based on what you and your old friend were just saying.  Our partner retailers have some great products we know you'd be interested in.  Oh, and by the way, some of your comments about immigration violated our hate speech policy.  So we're going to have to suspend you temporarily.  It's kind of what's going on, isn't it?  He proposes, and by the way, Neelay Patel on Twitter completely dismisses this, but I don't think it's a bad idea.  Since you can guesstimate that Facebook makes on average the ARPU, the ARPU, average revenue per user of about $112 per user,  if every American Facebook user paid $112 a year, Facebook would have the same US revenues without any advertising or data mining.  What if Facebook had on the front page a clear switch?  You could continue to use Facebook for free, but here's what we're going to gather about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So poor people get surveilled, but rich people can afford not to.  That's right there.  It is the one flaw with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the one flaw, but it's not a...  It's a fundamental...  If you want a private Facebook, you pay a few bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you're going to do it for YouTube, and then you're going to do it for Twitter.  It's...  See, this is why government exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you pick your service.  No, this is why government exists, to protect poor people.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So people who can't afford to get surveilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you saying that poor people should be able to use a service that costs money for free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm saying they should be able to use a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't we just send them subscriptions to the New York Times for free?  No, no, no.  We have a free Comcast subscription.  If you build...  So right now we've had...  Just because they can't afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they should not be surveilled without their help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've had companies build business models based on surveillance.  And this is where we are today.  It's just advertising.  So we're either going to...  Well, it's based on a deeper data mining than we've ever had.  Surveillance is kind of a loaded word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  Okay, so we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why they call them cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why they call them cookies, so it sounds...  They're delicious.  It doesn't like cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But based on the level of data mining that is unprecedented and ungoverned  and is sneaking into aspects of their lives beyond just advertising on a particular site that they're using.  So when you have all of those things, which we currently have, what we need to do is we need to regulate it.  And maybe people don't get their Facebook feeds anymore.  Maybe Facebook goes out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook is a human right.  I agree.  There are some things, human rights, that should, regardless of ability to pay, you should have.  Human rights.  Facebook ain't one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should you have a right to not have your data used against you without your knowledge?  Yes, and you do.  Just do what I do and what Stacey does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't use Facebook.  So what's this notion that everybody ought to get Facebook for free and Facebook shouldn't have the opportunity to monetize?  It's their notion.  That's their business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's right.  You're the one who's shipping it.  No, no, no, that's right.  And saying, no, that doesn't work for me.  I don't want that.  I want to charge everybody.  I agree.  They chose it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they chose a business model.  You have the right to, right now, it's still a binary choice.  You can use it or not use it.  And I think more and more people are aware of, this is part of the problem, is in the past, people perhaps weren't aware of the privacy that they were giving up.  But presuming that they're fully aware now, they have a choice.  What about a third choice where you say, I like this service, this service is useful, but I don't want to be surveilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they want that as a business model, but that's up to them.  Why are you going to oppose that upon them?  That's true.  Okay.  Shall we read?  Shall we have a reading, please, of Ben Thompson's trajectory on this?  Who has, I think, an intelligent analysis about, Matthew pointed it to me, about privacy fundamentalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I knew we would get to this because this is a great piece, I think.  It is.  Thank you.  And it comes from something that I know raised Jeff's blood pressure, which is Farhad Manju's piece on the New York Times Privacy Project, in which he had people monitoring his surfing of the net for a few days.  And seeing all the tracking resources from Amazon, Facebook, and Google, various trackers on the sites he visited.  This became an issue for Ben because, as you can see, strataquiry is in there and there are a bunch of trackers.  Ben said, which I found odd since I have zero advertising on my site.  So he says, it sure looks like I'm up to some devious behavior.  I guess it's all the advertising trackers on my site, which doesn't have any advertising.  Or perhaps Manju, as so often seems to be the case with privacy scare pieces, has overstated their case by a massive degree.  Sorry, let me just applaud that line.  I knew when I read Manju's piece, I knew that this would be one of those.  That would be losing it.  That and Jeffrey Fowler's piece where he tries to buy a banana with two different credit cards.  Did you read that one?  Fowler's going to be on the Tech News Weekly tomorrow, so be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should talk about their coverage of Section 230 too sometimes.  I don't know the banana story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he wants to know how much tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell us the banana story.  All right, let's go to the banana story.  We'll not go with Ben Thompson though.  I'll go back to Ben Thompson.  Put a pin in that.  We're going to push that onto the stack.  Put a pin in Ben Thompson.  Yeah, put a pin in Ben Thompson and then go to buying bananas via credit card.  Jeffrey Fowler's story in which he says, what we want to see is we wanted to see how much information was gathered with a credit card purchase.  So I went and I bought a banana, one banana with two different credit cards.  The Apple card and the Amazon Prime's reward card from Chase Visa.  At which point he throws out the entire banana analogy because he says there's really no way of figuring out how much information they gathered from that purchase.  So forget I mentioned bananas.  But here's what we know or we think we know about credit cards gathering and how that information is shared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, it's not even about bananas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, it was like a good lead for about five.  The banana was a red herring.  It was a red herring.  Look how long the bananas go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like a macaque.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a yellow herring.  But he does then get into what, and I think this is actually one of those good informational pieces consumers should read to understand the kind of information.  He actually analyzes the privacy policies from the various credit cards.  It's kind of an ode to the Apple card in which shares very little information.  Goldman Sachs, which runs the Apple card, has been prevented by Apple from gathering information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we trust Goldman Sachs.  Well, Apple we trust maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Goldman does have to share information with the credit agencies.  But it does not.  It says it does not.  And Apple says we enforce this share transactions to marketers or a sister company of Goldman that mines credit card data.  Oh, nice.  It's very cozy.  Anyway, he says, you know, that's why you want to use the Apple card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But don't put it in your jeans or your leather wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have it in my leather wallet right now.  I don't care.  I'm a rule breaker.  I take my chances, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As long as you have the leather wallet in your denim jeans, the two negatives make it positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It reverses the polarity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's another.  Fowler writes a lot of pieces like this that I'm sure give Jeff the heebie-jeebies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that was the great thing about Ben's piece was that he pointed out that lots of those tracking pixels, which sounds so, you know, horrible.  One of them, like, lets him use a specific font.  Like it has nothing to do with tracking your behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to point out that the information about the visitor does go back to Microsoft on that.  Stripe is getting information about the visitor because he uses Stripe to pay for subscriptions.  CloudFront, which is an Amazon CloudFront, is probably pretty benign.  It's basically an Amazon DDoS protection.  And it's a CDN, isn't it?  Sort of. Yeah.  And we use it, too.  And so I think that's probably benign.  And of course, Farhad treated it as Amazon.  But I well, but who knows?  Maybe information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a jQuery file.  I'm just saying, I think the point is that some things are clearly.  I have to point out we use a lot of the same stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We use CloudFront.  We use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is about keeping the web going.  The cookie was invented not to surveil you.  It was invented to keep state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, these aren't all cookies.  Some of these are merely scripts or like buttons or things.  But they're all could be used to track you.  And somebody's also said the same thing to me.  You have 16 trackers.  I use Ghostry.  You have 16 trackers on Twitter.  And I said, yeah, but they're but they're not ad trackers.  They're things like this, like New Relic and Google's Analytics and stuff like that.  So there is privacy fundamentalism.  And the point that I think the point that Ben is saying is you don't want.  And this is what you've always said, Jeff.  You don't want the perfect to eliminate the good or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the verb could get dangerous.  It could be used for terrible things.  The point of this article, he says, this is sloppy journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will say that on online, I guarantee you there is someone who is using it.  Yeah, could be used.  Could be used.  So I do believe like, you know, someone's always going to use a new platform for porn.  Someone is always going to use a benign technology to make money via advertising or data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google. We use Google Analytics because we want to know how many people visit our page.  That's useful information for us and which pages of visit we're going to put briefly for just a couple of days.  A heat map tracker on our page to see what parts of the page people use.  And look, that's a usability thing for us, but it's a tracker and it's a third party.  So, yeah, the thing is, as Ben's pointing out, there are good reasons why I use every one of these trackers and it's not for advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think we should maybe I don't think the term tracker is a great term for what you're describing.  There are things that gather data about the user, but tracking implies that that somehow follows you or that someone is kind of surveilling you.  If it's just, hey, what fonts do you have? So I know whether to serve you one or not.  I don't consider that tracking. That's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yet, as Stacey points out, it could be misused as a tracker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let's I mean, this is where our regulations need to go and we need to elevate the discussion beyond regulate tech, which is silly.  And think about it more like, hey, when cars came out, cars were great.  They well, maybe they weren't so awesome, but they were good.  They got you places and some people were using cars to run over other people or to, you know, destroy property.  So we built. We got seat belts and turn indicators.  We create laws to solve those problems with tech.  We're still in this weird place where we're like, oh, we can't regulate technology, but we can.  We can regulate the outcomes we don't want.  If we want people's data to be protected, we should create laws that require you to opt in.  And once we have those laws, yes, some people are going to have to adjust their business models.  But I guarantee you, Facebook and Google will be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have we talked about the how the car industry invented the term jaywalking?  Have we talked about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but hold on. I want to get to that. Put a pin in that one because I have to unpin Ben.  He's been hanging there for a while now. Let me just wrap up his article.  He says the point of this article is not to argue that companies like Google and Facebook are in the right and Apple's in the wrong.  Or for that matter, to argue my self-interest.  The truth, as is so often the case, is somewhere in the middle in the gray.  To that end, I need I believe the privacy debate needs to be reset around these three assumptions.  This is what I want to run by you guys. These three assumptions.  One, except that privacy online entails tradeoffs.  The corollary is an absolutist approach to privacy is a surefire way to get policy wrong.  And incidentally, knock sites like his off the net, right?  Because there's no way to monetize.  Two, keep in mind that the widespread creation and spread of data is inherent to computers and the internet.  And that these qualities, Jeff's been saying this all along, have a positive as well as negative implication.  Be aware of what good ideas and positive outcomes are extinguished in the pursuit to stomp out the negative ones.  That's one Jeff's been saying a lot.  Yes. Yeah.  No, and I think we all agree on that.  Focus policy, and this is the one I like, or I think we should talk about.  Focus policy on the physical and digital divide.  We're just talking about that.  The difference between Facebook's political ads and broadcast's political ads.  Our behavior online is one thing.  We both benefit from the spread of data and should in turn be more wary of those implications.  Making what is offline online is quite another.  I don't fully understand what he's saying there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he's talking, that relates to his analogy of the Stasi files.  So the Stasi had all this information in file folders, so it was hard to access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The East German secret police had millions of these, literally miles of file folders on East German citizens.  But because it wasn't online, it wasn't as mineable, it wasn't as big of a hazard.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this gets to that concept of ambient privacy, which is once we start putting all this data online,  it's searchable, accessible, and mineable in ways that it hasn't been before.  And so I think, and that's a very good point to keep in mind.  And it's kind of, that drives my reporting on any sort of smart stuff that I'm talking about.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think he's got a great point about, like, look at DNA information.  So people can upload their DNA info, which is great because they can find family members that they didn't know about.  They can find out information about their background.  If they were adopted, they can find out if they have health risks that they didn't know about.  So it's all fantastic.  But people can also use that information for all sorts of nefarious purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you don't regulate the knowledge, you regulate the use.  That to me is key here, is that I worry that data has become a scare word.  And that we're going to be in a position where we're going to try to control knowledge.  Men in black, we're going to erase things.  That's why I object to the right to be forgotten and such.  Knowledge in a free society is free.  Misuse of it is about where Stacey's going, and it's quite right.  Your then government steps in to protect people's rights against real harm and real misuse.  But to regulate knowledge or even the underlying technology itself is the wrong way to go.  This is why when it comes to facial recognition, there was another effort this week, I forget which politician said, I want to ban it outright.  Well, tell that to families with Alzheimer's patients.  Tell that to the police who do have a legitimate use of it.  Tell that to others.  Facial recognition is not inherently bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the Stasi have shut him off.  Go ahead, Jeff, you're back.  You stopped at inherently bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it just we should regulate the use of it.  And I forget now.  And I do think that companies are partially to blame for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Skype works.  I got I got Skyped.  Because they've turned their four years, their rallying cry was don't regulate technology just broadly.  So that's why we're talking about data so broadly, because we we haven't been forced to articulate what we mean when we're talking about technology.  And the tech industry has benefited hugely from that because we've steered clear from it because it was a job creation engine, because it was making money and we were worried about stifling innovation.  And it's time now that I mean, that's we're all putting our skepticism glasses back on or taking off our rose rose colored eyeglasses.  There's something about that.  And we're saying, oh, hey, we need to regulate the use of data.  But we still haven't had that.  We haven't developed the vocabulary for having these policy discussions yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think it's it is totally the the fault or partly the fault of Facebook and Twitter and Google.  Mark Zuckerberg admitted in an interview that for the first 10 years, all he did was think about the positive aspects of connecting people together around the globe.  So they had nobody thinking about the negative aspects until everyone got mad at them about an election and Russian trolls.  Like, you know, thousands and thousands of PhDs couldn't spend even 10 minutes thinking about what could happen to your data.  What could if they allowed everybody to use it?  What could someone use it for something bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The best thing about wearing rose colored glasses is that all the flags, red flags just look like flags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that was nice.  It took me a while.  Not as long as it took him.  It took me a while to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So why why did the auto industry invent jaywalking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is a fascinating story.  So they it was a marketing campaign to try and get people to stop stepping out in front of cars because they kept hitting people and people were like, cars are bad.  They hit people.  But if you look at old video of people walking around New York or Paris or London before cars were were dominant, they literally just wander wherever they want.  And cars are like, there's no sense in the corner.  And so the car industry came up with this campaign to convince people that that walking out of cars was bad.  Instead of instead of maybe designing roads or streets or cities in a different way to accommodate people walking, it was cars are more important.  And therefore, if you step out and the J came from crazy as a J.  Bird, I think was the term at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I love your crazy as a J.  Bird walking out in front of that car.  You know, I think the self-driving vehicle industry should take a page from that book because we need to find a new way to get people from walking.  Right after we talked about Anthony Levandowski and his indictment, the New Yorker published a piece from Charles Duhigg, how the Anthony Levandowski indictment helps big tech stifle innovation in Silicon Valley.  Wow.  Now, his contention is all innovation comes from intellectual property theft.  Much of the history of innovation is the history of theft.  Microsoft stole the basic idea for the GUI from Apple.  Apple stole it from Xerox.  The research of Xerox probably stole it from somebody else.  He says these large tech companies are worried they might be on the wrong side of the per loiner dynamic going forward.  So now they're issuing to workers a basic threat.  If you leave and join a competitor, we're going to come after you for stealing our secrets.  So that's an interesting idea.  That is a hot take if I have ever seen it.  Tuesday's indictment is drawing mixed reviews in Silicon Valley, Duhigg writes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some were delighted by the possibility that Levandowski could be sent to prison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He had clearly taken files from Google he wasn't supposed to take.  And he is widely disliked by his former colleagues.  A former co-worker told Duhigg he's one of the most coin operated people ever.  He just goes wherever they pay him the most.  I love that.  Others have been put off by his extracurricular activities such as the founding of a church called the Way of the Future.  I guess devoted to the realization of acceptance, worship of a godhead based on artificial intelligence.  For God who was behind that.  Yeah.  I've clearly not been reading most of the stories.  They're like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For God he was behind that.  That's usually his clause lately.  Levandowski is in many ways a perfect mirror of the valley's worst instincts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so like many perfect mirrors, folks are happy to see him get broken if it means they no longer have to suffer the glare.  There you go.  Charles Duhigg.  I mean Apple did steal that stuff from Xerox.  Not really.  Apple didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although they kind of borrowed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They licensed it.  Didn't they pay a license fee?  Later they did.  Later.  But again, we wouldn't have Windows, we wouldn't have Macintosh, we wouldn't have GUIs if they hadn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Xerox did say that's what that stuff was for.  It was a research issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they weren't trying to make a fortune out of it.  The best part of that story, which I think, I think is that they were trying to make a fortune out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was Bill Atkinson told us this on triangulation was that Andy Hertzfeld saw stuff at Xerox and misunderstood what they were doing with regard to overlapping windows.  And so as a result wrote that as part of the Macintosh operating system, when the Xerox engineers saw it, they said, wow, we never did that.  We couldn't figure out a way to do that.  That's impressive.  So that's how innovation happens, right?  Accidentally.  It's a mix of stealing and inventing.  I mean, Mickey Mouse wasn't the first mouse to steer a steamship.  Let's just face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't start with the Lion King.  Lion King, that whole thing is a ripoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Lion King is Hamlet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but I mean, there's another lion based innovative film.  You can't really rip off Shakespeare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the character's name is Kimba or something.  Literally exactly.  It's Kimba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's Kimba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know this.  So there's another film with a Lion King named Kimba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a young lion and his dad and there's a lion with an older lion with a scar.  It's still Hamlet.  Yeah, it's still Hamlet.  Shakespeare ripped off lots of stuff, too.  Come on.  Let's be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's in the public domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We didn't get to a sense of property until the Statute of Anne in 1705.  The only thing that existed before copyright was licenses where the government, the king,  the bishop would give you the license to be the only one who could print or the only one  who could write about this or the only one who could do that.  There was no notion of owning copyright.  The notion of intellectual property as property is a relatively recent innovation or lack thereof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of people think it's a bad idea.  The idea, though, was to reward innovation without stifling future innovations.  And to get it out in public.  Yeah, the whole idea of patent is publish it.  You own it for a limited period of time so you can profit from your invention, but then  others can build upon your invention.  That seems sensible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unfortunately, the copyright maximalists have extended the period for so long.  Making money is literally the only thing that occurs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Larry Lessig has talked about this quite a bit.  There's a lot of value in the common from stealing ideas, from taking Grimm's fairy tales  and making Cinderella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why the term intellectual property is fundamentally a bad term.  It's a bad term.  It should not be used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, we live ironically in a world where your actual property, like your phone, isn't  your really property.  And your books aren't your property either.  Yeah, it's very confusing.  And your tractor.  Do not bring your property into or out of the United States.  U.S. border officials are really getting aggressive.  Zach Whitaker writing in TechCrunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're coming after my people.  They're coming after your people.  This is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last year, the CPB searched 30,000 travelers devices.  That's a 400% increase since 2015.  And the real issue is that they are stopping people for the flimsiest of reasons.  He talks about...  This kid, it was his friend's stuff.  Yeah, Ismail Ajawi, who's 17 years old, was coming into the United States in Boston to  attend Harvard as a freshman.  He's a Palestinian national living in Lebanon.  He was denied entry because he had WhatsApp posts from friends, his friend's social media  activity.  And it wasn't terrorist activity, just they don't like the U.S.  Which, by the way, I think we're allowed to say that, right?  Apparently not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Be careful, Matthew.  You're a foreigner.  You be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like at my Twitter stream, I'm not getting into the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a bit of a U.S. immigration form describing why a traveler was denied entry to the U.S.  They're asking him about some stuff on his WhatsApp.  The guy says, it was broadcast on WhatsApp.  I received news.  I don't have anything to do with these.  They came to my app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's an interesting point.  So WhatsApp, someone can create a group and add you to it and then send you a bunch of stuff.  You don't have any choice.  And you have no control over that.  They said, when did you receive the photos on WhatsApp?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you understand the concerns of the United States and its citizens when considering the  graphic nature of the images on your cell phone?  Of course I understand.  No one finds the graphic pictures pleasant.  It's inhuman.  Have you ever had military weapons training anywhere in the world?  No.  Finally, considering the totality of this interview and the content on your cell phone,  you have been found inadmissible to the United States.  You will be removed on the next available flight.  Boom.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he was going to Harvard or something, wasn't he?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a Harvard freshman.  This is bad.  And this is happening more and more, particularly to students from Arab and Muslim countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's bad for us universities too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, what did Harvard say in response to this?  Harvard has not said anything yet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I imagine it will.  I mean, this is not a good...  I sure hope so.  This is not good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the claim is, is this is a backdoor Muslim ban.  Remember, the Muslim ban that the president tried to institute was told, that's not legal.  You can't block people because of their religion.  However, they found another way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were some nuns from Canada, I think, that were denied nuns because they had videos  where people were speaking in Arabic.  They were just talking, I think it was recipes or something.  But the border patrol was, well, you've got Arabic videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, really, if you're coming to the United States, and this does not...  It doesn't matter if you're a US citizen or not.  If you're coming to the United States, you really probably should wipe your devices because  I can't control what's on my Twitter feed.  I don't know what's going to be on there when I try to cross the border.  It might be somebody saying, I don't like what's going on in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shocking.  That's why I think there's got to be...  Someone should set up a service where you get a burner Chromebook, you get a burner phone.  Google could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did that for a while when they were promoting Chromebooks.  You used to be able to get one at the airport and...  Rent one, yeah.  Rent one.  That's a good idea.  Talk them off.  Anyway, that was more of a public service announcement.  Are you ready to do the changelog, Karsten?  Do you have the trumpeters?  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the drummers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, the drummers, they never stop smoking.  You know drummers.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, the newest stuff from Google.  Google Maps is now going to let you combine transit directions with biking directions.  What's shocking?  And ride sharing.  Multi-modal Google Maps.  You'll input your destination, tap the transit tab, and then you'll get some choices and you can...  This is... Citymapper's been doing this for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I have an app called Transit that I use for that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can have Uber, you can have Lyft.  Yeah.  You can actually...  Convenient.  There's a little book-a-lift.  If you want, there's a little button that says book an Uber, book a Lyft.  So this is in addition to the new transit crowdedness predictions that they put in there.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uber is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they can... In New York, they can say, never take the M after...  The L.  Yeah.  Yeah, never take the L after 4 PM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google, I don't know if you ever use this. Google Hire? Are you familiar with this?  They're shutting it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never even realized they had this.  I know.  I didn't even know it existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other news, there was something called Google Hire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a job application tracking system about two years old.  This was to simplify the hiring process.  I remember us talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Merchant G Suite.  I'm starting this.  Built for small to medium businesses, $200 to $400 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This came from an acquisition Google made of Bebop, which I guess did something similar.  What was...  Bebop.  Wow, that's like a time machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they shut that down, but they still have five different messaging apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of them's going to work, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, there is news in that RCS story.  I think Google's going to start providing an RCS server.  So if your phone company doesn't, which many refuse to do, doesn't matter.  You can use RCS through Google, which makes Google's messaging more like WhatsApp, more a standalone, not dependent on the carrier service.  And that's it.  Google seems to want to balance, have a balancing act, not offend the carriers too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, does that mean...  Hold on.  Does that mean I will stop seeing the so-and-so liked this text in my group texts as people in iPhones?  No.  Well, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you're still going to see that.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really, that's all I care about.  So moving on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it will if at some point people stop using Apple's messages and start using Google RCS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like that's going to happen.  Rich communications services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was depressed when I found out my kids care more about whether the bubble is green than about what system they're using.  Is that for real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a friend tell me that once and I swear to God I thought they were joking.  Oh yeah, Henry, my son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody in the frat had an iPhone, except for one poor kid who had an Android phone.  And they couldn't include him in group messages, so he just wouldn't get invited to parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, so he doesn't get included because it doesn't work or just they don't like the bubble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, well, I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're only sending it to iMessage recipients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can only do the group messages from iMessage, so because he's a green bubble he's left out.  But that really adds to the overall feeling that you don't want to be a green bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's happened to people in my family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, then I'm giving my daughter a Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, you're going to...  She's going into therapy in 20 years and going to blame you for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Child abuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mom gave me a Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a big deal for kids at her age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's not going to get invited to anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you need to ask her because who knows what's going on in Seattle schools.  There may be more Android phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's the new kid.  She's one of four new kids in a class of 15.  She's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ask her.  Say, do a quick survey what kinds of phones people have.  And if more than 75% have iPhones, you're getting an iPhone instead of a Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When our daughter was 14, she wanted a Blackberry.  She didn't even know what they were because of BBM.  That's all she wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know what? That's completely legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was patriotic, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She didn't even know it was a kid's company.  Unless you're in India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's just like, I want whatever BBM is.  What's that thing with the BBM on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of transit, Google has ways... I didn't know this.  Ways for... Have you used this, Jeff, for New York City public transit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's a crowdsourcing thing.  Pigeon.  They're now expanding beyond the subways. Pigeon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's going to all New York transit services.  So you haven't used Pigeon?  No, I have not. I didn't know about it until I started.  Well, it works from the path. So that's what your train is, right?  That's what I take. Path is a civilized...  As of Wednesday, it encompasses city buses and ferries, Metro North, the Long Island Railroad, New Jersey Transit, and the Path train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, I should install it right now.  Pigeon. Put Pigeon on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to expand Pigeon to San Francisco and Chicago later this year.  It's like ways in the sense that it's crowdsourced information.  So if you're stuck on train, you could say, hey, there's a delay or it's too crowded or somebody just barfed in the third carriage.  Or there's a busker with BO in carriage two.  That kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it comes from actual pigeons, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. There's a pigeon in carriage four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've got transmitters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a dead pigeon in carriage five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The one rule when I went to New York was never get on an empty car.  That's right. There's a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other rule in New York? Never hug an Elmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God. Don't even touch an Elmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't know what's in that thing.  Why would someone hug an Elmo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because around Times Square.  Are we talking about small children?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hugged a minion once, but I was at Universal Studios.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those are clean Elmos. Those Elmos are sanitized for your protection.  They are unlicensed Elmos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I would never hug an unlicensed minion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You do not want to do that.  Never do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me write that down as a show title.  Never hug an unlicensed minion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That has been a show title.  Never hug an Elmo has been a show title.  We have done this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I can't do that.  The show is done.  You have no memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've all been here before.  I blanked it out.  There's a law in the matrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ARCore renamed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've finally got every possible Google show we could do.  We have hit the limit.  When we get to that point.  523 of these, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When we get to the point where it's an infinite number of monkeys have typed out every script for every twig.  We're stopping.  ARCore renamed.  Google Play services for AR.  That just rolls off the tongue.  Add support for Note 10 and more devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is good because it's getting AR into more phones than just pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It now supports 60 frames per second rendering on devices like the Pixel, even the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 3.  That will give you a much smoother experience.  So that's an actual official changelog.  Devices that receive support for the AR service.  LG's G8S, Style 2, Style 5.  Realme X, Samsung A7, Note 10, Note 10 Plus, and the Xiaomi Mi A3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a second.  What?  Wait a second.  Hold a good hot minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What?  Pigeon.  Yeah?  Only works on iPhones.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a green bubble, Jeff.  You're a green bubble.  Who's green is a green bubble.  You're a green bubble, Jeff.  I'm pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No green bubbles on the subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it odd that Google would have an app that doesn't work on Android?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they've done stuff like that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess more people likely to use it on iPhones.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, are we done with the changelog?  Yes.  We're still changelogging.  Oh, I was.  Now we're done with the changelog.  No, I just was curious because.  Yes, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't see it on the list, but I didn't scroll all the way down and my  migraine is coming back.  So it's not.  Let's wrap it up.  Let's wrap it up.  Oh, no.  But I thought the Justice Department talking to Google and saying, you know  what?  You cannot complete your undersea internet cable between the US and Hong Kong.  Did you guys see that story?  That's scary.  It's relatively new.  And I was curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, that's all part of that thing.  You can't do business with business with China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And well, I was curious why it was the Justice Department coming in and doing  it.  Well, I think every.  Oh, I guess they wanted a national security review.  OK.  OK.  So Google applied with the FCC in 2017 for this and the Justice Department and  the Defense Department said, yo, FCC, hold off while we look at this.  OK.  OK.  Oh, that sucks, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No kidding.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you found the story.  Good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I thought that was worth mentioning because, you know, under having an undersea  cable like that is really competitive.  And if you can't connect, if we can't connect directly to China or big companies  can't connect directly to China, that is breaking the internet in a really  fundamental way.  Yeah.  So I just I was looking at it like, oh, well, that is that is a tough thing.  OK.  That is all.  Welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love cables.  Welcome to Splinter Net.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I mean, the main Schmitter Schmitter Schmitter Schmitter Internet Schmitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Net.  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want Schmitter Net.  I own Schmitter Net dot com.  S.H. or a C.H.  I think I did a C.H. as an Internet Schmitter Net.  Schmitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The actual German.  Schmitter.  Yiddish.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds like Yiddish.  It's probably Yiddish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Schmitter Net.  All good things are.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a break and then your picks of the week and then Stacey can go to bed.  Our show today brought to you by Monday.  Not the day.  Monday dot com.

We've got a two week trial, fruit trial waiting for you at Monday dot com slash twig.  Monday dot com slash twig.  Stacey, I'll let you go early if you give me your pick or your thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so my thing this week is a drink recipe.  I figure like once every three times a year I can give you a drink recipe.  I because I miss Texas so much, I've been playing around with Mexican martini recipes.  And I assume you all know. Do you all know what a Mexican martini is?  No, no, no, no.  Really? Okay. Oh, somebody does.  My dog's excited.  Jeff, if you like a margarita, a Mexican martini is like an oversized margarita served in a martini shaker.  Only it's a little different.  Does it have a rim of salt?  It does have a rim of salt.  Does it have ghost peppers in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it does not have ghost peppers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although if you want to take some habanero bitters and just stick that on top.  Oh baby.  So there are two recipes on the internet.  Actually there are a couple more, but the only two that even come close are Texas Monthly did one in 2013 and the New York Times did one in 2011.  Because I am a service journalist, I took both.  You tried both of them.  And I'm going to tell you the New York Times 2011 version is actually closer to the taste of the Mexican martini I know and love.  Which I am shocked. These are people who put peas in guacamole.  That's not a good...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As school up section 230 reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. And I figured Texas Monthly, you know, they would have the best one.  There are other recipes on the internet that include Sprite.  Do not. Do not do that.  No.  But should you feel like elevating your martini?  This also makes a lot.  Elevate your margarita.  You serve it in a martini glass with your martini shaker on the side with the little olives and a touch of brine to your margarita.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Try those jalapeno stuffed olives for extra kick.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which I love.  Jeff, while you're there, go on.  Where'd you say you were? Oh, AT&T.  The best place to go where near closest to you.  You've got two options.  Trudy's is the place where it originated.  Oh, no. Cedar Door is where it originated.  And Trudy's is where I used to go.  They also have a good queso.  Cedar Door, I don't know about their queso.  But there's a Trudy's on 29th and Guad.  And then there's a Cedar Door down by the convention center.  That's actually a legit place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bit of heaven is a Mexican martini and a nice big bowl of queso.  Queso.  Go eat it for me, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You miss it, don't you?  You miss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you really miss it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I miss the food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you have constant drizzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's all.  It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And for the first time in my life, I've been able to grow tomatoes.  So I'm very excited.  There you go.  But there are trade-offs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Give us a number.  So I'm kind of cheating.  Two. Two buildings. Two huge buildings for Google.  When I was down last driving by the construction at Google, I'm fascinated by the new construction that they have.  It's just amazing.  And so there are pictures up online.  This doesn't work for our audio fans so much.  But there are pictures at the link of the amazing roof is done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a garden roof.  Yes.  A garden roof?  What does that mean?  Oh, it's not a garden roof.  It's a tent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a tent roof.  Things grow on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a huge tent over many buildings that we build underneath it.  And it's quite amazing.  You see it.  It's very impressive on the ground.  The weird thing with the picture is it looks like it's dirty already.  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it does, doesn't it?  Maybe they'll clean it up later.  Don't fix that.  I don't like it.  You can see there's already a potential problem.  It looks rusty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And meanwhile, Google now has major plans for San Jose with, I think it was 5,000 jobs  and 25,000 homes.  And 6.5 million square feet of offices.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  You know, San Jose is a very strange city.  It feels like it was built but then deserted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it was.  It was.  A good way to describe it.  When I lived there, when I lived in San Francisco, nobody ever went south.  Right.  In the north, you never went south.  The peninsula was, you never caught dead there.  It was just boring suburbs.  And then San Jose was the nearest thing to a city that people abandoned.  Right.  And yeah, it was gone.  Gone.  Nothing.  And now it's a nice, decent place.  But you're right.  It's as if it was freeze-dried.  Yeah.  And it's now been thawed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I worked in radio in San Jose for years before coming to San Francisco.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  And that's kind of where I first got into technology because we were in Silicon Valley.  It was the late 70s and it was a very exciting time.  But it always felt like, where are all the people?  It's like a movie.  It still does to an extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matthew, anything you'd like to pick or plug?  I do have something that's a little weird.  We should call this pick or plug.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little strange because I like the odd.  And this one fits with something I've been thinking about, which is how to sort of randomize your life, how to break out of ruts or whatever.  So I came across this article about a group on Reddit, of course.  They call themselves randonauts.  And so without going into too much detail there, they believe that or they're trying to challenge the idea that we live in a simulation.  So they're trying to get out of the loop, as it were.  And part of what they do is they randomly generate places to go to.  And so there's a fairly complicated process where you log into a Telegram app and you type a command, get a tractor or get void.  And then their software uses a quantum random number generator and spits out a place for you to go to.  And the idea is you're supposed to catch the simulation glitching by by fooling it and doing something random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, all of that. Here's the here's the diagram if you want to try to figure it out.  Escape determinism. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. It's sort of half a joke and half, I think, a real thing.  But if you avoid all the kind of simulation part, what it is is just a way to get you to randomly go to different places because it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm afraid I'd end up in San Jose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You might. And so they keep they log things that they find that they think are evidence of either the simulation glitching or so, for example, three identical black cats, an upside down airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't the glitch prove that you're in the matrix, not that it's not a simulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It proves it is a simulation. So part of so part of them are trying to prove it is part of them.  And some of them are trying to get out of it. Anyway, it's not important that you believe I have a headache, too.  I thought it was interesting that some of the stuff there.  So they describe just randomly going to different places, which is something I've actually started doing not in any organized way, obviously.  But it reminded me of this guy that I came across.  Now I'm going to forget his name, but he was trying to do the same thing.  So he wrote his own apps and one was a kind of I think was an add on to Uber or it was like an Uber, but you couldn't put in a destination.  It would randomly generate a destination and then you would just go there and see what happened.  He started randomly showing up at people's events.  So he would pick a random event and just show up at it like someone's birthday party or an anniversary.  I just think I thought it was hilarious that he at one point he actually got a random tattoo, which he said he thought could have gone bad.  Yeah, random. Like he just walked in and said, tattoo me.  I think he actually wrote a script that then just pulled in a bunch of tattoos and picked one at random.  But he's actually designing apps that he wants to provide so other people can randomize things in their life.  Anyway, he just wound up with I think some Celtic thing or whatever.  So it wasn't actually that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fortunately, the total set of tattoos is not exactly random.  There's a certain tendency toward Celtic that probably saved him in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just thought this randonaut thing was hilarious.  Anyway, it's a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very Reddit. Reddit reminds me of the sense of humor of Reddit reminds me of a smart high schooler.  Yeah, that kind of a lot of irony.  And all right, well, since we're in the Reddit vein, let me share a Reddit subreddit that the Karsten shared with me.  For a long time, I was a fan of the subreddit Yes, Yes, Yes, where you watch a video where somebody tries something daring and unusual and makes it.  But you kind of it's a feta complete, you know, they're going to make it.  Then I started watching No, No, No, where somebody tries something and it turns out to be really stupid.  But Karsten said, No, No, No, you shouldn't follow No, No, No, or Yes, Yes, Yes.  You should follow Maybe, Maybe, Maybe.  These are videos from Yes, Yes, Yes and No, No, No, but they don't telegraph the results.  So you don't know if it's going to go well.  For instance, here's a woman attempting to cross an icy street.  Will it go well or poorly? We don't know.  Maybe, maybe.  No, she slipped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But wait, but wait, there's more.  Two more people walk and fall in exactly the same way and place.  I could watch these all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then there's one more thing.  So that's Maybe, Maybe, Maybe on Reddit.  I sprinkle that into my Reddit feed so that I have fun stuff in between all the Trump posts.  Then I have to say the world is going to hell in a handbasket.  One of the great rock and roll stations in the Bay Area, you probably know it yourself,  Jeff Jarvis, K-Fog, is going down.  Their owners, I think the number two radio company in America, Cumulus,  are going to flip it from its rock and roll roots to a simulcast of an existing station that I used to work on for years, K&BR.  It'll be all sports.  Cumulus said K&BR FM will give sports fans another place to tune into K&BR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What an addition to the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am actually on another Cumulus station in the Bay Area, so I should be very nice about all of this.  But it is a great station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The business is very challenged.  It's all old mass media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very challenging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a good business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Frankly, that's why podcasting is on a tear.  It's all out of this.  Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the end of this show.  Thank you so much for joining us.  I always love doing this because I love these guys.  It's a great panel.  Matthew Ingram, always a welcome addition to the panel.  He's the chief digital writer at the Columbia Journalism Review, CJR.org,  and he's got Matthew I on the Twitter spelled correctly with a mere single T.  Don't be confused by that other Matthew.  Thank you, Matthew. I appreciate it.  Are you back from the cottage?  No, you're still in the cottage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I am still at the cottage.  You'll notice I don't have the book with the swastika.  The Nazi book has been moved.  You know, I thought about that when you first came on,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I thought how sad that is that Matthew, before he did the show,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  had to say, oh, now I got to move that book again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I didn't. I just I tilted the camera a different way.  Oh, OK. It's still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good. Your head's blocking it.  Thanks also to Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be fair, we should explain that it is not a Nazi book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Was it The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich?  Yeah, one of the greatest books of all time.  I read it in high school. I'm rereading it right now.  It is because it's so it's so timely.  Maybe too.  Yeah, maybe a little too timely, a little too close to home.  Thank you, Matthew. Always a pleasure. Stacey, always great.  Yeah, enjoy.  We'll make sure Jeff enjoys a Texas martini and a bowl of queso in your honor.  Mexican martini.  Mexican martini, which is really a Texan martini, but we won't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We stole it from Mexico.

Transcript:  That's awesome.  I'm at the hotel run by UT Austin.  Oh, perfect. Hook em horns.  And Carson really wanted me to have queso at the ready on the show so I could rub it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do not want to see you rub in queso, but if you wanted to eat it, I'd be okay with that.  That's the only thing I can do with it. I'm keto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't rub in the queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could rub it on my body though. That might be fun.  We do this week in Google every Wednesday afternoon, 1.30 Pacific, 4.30 Eastern, 20.30 UTC.

Transcript:  I'd love it if you'd stop by live.  You can listen live or watch live at twit.tv slash live.  That's the live 24-hour stream of our content.  You can tap into that on your Google Assistant or your Echo just by saying,  Echo, play twit live.  And if you are watching, listening, voice assistant-ing live,  go into the chat room, irc.twit.tv.  You'd have a good time in there.  They're all doing the same thing and they're lots of fun.  You can also get on-demand versions of everything we do because we are, after all, podcasts you love from people you trust.  Yes, I gave in and we're calling them podcasts now.  You can go to twit.tv slash twig for every episode.  There's 600-and-some episodes that we've done of this show.  How many? No, it's not that many.  You can also subscribe in one of your favorite podcast applications.  We're there everywhere.  Just press the subscribe button in your app and you'll get it the minute it's available,  just in time for your Thursday morning commute.  Thanks, everybody.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
