Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you've got a little Marcel hairdo going.  You look like you should be working in a factory in 1943 France.  So that's me.  Welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's in the resistance kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey is at Stacey at IOT on IOT.com Stacey on IOT.com.  She also hosts the IOT podcast and I have some questions for her about helium.  We'll get to that in just a little bit.  Can you have that helium router?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess I do.  I've got possible answers.  Keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When we were in Seattle, I thought, gosh, if I were to sail by Bainbridge Island, I could use Stacey's helium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you were on a cruise ship, you could have used my helium.  I know.  I watched those ships go by.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was trying, but it wasn't labeled like Stacey's helium or anything.  So next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it has a fancy name.  It's like Foc Trot adobo pump.  I should have found out ahead of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Oh, well, next time.  And there will be a next time.  I like sailing by Bainbridge Island.  Also with us, ladies and gentlemen, somebody Pat Sajak hates.  We're going to add that.  I have to write that in on the list here.  I put that on the list.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Hello, Mr. J.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello, hello, hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello, hello, hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, Anthony Pruett is here from HOP hands on photography.  Hello.  Did you just give me up your nose with the rubber hose salute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think you did.  What is that?  Is that what this means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, all I remember is In the Darkest Hour, which is a wonderful movie with is it Gary Sinise as Winston Churchill, whoever it is, as Winston Churchill.  Initially, Churchill does this as the V for victory sign with his with his fist facing out and his secretary says, Mr.  Churchill, that doesn't mean what you think it does.  And that's why he turned it around and made it his own.  The two finger salute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just like to salute people I respect.  That's all.  I salute the people I respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's fine to do what you did like the Cub Scout salute.  Just don't do this.  Just don't go all the way.  Two finger salute is used in Poland.  It's used in Poland.  Do you have like a like a hand salute dictionary?  You just looked that up in Wikipedia.  Oh, it's all there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's called the Internet.  I'm sure you by this point, you probably turned it off because you discussed it with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate the Internet, but I am happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The stuff I learn on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grief.  As a framework owner to hear that Google.  So last week we had the bad news that Google and this was still a rumor from the verge, but a rumor only that the Google was abandoning.  The Pixelbook that had been moving quite far along with.  But now news from framework that they're going to make a Chromebook in partnership with Google.  The framework laptop Chromebook edition.  I framework.  I am a fan of very much.  So I have a framework laptop that I really like.  The whole proposition, the value prop framework is it's completely upgradable.  In fact, they lived up to their promise.  I have a 11th gen Intel processor in mind, but I could buy the upgrade.  Do it yourself to a 12th gen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does that cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eight hundred nineteen bucks.  So you do well, you get a whole new motherboard.  But the fact that you can even buy a motherboard with a laptop with an upgradable motherboard is mind bogging.  You can upgrade everything in this laptop.  And that's why I like them.  They are right to repair times 10.  And surprisingly, a very good lightweight, very nice laptop pounds.  The Chromebook.  Yeah.  So for them to offer a Chromebook, I think is fascinating.  There is Kevin Toffle wrote it up and about Chromebooks dot com.  You brought that to my attention and said and it's true if you order it that they say at this time we have no plans for motherboard upgrades.  It comes with an I five not cheap.  It's a thousand bucks.  Eight gigs of memory, 250 gigs of storage, Wi-Fi 6E.  You can, though, add not only external customizations as with all framework laptops, but you could put more storage in it because you use standard storage.  You can even put more RAM in it because it uses standard RAM.  But can I upgrade my CPU later?  On the FAQ says we haven't announced any plans for a newer Chrome OS compatible main board at this time.  Doesn't mean they're not going to do it, but that's something to be.  It seems like there'd be no point in doing a framework Chromebook if you couldn't upgrade it.  So this would be the first time you've ever been able to buy a Chromebook that you could put more horsepower on and down the road.  At least. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now Intel, of course, you can change bezels.  I don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's all frameworks.  The front bezel.  You can get it in orange.  Oh, no, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would like it in orange.  Yeah. See? See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love orange.  Yeah.  So I'm very happy with my framework.  I've bought it.  If you go to the marketplace, I've bought a number of different modules for it and so forth.  You can also, when people complained that the hinge was a little loose, buy an upgraded hinge.  You can get these little expansion cards ranging in price.  I got the terabyte expansion card because it's got USB-C.  You can see they do have quite a few upgrades, not just for the motherboard.  If you go to I5 12th gen, it's 538.  The one I quoted was 12th gen I7.  But you can also upgrade to the existing capacity.  It uses standard memory.  Oh, so you can do memory too.  Yeah, it uses standard memory cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is eight gigs on standard memory.  Yeah, but you could put, for 80 bucks, you could put 16 in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's not bad.  And by the way, you don't have to buy it from framework.  These are standard SO-DIMs.  So you can, same thing with M.2 storage.  So it's very, I love this framework.  I'm very, very happy with it.  Do they sell t-shirts?  Probably.  Yes.  Do they sell them in orange?  Let me find you a bezel.  I did say I would bezel it.  Yeah, there's the orange.  Oh, nice.  They have gray, black, gray, and orange.  And this is magnetic.  So it's actually really easy to snap it on.  Oh, snap.  It's so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is kind of a Clemson orange, not a UT orange.  Yes.  Boy, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm down for the Clemson orange.  That's the best orange.  It's ordering one as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yes, they do have merch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  You had a real question.  You had a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mr. LaFour, is it safe to say that all of the additional horsepower that's being offered  up for these Chromebooks is pretty much just for the developer community?  Because I thought Chrome OS was pretty efficient as an operating system.  Why would it need all of this extra horsepower for the average person?  Ask Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What am I, Chop Liva?  I do important work here, Dr. Pruitt.  I need the best like again.  You're opening up a text editor in what?  You're probably opening a huge space.  All you're running ever is Chrome.  It's everything's in its grasp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Chrome is no lightweight.  It's not actually.  Yeah, Chrome is a pretty big power.  Like energy is a pretty big power.  It's a pretty big power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a pretty big power.  It's a pretty big power.  It's a pretty big power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a pretty big power.  It's a pretty big power.  It's a pretty big power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's always sold i7s for its Pixelbooks, right?  We have i7s.  This is an i5 from Framework at $999.  That's certainly more than enough.  Most Chromebooks, as you mentioned, have scant RAM and they usually have crap processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two of RAM is too little.  Definitely.  You need four.  They sell them with four.  Eight is like the minimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eight is plenty, I would say.  But you could put more in.  And it just means you can do more tabs open or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chrome is not a lightweight.  I know people who have literally hundreds of tabs open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can put Linux on this.  That's why Kevin loves it.  Yeah.  And so you can absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But even with that, that's lean OS.  Lean mean OS, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, again, you could put Linux and run Cayden Live and do video editing.  So there's a lot of.  You could.  But, you know, it depends what you want.  You're right.  That's more developer-y focused than his normal person.  Probably nobody needs a thousand dollar Chromebook.  But if you want one.  That's been my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's been my point all these times.  Yes.  I would love to have the ideal $500, $600 Chromebook, but I've never found it.  And by buying the high end, I get an excellent machine.  I get an excellent keyboard.  I get an excellent screen.  I get the whole McGill.  That's what I'm buying is don't forget the build here as well.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think this is really a smart move on Google's part.  If they're not going to offer a high end Chromebook, go with a company that can and make it upgradable.  That's pretty cool.  What's unclear, and I'm sure Kevin will do some research on this and we'll find out,  is what it takes to make this motherboard Chrome OS certified.  I don't know.  I think, you know, you have to have the developer switch, right?  You can put it in developer mode.  I don't know.  It doesn't mention any specific modifications.  It's interesting they offer an i5, not an i7, but i5 is certainly more than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For Chromebook, even though Ant is going to look down his nose at me, I will say that  an i5 is plenty.  I understand if you're spending $1,000, put it on a better machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put that toward a better machine.  What?  And get Windows with it?  No, thank you very much.  I didn't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll get stuck with the Apple prison?  No, thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can put Linux.  In fact, I run Manjaro Linux on my framework.  It runs great.  Fingerprint reader works.  Trackpad works.  Everything works.  Cameras work.  So it's a good choice for Windows or Linux or now Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shout out to you for mentioning KdenLive, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good program, isn't it?  Is it for your video editing ever?  I've played with it over the years.  Open source.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's our top story just for you, Jeff.  Yes, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It makes me feel better after my morning last week.  I can blow out my candle.  Oh, happy birthday, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Happy birthday.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, happy birthday.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Okay, never mind.  Where did that come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was your birthday because you had a candle.  I'm as old enough as is.  You're trying to make me yet older?  No, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your birthday was a while ago.  That's right.  Okay.  Never mind.  What are you doing to me?  They will have, I believe they will be talking about this tomorrow on Tech News Weekly with  Micah and Jason.  A big study from Mozilla found that YouTube's dislike and not interested buttons barely  do anything.  You're still going to get recommended Nazi porn no matter what, right?  Using video recommendations data from more than 20,000 YouTube users, Mozilla researchers  found buttons like not interested, thumbs down, dislike, stop recommending channel,  remove from watch history are largely ineffective at preventing similar content from being recommended.  It sounds like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just like the crosswalk button.  Placebo button.  Placebo buttons.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even at their best, these buttons still allow through more than half the recommendations  similar to what a user said they didn't want.  At their worst, the buttons hardly made a dent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't know how these services are using it in their own general recommendation algorithms.  It may not affect you personally, but it may be metadata for them at a higher level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some of this is like, do not show this again.  Yeah.  Can I just say...  Yeah.  That doesn't work.  He thinks that I care about Leonardo DiCaprio and I do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You really should.  At all.  Can I just say you really, really should?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have told Google so many times, I have stopped clicking...  Leonardo DiCaprio could invent a brand new semiconductor or discover a whole new band  of spectrum.  I would not click on that article just to avoid confusing Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to go to Casey Neistat's.  We're moving back to New York City.  I am going to say...  Two weeks in a row with Casey.  Dislike?  Look at Neistat making tweet.  Well, no.  I wanted to pick something that I didn't mind.  What else can I do besides this thumbs down?  I can say...  That's all I've ever done.  Can you say don't recommend this anymore?  Apparently there are ways to do that.  Unfortunately, I'm already subscribed to the channel, so that would explain...  That's not going to work.  Never mind.  Forget I said anything.  Sorry Casey.  All I see is report, show transcripts.  No, I love Casey.  I don't see any way to say don't show me this anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see what Google is going to try to show me on basic YouTube.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's by the way.  Spice lattes.  Of course, it's that time of year.  Autumn begins tomorrow.  Stacey, do you pay for YouTube premium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  I wish they would stop asking me.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many pre-roll videos do you get?  I have heard from people that it is as many as five to ten unskippable ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Geez.  It's painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't get that many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they just have given up on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sometimes I get two, but it has to be...  I get two if I have an SNL clip or something that's like...  I think hot ones.  If I watch hot ones, sometimes I get it.  But I'm on a rowing workout right now.  I don't have any ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it has to be something that's monetized.  Try one of the...  But these are monetized.  Try one of the twit ones.  Try hot ones.  Hot ones would be good.  Or try one of the twit ones.  I've been hearing on...  I've been reading on Reddit and other places.  It really has gone out of control.  Five to ten.  All right.  Okay.  Count the premiums.  Well, I just went to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I'm on premiums, so I don't know.  Yeah, well, I went to Incognito and you can do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got one of two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the one is skippable.  Oh, okay.  I just got one skippable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So, you got up to two ads, one of them skippable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me try something.  I could try twit.  I don't think I've ever watched twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So apparently...  Now, thank you ScooterX in our chat room.  YouTube says it was an experiment.  I got two.  So YouTube says it has concluded...  That explains it.  It has...  A nice statement to 95Google.  YouTube says it has concluded this test.  Over the past month or two, some YouTube viewers have noted advertisements on the platform  have been expanding greatly in length and quantity, especially in unskippable formats.  And they confirm the same that I saw, which is threads on Reddit show ads with as many  as 10 ads in a row that can't be skipped.  It isn't happening to everybody or to all videos.  The good news, the ads aren't super long.  YouTube spokesman has confirmed these are expanded quote ad pods.  That was an ad pod you were watching.  Was part of a small experiment that has since concluded.  At YouTube, we're focused on helping brands connect with audiences around the world.  We're always testing new ways to surface ads that enhance the viewer experience.  How does an ad ever enhance the user experience?  We were at a small experiment globally that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sometimes I really need insurance products.  And boy, howdy.  Very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were at a small experiment globally that served multiple ads in an ad pod when viewers  watched longer videos on connected TVs.  Oh, you'd have to watch on the TV.  The goal was to build a better experience for viewers by reducing ad breaks.  We're going to put them all up front, make you watch them.  Who would do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For some of their shows, they do not all of them.  And they asked you, you could be like, do you want to watch one long ad or like have  it up?  And I'd be like, oh, one long ad, then you go get snacks and you come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's my question.  Are they cynical or stupid?  The ones on YouTube are pretty stupid.  A new game show category.  Cynical or stupid?  Or stupid.  So do they really think that this is about improving the viewer experience?  No.  They say YouTube reiterates that a user experience continues to be a top priority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're going to give someone ads, maybe you care about how they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's what they're saying.  Instead of interrupting the show, we're just going to force you to watch all the ads at  the beginning.  Now, if I'm the creator, I don't like that because don't you think that drives people  away?  They go, oh screw this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  haven't gotten to the content yet by showing me all of these ads.  Some viewers say that about just the intros to videos.  They say the intro is too long.  If you want the user experience...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it is.  God, they're so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hit the button.  In a little bit, we're going to tell you something you wanted to know.  But first, let me talk some more about other stuff.  Of course, we do that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We know you're stuck here for three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do ads.  Look, I'm not against ads.  I'm not against ads.  We do give people the right to pay for no ads, as does YouTube.  I don't kid myself that the ads are in some way a huge benefit to the user experience.  It's the price you pay for content.  You have to pay for content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The price you pay for free content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be cynical of me to say...  Maybe I'm cynical, not stupid.  I just feel like for them to lay it on, oh, we're trying to improve your experience, I  find that a little disingenuous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder what their results were when they rolled this test out to people.  I don't know if they stopped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As soon as anybody noticed, they stopped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And remember, he said it was just on connected TV, so it wouldn't have been on your mobile  device.  It was if you're watching YouTube on a TV, which I do a lot more and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, right now, ideally, you'll see two pre-roll ads, ideally.  That's livable.  And that's usable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guarantee you what they were doing is testing, well, how many can we get away with?  Right.  How long were the ads?  Were they 10 second ads?  They say they were short.  I don't know how short short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what they're experimenting with.  If you take the same two minutes and cram in more advertisers, will that affect people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, let's face it, how often do you see come ons for YouTube premiums, Stacey?  That's their real goal, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a point.  Yeah.  I irritate you so much.  Please.  Just please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of irritation.  Every time I'm logged in, I see that banner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need to have a Jeff Jarvis moment.  Wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You said irritation and Jeff Jarvis in the same sentence.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm worried.  I'm worried here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Let me slide back here and I can join these two monitors together.  I guess that's too much trouble.  Go ahead.  Jeff Jarvis moment.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaking of like constantly inundating you with, do you want this?  Okay.  The New York Times, a subscription which I pay for, is constantly asking me, hey, this  is better than the app.  Wouldn't you like to download the app?  And I'm like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate that.  I hate that.  It's constant.  There are ad blockers that will prevent that.  It's hard on mobile, I think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's only on mobile that I'm doing this, but it's driving me bonkers.  And I do.  I feel very Jeff.  How many times can we really annoy people, especially paying customers?  It's rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've not seen it yet, but Mr. Micah Sargent has said something similar about Zoom.  He pays for the service.  I pay for the service, but he says he's getting an ad every time he opens it up.  I'm like, what's the point?  I'm not.  You're paying your $15 a month.  What's the point of an ad showing up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but Stacey's talking about the far more annoying thing and I see it all the time.  When you open something in a webpage, it says, you know, you really should be using  our app.  And it takes over the top and says, you should be using the Reddit app.  You should be using the Zoom app.  I find that.  I agree with you, Stacey.  That's probably worse than an ad.  It's like, no, I'm trying to look at your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the only reason they want that is more data from me.  That's the only reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good reason to be mad.  Yes.  Because they already got your subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm giving you money.  Stop.  You're already getting my IP data.  You're getting plenty of data, New York Times.  You know who I am.  Twitter does it too.  Got my login.  We've got to let people know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this really needs to go forth.  That the most valuable thing for companies to be an app on your front page of your phone,  that is just by itself hugely valuable to the point where they don't mind annoying you  endlessly to get you to do it.  People just install apps willy-nilly.  Leave them on, let them run, give them permissions.  You're handing over tons of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, back to...  Mr. Scooter, put the tweet from Micah Sargent out about Zoom.  See, I haven't seen this.  He put it in the RFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just went to Zoom and I didn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see it in the app or did you see it on the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says, hey, Zoom, I pay you every month for Zoom Pro.  Why am I getting these from you after every single, don't Zoom alone.  I made friends to save $30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're trying to give you money, Micah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't Zoom alone.  That's actually kind of like, oh, you poor thing.  Micah, are you making calls to yourself?  Is that why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you the only person with a fax machine in your friend group?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, it's a good deal though.  They get 30% off their first year and you get a $20 Amazon gift card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God.  I'm not giving them any free money.  Although if you want to go to Micah and refer a friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have never seen this Zoom.  I've never seen that either.  We have a Twitter account.  So everybody Twits using Micah, if you're using your personal Zoom account, why don't  you start using our Twitter account?  You can have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or why don't we get all the viewers to line up and make Micah money?  Make Micah money.  Micah, everybody sign up with Micah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they also say, here's another one he gets.  First of all, don't Zoom alone.  Then broaden your reach.  For a limited time, save 50% off your first four months of a large meeting $500 ad plan.  We already know he's Zooming alone.  Why would you ask?  That's just hurtful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You narrow-minded Micah.  That's just hurtful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you only had 500 friends, we could get you a deal.  That's just hurtful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a whole bunch of them.  Micah's got just a range of these.  Connect with your audience.  For a limited time, save 50% on your first four months.  He's alone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now he has an audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and then he's getting the magical automatic support from Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks for the info, Micah.  Are you there, Zoom?  It's me, Micah.  Oh, you're funny, Micah.  Micah, we have a few extra seats, I think, on our Zoom account.  You could use your own email and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you pay for Slack, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't pay for that one.  I just pay for Zoom.  You don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We pay for yours.  No, it's fine.  I can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I write it off in the end.  No, you don't need to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you're not actually not spending any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I guess he might be slacking with other companies.  But the company you're slacking with...  Oh, that's right.  You said your family has a Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, my Slack is the family Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We used to have a GigaOM Slack and we all chipped in to keep our Slack going, like the former  GigaOM reporters.  We stopped after a while.  But it was...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, can you use the free tier for your family?  You probably can.  For Slack?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's perfectly fine.  It's not going to keep everything, but I don't need it to keep everything.  I just need it to...  That's what you give up, is that...  When I tell somebody to make sure to feed the dogs, they see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's free, right?  Oh, boy.  There's a lot of free solutions, but it's hard to get a family to move once you got  them using something, right?  I like Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought about Discord, but I thought Discord would be a bit much for this family.  You should WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How old is the oldest member of your family on the Slack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Say again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How old is the oldest member of your family on the Slack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so it's not like grandpa level.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  But everybody's not necessarily technically savvy in the Pruitt house.  It's grandpa level.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the one that does is Leo and Jeff level.  Yeah.  Who's the grandpa here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Let's be Frank.  Let's be...  Oh, is Frank your grandpa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grandpa Frank.  Grandpa Frank.  So, by the way, Slack...  So this is an interesting...  We kind of were started talking about this on Windows Weekly.  I mean, they're brothers adding an office suite.  Slack is adding an office suite.  Canva is adding an office suite.  Everybody is...  So Google's got one.  There's Zoho office, of course, Microsoft office.  And now Slack wants to...  So you don't ever have to leave.  What?  I think this...  You know what's really going on is this goes back to the...  Did we talk about Figma on last week?  I guess it did.  No, no.  It just happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about it on Twitter.  So I think this is...  So the story with Figma, Figma, which is a collaborative design tool, really cool, invented  by a guy who took the Peter Thiel money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember that?  Peter Thiel, about five, six years ago, said, I don't like college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should drop out of college.  In fact, I'll give you $100,000 to drop out of college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know why I'm making him sound like Colonel Sanders.  Drive out of college and do a startup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's far more like this, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, so this...  I have never heard him speak.  Is that ever times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't either, but in my mind, he's more like a bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember the very pilot episode of Silicon Valley?  There's a, I think a Peter Thiel style startup guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's driving a car that's so thin.  It's a one person car and he can get through, he can get through cars.  Oh man.  It's very funny.  Anyway, worth watching, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Episode one, Silicon Valley, season one.  Where were we?  Oh yeah, so actually it's a really great story.  This kid grew up here in Sonoma County.  His name is Dylan...  Oh, what's his name?  I can't remember.  Dylan Byer?  Anyway, cute young guy.  Field.  Field, Dylan Field.  Couldn't get into Berkeley, but he was into computers when he was three years old, lived  up the road a piece.  His parents got a computer, really got into it.  In high school, he was part of the first robotics project.  Really got into that.  So he started to love technology, but his grades weren't so good.  Couldn't get into Cal.  Somehow he got into Brown.  I don't know how...  Brown's I think harder.  Which is really hard.  Even harder, I don't know.  But he couldn't get into UC Berkeley, but he got into Brown.  Went to Brown for three years.  Peter Thiel says, I give you $100,000, so stop going to college.  So he does.  His first dream, his first startup was a drone company designed to spot reckless drivers  so they could give him a ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of flopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then Dylan says, what else?  Good effort.  He and his buddy decide to start a collaborative design company.  This is in 2012.  They kind of struggled along for a while.  Eventually they did raise money.  I think they raised a little bit of money four years ago.  The Wall Street Journal talked about the fact that he was still living in the mission, buying  dollar coffee on his way to work.  Very Wall Street Journal-y kind of detail.  The company itself was above a bar and it got so noisy after 3 p.m. on Fridays, they  all just went home early because they couldn't get any work done.  So just a typical little startup.  Raised some money.  Then raised a little bit more money.  Finally got up to a valuation of about 10 billion, which is not bad.  Adobe announced this week they're going to buy Figma for $20 billion.  Biggest deal in Adobe history.  One of the biggest internet deals of all time.  $20 billion.  A lot of money for a company that only has annual recurring revenue of $400 million.  Let's see, do the math.  That means it will take about 20 years.  No, no.  Not that long.  They're making a billion dollars every four years.  So it'll take them 80 years to make all the money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's at that current rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you have to assume they're going to do more.  But more importantly, Adobe I think felt like their lunch was getting eaten.  Adobe has a competing product, Adobe XD, that wasn't competing.  I think there was a threat.  So Adobe, which only has income of around $4 or $5 billion a year, is going to give  them half cash, half stock.  With regulatory approval, Mr. Dillon Field will join the three commons club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Describe Figma's more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's go there.  We can look at it and they can describe it for themselves.  The collaborative interface design tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When this news dropped, I was surprised because I was like, who is the competition?  Canva?  Club Twitch.  One of the members mentioned is Lucidcharts.  Lucidcharts was another competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Canva, by the way, just announced they're going to add, it's going complete full circle,  the same thing Slack's doing, they're going to add Docs.  They're going to become an office suite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Basically, we're all trying to figure out how to collaborate best remotely and using  the Internet without just using words.  And that's because we're a visual.  I mean, this all makes sense.  You've got to make it.  You've got to have everything right.  You've got to have words, video, instant feedback, a way to produce something that looks slick.  5G, quantum.  But yeah, I watch it.  You got to have the blockchain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All stored on the blockchain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Adobe stock, of course, tumbled as soon as they made this announcement.  But the folks at Figma are pretty happy.  Yeah, I think, and of course, some of this is COVID, right?  Because suddenly we're not working at the office anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it just office or is it a wider sense?  I think it's a lot of gig workers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think gig workers really like Figma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My my my child actually used Figma and Canvas.  Yeah, they prefer Canva over.  No, they prefer Figma over Canva.  They hate Canva, but everyone's kind of solidified on Canva at their school.  Yeah. So I think all these companies are in play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Group projects, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Group projects.  They actually laid out an entire magazine in Canva, which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How old fart of you, my daughter?  No, no. We have an internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I was just like, oh, my gosh.  Like, I had some horrifying CMS is in my life, but dear Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you play with it? Is it terrible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's not for magazine layout.  I mean, it's it's fine.  Like I've made a slideshow.  It's like a like a whiteboard maybe more or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so it's like a presentation manager more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's I think of it as for presentations,  but you can do lots of stuff with it.  I mean, my child is now using it to make Instagram posts  of like inspirational quotes for. Right.  I think that's actually my real question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not my car readers. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's the thing.  Adobe already has a product  beyond XD called Adobe Express  that does a lot of the same stuff that Canvas doing.  And it's pretty good.  It's well, that's the problem. Pretty good.  XD on the other hand, I believe that that's where they were falling apart  and getting their lunch eaten. Yeah.  My opinion. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, look at that. I just made a diagram.  It was just that easy.  Let's see. But let's change it to the twig diagram.  And they give you fonts and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is canvas to the Stacey and Jeff overlap.  Yeah, let's do it.  Stacey. Hey, Jeff.  I would like Jeff to have on his side, moral panic.  My size should be nuanced and we should talk about this.  And then the middle irritate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got it, Stacey. Very self-aware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chickenhead 21 in the chat says Adobe is like Autodesk.  They buy up all of their competition there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Or like Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what is what is Jeff's moral panic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You had to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in the what's the overlap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Irritated about you, Leo.  You you get Leo in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have made the twig diagram.  Wait a minute. Where's that?  We got to add it.  I don't know how to use your diagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how to.  And it can be off in the side looking at all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need a circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then, OK, you're also irritated about me, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, then it's circle should also be big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, you get the idea.  This is pretty cool.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  And then, oh, yeah, wait a minute.  This here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now we got it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of our all of our twit graphic design  listeners are just who needs who needs designers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All we need is to get our stock art from Dali and then poof.  We just well, you won't be getting it on Getty on Getty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Page two.  Getty has decided to prohibit all AI generated content.  Why, you might ask, because they don't.  It's unclear who owns the rights to that content.  Remember, Stable Diffusion,  Dolly, too, and Metta.  What is it? Metta Diffusion.  Mid Journey. Mid Journey are all based on scraping art.  The latter two, I don't know about Dolly.  Good Dolly, I think probably not, but certainly stable diffusion and mid  journey scraping kind of public domain stuff,  stuff on pin board.  So there's going to be some question when you generate some art.  Like, well, who really owns that that picture?  So Getty says it's not it's not worth it.  The presence of copyrighted imagery in the training data of AI  art generators is obvious from their tendency to reproduce  the Getty images watermark.  Here's here's an example from a Lexica search of Donald Trump behind bars.  But look, Getty images is clearly visible.  There's the Getty watermark.  So Getty, I think rightly so, says, yeah.  A little dicey. A little dicey.  Maybe draw it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can build it in Canva, y'all, or sorry, Figma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question.  Do you own the rights to all the little doohickeys  that you get from those design tools?  Can you only do it for non-commercial?  I bet you have to buy if you if you if you use it commercially,  you got to buy it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Somebody's got to get paid commercial purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah, you I mean, we pay for you.  You pay for Figma and stuff based on, I think, isn't it access to certain tools?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, right. Like you like you pay for  these super editor tools, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. I was like, you can't access  gifts if you don't pay five dollars a month or whatever. So.  I don't know the actual rules.  Your diagrams can only have three circles. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there was no Leo on there,  except for the, you know, the universal hate. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Irritation, Leo, irritation.  I was going to say, well, we have to take it on as we love Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but you with your poor self image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I said irritation over ads.  I turn it into hate.  Well, I'm going to irritate you a little bit more  because it's time to talk about one of our sponsors this week.  And Google continues with Ant Pruitt, Jeff Jarvis, Stacey Higginbotham  and a visit from IT Pro TV.  These are the folks who Lisa and I went out to see in Gainesville  a few years ago to visit their beautiful new studios.  The best possible place to get your IT training,  whether you want to get your first job in IT or accelerate your career in IT.  IT Pro TV is not dry, dull classroom activities, not boring books.  It's learning from experts in the field who are so passionate, so knowledgeable.  They get you excited about what you're learning.  They call them edutainers because they're fun.  They make learning engaging and fun.  And with IT Pro TV, you're doing it on your own schedule, in your own way.  More than 5,800 hours of up to date IT training.  That's why they've got those studios running Monday through Friday.  Seven studios running Monday through Friday, creating new content all the time  because the tests change, the questions change, the software changes, the search change.  And so they need to keep up.  And that's nice because it's super fresh, always up to date  with the most current content.  The episodes are 20 to 30 minutes long, which means you can watch them  whenever is convenient for you.  And you can watch them wherever is convenient for you on your desktop,  your tablet, your mobile device.  They support Apple TV.  They've got a Roku app too.  So it is so easy to learn, so much fun to learn that before you know it,  you will have the skills to get that cert, to get that job.  It's just a great idea for IT training.  If you get it, it's like watching, you know,  Twitter, only you're you're watching IT training the whole time.  One reviewer says it's easy to understand what they're saying.  It's well explained.  The classes are very smooth, along with the notes and transcriptions given.  That's right. Every class has a transcription so you can read along.  Great for studying, right?  They give you study notes, too.  By wrapping the instructors, by wrapping their own experience  in with the course, make it easier to comprehend the hardest topics,  this reviewer says.  They also make sure you feel confident enough to pass the exams.  One way they do that is with practice tests.  So you can take the test before you take the test,  know that you're ready or not ready and keep studying.  They also have virtual labs.  You don't have to have a Windows server or Windows clients  to learn how to run a Windows network, for example.  You can do it all in your HTML five browser, which makes it really easy.  Another reviewer says IT pro TV is the best website  to study IT and cybersecurity related courses.  I like the part where they make a few courses free for a weekend.  Every month they do that.  Every month they offer multiple free webinars you can watch,  you can join into, you can ask questions.  And of course, since there are a whole bunch of them now that you haven't seen,  you can see them all on demand.  In fact, there's a few of them right there on the website.  Now, IT pro TV is great for individuals, but if you're a company with an IT team,  they're great for that to check out IT pros TV's business plan.  They have some great deals and really great training.  Your team will love.  Get 30% off when you sign up at IT pro dot TV slash twit.

IT pro dot TV slash twit and the offer code T W I T three zero for 30% off  tomorrow night. Game two, Thursday night football.  And yes, what do you think it was on?  It was for the first time ever.  You couldn't watch it on TV.  You had to watch it on Amazon Prime.  Amazon says it drew a record number of prime signups for a three hour period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  I'll sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I see it now.  They paid a billion dollars a year for this, right?  They did a good job.  I mean, they've already had football on NFL football and before any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it was always on CBS at the same time.  Right. So so or in a blackout rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So like the whole rules, like if you have to pay to get it any.  I have a lot of questions about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me explain how the arcane blackout rules work.  OK, you can only watch it in a marketing game like so I can watch the Niners games.  So if the Niners game is on a Thursday night football, I will be able to watch it on  broadcast. But last week it wasn't it was it was a Lions game.  It would have been local in Detroit, but not anywhere else in the country.  So that's where you had to watch it on Amazon Prime.  It's the same thing as Monday Night Football, which is still on TV networks.  You can watch you can watch it everywhere.  The only the blackout only applies if they don't sell out all the tickets, I think.  Maybe that's even old school. I don't know what they do.  That's so old school. They also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm so confused.  So when can I watch these games on my local?  So can I watch my local games on my local?  When the Seahawks play, correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When the Seahawks if this is only Thursday night, they're still Sunday and Monday.  Right. But Thursday Night Football, if the Seahawks are on Thursday Night Football,  you'll be able to watch it on broadcast.  The rest of the country has to use Amazon Prime to get it.  And that's what I thought was very bold. I mean,  what I mean, people do you have Amazon Prime?  I do. OK, does everybody have it? Is that why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the thing. It seems to be more common than we would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, because they have way more than just television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'd be pissed, though, if I were, you know,  wanted to watch the game and I'm turning around on the dial and it's not on  the networks and you have to have to sign up for Amazon Prime.  So Amazon has a hundred and forty eight point six

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  million Amazon Prime subscribers.  Probably enough penetration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although streaming streaming has now beat both cable and broadcast in viewing.  OK, so it's so old fart.  What do you even that's that that's even doing that, Leo?  Click is an old thing.  I got a clicker. Yeah, don't click the clicker.  You have the TV guide on the on the couch. Yeah, yeah.  You have the little markers in it to know what you want to watch.  Yeah, the game's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it was the Kansas City Chiefs in the Chargers.  So if you were in L.A. or Kansas City, you'd watch it on broadcast.  ScooterX says he was able to watch it on TV  if you're in the appropriate broadcast area.  So 15 games, a billion dollars a game, apparently  a success, according to J.  Marine, global head of Amazon Sport Division.  Because so many people.  What the hell else is he going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I know this is an internal memo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it could have been a guy.  So what happened with DirecTV over the last two weekends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But no, they did a good job.  They've always done a good job with covering football.  They got Al Michaels and Kirk Kirby's.  You can down to have in Kirk Herbstreet, Kirk Herbstreet, Kirk Herbstreet.  He did a great job with all of his work that he has to do for college football.  It was good play by play.  It was good play by play.  And it was just as prepared for the NFL side of things.  It was great.  My only beef is I remember I was trying to switch back to Hulu Live  versus YouTube TV and I decided to go with YouTube TV.  Not on. Is it on?  Well, YouTube TV gets a leg up, in my opinion, because they offer  live stats while you're watching the game.  You can literally just pull them up and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Fox, I mean, Amazon says they're going to do that, too, right?  They're going to have X-Ray.  They say they're going to have X-Ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I hope so. You got all of that analytics.  They do ads for Amazon and other games talking about here.  We're going to break down this play using the Amazon, blah, blah, blah,  whatever it's called.  It would be nice to have those additional stats in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nielsen has not yet released  the ratings, but J.  Maureen in the memo said they're going to be good.  That's when that'll be the test, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Define good.  I wonder what it'll be like versus broadcast.  Yeah, I just I guess I was just so it's a sign of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all it is.  So he says the ratings show  Amazon's measurement shows that the audience numbers exceeded  all of our expectations for viewership.  Again, that's what I'm always says.  Is that so, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got I got a physical letter like like the mailman for the first time  in six months came and put something in our mailbox and it was from Amazon.  Was it full of anthrax?  And I opened this strange thing from the past.  It was a physical letter from Amazon saying,  we noticed you haven't used your wonderful prime video features lately, Mr.  Jarvis. You might want to recognize all the wonderful things on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you pay for prime video, but you have never turned it on.  I pay for prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it includes and they're saying to me, hey, schmuck, don't forget.  You want to stay. I must be.  I have a retention tool, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely, because they keep raising the rates for Amazon Prime.  What is one hundred twenty five bucks now a year, something like that.  And it used to be just second day postage.  I think that price, it wouldn't be worth it.  But if you get all this other cool stuff, maybe.  Lord of the Rings, which they spent half a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of my friends did, I was like, hey, we watch it.  He's like, I got so sick of the finest acting that Canada could provide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's like, why does every town look like Vancouver?  I actually think I have mixed feelings about it.  It's anyway, 25 million people watched the first day.  That's a good. I think that's a good number for streaming.  It's not a great number for broadcast, though.  I mean, and it's heyday.  And Seinfeld used to get 40 million in their heyday, right?  I don't know. But that was TV guides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.  So I just was doing some research on this.  Now I got to frigging find it  on these numbers because the numbers are so far down.  Give me a minute here. I'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Eee. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the days when you had three networks.  And imprisoned. Yeah.  And you didn't, you know, there you had to watch what was on pretty much.  It wasn't unheard of, I think,  for those shows to have 40 or 50 million viewers back when  the United States was only 200, 250 million people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when cable wasn't as prominent or Internet wasn't as prominent as it is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Season five, which was the prime time of Seinfeld,  had a rating of 19.6.  That means 19.6 of the available percent of the available households were watching.  So that's I mean, you're never going to see that in streaming ever again, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I think well, also, I think there's there has to be a different  way to measure to with the binge culture nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it would be. Yeah, because like.  What was it Neil Gaiman was tweeting a lot about like how to get people to  how to get Netflix to re up for the Sandman second season.  And it wasn't enough, he said, for like everybody to watch it,  for to be number one for however amount of time it was.  He's like, you know, you've got to watch it again.  You've got to make sure like it keeps growing.  You can't like.  So it was kind of interesting to to see kind of behind the scenes on how they  So Leo, I have the numbers for you.  Yes.  What was the number that you you quoted?  Twenty five million on day one of of which of the football of the Lord of the Rings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lord of the Rings.  OK, so here's OK.  And that's global, by the way, not US variety.  The four major broadcast networks averaged around 20 million viewers.  The four major broadcast networks averaged around 20 million viewers in total  across eight to ten prime time or same day viewing.  But that's average. This is fallen.  This is fallen by 10 million viewers since 2015.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this variety. Oh, so 25 is then very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is very good.  Mass ain't mass no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ryan Seacrest.  Rocking, rocking, rocking either Ryan Seacrest, Rock and Eve.  Nineteen point six million viewers last New Year's Eve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's because you have to watch it when it's on, because like we talk about it.  Like, but one of the issues is if you have if you don't have to watch something  when it's on, you basically you have infinite opportunities.  So you may not watch it ever in some ways or, you know.  But yeah.  I think we also do more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We will. Yes, yes, we'll be also.  So pay TV subscriptions have also fallen by 10.2 million cable cutters.  Competition for time is getting stronger, says Variety among not just streaming  services, but also video games and social media people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, yeah, I mean, like tonight, instead of watching prime time,  I'm going to be hanging out with my friends to an agenda tasting way better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. You know, it would be good.  I know when combine that with Seinfeld, because you'll be a little tipsy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I find Seinfeld really annoying.  Yeah, the ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would. You would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you feel about Moonlighting starring the fabulous  what former television critic, former television critic, Jeff something or other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I wasn't old enough to watch Moonlighting.  Oh, God. Moonlighting was good.  I'm sure it was.  I just will be a crush on Cybill Shepherd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  Who doesn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's Jammer B with the memory sound effect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's there's good news and bad news in the stock market.  As you know, it's been not great, especially for tech stocks of late.  Mark Zuckerberg, what did they say?  He lost $71 billion in net worth this year.  Yeah. Wow.  Seventy one billion.  Metta's market value down by more than 60 percent since the spring.  But during a hearing Monday on the future of a lawsuit  brought against Metta by a group of states, Aaron Pan, or the attorney  representing Facebook, said sometimes  facts that are good for an antitrust defense are bad for business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In other words, we're not we're not a monopoly anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go, you know, pound sand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kick somebody else who's down. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, there's a silver lining to losing 71 billion dollars.  Federal Trade Commission can just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does kind of stick a pin in antitrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google, each worth more than a trillion.  And Apple's case almost double that.  Metta worth half a trillion, five hundred billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here's here's the other thing.  I wrote a post about the  newspaper antitrust thing, allowing them to negotiate with the platforms.  And it was aimed it was the legislation was written  by companies to serve this many people, this much market cap.  So news publishers will be able to negotiate with Google  and Amazon and Microsoft and Apple.  But now Facebook, the one they all hated, is too small to fit under the description.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not I can't say I'm sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's still worth half a trillion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's not like, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. But boy, you're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark's not going to have to hunt his own meat or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, he might hunt his own meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He used to.  I was waiting for this Mike Masnick piece that came out last Friday.  You remember the Texas social media bill?  Which essentially said platforms should not be able to.  Kick anybody off, they shouldn't be able to.  It shouldn't be allowed to to.  They should be allowed to moderate that content for political reasons.  Of course, it was immediately challenged by Internet service providers and others.  NetChoice, which is a trade group and CCIA  immediately challenged it.  And and the lower court said, yeah,  you know, HB 20 is unconstitutional.  You can't the government shall pass no law  bridging the freedom of speech, including the freedom of a company to moderate its site.  The judge tossed out the entire laws unconstitutional.  Mike Masnick wrote, he wrote a thoughtful,  thorough ruling that explained why every bit of the law violated  the website's First Amendment rights.  To put in place their own editorial policies.  OK, so then the state of Texas appealed to the Fifth Circuit, which said, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they reinstated the law.  First Amendment, Schmurst Amendment, promised a ruling at some future date.  And now, of course, this NetChoice and CCIA have gone to the Supreme Court.  Oh, yeah, Florida's law was found unconstitutional by the 11th Circuit.  So Florida is also going to the Supreme Court.  So it's all so it's all going to come to the Supreme Court at some point.  I don't it'll be Jeff.  Will it be multiple cases or a single case?  I don't know how that I don't know how that will work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's because right now in one circuit versus another,  things are enforceable in different ways. Yeah.  So if you want if you want to go be mean, go be mean in Florida.  But or not go be mean in Texas, in Texas, and it'll have to stay up. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Obviously, for people who are reading it in Texas or just if you post it in Texas  or if your site hosts it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Stacy, you want to like to have laws that you can actually read and follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, how silly. Well, by the way, this is another law.  This Facebook might have just skated under the under the line  because you have to think of 50 million in revenue.  I can't remember what the rule is, but Facebook is is somewhat below that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a strategy, Leo. It's all a secret strategy.  He's playing five did all of this to get out of this regulation.  It's very clever of them, I think. Smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clearly, we want social networks,  IRC channels, forums to be able to moderate, to have rules, to say this shall not pass.  We don't want this kind of speech.  I understand that for some people, if there's if it's politically motivated,  then they go, well, I should have the right to say it.  You know, in our in our forums, the Twitter forums,  we've for a long time, we had a couple of people that kept coming in and saying,  you know, things that I deemed to be untrue about covid-19.  So I would kick them out.  Or I would actually I don't think we kicked anybody out.  I think we just deleted the thread or locked the thread.  I want to say you locked it.  Yeah, you're in lock the thread.  Yeah. And a lot of that's Paul Holder, who spends a lot of time moderating it.  Thank you, Paul.  But I agreed with him. It was the right thing to do.  We have the right to do that. We should have the right to do that.  Absolutely. In Texas, we would not.  So the problem, of course, the good news is we don't make 50 million dollars a year.  So we don't we don't you know, we get we can see the small ones can skate by.  It's really aimed at Twitter and Facebook, frankly.  And Facebook may even skate by on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's incredibly stupid, incredibly dangerous.  I worry so much about speech.  You know, I was thinking about this the other day, if you were if you were.  I was going to say we don't burn books in this country, but we are.  That'll come soon. We you know, people are banning them and so on.  They're already banned.  Might as well call it burning.  Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My fear is that nobody cares.  You know, we talk about it.  Mike Masnick obviously has an ulcer over it,  but I don't have you.  I've never seen this in the newspaper or on the TV or.  The newspaper should be standing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of all places should be standing.  I agree. Yeah.  And they and they're not.  Yes, you're right.  Because because they're because of the tech lash, because, oh, the Internet  has cooties and we're going to be against the Internet, as opposed to saying  see the trees for the forest, see the millions and billions of people  on the Internet hear their speech, understand.  But those are the people mass media always ignored and never put in their pages  and didn't respect.  You know, my city, the basic theory about the Internet is  it brought out all these bad, ugly people.  My theory is the opposite of this.  The Internet enabled people who were never heard in mass media to be heard.  And then it's the old bad, ugly people who used to control speech  who are now launching their counter-reformation.  And that's what we saw in January six.  And that's what we see in all this.  And it's a reaction to this, the speech on the Internet, not previously heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think that's true.  I think it's done both.  I think it gives people who haven't had a voice a voice,  but it definitely has given a voice to a lot of creepy crawlies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course it does. Of course it does.  It does that as well.  But I'm saying that the the the the Internet didn't create that,  that the reaction was it's reformation, counter-reformation.  And we have a lot of Martin Luther's out there today  who are saying things that that that people could control before.  And now that they can't be controlled, the old white male forces in the country  are going overboard to say, I'm going to burn everything down rather than share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hmm. I mean, I think that's some of it.  But I think basically you just opened up like you had a public square,  but everybody who's in the public square knew how to dress.  And then everyone's like, you know what?  We don't need everybody to like know how to dress to come into the public square.  We don't need a dress code.  And then you got people who couldn't afford the dress code, which was great.  Right. But who wanted to play by rules.  But you also got people who were like, yeah, screw the dress code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey's fashion analysis of the First Amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well,  I'm trying to get people to care about it.  Maybe people who care.  I don't want the people who care about dress codes to care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's not forget that the people who set these standards  that were called civility or objectivity  or civility were the old white.  Some of them. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some of them. Yes. Like I can't like I will not.  I mean, there are lots of people who still ask me why I'm so angry when.  Truly not.  But it's because I'm a woman who is speaking my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I will also say must not know that we got a spoof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't stop that in its tracks.  So so in some ways, you're right.  But there are still like I think both are true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, let me of course, of course, always the case.  But I think what's happening is that when you ask, why aren't newspapers  standing up for freedom of expression?  The trope that they follow is the Internet is bad.  And what we hear on the Internet is bad rather than seeing  that we need to defend the Internet because it allows voices  who've always been there but just weren't heard.  Well, why weren't they heard?  Because mass media didn't include them.  So it's part of the guilt of mass media as well.  I'm ashamed of our field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the I think the reason that you don't see a lot of this  in mainstream media is because it's so hard to cover.  It's so complicated. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're even having and someone's always going to someone's always going to come out  after you and say like really crappy things. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's been a lot of truthiness going on.  And it's very easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just wasn't sexy enough because that's that's what sells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  What doesn't sell is hard to explain.  That's really what's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People will buy into it if you are the aggrieved party.  I mean, what is it? Grievances?  They sell. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the Texas attorney general, our great friend, Ken Paxton,  said big tech attorney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought he was the lieutenant governor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A.G. now.  Big tech's reign of endless censorship  and their suppression of conservative viewpoints is coming to an end.  These massive corporate entities cannot continue to go unchecked  as they silence the voice of millions of Americans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. That's their aim.  His accent. Nice work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got it. You got it.  But so and one of the ways that they're kind of trying to make this OK  is saying, well, they're a common carrier.  They're like the phone company.  The phone company is not allowed to censor what you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he doesn't even want to be a common carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. Well, and of course, the irony is the FCC was able  to overturn that neutrality by saying they're not common carriers.  Exactly. It's it's it's situational ethics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Their aim is to be as shocking as possible and to allow and to not be.  The is to not have that shocking content pulled down because they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to shock. According to the post,  all of the appeals court justices, both in the fifth  and the 11th in Florida and Texas, have noted the difficulty  of applying Supreme Court precedents.  We're in a new arena, wrote  the judge, Leslie Southwick, on the fifth, who dissented from Friday's  decision, by the way, we're in a new arena, a very extensive one for speakers  and for those who would moderate this speech.  None of the precedents fit seamlessly.  The closest match I see is case law  establishing the right of newspapers to control what they do and do not print.  And that's the law that guides me.  That's why I'm not sure if it's a he or she that the judge dissented.  He he or she said, no, no, no, this we got to wait until the Supreme Court  gives us more guidance on this.  But then, of course, the people who approve of the Florida and Texas laws  are the ones who say, well, no, they're common carriers.  They should not.  But, you know, it doesn't take a lot of thinking to say, OK, let's say  they are common carriers that Twitter and Facebook can in no way  weigh in on the content.  Everything goes on their sites.  They don't want this.  I don't think you want this.  Nobody who uses it wants it because suddenly it becomes an instant cesspool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what they want, because that that that they want to be outrageous.  They want to cause January 6th.  They want to say that that that liberals are pedophiles and pizza parlors.  That's the and what do they get out of it?  They get votes on their so-called base.  They get money. Look how much Trump raises.  Rolls truth social stuff.  They get, but they get they get the power.  But you're going to create a useless platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. They don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Platform, but don't they also not want like  you could also have the truth there, though?  You can also have like, but look at truth.  Look at truth social Trump's platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's failing because nobody really wants to hang out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for the libs aren't there to be irritated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's it.  Yeah. But the libs won't be.  I can guarantee you the libs won't be on on Twitter if it's completely unmoderated.  I know what he would destroy education.  He would be in our chat room.  No one would be in our chat room if it were completely unmoderated.  Exactly. No one would use our forums if they were completely unmoderated,  unmoderated.  So then that has nothing to do with right or left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unmoderated truth and education won't have a voice.  Hallelujah, they say.  We'll chase them all away.  They don't have a voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They just have a voice elsewhere.  You'll just find them in other places.  I mean, we've seen like nobody wants to be on Facebook anymore.  Everybody's going over to other.  So you'll find other places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How does it all says it's the height of absurdity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the height of absurdity to say that the president of the United States  has been deplatformed.  What are you talking about?  The guy's got a bully pulpit to say that a senator is deplatformed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, OK, so journalism more valuable or the role of a journalist more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I just think it kills social media.  Justice Alito, who will be weighing in on this on the Supreme Court,  says social media platforms have transformed the way people communicate  with each other and obtain news.  At issue is a groundbreaking Texas law that addresses the power of dominant  social media corporations to shape public discussion  of the important issues of the day.  That's not untrue.  Just as a newspaper does, and there are there are conservative newspapers  and there are liberal newspapers and certainly editorial slant  can make one one way or the other. Right.  I don't think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pull back on that on that shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The government is not allowed to come into the newspaper and say,  you have to slant it one way or the other.  Exactly. That's up to the editorial board of the newspaper.  Is is the is is the premise here that there's so few social networks  that they can't be allowed to be run independently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the thing, Leo.  So I was reading you're going to roll your eyes.  I was reading a German newspaper about Jürgen Habermas's new book.  Oh, the excitement.  And, you know, his argument is, according to the story,  I tried to read that, yes, we used to have this many media players.  Now we have this many technology players.  But what that misses, once again, it doesn't see the trees for the forest.  It doesn't see that there are three billion voices who weren't there before.  If you don't look at it in the corporate, you look at the total voices.  It's a hugely more diverse world of speech.  But that's not how it's being analyzed.  Those cases is, oh, my God, we only have so many platforms and they're controlling.  Well, OK, let's talk about how they're controlling.  They may be seeking attention, just like old media.  But they're they're scared to death of making political judgments.  They're not pushing an agenda.  But the right has to say, no, no, no, everybody's against us.  And the platforms are, too.  They're taking down the buff says, take down hate speech.  And then the right says, that was my hate speech.  You took down. How dare you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is my question is, is there a difference between Twitter?  Let's say this show, if the government said,  you have to have this person on or that person on or you can't decide.  If somebody says they want to be on Twig, they you can't say no to that.  They should be forced to be a lot.  They're not going to they not they clearly they believe that traditional media.  And I guess this is closer to traditional media than social media.  They the government is not allowed to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can't say no. I wouldn't say that, Leo.  They're going to there are in some states.  They're now going after the bookstores, Barnes and Noble, saying,  you've got to carry certain books or you can't carry certain books.  That's so against the First Amendment.  But they're but they're proposing laws do that.  They're going to libraries and say, you can't have any book.  That's nice to gay people. Right.  We're the the Constitution's being the irony is that it's being thrown away  by the supposed constructionists. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so it's not the contention that there's something special about social.  Well, I mean, I think that's what Alito's saying.  There's something different about social media.  Our existing that's what they'll try to argue, but they're doing it across the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As well as as as Ant just said, ban a book, burn a book.  There's not a lot of difference. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. All right.  Let's take a little break.  A theory about why spam filtering on Gmail has stopped working so well.  Coming up next, Stacey Higginbotham's here, Stacey on IOT.com.  I is it is it an is never mind.  Never mind. I I I retract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it a jumpsuit question?  Yes. I can answer the jumpsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I retract the jumpsuit question.  Unless if you if you choose to bring it up, I can't stop you.  But I will I will not say anything.  Also, Jeff Jarvis, who is wearing a lovely black turtleneck sweater.  Mock turtleneck, not even a real turtleneck.  It's Uniclo Large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  None at all. Good.  Yes, I thought so.  Our show today. No. Yes. Thank you.  Our show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It reminds me of the TikTok video where the guy's training  his roommate not to be racist and he has a little squirt bottle.  And every every time he starts to say something racist, he squirts him like a cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's what we should get you, Stacey.  Just a little squirt bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just a little. It's the punch Leo button.  I can't believe I've been on the show for like five or six years.  It's hard. It's a difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's Mr. Burt? It's a technically difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is. It's a challenging thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we don't want to see the promise latency.  We don't want we want the punch to actually hit right at the right time.  Otherwise, the cat doesn't know what you're punishing him. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like clicker training. Exactly.

The poster said in the last two weeks, my Gmail inbox went from zero spam  to at least two thirds spam and phishing emails per day.  I've seen that.  So the theory, you know, the theory is this is really interesting.  Google's mail servers have been compromised for a couple of weeks.  It's being used for infected crypto spam.  Are you getting trader bot emails with attached PDFs, for example?  He says, I'm not sure if they're just compromised Gmail accounts or if the mail  servers themselves have been compromised.  There seem to be some reports on abuse, IPDB of intrusion attempts  coming directly from Google's mail servers.  Whoops.  Google, unfortunately, has declined to receive reports from spam cop.  He's been reporting it through abuse IPDB.  Here's one Google mail server that has over 300 abuse reports.  There are many more.  The thinking is perhaps it's coming from Google selling this.  It's not clear.  Maybe that even if Google is making money on it, but why isn't Google solving it?  So apparently this is not uncommon.  Compromised accounts are not uncommon.  I just thought I'd bring it up.  It's not a news story.  It's a hacker news thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you seen this on your Gmail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I honestly stopped using Google.  I used to use Gmail.  I used to put my mail through Gmail just for the spam filtering.  And then I noticed it wasn't doing a very good job, but this was years ago,  five years, six years ago.  So I just stopped.  I just started using a spam assassin and other technologies to do my spam filtering.  Honestly, at this point for me for spam, I just assume it's I have the zero trust model for spam.  I assume that every email you get is spam.  Instead of me trying to block spam, I try to find stuff in the spam that's okay.  For instance, if you're in my contact list, you get through things like that,  because otherwise spam has gotten worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, have you seen any change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't seen anything.  How about the Dick's Sporting Goods email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get a lot of those?  No.  Actually, hold on.  There's a guy here says, I'm getting 10 Dick's Sporting Goods email a day.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's all spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the problem is also for Google, it's hard for them to distinguish between spam and bacon.  Bacon being mail that you asked for, perhaps accidentally signing up for a mailing list when  you logged in.  So they don't want to block that because from the point of view of the vendor,  they got permission, right?  Yeah.  Maybe I want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get a lot of those, but I can't really call those spam because I do recognize where they  come from, but looking at it now, there's stuff from the hackers.  Yeah.  But it's a lot of that every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've just started testing, letting political spam through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't want them to do that.  I know, but they're testing that now.  You give them an email and like, God, I donated to ActBlue.  It was the worst thing I ever did.  No one donate to ActBlue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go write to give it directly to the candidate because...  And ask them never to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't say liberal things on podcasts because then people sign you up for Trump newsletters.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get all of those.  The problem with any political donation, it is public by law.  So if a spammer wants to mine the political donation database, they certainly can do that.  Let me see if I'm getting any Dix Sporting Goods.  Oh, I am getting a lot of Dix Sporting Goods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they in the spam though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I've ever signed up for it.  I've never even been into a Dix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have any in my spam filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was like, I'm not going to search Dix in my email at all.  Yeah, that's probably true.  I'm like, I'm just not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never signed up, I know, because I've never partake.  Oh, that's good.  So I just clicked the unsubscribe button and I got a 400.  So there you go.  There you go.  Hey, it's better than...  That's legit.  Yeah, that's legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is that?  You just gave them a positive...  Yeah, they said, oh, we got a sucker.  Yeah.  Yep.  Send them more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Well, anyway, yeah, I do feel like Gmail is not...  Which used to be the best way to not get spam.  Amazon's purchase of Roomba is, as we thought it might be,  under FTC investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, they're asking for more records.  The FTC was going to decide, once the deal was announced,  they were like, yeah, we're probably going to take a look at it.  And now they're like, all right, we need way more information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not an investigation that's just asking for...  I mean, it is an investigation, technically.  It is an investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you announce a deal, the FTC can tell the companies,  yeah, they can just pass on doing anything with it.  They can just be like, yeah, go ahead, have fun.  They can immediately say they're going to stop it,  or they can say, you know what, let's take a closer look.  Yeah.  Give me some...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iRobot disclosed yesterday that the FTC has formally requested documents from both companies  explaining the purpose and rationale of the acquisition.  Why do you want to do this?  They're also investigating Amazon's deal to buy One Life Healthcare.  Same thing.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  iRobot said both companies will cooperate and expect to promptly reply.  The problem is an investigation slows things down.  It could take up to a year, often does.  So it's all on hold until that's done, right?  It is.  That means the shareholders suffer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and even though we're trying to do this for the greater good,  I don't think they're trying to do it for the greater good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they're just trying to make...  I mean, who cares if the shareholders suffer, honestly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no suffering.  No money is exchanged.  It just puts it...  Yeah.  It just delays it.  But I think, you know, big companies these days...  I mean, every time we talk about Adobe buying Figma,  it's always pending regulatory approval.  You always run that risk.  Amazon says it's been...  With big deals.  ...a very good steward of people's data across all our businesses,  and then it really doesn't want any of Roomba's information  about what's going on inside of people's homes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's like just a red herring.  The issue isn't...  Like I said before, the issue isn't that Amazon's  getting more data necessarily.  The issue is that Amazon will then have the power and the tools  to create the ambient home in a way that presses their goals,  not the goals of other companies in the industry and or consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FTC is also investigating Amazon's Prime membership program.  According to a legal petition Amazon filed last month,  the company has asked the five-member commission  to quash subpoenas tied to the probe,  saying the FTC staff made excessive demands on poor little Jeff Bezos.  He's busy.  Don't bother him and other company executives.  Sorry, what is he doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's going to space.  He's not even doing that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's like sailing on a boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If he can get it out under the bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw him at the football game on Thursday Night Football.  Really?  Yeah.  He was there with his paramour and his main squeeze.  And who was he sitting with?  Some big shot, big wig.  They were chatting and talking and all that.  I hate that stuff.  Very prominently featured on the broadcast.  I wonder why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate that stuff.  I know.  Who cares?  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ooh, Jay-Z's at the ball game today.  I don't care.  He's not going to convert third and one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many of you listened to Serial?  It was the podcast that put podcasting on the map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, podcasting of that sort.  You are the podcast.  True Crime Podcasting.  True Crime Podcasting.  Some say this is a true crime, but we don't think so.  Yeah, it's a crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they just say it's a crime.  It's a crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Serial, which debuted in 2014,  they did a series of 12 episodes about the case against a,  at the time, teenager who Adnan Syed,  who had been accused of strangling his high school classmate in 1999.  He was found guilty serving a life prison sentence.  They examined the case with cliffhanger.  I didn't actually listen, but I know a lot of people did.  I did a lot of cliffhanging.  Cliffhangers.  They described his peculiarities of his lawyer who was disbarred and then died in 2004.  Well, here we are.  How many years later?  Eight years later.  Uh, Syed walked out of prison on Monday.  His conviction was overturned thanks to the serial podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there was also, well, yes, but there was an investigation then by both prosecutors.  Well, if it hadn't had the podcast, probably nobody would pay any attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure someone would argue.  Judge Melissa M. Finn of Baltimore City Circuit Court vacated the conviction in the interests of  justice and fairness, finding that prosecutors had failed to turn over evidence that could  have helped Syed at trial.  I guess that was one of the revelations of serial, right?  And discovered new evidence that could have affected the outcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Other possible suspects and somebody who could have been a witness in his favor.  The state AG was pissed as hell.  Pissed at whom?  At serial?  This happening.  No, at the city prosecutor for doing this.  Said he wasn't notified, wouldn't have done this.  Would have kept the conviction.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you listened to the whole thing.  I did.  I should have.  It was well done.  Yeah, it was very well done and I should have listened because it really transformed podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now being mocked by, you know, was it Only Murders in the Building?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's Steve Martin's show is basically making fun of true crime podcasts.  It's a loving tribute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It launched a bunch of, I mean, like serial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Serial never succeeded as well as the first episode.  Nobody was ever able to duplicate their amazing success in the first series.  So do you think Jeff's serial was legit?  Or were they trying to stir up interest for the interest of a podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's like any crime reporter ever has.  In New York Daily News, we did the same thing.  You know, the case of the missing nun, you know.  Right.  We'd do that kind of stuff.  We'd go back in the files and find old cases.  Do you think so?  It's a longstanding tradition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Was it straining credulity or did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was, no, it was well done.  It did not come to a conclusion.  It did not say he was innocent.  It led you that direction but did not come to a conclusion.  Yeah.  And the family of the victim is very upset by this and thinks that it was a legitimate verdict.  And the thing is, this is life.  Life is messy.  You never know.  Things aren't certain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Prosecutors recommended that his conviction be vacated and that he be granted a new trial  because they said the state no longer has confidence in the integrity of the conviction.  So the podcast convinced people.  That's key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's key.  And they don't know what they haven't yet said whether they're going to try him again or not.  He's on home detention.  He's out of prison but on home detention until they decide.  But what have you done, Leo?  You know, that podcast got somebody out of prison.  What the heck have you done all these years?  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Compared to that, I can't remember the audience numbers through the roof.  I mean, it really was.  It put podcasting on the map at the time.  Ms. Lee, the victim's brother, said and asked about the podcast,  this is not a podcast for me.  This is real life, a never-ending nightmare for 20 plus years.  He felt betrayed and blindsided by the motion to vacate  and frustrated with the many turns in the case of the last two decades.  Whenever I think it's over and it's ended, it's always coming back.  It's killing me and it's killing my mother.  Of course, if you were a family…  How many?  3.4 million.  Wow.  If you were in the family…  We do that almost every month.  If you were in the family of the victim and you thought they had the wrong guy  and the real guy was wandering around, you would want this to be reexamined, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they don't think they got the wrong guy.  That's what they're saying.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, they've bought heavily into that, which I mean, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time the wrong guy is convicted, the right guy is walking free.  Yes.  Right.  Yes.  So were you convinced, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was convinced he had a bad trial.  I was convinced he should have had a retrial.  Yeah.  That much, yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was also a documentary on HBO which came out a couple of years ago.  New York Times bought serial productions in 2020.  So it's now a part of the New York Times family of podcasts.  They never quite got that many...  It's hard.  That's catching lightning in a bottle, isn't it?  It really, really is.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's talk about helium.  It's AC time.  It's AC time.  So the first time I ever heard about helium was you.  You have a helium router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do.  I have a hotspot that is a Lora hotspot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Low range, long range.  Long range.  Long range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the idea is people use it and generate helium crypto tokens for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the idea is by having this hotspot, I am providing a node in a LoraWam network  that helium offers out to companies who want to use it.  They send their LoraWam data to my hotspot and then it goes over my home Wi-Fi  to the public internet.  In return for doing this, I get a helium network token.  Which is the helium's cryptocurrency, which then I can exchange either to buy data  credits on the helium network if I want to operate my own sensors, or I just sell for  cash money based on how much HNTs are exchanging on.  They are not exchanging for much now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the question.  Have you made money on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did.  I made a lot of money in the beginning and I sold it.  So I made actual money.  I made fiat currency.  I made 15 or $18,000.  Yeah, it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're not making much now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can tell you right now that I think it's worth...  Well, I never know what it's worth.  I never checked it.  So part of it was I didn't check it for a long time.  And then when I checked it, it was like $8,000.  And then all of a sudden it had the super run up.  And then it was like a lot of money.  And I was like, oh, holy cow, I should sell.  Right now, it's $565.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  And how many months is that?  Since when?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so there's two issues.  One, I'm generating fewer HNTs in the beginning to set up the network.  They incentivize people by giving them more HNTs, but also the value of HNTs  have dropped precipitously.  Like at its high point, the price of an HNT...  Like when I sold it was like $15 to $20.  And now it's at $4.30.  So there's a couple of things happening there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so has Bitcoin, which is now at $18,000.  So as ETH, which is now at $1,200.  I mean, all the cryptocurrencies have dropped quite a bit.  So that may not be a helium issue.  So the reason I bring it up is helium has made an announcement.  They're partnering with T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to make Helium Mobile a 5G wireless service for smartphones  using, I think, using your router, right?  Using the helium...  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  So it is the same sort of model, but it is not the same.  My router only does LoRa and Wi-Fi.  Ah, so it's too slow to do anything useful.  It doesn't have the right radio inside.  I mean, it's a totally different wireless network.  This is going to be 5G.  Yeah.  For 5G, you have to buy a different type of router.  And it's much more expensive.  It ranges from $1,800 to about $10,000 for this router.  Because a 5G radio is inherently more expensive and more complicated.  You're also going to need backhaul for any 5G.  You could use your Wi-Fi network.  And I actually asked Helium.  I was like, hey, how are you going to handle this?  Because 5G is a lot.  Okay.  This is verbatim what they sent me.  I said, hey, how does the Helium 5G hotspot handle large data requests on  a user's broadband account?  Are there limits?  They answered me, this move will allow 5G infrastructure to be accessible at a much  faster pace by enabling the Helium community to help build and use the network,  especially in hard to reach places.  So the answer is they're not answering.  So I don't know how you could actually do this reasonably and what kind of data  speeds you could expect on this network.  But if you're a subscriber, you can buy, if you're a T-Mobile subscriber,  you can now buy basically, well, let me rephrase that.  You can buy a Helium mobile subscription that will run on the Helium 5G network  and T-Mobile's 5G network.  Most of the time it's going to be on T-Mobile's 5G network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So according to the article on Decrypt, Helium has 950,000 node operators,  including Stacey Higginbotham.  They mentioned you by name.  No, they don't.  So that's pretty widespread, but as you say, not nearly widespread enough to provide 5G.  Helium's own 5G...  They only have 4,500 5G networks.  Oh, that's a little deceptive.  Okay.  That's for the IoT speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they have two separate tokens.  They have the HNTs, which is their IoT, and then they have what they call mobile, all caps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's hardly anybody has the Helium.  You said it was $18,000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's between $1,800 and $5,000.  Okay.  So very few people have those.  Right.  Only 4,500 of them are in operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Helium's own 5G network will be the preferred network from Helium mobile when coverage is  available, which is never.  Initially, voice calls will take place entirely on T-Mobile's network,  while data transfers will use service provided by node operators  in the decentralized network when available.  Otherwise, it falls back to T-Mobile.  So it'll behave probably like any other T-Mobile NVNO initially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but with less coverage.  Where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it'll use T-Mobile if you can't get anything else.  So it'll be just like a T-Mobile NVNO, but maybe if you're near somebody who has a 5G.  If you're near someone else's hots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  The idea is hopefully people will buy these.  If you're a WISP operator, like a wireless infrastructure provider in the middle of Lake  Wisconsin, you might want to put one of these up because you already have the infrastructure  and if you can earn money when, because T-Mobile doesn't have a 5G network in the middle of  nowhere in Wisconsin, but maybe people would use it if it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the analog to this is Xfinity's cell service, which is a Verizon NVNO.  If you're near an Xfinity router that's connected to the internet, you'll use that.  Otherwise, you'll use Verizon.  There are a lot more Xfinity routers out there, but it's the same idea.  You can bootstrap and in effect bootstrap your network by starting as a NVNO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are 20 million Xfinity routers out there because there are 20 million Comcast  Xfinity subscribers.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not all of us turn on our routers.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is true.  So if you don't use the Comcast modem, okay, you're right.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if I have a Helium 5G node, do I make money just like you do on your other Helium node?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When someone comes on your, you'll make it by proof of stake or sorry, sorry, sorry,  sorry, proof of coverage.  Like, hey, I'm here.  Is she really here?  Okay.  Yeah.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we've talked about, we were talking before the show about proof of work, which is how  Bitcoin works, proof of stake, which is how the new Ethereum works.  And there's also proof of coverage, which is not doing math problems.  I think just saying hello, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's basically saying hello.  Hello.  Are you really here?  Yes, I'm really here.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get to chain, you get a coin.  Okay.  Actually, you get a tenth of a coin.  I'm sure they'll be talking about the Ethereum emerge.  I think they did actually on Tech News Weekly last Thursday.  As far as we could tell, it went absolutely smoothly, flawlessly.  So Ethereum has moved from proof of work, which is very environmentally unfriendly system  that one Bitcoin uses and Ethereum used to use to proof of stake, which they say saves 99%  of the power that a proof of work protocol does.  And apparently did it flawlessly.  Not that Ethereum has not gone down in value, but so has Bitcoin.  The real losers in this are the miners, the Ethereum miners who had the big A6 and the  GPUs and were making money off of mining Ethereum because they won't be making that kind of money  anymore.  In fact, article in PC Magazine from last week, no one is profitable.  GPU mining faces dark days after Ethereum merge.  Yeah.  It also means you'll be able to find a lot of GPUs on eBay.  Not sure I'd buy them.  The merge-  Because the power should go down.  The merge killed it all off, said one miner named Philip Robb.  All my stuff is idling now.  Initially, miners were hoping to shift to alternative cryptocurrencies like Ergo  and Ravencoin, which can also be mined with PC graphics cards.  They're so worthless and the electricity is so expensive that you're just not going to  make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So why were these people that are using, that are doing the mining, are they all US-based  or where?  Well, for a while they were in China.  Because everybody doesn't have the same electricity rates that we have here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So a lot of them were in China until China booted them out because they would be next  door to hydroelectric dams where the electricity was virtually free.  Then you can make money, but you can't in California.  There's no way you can make money.  We have a friend, Steve Gibson and I have a good friend in Arizona who makes money  because his electricity rates are low.  I guess if you had solar in a state like Arizona, it might be profitable, but not anymore,  I guess is the point.  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would figure some of the rural European, it might not be as much of an issue to mine.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, some miners are taking a wait and see approach says BC Magazine on the possibility  that GPU mining could make a comeback one day.  Blake Teeter says he only plans to sell his older generation GPUs.  I'm cleaning my rigs and watching the market until a few coins stand out to mine profitability  wise.  I think GPU mining will still have a place in crypto mining at least for a few years.  It's also made up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also amazing.  But Leo, I asked you before the show to explain proof of stake to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So normally the way Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies originally were designed,  you would make money by solving tough math problems.  In order for a transaction to go through, let's say I want to give you a Bitcoin,  I then have to offer an amount of money for the transaction.  There's a default amount, but if you want the transaction to go through faster,  you might give a bigger percentage of the transaction.  And then it goes out to all the Bitcoin miners who attempt to solve the problem.  They're all working on it at the same time.  The first one to solve it gets the transaction fee, the gas fee.  So what you have is this duplication of effort across the whole.  All the miners are working full steam trying to commit stuff to the blockchain.  Proof of stake doesn't have that lottery system.  Or it actually does have a lottery system.  It doesn't have that system.  It picks one miner, says you get the transaction fee.  It doesn't necessarily reduce gas fees, but it keeps everybody from mining for the same coin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that miner, because when I read about it, does that miner verifies?  Is that miner also solving a problem?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's just not going.  Oh, I see.  That's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just going to one block per miner, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so you're presuming a trust there because that miner doesn't want to ruin their trust  if they screw it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's my understanding.  I'm sure I got it a little bit wrong, but it's life.  Ferret and the chairman says they solve for blocks of transactions, not individual transactions.  Well, yeah, they bundle them, but you get the idea.  You get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just put a link from CoinDest that's explaining the differences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two different methods to validate transactions.  The whole idea of blockchain, the whole idea of all of this is you have a decentralized  ledger that everybody who has a copy of the blockchain knows all the transactions that  happen on the blockchain.  So it's all simultaneously public and decentralized so that no bank runs it.  It's just run by every.  It's a consensus mechanism.  And in theory, that works better.  But I think there's certainly applications for a distributed database, obviously,  but not as many as one might think.  It works just fine.  The cost, I saw somewhere the cost of a Bitcoin transaction compared to a  hundred thousand Visa transactions.  And it's like a hundred times higher than a hundred thousand Visa transactions.  It's just not a sensible way of doing it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I heard you mention that, I think it was Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it was Sunday I heard you talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, whoa.  I wish I could find the story because I wonder where their source come from.  And that's a big factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody knows it's a very significant amount of energy used.  Proof of work requires, this is from the CoinDesk article.  Proof of work requires a significant amount of energy to verify transactions.  Since the computers on the network must spend a lot of energy and operate a lot,  the blockchain is less environmentally friendly than other systems.  By a lot, I added.  Another problem some raise is that because of the competition between miners for rewards,  a small number of mining pools control the blockchain, a kind of de facto centralization.  That's what happened in NFTs by the way.  OpenSea basically dominates.  It's important to note though that mining pools are made up of individual miners or  smaller groups of miners who are free to pull their hash power if they no longer  agree with the direction of the larger mining pool.  The downsides of proof of stake is that it requires an often enormous initial investment.  You must purchase enough of the native token of that cryptocurrency to qualify to be a  validator which is dependent on the size of the network.  In theory, people must be wealthy or earn enough money to buy a network stake.  Or you can buy a stake in the stake.  I wonder, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leading to an exclusively rich blockchain.  But then again, that's centralization.  It's 32 ETHs I think.  Yeah.  Could Bitcoin do what ETH just did?  What made ETH able to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a promise of Ethereum from the very beginning.  They also had to achieve consensus, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you got enough people to agree to do it on Bitcoin, then yes, you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got it.  It's just an algorithm.  You changed the algorithm, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  But you have to get 51% or maybe it's more to agree to decide that that's the new math  we all want to follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of this has roiled the GPU market.  One of the biggest GPU manufacturers, EVGA, has announced that they're out of the business  entirely.  Jesus.  80% of their revenue comes from making Nvidia GeForce GPUs.  They're cutting their ties with Nvidia saying it's a bad business.  It's a bad business.  A lot of us have EVGA cards.  Wow.  This is the problem.  Nvidia's gross margin has been going up, up and up.  Meanwhile, the people who make the cards, their profits been going down, down and down.  EVGA is just one of those partners.  So it's not a good business.  Nvidia is suffering too, frankly.  They just announced new cards, though, so maybe then I don't know.  We'll see.  The market's changing.  Well, and they also have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There is a legitimate market that is not driven by financial speculation for Nvidia's products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's three.  As far as I know, there's PC gaming, artificial intelligence, and driverless cars.  Those are big markets for Nvidia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's also transcoding.  There's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright, let's take a little break.  Can it be...  Wait a minute.  Before we take a break, I think I have to do a change log and stuff.  Shoot.  There's some other good stories here.  I know there's other good stories, but dude, we're already at an hour 48.  I got to do the picks of the week.  Life has to go on.  Jesus, it's already four o'clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had to go get my waffle.  I was hungry.  It's already four o'clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright, let me see real quick.  Clearview story is interesting.  No, no.  Robert Kinsel, former chief business officer of YouTube.  You mentioned he left YouTube.  He's going to Warner Music.  Going to run Warner Music.  Clearview used by police to find criminals now in public defender's hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After a Florida man accused of vehicular homicide,  his lawyer used their facial recognition software to prove his innocence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a guy who was in the passenger seat in a car.  The driver in a bad crash was thrown out.  Good Samaritan pulled him out.  The passenger door was jammed, so it pulled him out through the driver's door.  Then the cops said, you were the driver.  Oh.  He vehicular homicide.  The cops didn't get the name of the Good Samaritan.  Even though they interviewed him, they didn't get the name.  They said, you're going to jail.  So the lawyers said they had images from the police video of the Good Samaritan.  They needed to use Clearview to match face and find the real person.  They called the Clearview CEO and said, okay, we'll try this.  It's mainly only used for police.  In this case, they found the person.  This person said, yes, absolutely.  I pulled him out from the passenger side.  He was not the driver of the car.  The guy's not going to jail as a result.  Now, what's wrong in this story is the prosecution and the police were all messed up.  They shouldn't have gone after this guy in this way.  They should have done their job and gotten the documentation and all of that.  Nonetheless, it was technology that's decried and properly so for use by police only.  If it's also in the hands of defense, then shouldn't it be in both hands at least?  That's the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Technology is a tool and the police are lazy.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to do that story.  Let's see.  Appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I try.  No, we did the story.  I'm joking.  David, you're short.  AI is going to eliminate coding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not.  IEEE story?  No, it's not, but it's going to make people more dependent.  By the way, interesting stat.  It's not a number this week.  I'll use it anyway.  The bonus number is that within about a year, American colleges and universities will graduate  more computer science majors alone than all humanities.  Which means there's going to be a glut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  We need more English teachers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need more anthropologists.  We need more plumbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what we need.  Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need more plumbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need more carpenters, plumbers, handymen, people who can solve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We also need more historians and philosophers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We got plenty of those.  Yes, we do.  I was putting brake pads on my car the other day and I kept getting messages from people  and I'm like, yeah, I'm busy changing my brakes.  It's like it amazed people that somebody else would work on their car.  And I'm like, you all not do this?  Apparently not.  No.  So I'm like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you can't anymore because you need a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did I tell you the story of the one time I tried to change my oil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you tried to change your oil?  Let me guess.  You had your face under the hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was under the car and I was convinced by a co-worker, you know, you could do this,  Jeff.  You could really do this.  I went and bought all this stuff.  You just unscrewed the thing.  Yeah, just come to that.  No, I was under the car on a street in Chicago on the other side and I got the round thing  on the oil.  First, I took the nut off, got all the oil out.  So there's no oil in the car.  Good start.  Okay.  Good start.  And then I take the thing to try to get the filter off.  Yeah.  And I wrecked the filter but can't get it off.  So now I have a car that has no oil in it.  And no filter.  And if I put oil in it, it would come schmutzin' out of the filter.  So I had to have the car towed.  Towed.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  How about humiliation?  Humiliation.  Somebody of Ant's talents driving the tow truck saying, you idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you have the special filter wrench?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I did.  I got there and all I did was took a big screwdriver and stuck it through and then turned it and  it came off.  I've never tried to change my oil.  That's hilarious.  I certainly wouldn't be changing my brakes.  I'm so sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My dad taught me how to change my spark plugs.  That's good.  We used to do all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't do that anymore, Bites.  Now you don't do that anymore.  That's a skill you don't need.  You need a computer.  But this is the outfit I would wear if I were doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh-huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Rosie the Riveter over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Girl power.  Let's do the Google change log.  Otherwise, we'll never get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Fi offering free service.  If you were a Fi customer and you stopped, expect an email from Fi saying, please come  back.  Free service for the rest of the year.  Uh, if, if invited and you'll get an email if you are, you and up to five other people  get three months of free service, uh, which is about 720 bucks.  If you have all six lines going, if you are an existing Google Fi user, that'll be the  normal fee.  Thank you very much.  No deal for you.  No deal.  This is actually a much more useful story.  Google app starts rolling out results about you to help remove personal information.  Google said they'd be able to do this.  So here's the deal.  You have to be using the Google app.  Take control of results about you.  Your personal info is yours to share or not.  We're here to help you remove personal info you see on Google and you can have requests.  You can say, uh, you know what you want to remove from where Google will then do it.  You'll have to say, uh, answer the question.  Why would you like to remove this result?  It shows my personal contact info.  It shows my contact info with an intent to harm me.  It shows other personal info.  It contains illegal info or it's an outdated.  Remember they announced this, uh, Google IO it's now appearing in Europe and the U S  not wide though.  That's because they're doing it slowly.  So, um, it's important to note says Google when we receive a removal request, we'll evaluate  all content on the webpage to ensure we're not limiting the availability of other information  that is broadly useful.  For instance, in news articles.  Remember they said that because that was the question is when you're going to remove news  articles.  No removing contact information from Google search does not remove it for the web, which  is why you may wish to contact the web hosting site directly.  There is so much, you know, revenge porn and stuff like that on the web.  I think this is a good thing for Google to, uh, to do.  There've been companies that make a lot of money trying to do this, but really Google's  going to be the king of this one.  Google's to do list and reminders will finally work together.  Google is working on a big update to Google tasks integrating its reminder sister across  a system across assistant calendar and the rest of the Google suite of apps.  Uh, that's good, right?  Google tasks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put things on a to do list because then I don't do them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they're on your to do list, you consider that done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, then I fear them and they, and they hang over me.  They're scary.  Like torture.  And yes, that's the worst thing I can do is put it on a to do list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you have a Google assistant, you might try saying something like,  Hey, you know who remind me to take out the trash at nine.  It will then get added to your tasks.  Uh, as well as your reminders.  I think that's good.  What was Gina's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that always what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there were two separate things.  If you said remind me to put it on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I just got a reminder and it wasn't on my to do.  Okay.  Yeah.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gina had one called to do dot TXT, which was a command line based text to do program.  I don't know if she's maintains it or somebody else does it's open source.  Might somebody go to the command line.  Yeah.  I have terminal.  I have, I often go to terminal terminal, baby.  It's it all comes down to EMAX in the end.  Are you using Stadia?  Are you a pro member?  Look for 1440 P quality.  It's rolling out.  Of course, you'll have to have a lot of bandwidth to do that.  I would imagine.  YouTube's partner program is expanding so that people who do shorts will get some revenue.  The revenue sharing program.  And there also is a creator music catalog coming with licensed music.  To join.  Just saying this is a big deal.  Yeah, it is a big deal, but you got to be a pretty active.  You have to have 10 million views of your shorts over 90 days and a thousand channel subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My God.  I guess that's like going viral on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  10 million views seems like a lot to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a lot.  I didn't know it was an and I thought it was an or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a plus.  40,000 valid public watch hours.  But you know, you'll get some money, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the 20th of the month.  That's when YouTube sends out their pay.  Do you get a check?  Oh yeah, I always get beer money from YouTube.  So that's good.  It's quite nice.  And then when I saw the news about shorts, I was like, well, maybe I could put more into shorts.  I didn't see that and clause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  Google's numbers, YouTube's numbers are so inflated.  Maybe 10 million is not as much as it sounds.  I don't know.  And they're short.  The idea is this is Google's TikTok competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I always told him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But even on TikTok, 10 million is a lot of views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google has begun.  This is for you, Stacey.  Google has begun testing matter update for the Nest Hub Max.  It will give your Max Bridge and Extender features.  I have one of these Nest Hub Maxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am.  If you have the yeah, if you have their you can actually get their SDK and run matter today if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What will that give me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they approve you.  If you have any thread devices in your house that are also running on thread.  Which I probably do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I might not know it, but I probably do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  How would you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you have thread devices?  Yeah.  Do you have any Eve devices?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eve is one of them.  How about Wink?  Eve's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Wink?  How about SmartThings?  No, no, those are not.  How about Hue lights?  No, but Nanoleafs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nanoleafs.  Okay.  The newer Nanoleafs.  I'm not hip with the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're just messing with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  Yeah.  Chrome's incognito tab can now require your fingerprint on Android.  Seems that's the opposite of incognito.  That's the opposite of what you want.  So you could, oh, this is to lock your incognito tabs.  Oh, okay.  So you can have some incognito tabs open.  They'll be locked and then nobody will be able to see them unless you prove it's you.  Okay.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so no one will look at your porn if they pick up your phone to look at your photos.  There's no porn on my phone.  Got it.  What phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What porn?  Just saying.  Just his TikTok is good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look in the privacy and security settings.  There will be a switch, lock incognito tabs when you leave Chrome.  Turn that on and you can have it be fingerprint based as well.  Good.  And that's the Google change log.  Honey, can you give me your fingerprint on your phone, please?  Honey, just show me your face for a second.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm wise to your tricks.  All right.  Let's take a break when we come back.  Your picks of the week, if you will.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just going to ask your opinion about it.  I was curious.  We saw this coming, but Spotify going heavy in audiobooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, 300,000.  I can't remember what Audible has.  I think it's a good thing.  Audible really dominates right now.  It's a monopoly in effect.  Amazon's Audible.  There's others.  There's Libro.fm.  You get to roll on Apple.  Apple sells Audible books.  Google, I think, also sells Audible books.  I don't remember where Google gets its books.  But Audible really is kind of 90% of the market.  So in a way, I think that's good.  You're going to pay per book.  It's not a subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it split it up where you want a given book  and it's going to be on Spotify, not on Audible?  Is it going to fragment the market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because they make deals with publishers.  Random House has its books on a variety of services.  Audible does its own exclusives, which is very smart.  And that's it.  Yes.  This is Spotify trying to get out from under the thumb  of the record industry.  They are completely at the mercy of whatever the record  industry decides.  If they want to charge more, Spotify pays more.  If they charge less, Spotify pays less.  And if Taylor Swift doesn't like Spotify, that's it.  So Spotify is looking for alternate revenue streams.  Podcasts clearly are a big focus.  They've spent, I think they said they were going to spend,  was it $500 million on the podcasts?  They acquired a bunch of companies.  They bought Joe Rogan's show.  They bought a bunch of other shows for exclusive.  I think they've spent more than a billion now, actually at this point.  So this makes sense, you know, spoken word content.  It's not music.  I don't know if you're a Spotify listener,  I guess you don't mind living in the app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I guess I have my Spotify app open more often than not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think really a lot of it is also, to me anyway,  the deals these companies make with smart speakers.  Do you listen, when you listen to an audiobook,  do you listen on a smart speaker or do you listen on headphones?  Sometimes.  Usually I...  No, my speaker's not smart.  Well, I listen to the car.  So that's just the phone paired to the car.  But I will, because it's Audible, I'll ask Echo to play.  I'll say, read to me.  And it reads my book.  Unless it instead decides to play a movie from Netflix that I didn't ask for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But usually it reads my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audible is a sponsor, I should mention.  And I'm certainly not rooting against them.  I'm kind of like an Audible fanatic.  Yeah, so why?  But I think it's good to have competition.  Yeah.  And of course, Simon & Schuster says yes, it's good.  Competition also means perhaps,  you know, they can get a better deal from some of these companies.  According to the Times, Audible is by far the biggest audiobook retailer  with more than 760,000 titles.  Many of them originals.  Daniel Eck of Spotify says the company is prepared to invest heavily  in order to compete with Audible.  Just as we've done in podcasting, expect us to play to win.  Oh, I didn't even know they were playing to win.  Oh, no.  What does that mean, Daniel?  Play to win.  You competing against me?  OK, we can't make fun of people for their mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, we can't, but it's a good thing.  We can't make fun of people for their mind.  I mean, we can't, but it's silly.  Well, who are they competing with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand with audiobooks are competing with Audible, I guess.  Who are they competing with with podcasts?  All the little independent podcasts.  I'll give you the answer.  The ecosystem.  Because I know they're competing with the ecosystem.  Exactly.  Or the ecosystem.  The eco-eco, it's all the same to me.  Stacey Higginbotham, your thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so I don't...  Did y'all talk about this?  Because it's really important.  Did y'all talk about this last week of my story about matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Your story?  No.  What was your story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't usually promote my own stuff, y'all.  So, bear with me.  But I did on my newsletter last week, and I think it came out Monday, maybe,  Five Ways Matter Will Disappoint Users at Launch.  For a second there, I thought I typed lunch in my headline.  It was like...  And I think this is important to talk about because I have been really extolling the  virtues of matter.  And I spent last week in Austin eating tacos and attending this particular event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where you were.  That's a secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing is really secret in my life.  And I have to say, you should check this out because matter is...  It's not going to be a failure, but it is not going to be as cool as we all wanted it to be.  And there's a couple reasons for that.  One is it's very complicated.  And so things are going to break for heavy users.  And I think that's really important to note.  Anyway, y'all should just check this out if you're interested in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, what's a heavy user means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so some things like if you are someone who has lots of complicated routines,  matter is probably not going to help you very much.  If you want to...  My home, when I switch over to matter, it might be rough going.  One of the biggest promises of matter was that developers would be able to build once  and won't need it.  But since 2019, when it was launched, there's been a lot of programs on top of that.  So things like Google's Home Device SDK and Intelligence Clusters,  Amazon's Ambient Home Development Kit, where they're trying to tell your stuff  if you're home or away or not.  That all is way above matter.  So if you're developing, you're still going to have to focus on those.  So that's kind of sucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else is there?  So matter is really a low level interface.  It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Super low level.  A lot of your devices too, one of the other values was that you weren't going to have  as many apps.  I was really looking forward to dumping a lot of my one-off apps.  That's probably not going to be the case for things like my smart plugs  that track energy monitoring.  The energy monitoring isn't going to come through on matter.  So I'm going to still need that.  Even your lock apps are going to have setting codes and things like that might not be  supported with matter.  So it's just...  They over promise, they're going to under deliver.  It'll get better over time, but it's still like...  I think this is probably a good level set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So where would you at this point would recommend people go for a capable home hub?  All of them will support matter eventually, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, like the big ones, yes.  I think if you are just a normal person who wants some convenience like lights,  if you're an Apple user, do HomeKit.  If you're a Google or Amazon person, you can do those too.  Most normal people should not be...  Like smart things is nice.  I like it, but it's too much for normal people.  If I use HomeKit, do I also get access to matter capabilities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can it talk to other devices?  Yeah.  So you're really choosing the higher level interface is going to come from whatever  system you choose and matter is really an interoperability layer  so that you can have multiple devices in the same house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an interoperability...  So you don't have to sit there and like when you're buying a light bulb go,  crap, does this work with Madam A or does this work with G?  Well, but...  You can see that it works with matter.  A light bulb is going to have all those logos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not going to just stop with the matter logo.  It's going to have all those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, someone else was very upset over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're like, I still have to do all the logos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was like, oh, sorry.  There are like so many badges.  But prior to this, you didn't actually know.  Your ring sensors don't work with your Google stuff.  And now if you buy a ring, a matter sensor, a matter security sensor,  or sorry, a ring security sensor that's matter certified,  it will talk to your Google Home.  Oh, my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like I'm not unusual in thinking.  Nobody got time for this.  This isn't...  I got more important things to do than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's fair.  Well, anyway, that's my...  It's not really a thing.  Also, Kevin reviewed a Laura developer kit.  So if you're...  I saw you built one.

Transcript:  He's just sending data today.  He asked for good...  He was like, send project in the show that comes out tomorrow.  He asked for project ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay. Cool. Nice.  Yeah. It's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it's a sweet little kit.  It's kind of pricey.  Sparrow development kit.  Yeah. It's Rayazzi's company.  Oh, is it?  Oh.  Yeah. Blue's Wireless is Rayazzi's latest company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's a step down.  What's he going to do next?  Is he going to sell fireplace inserts?  This is...  Ooh.  This is...  Ooh.  It's connectivity.  It was like a big shot.  Microsoft, he created Lotus Notes.  Lotus Notes.  Now he's doing like boxes to connect things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he's doing connectivity plans for IoT devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be big.  It'll be huge. Someday.  Someday it'll be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was not prepared for the dig against Rayazzi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We live in the same place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got to go. We got to go.  We got to check.  We got to check it out.  See what?  For Bainbridge?  Move next door to Rayazzi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She-she.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She-she.  I'm she-she.  Jeff Jarvis, Number of the Week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, since we were talking about books, I was starting to research something.  During the Department of Justice versus Penguin Random House trial going on,  trying to stop the acquisition of Simon & Schuster,  there was a thing that resonated all around literary Twitter about how few books sell.  And so NPD Bookscans' Kristen McLean came in and used the numbers and gave this,  which I thought maybe you might find interesting.  So total number of titles, new titles last year, 487,000.  She looked only at the top 10 publishers.  All right. So these guys are going to make money, right?  So out of that, they've published 45,000 titles.  Copy so far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Out of 45,000 titles, how many do you think sold more than 100,000?  That's not, I'm not even talking about millions.  I'm just taking 100,000 as a decent, decent, good popular sale.  Stacey, what'd you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say it doesn't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So those who sold between 50,000, 100,000 about double that, right?  But you get down all the way down the bottom.  14.7% of these books, 6,700 of them sold fewer than 12 copies.  Oh, that's so depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that was the 12th.  Okay. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was the 12th.  51%, half of them sold between 12,000, 12 copies and 1,000 copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to sell 12 to the author and the author's mother alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you write a book in 12, you can't sell 12 copies to your friends and family.  So depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like if I published a book, I could probably get 100 people to buy it, max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't.  I've got your book, Ant.  You have.  My mom wouldn't even buy it.  She'd be like, boy, move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My best-selling book was, I think, 55,000 copies.  Which is good.  That's the second year there.  Well, with having a TV show behind it, it's still pretty.  Pearson was very happy, but it was like, so there's no money and this is what you're saying?  They're saying, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Will Page, who was the former chief economist at Spotify,  also in part of this discussion, for Context, said that out of the 6.3 million artists on Spotify,  just let that sink in, 6.3 million singer-songwriters in the world, everybody wants to give you their song,  78% of them have a monthly audience of fewer than 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  So if the buy-in-a-world is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shout out to my favorite singer-songwriter, Slay Cleaves.  He's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The good news is if you put Poo Poo in the title, you make millions because  two-year-olds love to shout, echo, play Poo Poo.  Note to self.  I am not kidding.  Show titles.  They, anybody who's got a toddler in the house knows, they love doing that and they'll do it  over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They do, they like farts too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  Speaking of disinformation, Poo Poo and farts, I should talk about disinformation online and give  a plug to our friend, Joan Donovan's book, Meme Wars, is out right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should have had Poo Poo in the title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now available on Spotify Plus, the Poop Song by the Toilet Bowl Cleaners,  Poop Song and Lyrics by Donald Glover.  Never gonna poop on the floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you play any of these, we'll get taken off YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about you thought we ran out of poop song ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were wrong by the Toilet Bowl Cleaners.  Poop Clouds.  This Toilet Bowl Cleaners actually have a whole album of this.  Yeah.  Randy Licky poops 11 times a day.  Poop Sneeze, Bristol Stool Chart.  I want stomach flu because I love to poo.  You can stop now.  You can stop.  Tell me if I'm a booger on my nose.  Please, please stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, the Magnum Opus.  I didn't pee on my tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huge.  These guys make a lot of money.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  Mr. Anthony Pruitt, your pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My pick is InShot for your iOS or Android devices.  Yes.  Editing the app for photos and video.  I've been playing with it in contrast to using Premier Rush on my mobile device.  And it's pretty daggum slick.  It's got nice transitions, really easy to use.  And the video quality comes out 30 frames per second like it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it that you can do stills and movies.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Free app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's free ads in it.  Yeah, there's some ads.  And if you're in a session and you want to stop the ads from popping up,  you just have to watch along with it, similar to how we talked about it at the beginning of the  show with Hulu.  And then you can just continue doing what you need to do without any ad interruptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you pay to get rid of the ads or is that not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I don't remember seeing that option.  Nice.  InShot.  Because I've been using Premier Rush and Premier Rush gets on my nerves some days.  They could do a lot better with Adobe.  And hopefully with our very own all about Android,  I'd miss when to it now be in there at Adobe.  Maybe that's something that's going to change.  Oh, she got a job at Adobe, did she?  Yeah, she's at Adobe now.  Nice.  Good for her.  We've had it.  I'll just say that.  Yeah, that's great.  And my last pick, this is from M.  I don't know.  I can't think of the name, but someone sent this to me on Twitter and I thought it was pretty  dank.  I'm cool.  And it's Mike Pokernik.  Pokernik.  Sorry if I'm mispronouncing your last name, but it's AI portraits.  Imagine how celebrities would look if they were still alive today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has an Instagram.  He uses AI to do this.  Here's Princess Diana if she were still alive today.  What I want to do is do one for me.  That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't like that one because I think you got that one wrong.  This is who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's this?  That's Michael Jackson.  Oh, MJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that's Michael Jackson from the 70s.  Michael Jackson from the 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  There's Amy Winehouse.  She wouldn't be that old now.  Here's the Beatles.  So actually Sir Paul and Ringo, that's what they look like.  But this is what John Lennon would look like now, what George Harrison would look like now.  It's really good.  I mean, it's a guess.  Heath Ledger.  Yeah, Heath Ledger as if he didn't have the...  This is Freddie Mercury wearing suspenders.  Look a little like Tom Selleck, but I guess he would, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yep.  My favorite one is that one, Tupac.  Tupac.  Because a lot of the rappers from the 90s and early 2000s, I've seen them today and most of them  have aged pretty much about like how that image looks.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's Turkish, so some of these are...  Here's Turkish, that's John Lennon.  Who is this?  Madonna.  Well, I don't think we have to guess.  She's already in her 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then she doesn't look like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has some other AI artwork too, which is beautiful.  So this is Mid Journey.  So he does some interesting stuff.  Those ducks are real.  Pretty good stuff.  They're not AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I did a mid journey the other day of...  I think I said Milky Way at Night in Napa Valley.  It was something really simple like that.  And it came out quite nicely and a lot of people enjoyed it.  And I had to be very clear.  This is not my photograph.  This is AI.  And I think that's a problem that we could probably run into in the future with people  using these tools to create the art and taking all the credit for it.  And I don't know if that's necessarily right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, just make sure you get the Getty images watermark off of it before you try to pass it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trust me, I've severed my relationship with Getty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Getty don't pay enough money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I want to talk about the iPhone, the new iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  Using the iPhone camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everybody's pretty excited about that camera.  So I figured I would do an episode and share my two cents on it.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't borrow mine though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, don't worry.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I need it.  I got to take pictures of Roger Waters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah.  Mr. Jamer B was talking about the concert that he went to Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He went Tuesday.  He's been to like a dozen of them, but we're all going on Friday.  Micah's going.  Jason Howell's going, right?  We're all going.  It's going to be exciting.  And you could come.  Benito.  It's football.  Benito.  It's football.  Football.  Oh, college.  High school football.  High school and college.  And college.  Oh, you can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Football season.  Got to have our priorities here.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism.  I think Greg Newmark.  Newmark.  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Hey, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't think you read the whole card, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I didn't read this part.  Google shareholder, former TV guide critic Frank Sinatra called him a bummer.  Ray Kroc called him a nickel millionaire.  Murphy Brown called him a bottomless pit of hate.  Formerly one of San Francisco's most fundamental boundaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Pat Sajak hates him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Pat Sajak hates him, says it right at the bottom.  Hated by, would you write that on?
