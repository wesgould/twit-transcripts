It's time for This Week in Google, the show that covers Google, the cloud and really pretty  much anything we feel like talking about.  That's because we have such a great team of people.  Now, Jeff Jarvis is away today.  He's taking Jake to college, which is kind of cool.  But Gina Trippani is here from SmarterWear.org and ThinkUp app.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, how's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going great.  We brought in a nice bunch of people to, took two people to replace Jeff Jarvis today, starting  all the way to my right from Lifehacker, the editor in chief, Adam Pash.  Hi, Adam.  Hey, how's it going?  It's great to see you.  Thank you for joining us.  Thanks for having me.  And from the Googleverse itself, from the Plex, Mr. Chris DeBona.  Chris's old friend used to be a regular on the screensavers showing open source software.  That's back when you were with SourceForge.  Yeah, way back when.  And in fact, was the original host of Floss Weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was before I flicked out according to Wikipedia.  Does it say that on Wikipedia?  No, no, it's actually true.  And then due to commitment issues, and I'm like, that sounds kind of neat.  You were busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Commitment issues.  I have problems with commitment.  Well, due to his problems with commitment, he no longer hosts that show.  But that's because his commitments involve being manager of open source software for  all of Google.  Yeah.  So that's a pretty big job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a little tiny job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You keep it.  Tiny.  It's very busy, especially now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Top story today, I think is not a Google story, except maybe peripherally.  The United States Department of Justice has now filed a complaint to block AT&T and its  $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile.  With a B.  With a B. $39 billion dollars saying it violates antitrust law.  I have to say this.  I can't remember when the last antitrust litigation happened in the US.  But this is a big deal.  But let's start, I guess, with you, Gina.  Is this unexpected?  Does this surprise you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know that it surprises me, but as a T-Mobile customer, I'm sort of glad that  I'm not an AT&T customer.  Yeah.  I mean, I think this kind of makes sense.  I really like the idea of having more choice.  I really like T-Mobile.  I used to be an AT&T customer.  I wasn't thrilled about the announcement of the merger.  I know that a lot of free market folks don't like the idea of regulatory agencies stopping  this kind of thing.  But I mean, I think it makes sense.  I think more choice is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Adam Pash, a surprise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I'm kind of cynical, so I always assume that stuff like this is going to go through.  Me too.  But I'm likewise pleased.  I think it's generally going to be better for consumers, and so I'm not going to complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But wait, AT&T offered to bring home 5,000 call center jobs.  That's not better for consumers.  AT&T said that this merger would allow them to put 4G in 97% of America.  That's not better for consumers, or was that just a lot of smoke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the 5,000 thing is sort of, it seemed less like it had anything to do  with the deal and more about like, hey, help us out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At a time when many Americans are struggling and our economy faces significant challenges,  we're pleased that the T-Mobile merger allows us.  We couldn't have done this.  No, no, no.  Couldn't have brought those jobs back, but this merger allows us to bring 5,000 jobs back.  Of course, they don't mention how many jobs will be lost by the obvious duplication of jobs  by the merger of the two companies.  Could be tens of thousands.  They say no, but of course, jobs will be lost.  We also saw a leaked memo thanks to their law firm that said that, well, if we wanted to put,  if the merger doesn't happen and we wanted to put 4G in 97% of the U.S. all by ourselves,  could we do it?  Oh yeah, for $3.9 billion, one-tenth the cost, we could do it.  So I have to think that the Department of Justice might have just noticed this stuff and  said this is not a good thing.  How, though, can you call it an antitrust action when there are, in fact, four cell companies  in this country and this would only bring us down to three, Christopher?  I mean, it doesn't seem like that would make AT&T a trust, would it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think when I think about cell phone companies in the United States, I think of  those that are running on the GSM frequencies, and then I think of the ones that are running  on the CDMA.  That's a good point.  It would be the only GSM phone.  We have Sprint and Extel versus Verizon.  In GSM, we have T-Mobile versus Sprint, versus AT&T.  There's no one else.  So what we're saying basically is that all GSM activity in the United States is going  to go through one company if the merger goes through.  So that's a decision for the antitrust people and for AT&T and T-Mobile to talk about it,  it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a big win actually for Deutsche Telekom because there's a $3 billion fee should this  not get approved by regulators.  That's cash that goes to Deutsche Telekom.  Wow, that's the kill fee on that one?  That's the kill fee, $3 billion.  And, and this is the part as a T-Mobile customer we like, Gina, AT&T will provide T-Mobile  USA with wireless spectrum in some regions and reduced charges for calls into AT&T's  network.  So the kill fee, according to Deutsche Telekom, is worth as much as $7 billion.  Ow, that's got to hurt AT&T.  And it couldn't happen to an Iserfo company.  This is so sad because really, I mean, I don't know why I've got the knives out for them,  but nobody likes AT&T.  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I would also temper that by saying you're in the Bay Area where AT&T's network  seems to be very oversubscribed.  That's actually true.  I can't drive on 280 without dropping.  So there are some areas where people seem to really like it though, like Tampa, where  my parents live.  AT&T seems fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the heat map of AT&T hatred is definitely very red in the Bay Area for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And New York, so from a media perspective, everyone's like, I hate AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  And New York as well.  I wonder if they make the GSM CDMA distinction in any of these filings.  It doesn't look like they did, but I think that's a really good point to say this is  this would make AT&T the only GSM choice.  I travel a lot internationally, so I try to go with GSM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  That's why we have T-Mobile phones.  Yep.  I would guess though that the other issue is that would make AT&T by far the largest  phone company.  They would leapfrog Verizon.  And the other issue is that Sprint now becomes really a laggard.  You have these two giants, Verizon and AT&T, and then the little bitty Sprint, which probably  means that Sprint would get snapped up.  Maya, here's an interesting question.  Regulators didn't approve this because it was a big phone company buying a little phone  company.  Would regulators approve a T-Mobile acquisition by, let's say, Google or by, in fact, we'd  heard rumors that Google might be looking at Sprint or by, let's say, Apple.  And would Google or Apple even consider the idea of buying a phone company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think a more interesting speculation is what if Sprint and T-Mobile got together?  How weird would that be?  You know?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess it would because it would make, you know, that case would remind me of the satellite,  DirecTV and Dish getting together.  And the reason that was allowed, which clearly made a monopoly, there's only one satellite,  you know, a small satellite company in the United States now.  But that was allowed because both companies were about to fail.  They were about to go on.  Or like SiriusXM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it's not like DirecTV.  I'm sorry.  Not DirecTV and Dish.  SiriusXM.  What am I thinking?  You're absolutely right.  Yes.  Sirius, the satellite radio, I should say.  Thank you for correcting me.  I don't know.  I was smoking pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they were.  They were actually in financial trouble, those two.  They were.  They were about to go under.  That's not my impression.  Maybe Sprint.  I don't follow Sprint very closely, but you know, T-Mobile seems to be doing great guns.  I mean, you know, they're worth $39 billion, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least that much.  Yeah.  Google has been using T-Mobile for its Google Experience phones.  The Nexus One, the Nexus S. Adam keeps dropping out.  We're going to keep getting Adam back.  We'll get him back.  And I like it because it is GSM.  So I can use all kinds of different.  I have the G2X.  I have in my hot little hands a Samsung Galaxy 2, which is part of the story a little later  on.  That's Eileen's phone.  And then also this HTC Sensation.  These are all great Android phones.  I mean, I know you don't speak for Google, Chris.  I mean, I kind of do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was letting you off the hook.  I think it's kind of specious.  I would expect.  Well, you don't speak for the phone division, let's say, the Android division, but there  must be some happiness that T-Mobile will stick around.  I mean, that makes it easier for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no idea, honestly.  And it's too early to tell.  We saw the headlines this morning when you did and we're like, I wonder what that means.  And there were rumors at the next.  Trying to guess.  You know, one of the things I've learned working in this business, and you probably know this  too, trying to guess what the DOJ is going to do.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just, who knows?  The combination, they said, the DOJ said the combination of AT&T and T-Mobile would result  in tens of millions of consumers all across the U.S. facing higher prices, fewer choices,  and lower quality products for mobile wireless services.  Wow.  That's so smart.  And it's smart.  This is Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole.  Continues on consumers across the country, including those in rural areas, which was  part of the selling point on this, and lower incomes benefit from competition among the  wireless carriers, particularly the four remaining national carriers.  They're saying something there too.  There's four remaining.  The lawsuit seeks to ensure that everyone can continue to receive the benefits of that competition.  Boy, I just have to say, you know, two thumbs up.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really great.  I wonder what Jarvis, I'm thinking about what Jarvis would have to say.  Well, he's going to be happy, right?  Yeah, I think so.  I don't know.  We'll have to ask him next week.  Yeah.  He doesn't like too much regulation, so we'll see.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, but I think even if you're a libertarian, and I've heard libertarians say this, the  one area of government involvement that does make sense in the economy is prevention of  monopolies, antitrust.  That's one thing you clearly need, and it's one place that only the government can intervene.  The market, in fact, promotes trusts, promotes monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think that even Jeff Jarvis may agree this is a good thing.  Google is looking at using plus one data.  You know, this is, I think, tell me, Christa Bona, if this is a specious story.  Some have said that this is just a specious story, that when the plus one button was announced,  Google said, we're going to use these signals to improve search.  And now, somehow, somebody got the notion that this is somehow something new, that Google's  going to use the plus one button to rerank search results.  Is this the same as what Google announced in the first place, or is this some new way  that they're going to use the plus one button?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to lie to you.  I didn't read it that closely, and I'm not Matt Cutts.  So maybe I missed some of the subtleties of this issue, but it seems that we already said  we were going to look at plus one data for search quality.  That's what I thought.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's August, right?  So people are going to take old stories, make them sound new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everything is new again.  Adam, have you been paying attention to this?  Is this really, truly something new?  Oh, we lost his audio.  Hello, Adam.  Is it us, or is it Adam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He should be on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Adam, did you mute yourself there?  Adam, did you push that mute button on the hit-and-run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want me to pretend I'm Adam?  I could...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hi, I work for LikeHackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He doesn't talk like that.  I'll tell you what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't like magic gathering.  Google sent an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I work for LikeHackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I work for LikeHackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I work for like a magic gathering.  Google sent an email.  Can you hear me now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, can hear you now.  Yeah, Mr. Verizon Man.  You even look like that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, okay, okay.  Sorry.  I think the main thing...  Is the main thing now more about the fact that Google Plus exists as an entity?  Isn't that like sort of what the hook behind the new story is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the confusion about plus one, isn't it?  Is it Google Plus or what?  Here's what Google said in an email to Wired.com, Ryan's single writing.  Google will study...  This is a quote.  Google will study the clicks on plus one buttons.  Those are the buttons that websites have.  I have them on mine.  Where they...  If you like an article or a blog post or whatever, you plus one it, right?  Google will study the clicks on plus one buttons as a signal that influences the ranking and  appearance of websites and search results.  The ranking and appearance of sites and web results.  The purpose of any ranking signal is to improve overall search quality for plus ones and other  social ranking signals as with any new ranking signal.  We'll be starting carefully and learning how those signals relate to quality, which all  that makes sense.  But I would have thought the whole idea about plus one in the first place was exactly that,  to get social signals into search.  Now if you look at my search result for Leoville, this was a lab thing, right, Gina, where you  had a plus one that you could plus one a site, right?  See I'm not going to plus one that one.  Smoking hot, yeah.  Let me just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think that's a lab feature anymore.  I think that that...  Is that now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a full rolled out feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's one way that we can plus one.  And then if I go to my site, because I've added the plus one button to blog posts, let's  go to a blog post.  This is another signal that a site operator can add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, this is where the good stuff is, right?  Because if you're on a page...  This is the problem.  You don't want to plus one a search result in the results because you don't know if it's  good yet, right?  Because you haven't clicked through.  But having the plus one on a page that you're looking at already...  Yeah, and also it lets you share to Google Plus as well.  So not only does it add the plus one, but you can then write some copies...  Oops, I unplussed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It pluses and minuses.  This is nice to share to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is.  You can share to your stream.  This makes complete sense.  This is just one more signal that Google's going to use.  This doesn't turn Google search results into dig.  I think that that's maybe the concern is that people are going to try to game it and it's  going to be whatever links have the most pluses.  Google at this point, the search engine has, I'm sure, thousands of signals that it uses  to determine ranking.  It's not just going to be plus ones.  And I think we can...  I don't know, maybe we shouldn't assume, but I think we can pretty optimistically hope that  Google has some really good spam or gaming prevention mechanisms in place.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that would be the risk, is that people will go plus one their site like crazy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  I think the other thing though is that the Wired article tries to make the point that  now that plus one is tied into Google Plus, it incentivizes users to use Google Plus over  Facebook and I think there's a slight concern about that sort of competitive advantage.  Or at least that's what I think, that's what I understood part of the point of the article  to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a plus one on Google Plus would be the same as a plus one on the page or sharing  it on Google Plus would be an effective plus one.  I don't know if that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can now plus one something that...  Plus one's just this week, didn't they tie into Google Plus?  You can plus one something and it will automatically show up in your Google Plus, like liking something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if it automatically does.  We saw that form drop down.  So what you're saying is that if I am now on Google Plus and I look at Josh's post here  that says the best 404 ever, if I plus one it on Google Plus, I don't think that's the  same as plus wanting it on the page or in the search results or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.  I think it's more like...  So share would put it into your stream, right?  But plus one within Google Plus doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That seems like that.  But again, this is a useful signal.  But I think in that case, Adam, you'd be right that that would over-prioritize Google  Plus over other social signals.  I mean, clearly Google has social signal envy.  I mean, they look at what Facebook's doing and I think the big fear is that Facebook,  with all of its social signals, all of its data, all of its metadata on top of search,  could ultimately outdo Google in some spaces if you were looking for a restaurant or a  recommendation or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they also have the whole web indexed with every link from page to page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google really, if Google can incorporate some social into there, I guess Bing is the  threat because Bing does incorporate the Facebook social signals into itself, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what do you think, Adam?  Is this...  I mean, I think this makes perfect sense.  If you're Google, why not incorporate this data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, of course Google wants to make their product better and they don't have access  to Facebook's data.  Bing has that and they have to make do somewhere.  So it seems like a pretty obvious move for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I imagine after the Justice Department finally grew some teeth with this T-Mobile thing that  now everybody's going to kind of start thinking, hmm, is this going to be a cause for concern?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is why we have a lady on the panel, so we soften some of the...  Teeth, they grew some...  Yeah, exactly.  Teeth is what they grew.  Fangs.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now Forbes had a story that said, stick Google plus buttons on your pages or your search  traffic suffers.  It was a story by Cashmere Hill.  Hill wrote about a meeting that he had with Google ad representatives and said, quote,  the message in this meeting was clear.  Put a plus one button on your pages or your search traffic will suffer.  Forbes did kill that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is my skeptical face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you being skeptical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That doesn't sound like the company you work for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  I mean, you have 30,000 people in a company and somebody is going to say some wrong things  now and then in a client meeting, right?  But that doesn't sound right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that...  I think the right...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure that there's a...  Logically speaking, if plus ones add to your stream, which leads to more traffic from your  fan base, okay.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's where you have to really walk a fine line, isn't it?  You have to have almost a Chinese wall between ad sales and the people who would like you  to put a plus one on there for obvious reasons.  The search people who really say, well, we want to take signals from every source in  as best we can incorporate them in the search results because social signals do improve  search.  A human...  This is so funny because it's almost coming full circle.  In the early days of search, Yahoo said humans have to create an index and then Google came  along and said, no, you can do it algorithmically and now we're coming back full circle, which  says in effect, you can do it algorithmically with human signals.  It's not just an index.  You need signals.  These signals are incredibly valuable to search.  Well, it's the difference between the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would also point out if you think about it, a website linking to another website is  being done by a human, right?  If you get back to the PageRank.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think the PageRank did that because it was harder to game.  Sussing out human intent, right?  Right.  You want to suss human intent without signaling that you're sussing human intent.  In other words, harder to game it with PageRank.  It turns out not to be.  But the theory was, well, if we explicitly say, let's see what people do, then people  are going to game us like they game Dig.  But so what we should...  And this is with a risk with a plus one button.  Has Google maybe come around to the notion that A, we need this and B, we've got a way  to get around the gaming issue?  That's how we started this conversation.  You got to get around gaming.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yes, you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, back in the day, I have to remember that Yahoo had like a team of editors  who were like creating an index of the web.  It just didn't scale.  I don't know how many people they had.  Maybe a few dozen at most.  It didn't scale.  And now you have millions and millions of people and lots of algorithms cleaning out,  determining rank and authority and all that other stuff.  So we are coming back around, but we're dealing with millions and billions of people instead  of that team of editors speaking.  Open directory.  What was it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Open directory?  Yeah.  Open directory.  Oh, right.  DMOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DMOS.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Mozilla thing.  Yeah.  It's still around, I think.  I don't think anyone cares about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's from like Wikipedia now.  Really?  That's too bad.  I think that's what makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this now, okay, going back to Ryan's article in the Epicenter blog and Wired magazine,  he does make an interesting point, which is this might tie right back into the Nim Wars.  Remember the battle over using real names on Google+.  Dun dun dun.  Dun dun dun dun.  Maybe, he says, maybe this explains Google's hardline position in the Nim Wars.  Google's being adamant that users of its new social networking tool, Google+, use their  real names.  It's zeal to root out fakers and people using pseudonyms.  Perhaps what they're trying to do is also protect themselves against phony plus ones.  But I still don't think the plus one on a Google plus is the same as a plus one if somebody's  on your page in plus ones.  Hi, Cobble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, people are trying to make an equivalence between plus oneing something and clicking  on your own ads.  It's not like people using their real names won't click on a plus one button to promote  a blog post or a Google plus post that they've written, right?  I mean, I've done it.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get slammed constantly by people with real looking names on Google+.  People leave comments on my post all the time with links to their stuff.  These are clearly not people.  These are clearly just spammers who set up fake accounts.  Google isn't checking every account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The nice thing is it made it very easy to report.  If you don't like a comment, you can totally kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're doing that, but requiring real name doesn't guarantee...  Taking pseudonyms or names that don't look like regular American names doesn't ensure  that...  I don't think there's a connection there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't you guys already have Bradley Horowitz on to talk about this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this was when Google plus launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is though, we still call it a field trial.  I know we can make all the jokes about Google and beta and all that stuff.  It is still a field trial.  We're still figuring out what it all means to us.  They're working on it.  It sucks that it's not fixed to everyone's satisfaction already, but they're working  on it.  That's really hard to hear because people put a lot of effort into this whole Nimwar  thing.  For us, it's sort of an engineering problem that we have to get to.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google sees everything as an engineering problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's who we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chris, I've totally seen this Nimwar issue as an iterative thing.  Me too.  It's been amazing watching the groundswell of discussion and the effort behind getting  Google to change.  Google's been super responsive about iterating Google plus pretty quickly.  When you have Schmidt saying things like he said last week or this past week, like that  if you don't like it, then don't use it, it's hard to feel like it really is.  I know that he's not representative of everyone.  Bradley and Vic obviously have said that they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's worth pointing out what Eric said.  I know Eric okay.  I don't speak for Eric.  When he said, listen, if you don't like it, don't use it right, I think what he meant  to say was then right now at the end of it or yet.  It's realistic to say if we're not ready for you yet and we're not going to cater to your  needs, don't use it yet.  And then when we do, please consider coming back.  I don't think it's unreasonable to say that.  Eric can be very direct and you have to realize when Eric says something, it's not like when  I say something.  People are willing to listen to the end of my sentences, but Eric will say, well, I like  this part of the sentence and I'm going to use that or that's what I heard.  Oh my gosh, you already said.  So when he speaks, it's got a much higher sort of, it's higher risk in some ways.  And people parse it.  That's why you see a lot of people in his station and his position just not giving interviews,  not talking because in some ways there's no way to win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never interview CEOs because you can never get anything good out of them except I would  interview Eric Schmidt in a heartbeat.  That's what I was going to say.  I mean that's the truth.  Most CEOs are so carefully sculpted, crafted and cagey that they never say anything.  And in fact that's why we've loved Eric and we're going to miss him.  I think Larry is actually fairly good at controlling the message and staying out of trouble.  Unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For what, reporters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, hey, I love the juicy, you know, creepy quote every once in a while.  One, I'm sorry, four billion plus ones a day.  In July the plus one button went to two billion daily views.  Today it's on more than a million sites according to the official Google blog with four billion  daily views.  Now that means when you go to my page and you see that plus one button, that's the view.  You don't have to click it.  That doesn't say how many clicks there are.  So, and then this is sharing with your circles on Google Plus.  We saw that.  That's the drop down on the plus one button.  And then this is something else new called snippets.  Oh yeah, that's something.  You know, I think Google Plus has always done a good job with these little snippets.  They parse the page and publishers could take advantage of this by customizing the content  that Google Plus pulls in as a snippet.  I've always loved that.  You go to IMDB and you link to it.  You get just a nice little post and stuff like that.  So if you're a webmaster, I guess I should read this.  Is it XML?  What do we do here?  Yeah.  It must be some sort of tag.  Yes, markup.  It's rich annotations.  Let's all read it now on the air.  Just together.  We'll just read it together.  Yes.  Body item scope, item type equals schema.org slash article.  This is the article.  So here's a schema.  You load in a schema as those of you who've used XML know.  And that gives you some new things like item property name is the article name, item property  image.  This is great.  And then description.  You put this in every post.  Boy, somebody should make a WordPress plugin for this and you'll get nicely formatted snippets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The problem with this as a web publisher and for web publishers is that there are so many  thumbs up, like plus one, dig buttons that you can kind of put on a post.  It's really kind of indicative of what tribe you run in.  You know what I mean?  It's like the stickers you put on your laptop.  What brands do you identify with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What XML schema do you support?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like, if I put plus one but not Facebook like, then I'm a Google person and not a Facebook  person.  So it's hard.  Or you can just add all of them, which just looks kind of messy.  And I think it's great.  I think it's a good way to share signals.  But I guess it's that problem of also, this is a cool link.  On what of the six social networks on my blog do I want to share it on?  Which isn't a correct problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to do Twitter.  You got to do Facebook.  I think now you have to do Google+.  A dig you don't have to do anymore.  Aww.  Aww.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin's your pal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Kevin.  Well, first of all, Kevin left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, he's still on the board and I'm sure he gets money from them.  But I think Kevin, even Kevin went, hey, I give up.  I mean, I won't speak for Kevin, but I was just looking at an article on dead websites  and dig made the list because they're now this is from compete.  Their compete numbers are way, way down.  I don't think compete is very reliable.  It requires a toolbar, the Alexa toolbar, but still, it's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twitter, Facebook and plus do seem to be the three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter, Facebook plus.  What else?  LinkedIn maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe?  No.  Well, maybe for some kind of business article.  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  Yeah, that's it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adam?  Oh, he froze.  Yeah, he froze again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He was going to say, there's now a light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Publishers can use.  Okay.  Gina, I don't know if you know anything about that.  Facebook snippets?  I don't.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook snippets?  I don't.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I would just assume that they were scraping the page and then parsing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, like detecting the images and stuff.  Yeah, I'm not sure if you can set up snippets.  I'd be surprised actually if you could.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's where I wish they would just support the goddamn micro formats.  And then you have one standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Use XFN and just do it the way, and then everybody be a standard.  But no, everybody's got to have their own thing.  You know, I thought, Chris, I'm going to call you out on this one, that Google was...  Hurry on.  They were a big micro format supporter when Kevin Marks was...  That's what he was doing.  Isn't Chris Messina doing that?  Aren't they pushing XFN and things like that?  Shouldn't that be what Google Plus uses instead of its own crufty schema?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So honestly, I have no idea how to answer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I demand you to answer this question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, I think it's interesting.  It's like when we created sitemaps, there were other ways of sharing bulk URLs and page  information and we chose our own way then.  And I know we had good reasons for it, but it was seven years ago, so I can't remember  them.  So when I see this happening, I sort of see it as my job just to make it easy to publish  these things.  And I try not to weigh in on, oh, what about micro formats or what about this or that?  It makes me feel like I'm fighting some RSS versus Atom sort of fight.  Yeah, yeah, but I also support...  It's worth pointing out, I support multiple open standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what XMoc said in our chat room.  Open standards are great.  That's why there's so many of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why there's so many of them.  And I don't see it as my job to decide politically which ones the company backs and which products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you mentioned a really good one.  Life's too short, man.  You mentioned a good one, which is RSS, 1, 2, and Atom, which are all three open standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And somewhere Dave Weiner is sweating now, you know, because it's like someone mentioned  them both in the 70s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All an open standard needs is a really, really big product behind it.  So Google+, getting behind a particular standard would be huge.  Facebook getting behind a particular standard would be huge.  I think that we're still in the space of deciding what the data is.  And I don't know, maybe Chris, maybe you can disagree.  I'm working on ThinkUp, like getting ThinkUp's data model to be able to accommodate data  from all these different places, Twitter, Facebook, eventually Google+, hopefully.  And I think now we're really getting this place where it's like it's a link, it's an  image, it's a description, and there's a caption.  And those are the fields.  And I think we're really kind of getting to that.  And hopefully I would love to see both, all of the products that publish that kind of  data just use a particular standard, just pick a standard or pick a couple of standards  and use them versus coming up with their own markup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I guess the problem with XF is...  I think we picked a couple.  XFN doesn't really give you what you want, which is link, title, description, you know,  in a nicely formatted way.  So maybe there, I don't know, there must be a micro format that does that.  But you know, they say there's a country song that says tequila makes her clothes fall off.  Apparently tequila makes Apple employees lose iPhones.  Did you see this?  Your iPhone has been lost at a Mission District tequila bar, Cava 22.  According to CNET, a day after the phone was lost at the tequila lounge, it also serves  lime-marinated shrimp ceviche, Apple representatives contacted San Francisco police saying the  device was priceless.  It sounds like a Visa commercial.  And the company was desperate to secure its safe return.  So somewhere there's floating around an iPhone 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Resisting Gizmodo joke.  Yeah, there's something in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't think, I think Gizmodo, even though they did get off because, you know, they were  protected by, you know, press, you know, free press laws, I think that they would probably  think twice before they'd say anything again, right?  Apple tracked the phone to a home in San Francisco's Bernal Heights neighborhood.  San Francisco police and Apple investigators reportedly spoke to a man in his 20s about  the device, but he said, I don't know, man.  After a search, they found nothing.  There's no word if Apple got the phone back.  Apple did not file a police report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that story.  I just, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People sometimes ask me here at Google, hey, why aren't you running the latest tip of tree  version of Android on your phone?  And I'm like, are you kidding?  You know, I like my job.  It's like, I want to get liquored up.  It's just, I travel a lot, right?  It's like I've lost things while traveling.  What phone do you use right now?  Oh, I've got the Nexus S on T-Mobile.  So you know, and it's running, you know, standard, not honeycomb, gingerbread, gingerbread, two,  three, four.  I'd have to check.  It's lovely.  I mean, it's really nice.  So I like it.  It ain't ice cream sandwich.  I can tell you that right now.  I don't want people like finding me a conference saying, hey, mind if I use your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you like, have you played with ice cream sandwich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't be able to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you like it?  See, it's like, I want Schmidt.  Bring me Schmidt.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really about identity, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get Chris to say something embarrassing and revealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually don't want him to because I'm sure that the consumer will find ice cream sandwich  to be lovely.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And tasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tasty confection.  So Eileen Rivera, who hosts are all about Android show and happens to produce this show  as well, of course, has to have the latest Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It won't be for long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She spent some money on this.  How much was this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Six hundred bucks?  Yeah.  Well, speaking of lost phones, I lost my Nexus S, so I had to pay full price for a phone  anyways.  And then I've been salivating over the Samsung Galaxy S2 for a long time.  And I went ahead and just ponied up and bought the unlocked phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the European version that you put the T-Mobile Sim in.  I have to say this is gorgeous.  This is a super AMOLED screen.  Is this one 4.3 inches?  Yeah, this one's 4.3.  Oh, there it goes.  It focuses automatically.  And then now we were starting to hear the first official versions of the Galaxy 2S.  T-Mobile will be selling it.  Sprint will be selling it.  And AT&T will be selling it.  Each has their own names.  The best one is what is it?  The Sprint Epic 4G 3D X-Ray phone.  It's the Epic 4G.  But what's interesting is AT&T is going to stick with this form factor.  In fact, this looks very much like the square AT&T version of the phone.  But Samsung is going to make a slightly different one for Sprint and T-Mobile that will have  a 4.5 inch screen.  Just point 2 inches thicker or wider, longer, heftier.  I want the big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if they're going to start remaking pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A Scoshmore room.  That's the slogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like cargo pants will come back.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you've got some sort of fancy desktop on.  What is the screen manager?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is GoLaunchRx.  GoLaunchRx.  Yeah, it's free.  It's my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that.  But I have to say it drives me nuts.  So here's the HTC Sensation, which is also a T-Mobile gingerbread phone.  Same size.  Same pretty.  I like it's a little more pretty.  It's got a little more chrome on it.  But the gosh, diggity dang buttons.  This one's got some, they're back to the scroller, which is kind of nice.  And then it's got the menu button here and the back button there.  And I guess the scroller becomes the home button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's not what it's going to look like.  The phones, there's no buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no buttons.  No buttons at all.  And then this one, they've reordered the buttons.  It's home, menu, back, search.  Where's the search button on this thing?  There is none?  There's no dedicated search button.  See that one I use all the time because I press and hold it and I talk to myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the home button.  If you press and hold it?  You double click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Double click, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was double clicking and it's not coming up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There it is.  Okay, so that did work.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if this is getting a little too off topic, but...  I don't see how it could be any more off topic than I am.  These buttons across the bottom row.  So I've got an atrix here.  And yeah, and it's got the four across the bottom.  From motorugal.  Yeah.  I hate these buttons so much.  And I would kill for something with just one solid or a couple solid hardware buttons.  I agree.  Back to the buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now they're all going to be soft, right?  They're not even going to be like the ones kind of at the bottom of the screen that light  up or they're going to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would prefer that they're soft to the ones there at the bottom of the screen light up  because those buttons are just wasting space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  So they'll be on this...  I think that's what Ice Cream Sandwich does is it'll...  It does what the tablets have done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it does on the tablets.  And I actually, I prefer that quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're saying you'd like physical buttons even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if there's going to be for things that you want in every...  Across applications.  Like search isn't a bad button, but at the same time, if everything doesn't have search,  I don't see the point in having it permanently on the screen and not working.  Unless it's going to be like it'll be a universal search if there's no app specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of making me long for an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it makes me long for.  And I don't want an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want an iPhone either, but I hate to admit it.  But the problem is that it's inconsistent and crazy.  Now, I thought MG Siegler wrote a very interesting article that was very...  It was flame bait that said basically business would be crazy.  I think I clipped the speakers there.  Crazy to use an Android phone.  Any thoughts on that one?  Did you read that article?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't see that one.  It was on TechCrunch.  It was on TechCrunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find it because his position was that security, fragmentation, you don't  know what you're going to get.  It's too easy to get apps from third parties to uncheck that.  And that business just can't afford to let this Trojan horse of a phone into the enterprise.  This is just ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just shows people don't do the research.  I mean, so we have this really cool device policy app that we're trying out now that  does amazing things around locking down and having to be, frankly, corporate IT shop control  over your phone.  This is just not rocket science.  And really what MG is saying is, okay, you can choose to abdicate your security to a  company in Cupertino or you can do it yourself in your company.  It's sort of one of these fundamental questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying that the controls are there for an enterprise, for an IT department to  lock the sucker down.  That's right.  Well, or you could just say let Apple do it because Apple doesn't really have the enterprise  controls.  By the way, Microsoft also has the former.  Microsoft's always given you policy.  Yeah.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if you really want to talk about it, it's really going to be rimmed.  It's blackberry.  And then you'll talk about iPhone like 16 years later.  And then you'll talk about Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know why iPhone is really in the enterprise?  Because more and more enterprises are letting their employees choose.  And employees choose iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also seem to choose Android an awful lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Five hundred fifty thousand activations a day.  I guess you're right.  You know, I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If the company is going to pay for a brand new iPhone, you know, right.  Well, you know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the company doesn't choose the iPhone.  That's the point.  I think the company probably would choose Blackberry if the and that's what they have  historically done.  They've chosen Blackberry because you've got Blackberry Enterprise Server.  You've got encryption.  You've got the security in most cases.  You've got the policy ability to set policy from the IT department.  All of the things that a corporate buyer wants on Blackberry.  And you're saying Chris, the boner, that Android will do all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so if you've looked into how Blackberry's Enterprise Server stuff works, it's incredibly  detailed and it's very, very powerful.  Right.  Yeah.  The problem is the users kind of don't want the phone.  Right.  Right.  So Android is sort of this happy medium really between phones that people will like and want  to have and something that can be moderately well managed by the enterprise.  Right.  Right.  So, you know, sure, people love their iPhones.  Absolutely.  But you can't manage them.  Right.  But you can manage the hell out of a Blackberry, but people don't want them.  So what are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it seems like it's a good middle ground.  Yeah.  To do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it is.  And I personally actually really dislike using iPhones.  But you know, I'm obviously working for Google and we use a lot of Google services and just  going from that back to an iPhone, you know, because we have an iPad at the house and it's  the same stuff.  I just feel like it's totally nerfed.  You know, I just don't have time for that anymore.  I have too many things I need to get done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the flexibility on Android.  That's really for me what it all comes down to.  But it's that exact flexibility that MG is saying is a security risk.  But you're saying, for instance, I'll give you an example.  So you're saying the policy editor or whatever, what is the tool that Android offers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's device policy.  I think it's on the market.  But without the backend stuff running, it's no good for you.  The device policy stuff, for instance, on my phone says you have to run X version of  the operating system on X phones.  You have to you can't install things from unknown sources if that's been ticked for  your user account, things like that.  That's key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's one that that's one that MG pointed to specifically the fact that third  party apps are allowed, which is I think is a little specious because that presumes that  the app marketplace that Apple offers is absolutely secure and safe.  And it's clear that there are so many apps being released that there's no way Apple can  really truly vet all those apps to make sure they are secure.  And in fact, some malicious apps have leaked into the iTunes app store, not as many as  on Android.  We've seen quite a few more on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know that I agree with that.  I think the measure of both stores is how fast they act when they find a bad actor.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, some people in chat are saying it was Paul Therotte who wrote that article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Right.  It wasn't MG Siegler.  I take it back.  It was Paul, our very own Paul Therotte.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Windows Weekly guy.  I'm so sorry.  You're absolutely right.  It's just the kind of article MG would have written.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, MG did not say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paul Therotte did.  And he's and it really got a lot of attention where he said, you'd be crazy, crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry.  for that or discredit, depending on your point of view for that for that article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's promoting Windows Phone, obviously, as a safer alternative.  No one wants a Windows Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, come on.  I mean, maybe that'll change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That might change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That might change because the operating system is actually pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, so I know someone who recently lost her work phone and had the choice to buy a  new work phone.  Right.  And then Android 2, 2 and up.  Right.  The IT department supported like Android 2, 2 and up.  And one of the part of the problem was like, how do I know which phones like which phones  run which version of Android?  And if this one ships with the lower version, can I upgrade it?  And there was like a lot of questions and confusion about that.  And so like the iPhone seemed like the iPhone is just such a strong brand, I think.  And, you know, so that's why I said, hey, if the company is going to pay for an iPhone,  like, you know, I can see people buying it or going with it just because it's such a  strong brand.  And if the company is paying for it, why not?  You definitely want an Android device over a BlackBerry or Windows phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Paul says Android, thinking of IT, just of IT, Android is a disaster waiting to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's crazy.  That's a little specious.  I don't do corporate IT and I don't work for Google, but that seems a little, a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the rebuttal is.  I've worked in corporate IT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two kinds of phones they hate.  One's they can't even control.  Right.  And ones that are so complicated, they can't maintain them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can't figure the hand.  And that's part of his point is that the fragmentation of UI and OS is.  But that can be restricted, so it's not a big deal.  Yeah, if you just say you have to use this version, you can't turn on third party apps,  you can only use certain apps, you can only do that.  I think as long as, I haven't analyzed the security policy, but as long as this security  policy gives you all those features, then I think that you're right.  I think that this would.  Do we know what the enterprise uptake is on Android devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I suppose if I were RIM, I'd be more worried than anybody about the whole thing.  Alright, we're going to take a break.  We are talking, we have a great cast here.  Now Adam, I want to get you in more, but I have a feeling we're having trouble with the  Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.  I'm not sure what's going on.  Don't worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know what you should do is just write an article on Lifehacker about how to get  Skype working better.  Is that a joke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because we did one today.  I know you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gee, wouldn't that be a great article?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's always worked fine.  It's working poorly now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's us.  I'm totally visiting Lifehacker right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's totally us.  Let me just tell you, we screw up more Skype than anybody else.  Lifehacker is a great site.  Adam is the editor in chief of the site that Gina started.  Gina started, but he's just got great stuff in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great stuff in it.  Lifehacker.com.  Thank you for being there, Adam.  Chris DeBona, is it open programs manager?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's open source and public sector programs manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Open source and public sector program manager for the goog.  It doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there's something open source at Google, I'm kind of the guy who deals with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and you're good at it.  I'd like to think so.  He's a great guy and he's straightforward.  If I can't get Eric Schmidt on the show, you're the next best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I really think that having Bradley on again might be a better idea.  I love Bradley and I love him.  You should have on Natalie Villalobos.  She's sort of the community manager for Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd love to.  And I saw that you just hired Louis, which is Louis Gray for Plus.  That's right.  I love Louis and that's great, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I only kind of know him a little bit through online stuff.  He's a really great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've never met him.  I don't think.  Isn't it funny how you start to feel like if you really interact with these people in social media,  like I know you.  I've known you for years, Louis.  I know about his kids, when his kids were born.  I've seen the baby pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much more can you know somebody?  He shares a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina Trapani is also here from SmarterWear.org.  Great conversation today.  It is always fun when we have these great people on.  But briefly, I want to mention Netflix.com.  Dirty Dancing.  I couldn't believe they're remaking Footloose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to remake Dirty Dancing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're remaking Dirty Dancing.  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're remaking War Games.  They're remaking a ton of movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they remade Fright Night.  I kind of want to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My suggestion, however, is to go to Netflix.com and watch the originals before you burn your eyes  with these bad remakes.  Because it will spoil it forever.  If you haven't seen Dirty Dancing, it will spoil it forever if you see the remake.  If you haven't seen Footloose, you want to see the original.  You want to see the movie that started it all.  You know, there's some great things here, too.  They're doing the Millennium Saga.  You know, the girl who played with fire.  The Hollywood versions will be out.  But you know, they've got the original Scandinavian versions on here.  They're dark.  I've got to warn you, they're really dark.  But they're also really true to the novels and just great.  The novels were dark.  Great TV shows.  Kids stuff, too.  Look, Toy Story 3, The Princess and the Frog.  I mean, if you've got an iPad and you've got Netflix streaming,  you don't have to ever talk to your kid again.  It's just incredible.  Do you play this on your Mac, your PC, your iPad, your iPhone?  24 different Android devices now.  Thank God.  On the tablets as well.  And of course, most TVs, all the Blu-ray players,  Xbox 360, PS3, Nintendo Wii, they all can play that on Netflix.  I use Roku.  That's my personal favorite Roku box.  Google TV does it.  Pretty much anything you connect to your TV is going to do it.  So here's the deal.  I know you're already a Netflix member.  I know I'm preaching to the choir.  If for some reason you've missed out, try the streaming.  $7.99 a month.  Forget the disc.  Just go with the streaming.  Netflix is going to be mad at me.  But I just love the streaming because emotional dramas about marriage.  I love just the recommendations they give me.  What's the deal with that?  The Burning Bed and The Lion and Winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've been watching some emotional dramas about marriage.  Is that what happened?  I think that's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, recently watched The Family Guy.  Oh, that is an emotional drama about marriage.  Of course.  No wonder they came up with The Burning Bed.  Dark movies based on a book.  Yes.  So these recommendations come from what you've been watching, I guess.  I don't know.  Mind-bending cult movies.  Anyway, the recommendations are great, but there's tens of thousands of movies and TV shows.  And if you're not a member, go to Netflix.com slash Twitter.  And you can try it free for 30 days.  And if you already are, do me a favor.  Just go throw up and go to your window.  Throw up in your window and shout,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netflix.com slash Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just get somebody to do it for us.  Netflix.com slash Twitter would make me happy.  Goofy workplace TV shows.  They must know I work at Twitter.  That's not from what I've watched.  That's they know where I work.  They've gotten so specific with their categories.  Isn't it hysterical?  It's so funny.  More like zero.  Quirky TV comedies featuring a strong female lead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Classic.  Movies where dogs have switched places with humans.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Left-handed Portuguese comedies.  Inspiring Fight the System documentaries.  I love this.  I love this.  And you know, the truth is I often don't go beyond the recommendations because they because it usually is good stuff.  It usually is good stuff.  Apparently, I've been watching a lot of movies about gay love.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice.

Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody said, I think it was Eileen said, you're pretty brave showing your Netflix recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what that was.  That's what mine looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't mind.  You can know what I watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gay love movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I watched.  I watched one.  I love so much.  I can't remember what it was.  And I think that's probably why.  Well, not zero philia.  I don't I didn't watch that.  But it was so good.  But anyway, some of these are getting a little.  Wow.  Man.  OK.

Transcript:  Let's go back to Batman.  Anyway.  Wait a minute.  Robin, Batman.  OK.  Maybe that's why they got this whole thing going here.  I don't know.  Netflix.com slash twit.  Please enjoy.  Netflix knows what you want.  I don't know how they know.  Moving along.  Let's there must be more.  There must be more in the twig.  Run down.  You were saying, you know, just last week after we finished the show, Steve Jobs resignation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  announcement came out.  That was after this show.  Yeah, it was right after.  We should talk about it.  I feel I feel bad because we've talked about it on every show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the last show to get it.  But what are your thoughts?  Well, you know, I thought it was interesting what you were saying earlier about how you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  get to know people online and social media like you feel like you know people on the  social media like you feel like you know them even though you haven't met them.  And after Steve Jobs resignation announcement, Vic Gondotra, whose birth name is Vivek, just  an aside, he posted on Google Plus this story about working with Steve.  Did you see this?  The icon ambulance story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so good.  In fact, I'm going to read it out loud in a dramatic reading.  OK, because it really is a great story.  And you're exactly right, Gina.  This this might have been this of all of the hagiography and the and the eulogizing that  everybody did and everybody did about Steve Jobs.  This was the one that said more about who Steve was than anything.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And when we have heard this from Vivek from Vic, if if like if Google Plus didn't exist,  it's a perfect place for him to share it.  Right.  Exactly.  It's a perfect place.  Humanize folks who, you know, maybe wouldn't have a place.  So go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But this way we all saw it.  One Sunday morning, I was attending religious services when my cell phone vibrated as discreetly  as possible.  I checked the phone, noticed my phone said caller ID unknown.  I chose to ignore it.  Later I checked my messages.  The message was from Steve Jobs.  It said, Vic, can you call me at home?  I have something urgent to discuss.  Before I even reached my car, I called Steve Jobs back.  This was when Vic was responsible for mobile applications at Google.  He said, in that role, I had regular dealings with Steve.  It was one of the perks of the job.  Hey, Steve, this is Vic.  I was in religious services.  Steve laughed.  I said, I'm sorry, Vic, unless the caller ID said, God, you should never pick up during  services.  I laughed nervously.  After all, it was customary for Steve to call during the week upset about something.  But it was unusual for him to call me on Sunday and ask me to call his home.  I wondered what was so important.  So Vic, says Steve, we have an urgent issue, one that I need addressed right away.  I've already assigned someone from my team to help you.  And I hope you can fix this tomorrow.  When looking at the Google logo on the iPhone and I'm not happy with the icon, the second  O in Google doesn't have the right yellow gradient.  It's just wrong.  And I'm going to have Greg fix it tomorrow.  Is that OK with you?  Of course this was OK with me.  He gets an email from Steve with the subject icon ambulance.  So there's a sense of humor coming through from Steve that you don't normally get, frankly,  in a lot of anecdotes about Steve Jobs.  The email directed me to work to fix the icon.  I think it's just great.  He says, in the end, when I think about leadership, passion, and attention to detail, I think  back to the call I received from Steve Jobs on a Sunday morning in January.  It was a lesson I'll never forget.  CEOs should care about details, even shades of yellow, on a Sunday.  To one of the greatest leaders I've ever met, my prayers and hopes are with you, Steve.  Vic, isn't that great?  You're absolutely right, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Best story.  Best story out of everything that got good.  It said it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His attention to detail, his kind of obsessive attention to detail, and yet the sense of  humor and playfulness.  It was great.  Really great.  Yep.  New feature in Google+, speaking of which you can now ignore people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is kind of a weird feature.  So it sounds like you can, it's not that you can ignore people who you've circled.  You can ignore people who have circled you.  So that incoming stream, so if someone has circled you and you see them in your incoming  stream, if it's somebody who you've just decided, I'm not going to circle this person back,  you can ignore them and they won't show up in your people who have circled you list or  your incoming stream.  So it's actually, it's not like following someone and then muting them.  It's basically saying, don't show me this person again.  I'm definitely not going to circle them, so get them out of my way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you've had Block, which was kind of more draconian, I mean that just like kills this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  person.  Yeah, Block is like, don't ever show me this person ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So it makes them not show up in comments too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, actually, no, you'll see their plus ones, you'll see their comments.  You won't see them in the incoming stream or in the list of people who have circled you.  Oh, okay.  So that's one of the cool things about Google Plus is like it kind of shows you people who  have circled you that maybe these are people that you might want to circle in a kind of way.  So you can say, I'm not going to circle this person.  I don't want to see this person in my incoming list.  Just show me other people who have circled me.  So this is an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Chris Brogan, actually who I followed for a long time, but he just, there was so much  content, I actually uncircled him, which is not the same as blocking.  I still see comments and pluses and stuff.  But now I could say ignore him.  Right.  And then I won't see his.  And then you won't see him in incoming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In incoming anymore.  And you won't see him in your list of people who have circled.  So it's kind of a weird but subtle way of saying here you can constantly browse the new people  who have circled you.  And if you just don't want to see somebody ever again.  Oh, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I actually think this is much needed because while I often check incoming to look at who  I'm not following that I should be, some of these people are posting like kind of stuff  I don't want to see at all.  Like it burns my eyes.  So those people I can say, don't put them in there anymore.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So instead of blocking them, which is kind of harsh, ignore just says, hey, you know,  get them out of my incoming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's specifically for incoming, not for the rest of the.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you'll see their comments on your, if you don't want to see people's comments or  pluses, then block them.  But if you just don't want to see them in incoming, then you can ignore them.  So it's a less harsh block.  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need an animated GIF filter.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love the animated GIF.  I have to admit.  I honestly love that involved kittens.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is, this is something that is kind of controversial in Google Plus because it's  something that MySpace had.  Facebook does not.  Twitter does not.  And it was clearly Chris DeBonac, and you shed light on this, was there internal debate  over the animated GIF?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you look at, I think it was, it was Buzz or one of the other services where you  could post pictures.  Right.  The first thing that me and a couple other people do are put up a couple of animated  GIFs to see if they work.  Right.  And figure out what the parameters are under which we can share animated GIFs.  You know, we just don't use them enough internally for them to be too annoying during dog  fooding.  So I think that when it launched.  You didn't count on Jenny Jardin.  I think animated GIFs are too much fun to not support, you know?  No, I agree.  Is that one of the people going, oh no, you know, walking back and forth like this?  Oh no.  Oh no.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no.  I haven't seen that one yet.  I probably do unfollow people who use it too often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's all about moderation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  A lot of celebrities starting to appear now on Google+.  It's my celeb circle is getting quite, quite full.  There's Avril Lavigne, Snoop Dogg.  We've got Britney Spears, very active on there.  Sammy Hagar, like him.  You can tell who.  You can't drive 55.  Yeah, you can't drive 55.  Madonna is in there.  Will Wheaton, I don't know.  Does he count?  He counts.  He counts.  There's a kitten picture.  There's a kitten picture on a skateboard.  What could possibly be real wrong?  Sometimes they're doing that with animated GIFs.  They're doing them so subtle that you don't know that it's an animated GIF and then something  weird happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like the raining one with the Doctor Who.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to filter like a not colon dot GIF search filter for my Google+.  Any search at all would be nice.  Well, so Chris, maybe you can confirm or deny this.  The theory, I was talking over theory with a friend of mine from who works at Qualcomm,  who's saying that the reason why Google Plus doesn't have search right now is because of  the privacy, because the visibility issue that like doing late binding of visibility  showing, you know, public posts as well as posts that you have permissions to see is  just too resource intensive or too difficult.  Is that anywhere in the ballpark, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that sounds fishy to you.  Even though it is kind of fishy that there's no post search.  This is a good example of how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think we need to find a search company to help.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a good example of how in a vacuum, weird ass rumors just appear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true.  No, it's so true.  I think they're great ones.  In fact, let's make one up.  No, the reason it's not done was because we had a deal with Coca-Cola to do searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're waiting for the brand search to get going.  Yeah, yeah, that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brands, brands, yes, business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is somebody, Dr. X is saying in the chat room, there's no search on Facebook.  I didn't even think about that, but you can't just...  Really?  You can search for people and I think just people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook isn't a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good point.  Do you know of a good search engine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you what I find interesting is that I haven't watched a lot of network television,  but I watched the VMA Awards and I just saw the season ending Glee, and shows now are  giving suggested hashtags all the time.  Like Glee, it says pound Glee in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the watermark, right, on the bottom corner.  And that just shows you how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've always said that hashtags are just specialized version of search.  They're saying this is some metadata that will tell you that this post has to do with Glee.  And you can click in on Twitter anyway.  You can click it and do a Glee search.  So to me, it's a specialized version of search and that's how important it is that shows  are actually now saying, well, there's a canonical search, use pound Glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, like here's the keyword.  It's like AOL keyword.  Right.  It is the AOL keyword.  It's exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think people do find comfort in keywords.  I know that sounds strange, but they've been saying type go Glee in AOL for 20 years.  It's all the same people too.  Right.  And yeah, so it's kind of interesting.  Go to this Yahoo sub page or something.  Right.  That's a good point.  People get used to it.  I didn't really think of that.  And every once in a while, it happens in flows.  They'll go and use Twitter or some link on Google or Yahoo or whatever.  And then they'll fade back over to...  You should go to sonymovies.com slash daredevil slash to slash The Awakening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, one thing I did notice is that the hashtags are always, I mean pound Glee, they're always  obvious.  Pound True Blood.  Like what else would you do?  Those are the obvious ones.  I guess if they had a non-obvious one, pound True Bees, then okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but then that just sounds like some weak marketing effort.  No, that's what they're called.  We're all calling ourselves True Bees now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Chris, that's what they're called.  Oh God, really?  Isn't it?  See, you can't make a...  Am I right?  Eileen hosts a show called Love at First Bite.  What is the name of your show?  It's called Bite Club.  Bite Club.  So she's an expert.  They're True Bees.  They're called True Bees.  I'm not making this up.  I couldn't make it up.  No, you couldn't.  You couldn't.  Hey, I'm excited about...  This sounds like I'm making it up.  I am excited about Samsung's chat on Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Samsung announced that they're going to do to compete with Facebook Messenger and  Apple's iMessager.  I mean, everybody's doing a Messenger.  And of course, there's about 20 group messaging applications that are across platform.  But the reason I thought the Samsung chat on was interesting, because it's going to  be completely cross platform, Windows Mobile, BlackBerry, Apple, Android, and PCs, desktops.  And I have yet to find a Messenger, except Facebook's Messenger, which I refuse to use,  that I can interact on the phone and then get to my desktop and interact there.  I just think that's really cool.  Plus, it's going to have animated GIFs.  Don't forget Bada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bada?  Bada?  Is it Bada?  What is Bada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that how you pronounce it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't even know.  Bada.  Bada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bada.  Samsung has another operating system that they use called Bada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's on Bada as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would have to be on Bada.  It is on Bada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has to be on Bada for me to use it.  You use Bada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I had never heard of it until I saw this article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No one uses Bada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bada.  I was just messing.  I think it's pronounced Bada.  It's straight Bada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Bada.  Like Bada.  Bada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung's been very, very nice to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the Samsung phones.  I would never really consider using a wireless company's software in any way.  It's almost always the first thing you remove from your phone.  Seriously.  I mean, really, isn't it the first thing you get off is the Motorola 18T?  Android saves us from that.  I know.  Seriously.  You know what saves me from that?  Cyanogen Mod.  Animation message.  Look, see that?  You can do that.  Wouldn't you like a messenger that does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you remember the beginning of Starship Troopers where the Casper Van Deen character  sends an animation to the girl he likes?  That's what they're trying to do.  We're trying to hasten the future.  Yes, hasten the fascist future of Starship Troopers.  Wow.  Would you like to know more?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at that.  Wouldn't you like to do that?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can stop showing this stupid video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you.  Someone in the chat room says, so is the Microsoft search app called Bada Bing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bada Bing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about tablets.  Touchpad, of course.  There's a great article, by the way, on the Wall Street Journal in which it says, if you  were going to kill a company, if you were given one year to kill a company, what would  you do?  And it's everything that HP has done over the last year.  I mean, everything.  HP's one-year plan.  This is a blog post by Al Lewis.  Let's see you were given a year to kill Hylia Packard.  Allow expenses to run out of control.  Try to blow through billions of dollars in cash reserves before the next global economic  slowdown.  And then finally, boast that you're going to attack Apple's iPad with your $499 touchpad,  then dump your touchpad in a $99 fire sale, then announce you're not going to offer it  anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then, and I have to add to this article, announce, well, maybe we'll make a few more.  They've announced they're going to make some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Buy a British company that does the same thing that SAP does for $10 billion.  Unbelievable.  So is the touch, this is the question actually I'd like to ask you.  Does the success of the $99 touchpad, Adam Pash, say that the touchpad wasn't a failure  technically, it was a pricing failure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, it could be, it didn't have to be the touchpad.  It could be any tablet that sold for $99 and people would have bought it.  So there is a price.  I mean, if you can go that low.  Yeah, I'm just saying the price doesn't have anything to do with the touchpad.  It just has to do with tablet prices.  If anyone could go that low, I think that they would be looking at a pretty good situation  in terms of getting, like they're an Android tablet or $99.  I think people would be pretty happy to buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because the very first thing a lot of people are trying to do is  put Android on the touchpad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a Cyanogen for touchpad that they said this week that they announced that  they've got sort of working on and running.  That's tempting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very positive review by Sasha Segan and PC Magazine online of the new Sony Tablet S.  Have you seen a prototype of this, Chris, floating around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't talk.  You know which one, if we're going to talk about a cool tablet, I really want to talk  about this one, I guess it's shipping in Japan, the Fujitsu one.  I haven't seen it.  The ruggedized one.  That's the one I want to talk about because that's the one I want.  I want a tablet I can spill crap on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to admit, looking at this Sony thing, I can't get excited about it.  I haven't been excited about Sony hardware in an awful long time.  It looks thick.  It doesn't look quite right.  This is a Fujitsu Android tablet that's only in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now.  I'm hoping they come to the United States.  It's also got 4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it bounce if you drop it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's anything like their rugged laptops, I'm sure it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the only ruggedized Android tablet on the street.  It's the arrows tab.  Waterproof, mil-spec.  I wonder if that's rubber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean sort of the second color.  The bezel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think it would bounce?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not literally, but I do like the idea of being able to just not worry about it.  I want to take it in the shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the shower tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seriously, you can keep reading and doing your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's it.  I want to mount it on the tile inside my shower, play a Twitch show.  There's a market for that.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's brilliant.  I know a lot of people who have mounted iPads in the dashboard of their car.  But yeah, shower tablet.  What a great idea.  You could put Samsung's chat on Messenger on it.  Sorry, I brought that up.  I'm really sorry I brought that up.  Gmail, I love this, is offering free calls for all US service members if they're calling  home no matter where they are in the world.  I think that's really, really cool.  You need a valid dot mil email address on your Google account.  And you of course have to have the Gmail voice plug in.  And that's really cool.  I think that's just a nice way to acknowledge people who are serving in the US military.  For all the troops overseas to call friends and family at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.  That's great.  Also offline Gmail.  Oh, what?  Which is kind of a big deal.  But kind of weirdly implemented.  So Google announces Gmail goes offline, but it's an offline Gmail Chrome app.  So you install the Chrome app and then when you do, it shows up in the new tab when you  open Chrome and you have to give it permission to grab your Gmail offline.  And then once you do that, Calendar and Docs can go offline as well.  So it's not quite the way Gears used to work.  I kind of expected that it was going to work inside Gmail itself, but you do have to install  this Chrome app and not forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if I just search for the...  I found a Gmail app in the Chrome Web Store.  That's it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's offline Google Mail.  Oh, it's called offline Google Mail.  Offline Google Mail, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course that's what I would have searched for.  Offline Google Mail.  And offline Calendar is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Offline Calendar is promised.  It's rolling out really soon.  Oh, this is cool.  And offline Calendar I definitely need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so offline Google Mail is a Gmail app to build.  That's cool.  And how cash is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, who's that?  Hi.  It's Chris Devona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so confused.  What just happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that Lewis Gray?  Oh, is this Leo Laporte?  Hey, congratulations on your new gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're a newgler.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you come running down to the conference room so that you could just say hi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For you, Leo, anything.  In terms of being a newgler, I'm trying to make the ramp up almost zero.  I don't have a whole lot of patience for trying to find a role.  So we're having a lot of fun.  This was a very interesting opportunity.  Obviously, I've been working with teams like Google and a number of other people in this  space for a long time.  Through all the interactions as a partner, blogger, the culture here is really strong.  They have real good integrity and that's something I didn't want to miss.  It's been a great opportunity to come in and have impact right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you going to be working with Natalie?  It sounds like your duties overlap a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Natalie and I work really well.  She's one of the many great community managers we have on Google+.  My role is more in the product marketing side.  What that means is helping really shape our vision, shape the way that the product is  communicated and helping to prove the differentiation of what we've developed here at Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like kind of a dream job.  I mean, you're going to be using Google+, anyway.  You might as well get paid to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's my opinion as well.  It's kind of like having your own radio show and having people show up.  Oh yeah, that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, hey, I'm not saying I didn't pick the best job for me, but I think it's just  great when people get to do exactly what they want.  Follow Louis Gray on Google+, and I'm sure we'll hear a lot more of you.  Congratulations.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I knew you see great people like Chris DeBona.  I've never had a position where I come in and like 50 of my best friends already work  there.  If you can imagine how cool that is.  So people who I've interacted with either as a power user, a blogger, a partner just  show up and they're here.  And so, you know, I hate to be feeling like Mr. Popular a little bit, but the lunch calendar  has been pretty full and it's been great to bounce ideas off and hear all the internal  stuff that they've wanted to tell me for so long that now they can tell me.  And it's free now.  Well, Google Plus has always been free.  No, the lunch.  Lunch at Google has always been free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Free for you.  That's awesome.  That's really great.  And so when did you start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I started last Monday and they have a quick ramp up newler process for us marketing people.  We don't have to take a lot of classes because they just assume a low bar of expectations.  You guys.  Yeah, you guys are not engineers.  So I was done like day two, they get into benefits and they're like, you're free.  And the rest of the engineers have to stay back and work.  That's the way it is around here.  They assume that if we know how to use a computer and access Wi Fi, that's all we really need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now my question is, do they make you hang this thing around your neck and wear a beanie  with a propeller or is that something you chose to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have a process of new orientation, which includes wearing the new beanie.  It's a rite of passage.  And I think tens of thousands of people before me have done it and there's no reason I should  be exempt.  So I was more than happy to do that.  I knew that the picture itself would get exposed through the many paparazzi we have on campus.  So I took control of it myself and put it out myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here it is Eileen on my computer.  This is Louis Gray in a beanie with a sign around his neck that says he's product marketing  manager.  Plus that's really good.  Degrees in university and fun.  Degrees in university.  Yep.  Yeah.  And fun fact about yourself.  Three kids, three and under.  Three and under.  I don't know if that's a fun fact, but it's certainly a fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some of the other people I came in with this year, you know, they're 2010 graduates, which  kind of reminds me how old I am.  So they go back to degrees and I have to explain to them back in the day, we used to have mass  communications and things called newspapers and they just kind of glaze over.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, congratulations.  It's really great to talk to you, Louis.  And it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Appreciate it.  It's nice.  I think they hired the right guy for the job, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, thank you.  There's so much work to do, Leo.  It's a great intersection of fantastic people and great technology, but also significant  work to be done.  You know, if this was a slam dunk, they wouldn't need someone like me and the many other people  like Natalie who do a great job.  Well, let's get you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anytime you want to announce a new product, let us know.  Yeah, you got a carte blanche anytime to join us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks Leo.  Let me hand you back to Chris.  He's got much better looking hair.  Yeah, I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got more of it.  Let's put it that way.  Hi guys.  Good job, Eileen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was fun.  Did Eileen do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, she, she, she, I didn't give her any warnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky.  A couple more Google stories.  Google has launched with the New York Times a YouTube channel to commemorate September  11th.  We're coming up on that 10 year anniversary and that's going to be of course a gigantic  story everywhere in the media and the YouTube has got the jump on this with a lot of, a  lot of, this is actually going to be a really interesting site, a lot of videos.  I wish they'd do this with this, you know, all modern historical events because what  a resource this would be to go back if you're a student, want to know more about 9-11 or,  you know, you just want to relive it.  Having all these videos online is incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the archive.org also has this archive of September 11th media coverage videos as  well.  I mean, I think we're going to see a lot of this with the 10 year anniversary.  But yeah, I spent, I lost a morning a couple weeks ago just, you know, looking through  some of this material.  It's amazing.  It feels like, you know, so long ago and yet it feels like, you know, so recently.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course you were there, you were in New York so this has particularly strong meaning  for you and I know Jeff was too.  We've talked about that before.  Yeah.  Understanding 9-11, a television news archive is on archive.org.  Similar, similar, you know, a little bit less, a little more text heavy but similar, similar  idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Less googly but some similar idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I have to think that if you think about 2001, this might be, you know, this  was kind of at the time when everything then was starting to be camera phones and people  were doing their own reporting.  This is the beginning of that.  So I think you'll see, we can see more and more archives of this kind, tweets.  I guess Twitter wasn't around yet at the time.  Facebook wasn't around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I was at Slashdot when this happened and I remember just how much we were working  on, well, mostly Robin the guy is working on keeping the site, you know, running and  useful for the people.  Right.  It was really an interesting time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For an event like this to happen again now, you can automate, you know, gathering this  data in ways that we couldn't back then.  I remember back then a friend of mine was one guy I knew carried a Canon ELF, one of  the first small cameras in his pocket.  He got all these amazing photos and I didn't have a camera on me and that's when I started  carrying camera.  Right.  But now, you know, these days you can gather that information and you can automate that  gathering, capturing so quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So get ready because this is just the beginning of, every event now will be hyper documented  and archived and that's what Archive.org, we should give them a big plug.  BrewsterCalesArchive.org is amazing because their goal is to save the internet on big  hard drives distributed around the world so that historians can go back and look at this  stuff and it's terabytes a day.  I don't know exactly how much they're saving but it's a ton of stuff and what's great  about Brewster and about this project is just ignoring copyrights right and left.  They say, we'll work it out later.  We're just going to save everything and we'll figure out how the archives work later.  I want to take a little break.  It looks like we lost Chris DeBono.  We're having all of everybody's dropping off bit by bit here.  Yeah, just call him back.  Actually, yeah, go ahead because I was just going to talk about new tech and that's where  you push a lot of buttons on your console but you're going to be busy right now.  Can you multitask and do both at the same time?  Our video switcher is about the most sophisticated thing you ever heard of.  It is a video truck in a box.  I used it since day one.  I did a lot of research when I first started doing live video.  I started with a webcam on a computer but when I realized I wanted multiple cameras  I said, I need a switcher and I looked at all different kinds of ways to do it and there  was nothing more affordable, more effective, more powerful than the TriCaster.  Since 2006 I've been using a TriCaster but man, this new one we're using, the 850 Extreme.  Unbelievable.  You see how it goes to black like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's incredible.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow!  The transitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't use half of the stuff it does including all of the virtual sets.  Just amazing.  Those are some of the fun transitions.  But really the fact that we have eight cameras that we can switch back and forth from, the  ability to record each of those individual cameras individually with ISOs, amazing.  Support for Apple AirPlay, we're able to actually take our iPads and play video back through  the TriCaster.  It's just incredible.  If you're looking for something with the state of the art capabilities that put even the  big networks to shame and by the way that's why a lot of big networks are starting to  look at TriCaster.  It's being used by everybody from the NBA.  Well, in fact I love it because we're in this panoply of people who use the new tech TriCaster.  But some big broadcasters as well.  This thing is incredible.  Highly recommend you take a look at the TriCaster and the new TriCaster 850.  MTV, NHL, VH1, Fox News, CNET, BBC, Mahalo, ESPN Radio, NBA Development League, Fox Sports,  CBS Radio, X Games, Sky News and oh yeah that little thing called Twitt.TV.  New tech dot com if you want to find out.  That scared me.  You scared me.  Well apparently Google has a massive internet outage and we're not able to get anybody back.  I don't know what's going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what Chris said.  He said the network just stalled.  So keep trying to call him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happened yesterday on our Twitt photo, we were talking to a photographer.  Apparently the landlord had forgotten to pay the power bill and in the middle of the interview  is electricity.  Not just the internet, his electricity goes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this is a breaking story.  Google down.  The internet network is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  James Gosling leaving Google for a startup.  He was only there a few months.  Gosling, the guy who created Java, wasn't real happy when Sun got purchased by Oracle,  left almost immediately and went to Google.  Now he's moved on to, in March, he's moved on to a company that he worked with at Google,  a company called Liquid Robotics which has to be about the coolest company I've ever  heard of.  He's the chief software architect there.  They're using autonomous vehicles to map the ocean.  A fleet of autonomous submarines that then have, yes, with a variety of onboard sensors  and they upload that data to the cloud.  Whoops, I guess there's nothing at that link.  Maybe our internet went down too.  Do you think it was us?  It seems like everybody's connection is going.  I'm working.  Yeah, thank you for the logic.  A little dose of logic never hurt.  Yeah, everybody else is here.  So it can't be us.  Liquid Robotics makes the wave glider.  I think that's a cool job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This sounds like a really cool job.  I can see going from the giant that is Google to want to go to a small startup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said how happy he was at Google, but boy, when something like this comes along.  I've got the image here, Eileen, of the wave glider, an unmanned maritime vehicle that  looks like a solar power.  So it's not a submarine.  It covers the surface.  Wave gliders provide a persistent ocean presence for commercial, scientific, and defense users.  And then they have a video on when sharks attack robots that you might want to check  out.  Shark week's over, but not the sharks.  The sharks continue on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I doubled up Adam just so that hopefully the connection will be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, two Adams.  Look at that.  As we wait for Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we're done with Chris.  We don't need him anymore.  Adam, have you seen the blogger redesign?  I was talking about those sites that have gone away like MySpace and Dig, sites that  are dying.  By the way, they mentioned Gawker.com.  I won't say anything more.  Not Lifehacker, but just the Gawker site itself.  That was the Fox News thing?  Fox News, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I guess says something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I couldn't actually disagree with the list.  One of the sites they said was disappearing was Blogger in terms of dropping usage.  But they also mentioned that Typad and other blogging platforms had seen dramatically dropped  usage as well.  I think that's probably true as more and more of us use Google Plus and Twitter and stuff  to do our blogging.  Well, and Tumblr, right?  Tumblr too, right.  However, Google has redesigned and relaunched Blogger with a brand new design that essentially  they say they've rewritten the entire application from scratch, which I guess would make it  a kind of a more of an HTML5 kind of a thing.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think that everyone can see it, right?  It's a draft.blogger.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see.  Here I'm going to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Draft.  I think that's their kind of beta test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not Bluger, Blogger.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't want to know what I would get if I did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see.  Is this it?  This looks different.  Yeah, that is it.  This looks different.  Wow.  And Automatic Span.  Let's look at my Wave blog.  I haven't seen that in a while.  Page views are up today.  Somebody visited it.  It's been zero.  Now I have two page views today alone.  That's incredible.  So this is the management, right?  This is not the blog look.  But it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool.  Yeah.  And the whole redesign is very much in line with the Gmail, Docs, Gcal, Google classification  of the Google sites.  It looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think it's Larry Page involved there?  Why all of a sudden is Google redesigning everything?  I don't know.  I'm glad they are.  Or do you think this was something that was in place before and then just getting around  to it is just coincidental?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or did they just design GWT and just apply it to everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  GWT.  Just change GWT and everything else applies.  Exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you look at the old blogger interface though, it's a huge, huge difference and a huge improvement  necessarily.  But it looks very old webby at this point.  And the new one, it's nice.  It's clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The blogger really did start to, was starting to look pretty antiquated.  Huh?  Yeah, it's about time.  And there goes, no, Adam's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm trying to fix his.  I'm here.  Because he's very pixelated.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it's just a little dirty.  There's a little smudge on his face.  He's becoming a monster.  But Gina, you're rock solid.  You're rock solid.  Love that.  Always reliable.  So is Facebook getting out of check-ins?  Because I mean, Facebook Places, which was launched with such fanfare a year ago, everybody  said that's it.  Foursquare's history.  I said that.  Goodbye, Foursquare.  Facebook's getting the check-in.  Now it's all over.  Now apparently they've kind of eliminated check-ins from Facebook.  Foursquare wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they just didn't get the usage.  So does that mean that most people don't want to check in?  That's what it really means.  Or does it mean that Foursquare's just really good at the check-in game?  Foursquare's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's one of my...  I check in all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it.  I love it.  But I know a lot of people who are not even close to even wanting to install it kind of  thing.  It really took me...  It's probably a niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is a niche thing.  And Foursquare is really good at it.  They're super good at it.  The gaming mechanics are really great.  They own the niche.  They own it.  Yeah.  And I think they were just focused on that one geo thing.  Facebook has so many other things going on.  I think they wanted to see what the uptake is.  I think that that was Facebook going, hey, let's see.  Do people want to check in or not?  They must not have seen the usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And some, like MG Siegler, say this isn't an abandonment of places.  They just put it everywhere.  They don't have a dedicated check-in anymore.  Just every time you post a status, you could say, and I'm here.  That's kind of like Google+.  It's a check-in and latitude and Google+.  Maybe that's the way to do it because I think you're right.  I think there's not going to be that many people like you and me who want to play the  game.  I want to be the mayor and all that.  Hey, Chris DeBona's back.  Sorry about that.  No, it's good to have you back.  So no truth to those rumors that there was a massive Internet outage at the Googleplex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There might be.  I switched.  I have patience levels that expire.  So I try Google Guest and then I go over to my tethered off of 4G thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're on 4G now?  Yes.  Well, it looks good.  Yeah, it looks good.  Looks great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Off your phone?  Actually off my tablet.  Oh, your tablet.  Wow.  Very cool.  Wait a minute.  Which tablet is that?  I can't imagine which one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there an Android tablet with 3G, 4G?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I must be using only 3G's then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the rumor mill is going crazy.  We know nothing.  I know nothing.  We know nothing.  Facebook according, possibly anyway, according to CNBC will be launching a music service  September 22nd.  Wow.  They'll be doing it with three partners, Spotify, RDO and Mog.  That actually isn't like you're launching a music service, which means you're building  those in to Facebook, right?  It's like the Skype deal.  They're calling it Facebook vibes, according to Jeff Rose, who found the string in a download  link.  That's a good way to do it.  Be interesting to have a Facebook's.  That would certainly be a compelling offering since so many people live in Facebook.  It just makes it more sticky.  You never have to leave Facebook.  Crickets.  My son has learned how to do a cricket sound and I thought, God, you got to teach me how  to do that.  It'd be so useful on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like with his mouth?  Yeah.  You got to get a recording of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really good.  It sounds like crickets.  Yeah, that's all I need.  I'm trying to figure out how to do it.  Can you write a life hacker article, Adam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adam's a music guy.  Come on.  Come on.  Cricket sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't read it.  It has something to do with it.  It involves whistling and spit.  That's all I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How does my cricket sound like a quail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a wookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's attempting to get us back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God, it's so late.  I didn't realize it was so late.  Thank you.  Let us, I just was having too much fun because I have such a great cast with me, Adam Pash,  Chris DeBona and Gina Trapani who will now give us her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, you can speed up your web connection using OpenDNS or GoogleDNS.  And it works.  I tried it.  Did you try it?  And you felt a difference?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's exciting.  Could be completely psychological, but.  Okay, could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me see.  I want to make sure that I get this right.  Google Public DNS and OpenDNS are partnering with CDNs to gather, they actually take location  information from your IP address and serve you content from servers which are closer  to you.  That's why web pages seem faster.  Right.  And yeah, so all you have to do is, you don't have to use Google Public DNS.  You can use OpenDNS as well.  And not all CDNs are in on the deal, but a few major ones are.  So that just started yesterday.  That's awesome.  So switch your DNS.  If you're using your ISP's DNS, switch to OpenDNS or GoogleDNS and you should see some  speed ups, especially around YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been using OpenDNS and maybe it's completely psychological because there's definitely a  placebo effect with these kinds of announcements, but I really noticed the difference yesterday.  It was like, wow, at home I use OpenDNS.  Very cool.  Adam Pash is going to fill in for Jeff Jarvis's number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Adam?  Yes.  So this week's number is 8,868, which is the number of tweets per second that were spawned  by Beyonce's pregnancy announcement that beat the former tweets per second leader, which  was, I believe, last month, the Women's World Cup final between the US and Japan.  So 8,868 tweets per second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's more of a measure of the growth of Twitter than anything else because, you  know, Ben Laden's death was only 5,000.  It's just how much bigger Twitter is all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think technically it's a measure of the growth of Beyonce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was also, it was the MTV audience, you know, because this happened during the days.  And the celebrity, the Hollywood tie-in at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's Beyonce.  And it's Beyonce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This number made me sad because the White House only got like, I don't know, at the  time I thought it was a lot.  It was several thousand.  It's almost 8,600 tweets a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not just total, it's a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's amazing throughput.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would normally do a tool of the week here, but I think since  Chris DeBonis here, I'm going to spring this one on you, Chris.  But something that you use, a Google or Android tool that you use and you just think is great  and you wish more people knew about it.  Is there anything out there like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I've been really, really, really enjoying Google Music.  I installed a Bluetooth transceiver in my car, which is a little older, so it doesn't  have one.  Yep.  And it's just, it's fantastic.  I have to say, I agree with you.  I've been having a great time.  I've got some invites left, not very many, but just text me or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any knowledge about when that might be a public?  It's private beta right now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's like there are invites we can send out or whatever.  Yeah, so I have no idea.  I have eight remaining invites myself.  Yeah, that's how many I have.  Between the four of us, we can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could be able to cover the whole audience, I think, very easily here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if we were more popular, it'd be one thing.  Hey, you have Deadmau5.  Yeah, we have Deadmau5.  Deadmau5, Deadmau5, how do you pronounce that?  Yeah, love that deadmau5.  It's just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I have to say, there is a lot of...  Well, and now there's a lot of music choices out there.  I'm a big Spotify fan, but having all of your music online...  I'd be curious to see, we've heard rumors that iTunes Match will do something similar,  but having all your music online and not having to download it to your phone to listen to it is great.  There's actually some debate about whether Apple's going to do that or not.  Initially, they were saying, oh yeah, they'll be streaming from the Apple's iTunes Match.  Now Apple's saying, well, not exactly.  You have to download it and cache it and play it as you download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
