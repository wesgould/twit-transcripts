Hello, everyone, and welcome to TWiG. This Week in Google, Leo is still out, although he's actually in the area.  They returned home. Leo and Lisa returned home yesterday.  So I have a feeling they're kind of battling jet lag at the moment, but I'm pretty certain that Leo is going to be in starting this weekend.  So you are going to be Leo-less for not much longer.  In his place, I'm sitting here, obviously, not switching the show today.  Jason Howell, I'm hosting. And I love it. Last time I got to host, it was just a lot of fun.  So I'm happy to be in this seat again. And I've got an awesome panel, of course, returning the show as always.  Jeff Jarvis to my right. How are you doing today, Jeff?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. BuzzMachine.com.  And, well, let's just say there's some really good Jeff Fodder in today's rundown.  So I have a feeling there might be a little discussion on right fruit. What is fodder?  That's a really good question. It's a word that I use, but I've never actually analyzed it. What do you think fodder is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is fodder. It is food, especially dried hay or feed for cattle or other livestock.  I'm sorry that I presented that.  There's a lot of my cud in the show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, thank you for starting things off so strong. I really appreciate it. Is my face getting red?  It probably should be.  No, mine is. Mine is always red. That's the problem.  Don't worry about it. The window in front of you is still keeping you a nice hue of blue. So it's all good.  Also joining me today, Gina Trippani is back a mere two weeks after her last appearance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi. How's it going, Gina?  So good to be here. Great. It's going great. I was thinking maybe like not catnip, but like Jeff nip.  We can think of it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I'm analyzing like my own internal dictionary and realizing maybe I need to strike fodder from the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fodder is OK. Fodder is all right.  Is it? Is it all right?  You're feeding. You're feeding. You just turned me into a cow, but it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK. That was not my intention. Oh, boy. So stoked to have you guys.  Also, Aaron Newcomb sitting here in studio in the flesh right next to me. How are you doing, sir?  That's very good. Good. Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I realize when I'm sitting down for a show of the caliber of twig, what my best strategy is, is to surround me with insanely smart individuals.  And let them do the talking. So that's why we're here.  So hopefully that strategy works this time around. I know it will, because these guys are all awesome.  So what should we talk about first here? We've got a lot of stories in today's rundown.  Let's do you want to start with revenue because it's at the top. Is that an exciting kicker?  Google's revenue growth apparently is slowing down.  Obviously, things are kind of slowing down at Google.  They're also hiring less workers in the first quarter of 2015. Google only added one thousand eight hundred nineteen employees.  That's the smallest bump since the fourth quarter of 2013. So they're kind of slowing things down.  You know, the groups aren't hiring as much.  I guess is being selective as far as which groups can hire.  Whereas I think in the past it was kind of like a freewheeling like, yeah, sure. You you whatever.  Hire all you want. For instance, last year, Google plus saw hiring cap while Nest was given the room to grow.  So and I think we've all kind of seen Google deemphasize Google plus.  So that kind of makes sense. I don't know. What do you guys think? Is this is there anything to worry about?  Is there any story here? Is this just how business works?  Yeah. What do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I put something on the rundown where Business Insider said the reason they're worried about Google is now where'd that go?  Where'd that go? It's on here somewhere. Oh, hell. Oh, hell.  I can't find it now, but but but basically the the growth rate is slowing down.  Well, when you're that gigantic, Google's long said that that when you become size becomes your own enemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the issue. At some point, we've heard from one of the founders.  I think it's I think it was I'm not sure if it was Larry. I think it was probably Larry, right?  Saying that like Google's biggest challenge is itself and figuring out how to how to best use its resources.  I mean, I think I don't think it's a big deal.  I don't think it's a big deal. Only hiring 1800 new employees.  That's a good shape. 1800 employees.  And though I imagine from the inside as a Googler, being in a group that's not that doesn't have the green light to hire would be a little demoralizing.  Right. Especially since Google hires people who are super passionate and ambitious and want to go to a company like Google because they want to build things at tremendous scale.  So I think if there's any kind of signal from the top that the thing that they're working on, whether it's Google plus or whatever, doesn't have the attention to the higher ups or like isn't in a growth phase, that could be a little that might put me off.  But overall, I don't think it's that big a deal.  I mean, I'd love to know which you know, which groups hired and which groups didn't like which which ones had the cap.  Google Plus, it was kind of clear, right, that that was happening.  But, you know, where else? And there's no way to tell that, right?  Because so many groups are right or not public or people just don't know what groups there are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I shouldn't be waiting for the phone to phone to ring with a job offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, not if what you're trying to do is work in the Google Plus division.  No, right.  But Nest, maybe so.  I don't know.  All right. So maybe that wasn't the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see. We'll also see.  I think I think probably while we're on the air.  Yeah.  Google's numbers are becoming out.  I think today is always there tomorrow.  I know. Yes, definitely.  Results day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, definitely soon.  Hopefully that'll be breaking news that we can slam into today's episode to kind of see how that compares.  A chat chat room.  Keep keep an eye on that way.  Yeah. Yeah.  Work for us.  Hey, let's let's talk about something that I know will get everybody kind of kind of a little amplified here.  Sundar Pichai spoke with Conor Doherty of The New York Times about intrusive technology and how it impacts our lives.  I thought it was an interesting conversation.  The interview itself is one thing.  And Jeff, you will talk about that here in a second.  The point that Pichai was kind of making repeatedly through the interview, I thought were some interesting points.  He's basically talking about how Google's aim with their products is to be user centric, to make users happier, more productive people, not to get in the way and deteriorate the quality of life.  Basically that the burden is on the user right now.  Sundar believes that, you know, that's that's not the way it should be.  The burden should actually be on on Google to create an experience to create and developers to create apps that.  Yeah.  Relieve the burden of the user and actually place the information in a user's hands without the user having to kind of seek it out.  So I thought it was kind of an interesting talk.  Did you get a chance to take a look at that, Aaron?  No, I was just looking at it.  I'm just trying to figure out.  I mean, what do you guys think?  I think it should be in the hands of the user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I guess so.  But I mean, it seems like it seems like Google's in a pretty good position to do that.  Excuse me while I kill an ant.  I'll be right back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think I think Pichai really kind of touched on what I think is probably one of the biggest challenges for Google and product design, which is like Google wants to create products that anticipate your needs maybe before you even know that you need to create a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think I think Pichai really kind of touched on what I think is probably one of the biggest challenges for Google and product design, which is like Google wants to create products that anticipate your needs maybe before you even know that you need them right to give you the answer before you ask.  But they want to do that without being prescriptive.  Right.  So this interviewer, which Jeff will speak to in a minute, you know, said, you know, are we are we all on our phones during dinner like is this a you know, during dinner time with our family?  Is this a good thing?  And Pichai was like, that's, you know, that's that's not a technology decision, right?  Like that's a that's a human decision.  That's a parent a parent's decision when kids are involved.  You know, but how do you you know, we all know sort of the power of defaults and the power of of the way like a great app works can can can really affect your behavior.  So it was interesting to hear him talk about being user centric.  And then this interview was just really, really pushing him in the in this direction of.  But is this you know, is this really making our lives better?  I think it's clear to particularly viewers of this show that it's a net positive.  I'm pretty optimistic about technology.  And I think probably most most people in our audience are maybe that's up for debate.  I don't I that's not for debate for me.  But it did feel like this interviewer was just digging, just digging for, you know, how we're all buried in our screens and not connecting with each other and our present anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was writing another story that appeared as a commentary and Sunday Review in the Times about applications and hardware that try to wean you off your phone dependency.  So he was looking for a quote from Sundar.  I've been a reporter. I teach it.  I get what's going on here.  It's the it's the journalistic disease of saying, I wrote the whole story.  Now, there's a little empty spot there, just perfect for a Sundar Pichai quote.  And I'm going to go and get that quote.  And so then you ask Sundar the question, basically, our phones kind of ruining our lives and our dinner.  And Sundar doesn't cooperate with him and says, well, no, I don't I don't think so.  I think that we're trying to give people what they want.  So what do you do as a reporter?  You ask the question again and again and again.  I count basically six times.  You essentially ask the same question.  And Sundar is of a rank.  He can't say, you know, kid, have you?  I'm not going to answer what I do.  What I do at some point when this happens to me and I go get it reviewed off, what happens and I see it happening.  I say, listen, you can ask the question as often as you like.  I'm not going to give you the answer you want.  So stop.  But Sundar can't say that because otherwise he's going to sound like he's being pissy.  So the poor guy has to sit there and just wait and wait through it again and then find another way to say, no, I don't agree with you without saying, no, I don't agree with you.  And so he said, as Gina pointed out, he said, listen, is it the phone's decision?  Is it Google's decision what kids or parents should do during dinner?  That's for families to do.  Who wants Google in the middle of that?  No.  And he says, you're not asking a technology question.  We're here to take technology.  The other problem I have is that I know he's on the beat.  But you have the chance to sit down with the second most powerful man at the most powerful company on earth.  And this is all you do is to say, aren't the things you're making really causing life to be awful?  That's what drives me nuts.  It's more of the it's the it's the techno panic is the beat.  And I just see more and more and more of this going on these days where publications that I respect are just buying right in to the contrarian view of technology that way.  Wait a second.  Isn't this bad?  Isn't this bad?  And OK, I get the point.  And maybe a discussion would be fine.  But, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really I really liked how he he kind of used himself as an example.  You know, it was the reporters asking, like, do you find in meetings that people are on their laptops or on their phones?  And he said, well, one thing that I've learned about myself is that I don't multitask well.  Some people do, but I don't.  So I don't check email all day long.  I do email separately and distinct from the rest of my work.  And that's how I work.  Right. And I felt like, you know, if he was being pissy, as you said, Jeff, he would have been like, this is a matter of self-awareness, of figuring out who you are and what your priorities are.  And you check your email, you look at your phone, not as an impulse, but, you know, as a mindful decision, because it's the right thing to do at the moment.  Right.  You know, if you're just about to get born, you check your phone.  If not, then you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A couple of great moments where Sundar said, well, you know what?  We had a dinner before I.O.  We usually try to put our phones in the basket.  But the one people the one group that can't give up their phones is the PR people because you damn reporters keep calling them.  Right. He said it nicer than that.  But that was what it was.  My other favorite moment was the reporter says that I found this absurd.  Well, one way that I try to, you know, tame my own evil instincts with phones is I allow it to be in only one room in the house.  You know, I so I imagine that he got grandma's telephone, the old telephone table that sat in grandma's front room.  Yeah.  And that's where that's where the phone was.  He had the little chair next to the phone and the wire into the wall next to the phone.  Hey, we invented new technology that lets you carry it anywhere.  Wow.  I'm going to put it back in one room with the string tied there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, but having said that, I suppose it still falls on the user in that case.  Right. If that works for you to curb your usage patterns, then I guess more power to you.  And what Sundar is definitely saying here is it's not really up to Google to make those decisions.  And it's right.  It seemed like the interviewer was trying to get that was trying to get the like Google has a master plan for how you should use your device.  And and what's repeatedly said is, as you were saying, is that that's that doesn't lie in Google's responsibility.  That's that's up to an individual to make that type of decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's a moment when I actually fear for I feel for the PR people because you know, they're sitting there saying, oh, God, all right.  He's asking again. Is this please?  Please don't yell at him.  Please.  I got to work with this guy.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I completely agree that it's not Google's responsibility.  And I'm really glad to hear which I say that.  But, you know, the reality is like as an app maker, particularly an app with notifications, which is every app now, like there are times and Google has to make this decision all the time with their product design when they're like, is this piece of information worth the user's attention?  And should it be a push notification right now that's potentially going to make that user's phone ding?  Right. Like, am I justified making this person's phone ding?  They have to answer that question constantly.  Or, you know, is this information worthwhile putting it in a Google Now card?  You know, making somebody look at it and parse it.  Right. And like this is, you know, if you think about all the users and all the time they spend looking at these things, it's, you know, millions and millions and millions of human hours.  So Google does have to make those decisions, you know, on some level and certainly on the app level.  I mean, any app, even if you make an app that does email notifications, any app that takes your attention, which is every app, like the designer has to make those decisions.  And I think that's what he means by user centric.  Right. Like putting the human who is using this app at the forefront versus putting the interests of the company who's making the app or the app itself at the forefront.  You're really right, Gina.  You're really right, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're as always. You're really right.  And it's not just the app maker.  It's also in my business.  Now news has the way to send an alert to make your wrist or your pocket buzz.  We in news are doing a terrible job at alerts.  We're awful at it because it's still one size fits all.  So, you know, the Guardian and the New York Times and everybody tells me, Pluto pictures, Pluto pictures, Pluto pictures.  Yeah, I've got them. I've got Pluto pictures.  And one of them I appreciate.  So what does that require?  It requires knowledge about me and data points about me to give me relevance.  Well, that requires what Circa would have allowed, which is me to follow stories.  It requires other data points that will then require a fight in Germany about how they're learning this because they're violating our privacy.  And but but but those who fill the apps, those who talk through those apps are also going to make the same decisions.  My friend Jim Brady, formerly of The Washington Post and other places now has a thing called Billy Penn and in Philadelphia.  He says that an alert should be worth interrupting a meeting for.  Yeah, that's a good way to think about it.  It really is like, oh, oh, oh, sorry.  Oh, sorry.  That's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got the note going in right now, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's OK.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here's here's a dollar going in the jar.  Sorry, I dirty word jar.  Twit.  Anyway, yeah.  So Sundar, I think did very well.  There was still interesting stuff there.  I felt for him.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one thing now that I'm not multitasking anymore and I can respond to the question.  Oh, is that relevant?  A little bit, a little bit.  So one thing that I've noticed is that you both kind of alluded to this.  I mean, not that it's necessarily Google's responsibility, but what I'm glad to see them  doing anyway and taking a lead on some of this thing is putting in the option.  So you both mentioned a couple of apps that have the option now.  Are you interested in this?  Because it eventually inevitably it is up to the user.  So you mentioned the news, the news and weather app, and you mentioned the cards, right?  The Google Now cards and both of those have the option to say, are you interested in this?  No, I'm not interested in this.  I don't want to know about this.  Maybe it's something my daughter was searching for on my account and I'm not interested in Cupcake.  So I don't want to be notified about that.  So I will give them kudos for actually beginning to put those controls in there, at least to prompt the user to make sure let's verify whether this is important or not.  And then the user is in control of more of what pops up and interrupts them in the middle of a meeting or in the middle of dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And let me be clear.  I do want to be interrupted by Pluto.  I was watching NASA TV.  I am absolutely mesmerized by Pluto.  I tweeted the other day that it's one of those moments in life when I really regret not having studied science well enough and become a scientist.  How great to be involved in that reality.  How great to see a standing ovation for data.  Yeah, interrupt me for that, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No kidding.  If I may, because I am surrounded by very smart, intelligent folks.  And by the way, there's so what do we have down there?  Oh, so this is like a blow.  Oh, so this is the way before I get into that thought.  Yeah, this is the kind of close up of Pluto's surface that was released just I think a couple of minutes ago.  Yeah, minutes ago.  Yeah, I know.  It's awesome seeing 11000 feet high mountains of ice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's crazy stuff.  And the fact that they're able to do what they did.  Yeah, oh, absolutely.  Get that back so quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And isn't it true that the whole surface of Pluto is about the size of Russia?  Like if you take Russia and wrap it up into a ball, that's that's about the size of like when we when you see the images you think, oh, yeah, like this is probably about the same size as Earth or something.  But it's actually quite a small sphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My two favorite things.  Number one is I can't wait to refer to a steely corporate executive as having a heart as cold as Pluto's.  I just can't wait to do that.  I'll be a moment when I can.  It's in the bank.  It's in the bank.  It's a nerdy burn.  It's in there.  The other the other is that the press conference, I guess yesterday or day before yesterday, yesterday as it was, somebody asked, does it snow on Pluto?  And the answer was yes.  I just love that idea.  It snows on Pluto.  Oh, it snows nitrogen and methane and God knows what.  But it's snow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't mean to drag us.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't get me wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Pluto.  And I'm also still kind of amazed that an image of Disney Pluto actually fits on Pluto, the planet, pretty pretty snuggly, I might add.  So there's something going on there that Disney folks aren't telling us about.  Anyways, one question I have related to phone intrusion.  And this was just something that I kind of thought about after reading the interview yesterday and then kind of thinking about it this morning and everything.  Total selfish question.  I'm merely asking this because I'm surrounded by minds that I want to I want to know where you guys fall on this.  So when you're talking about phone intrusion, you're talking about kind of the pull that phones and this kind of technology has in our lives now, even compared to what it was like 10, 15, 20 years ago, like there's no doubt we're walking around with computers in our pockets.  And, you know, there's a whole host of things that, you know, things that pull us into that experience regularly as a result of just having that kind of power in our pockets.  And so what I see, you know, primarily in our home is, you know, I have a five year old daughter and I can kind of I'm trying to measure my use of the phone around her because I want to set an example that I don't live my life inside of a screen.  Even though my job and what we do in the technology world is I mean, it's we work in technology.  So it's not crazy to think that that's not normal in some ways.  But so I'm trying to kind of like convey that and not create bad lifelong habits.  If there is such a thing, I find myself kind of conflicted.  Right.  On one hand, like I've lived a life of technology.  I work in technology.  I love technology.  So I want to instill that.  And I think that we have to because this is kind of the future of the of the next generation is so intertwined in the world of technology.  But then at the same time, there's another part of me that kind of fears this kind of addiction slash abuse slash overuse aspect of it.  And I don't know how to balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you've got here's what I think you do.  I think you have trust and faith in in first your child and second in your your yours and your wife's parenting that you know, there was a time I'm going to go to a good drinking drinking game guys Gutenberg.  There was a time after the Gutenberg press when people said, oh my God, books are going to ruin it.  People spend too much time reading books.  Books are bad for you.  Books are horrible.  And now books are not reading books is a very bad thing.  People are smart.  People will figure it out.  Your child will figure it out.  Yeah, they'll go overboard.  You know, I was raised watching TV.  And that's why I'm so crazy.  But I became a TV critic and had its advantages.  You know, same with our hours during encourages encouraged his kids to watch TV.  He put TVs in their rooms because that's how he was raised.  It gave him a career.  I think that that will use these devices and things as we will.  And if there's if somebody overuses them, if they're just brother all there in the computer, it's probably indicating something else happening.  Yeah, that's good.  Gina, Gina, how are you as a mom?  How are you thinking about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we're kind of deep in this.  I mean, I try to I try to I think the thing that I struggle with is that, you know, my co-parent and I are both often will pick up, pick up the phone and start doing something.  And we could be doing hundreds of different things with so many possibilities.  But it looks exactly the same right to my daughter who said the first thing she says is what are you doing, mama?  She wants to know what we're doing on the phone.  So I try to use like voice search if I'm Googling something so that she knows what I'm doing or I try to say like I'm texting your aunt right now or I'm looking up a YouTube video or I'm looking at this recipe because mama's cooking right now.  So I try to like narrate to her so that she understands the range of things that are happening when I'm looking at the screen and she understands why I'm not looking at her.  You know, I think it has a lot to do with the kid, too.  Like my daughter's almost three and she's a little delayed developmentally like her gross motor skills.  So one of the things that her doctors and therapists have told us is that it's really important that she's as active as we can get her to be right.  And I know like most people, myself included, if I'm in front of a screen, I just kind of go limp, right?  Like I'm not moving. I'm not climbing or running or walking right unless I'm at my standing desk.  It's just it's just really easy to become super cerebral and not be active.  So I try to to limit her screen time so that just for that, because I'm just trying to get her to be more active because that's important for her developmentally right now.  But she's going to grow out of that. She's going to catch up and she's going to be fine.  And I think this is going to be like a lifelong thing.  I mean, I spent hours. I remember clear as day. I was nine years old.  We had we had our first computer and I was sitting in the den using it in my house in the 1980s.  And I heard my mom in the hallway telling my dad, you know, she really should go outside and make some friends.  I remember that clear as day.  And I remember feeling like, you know, maybe I'm kind of a loser because I don't have friends, but I'd much rather be here writing this basic.  Right. Like so, you know, I'm going to support her interests and she wants to be on screen like great.  My 10 year old nephew is making these YouTube videos of narrating himself playing Minecraft.  And I think it's amazing. He's such a good speaker. He's totally into it.  I want to support his passion. And if that means being in front of the screen, that's fine.  I spend most of my life in front of a screen.

Transcript:  No, I know. Totally. And that's part of why I feel so hypocritical thinking about these things.  But I just find myself thinking about it a lot and not just about my own kid, but just about, you know, society at large,  realizing that technology is kind of the era that we are in.  This is the era of technology and it's just kind of this is how we live our lives.  It's our livelihood for a lot of us.  But then at the same time, it goes counter to a lot of the things that like I heard when I was a kid,  not that my parents dissuaded me from being in tech, you know, into things that were, you know, fell in the realm of technology.  But, you know, that there is an unhealthy overuse of this kind of stuff.  You got to get out and be active and all that kind of stuff.  You know, it's a hard, hard kind of line to walk and try and figure out for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it gets worse when they become teenagers, because that's when you're really trying to instill some of those future good employee worker habits.  Right. And it gets difficult for me because I'm at home.  I work from home most of the time and I'll be in one of these huge meetings of like 30 people on the phone or something.  And the kids will be home at summertime. They're out of school.  And they'll come in and they'll come in the office where I work and, you know, have my headphones on and stuff.  And I'll say, I'm in a meeting, you know, you got to go out.  And then they'll look at the computer screen and they'll say, Dad, no, you're not.  You're playing Goat Simulator, you know, because I need a distraction sometimes.  I'll admit when I'm in one of these meetings, sometimes I need a distraction.  So I'm listening, actively participating.  But at the same time, I'm just, you know, doing something like doodling.  But instead of doodling, it's playing Goat Simulator.  And so that becomes a challenge then to instruct them.  But it's both good and bad. I think, oh, maybe I'm telling them the wrong thing.  Maybe I'm giving them this habit where they're not going to take work seriously.  And then I think, wait a second, maybe they shouldn't take work so seriously, actually.  Like, maybe this is a good thing.  Maybe they should learn to take breaks, have a good time when they can, still get their work done.  Maybe I'm instilling something that will actually be beneficial in the end.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I mean, if what you're showing them is that they should play Goat Simulator, I think that's pretty noble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think I want to know what that is.  Goat Simulator?  Don't worry.  I think it reminds me of, Gina will get this, of a Neal's t-shirt.  We'll say no more.  We will say no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what that is, but it really is exactly what it says.  It really is. You are a goat.  You're walking the goat around, headbutting things.  It's ridiculous. It's not even.  Yeah, yeah. This is much more harmless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

I figured you needed a little warm up to get to the right to be forgotten stuff.  How are you feeling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want to warm up my brain.  All right.  OK, OK. I'm there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. So tell us what's going on here.  We have a couple of stories in here and I'm not exactly sure how this happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know, Gina, whether you can describe it, but somehow Google left the way the Guardian put it, is they left in their source code.  I don't know what that exactly means in this context.  I couldn't figure that out.  Yeah.  The ability to find out what Google was trying to categorize the requests and the right to be forgotten.  And they evidently left some data in that.  The Guardian has discovered new data hidden in source code on Google's own transparency report that indicates the scale and flavor of the types of requests being dealt with by Google.  So I think it just means that was kind of hidden within an app and they found it in the in the in the source.  And then Google came back and said, yeah, we were trying to categorize these things, but we actually found the data wasn't very good.  So we stopped doing it.  And so now there's a whole story about this data that Google doesn't think is very good.  But what we find out is that a large, at least with that categorization, 95 percent of the 220,000 requests made to Google were from plain folks trying to get rid of things about them.  That is to say, not criminals, politicians or high profile public figures.  Well, I guess 95 percent of the world is people who are not criminals, politicians or high profile public figures.  So in some sense, that makes sense.  And includes a woman whose name appeared in prominent news articles after her husband died and others seeking removal of her dress, an individual contracted HIV a decade ago and so on and so forth.  And I can hear people say right off the bat, well, hey, Jarvis, you're against this right to be forgotten.  What about these plain folks who just want to take stuff down?  And I'm going to hold firm here and say a couple of things.  One is that it's ridiculous to force a company to take things down upon request.  It's Google also gets crap again for being the court of this.  Well, Google was put in that position.  And my view on this is that if a court tells Google under a law of a nation, you must take something down, then fine.  Google at this point, the more I think about it, the more I think Google was mistaken to agree, even though it was the final court decision, they should have just done some civil disobedience of a sort and say, no, you don't want us judging this.  If a court tells us to take it down, we'll take it down.  But we're not going to be the judge of taking this down because Google's this is the position Google's in now where they're constantly going to be judged for their judgment on the requests that are made to them.  So I think that's the story unless everybody else has a different view of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is only taking place in the last couple of months, right?  Like this only started in mid April.  And I think they're saying more than a million links have been requested to be taken down.  Six hundred two thousand have been deleted as a result in just two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also has rejection percentages based on various categories and countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm looking at sorry, I was I was determined to find out where this data was hidden.  So if you go to go to archive that org's snapshot of this transparency report from I think I went to the one in like March and you view the source, there are huge blocks of Jason data that the JavaScript is using to render some of those those pie charts.  And it's been scrubbed out of the current live version.  But if you look at the archive that version, yeah, they definitely provided a bunch more numbers that are that are not represented in those charts.  So you cracked the code, Gina.  Good job, Guardian. Wow.  You are you.  Yeah, I know how to use the view source.  So, you know, that's that's that's some that's some that's interesting.  I wonder if they got tipped off to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding. How do you just discover that like just fall into that?  I guess we'll just view the source and see if maybe they inadvertently, I don't know, left some data in there.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually get access to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's a statement.  Yeah, we've always aimed to be transparent as possible about our right to be forgotten decisions.  The data the Guardian found in our transparency report source code does, of course, come from Google.  But it was part of a test to figure out how we could best categorize requests.  We discontinued that test in March because the data was or were, if you prefer, not reliable enough for publication.  We are, however, currently working on ways to improve our transparency reporting.  And so that OK, fine. Right.  So I think it's straightforward.  But then they go to a Dutch researcher specializing in the liabilities of search engine providers.  Jesus, is that that's a that's a narrow specialty.  Google is taking decisions that are publicly relevant.  As such, it is becoming almost like a court or government.  But without the fundamental checks on its power.  Whoa, Nellie.  Yeah, Google never wanted to do this.  Google was forced to do this by a Fakakta court decision that forced them to be the decider.  It's yes, I agree.  It's insane for Google to make these decisions.  I think Google would readily agree with that.  We have laws about about content that exist.  These these go way past that.  There are libel laws and defamation laws and other laws about things that can be taken down.  This is not any of that.  This just says, you know, Google, I don't really like that haircut.  I demand that you take down that picture of my haircut.  I was having a bad hair day and nobody should see that hair.  I'm doing my Leo imitation of somebody.  It's pretty good. Yeah.  Yeah. Thank you.  Just imagine me later, Hoson.  And and so it's it's it's absurd.  And so now to attack Google because Google is forced to make decisions Google doesn't want to make.  And and then to then to go after them for the transparency they give and say they don't have enough transparency.  Ah, their heads must explode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And I don't see.  I mean, there's a lot of that.  I mean, how do you tell that 95 percent or whatever?  I mean, if it was just written in the code, I mean, how there's so many variables that could go into that.  How do you even know?  Like, oh, this person served in office once or, you know, maybe he was the head of the PTA or something like.  And they said, oh, this is a famous person.  So he falls into that five percent category.  And anyway, I think this just goes to prove that Google's doing their job.  Right. I mean, they were doing what they were told to do.  Like, to me, this seemed like a little bit of a non story.  It had a big headline.  But I was like, OK, so Google's doing what they were told to do in a way that seems fair because the numbers represent what you would imagine they should be.  To me, that was it was a non.  It was almost a non story.  Take that, Jason.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm glad you included in the rundown.  I'm glad we were able to talk about it, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Believe me, when I knew I was hosting, I put everything in the rundown, everything that I found that said Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I suppose we can continue down the and let me try this for myself.  So I'll have a lesson right now.  Everybody.  Spoil to us!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is not easy.  That took me six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was that close?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not even going to try again because I'm pretty certain I'm not going to get it.  So Jeff, you also put in here the EU Commissioner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In charge of digital, who scares me every time he speaks, Günter Ittinger is now saying that he still has plans to enable an ancillary copyright law, which is English for Leistung Schutzrecht, for all press publishers across all of Europe by the end of 2016.  And in my view, it's already led to the disaster of the Spain link tax and the killing of Google News there.  And the publishers losing 10 to 15 percent of their traffic in an instant.  And I saw a story the other day, I couldn't find it right before the show was in, I think, Der Spiegel, that said that authorities in Germany warned lawmakers that the law doesn't make any sense.  And they still went ahead with it anyway.  And I'm not going to bore everybody with the story again.  But but but this you're going to hear me saying this word again and again and again over the next two years.  I just warn you folks, start a drinking game now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, well, I got another one.  Yeah. All right. Let's unless you want to try and say Leistung Sussekt again.  I can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've been drinking on the show.  Shame on you, gentlemen.  I wish only Gina is sober here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk about maps a little bit.  So this is kind of cool.  So last week, we kind of got a little freaked out and go lie about deep dream and the fact that it can put dog faces in your spaghetti, among very other things, which, by the way, the more I look at those deep dream images, it really looks like all it does is place dogs everywhere.  Is that true?  Like, I feel like dogs appear in every image in some way, shape or form.  Like, it's very dog focused.  Don't know why. Don't understand why.  But anyways, Google has something else that's kind of deep that they're working on.  And I don't know if we're going to see this anytime soon in like a physical form that we can we can mess around with.  But they did put up some some examples.  They have some demos. Yeah.  Yeah, they have some demos, which are really cool.  The neural networks are basically doing something called deep stereo, which takes two or more Google Street View images sequences and processes those to kind of put you in into that space in a virtual way.  Basically what it's doing, it's analyzing the view, multiple angles from each of those images, and then it approximates how the view how the room or that view looks at different angles throughout the room that there was no picture taken from depth color of every pixel in each of these images is analyzed.  That creates a 3D space.  Then it fills in the gaps from the original photos based on color and depth input.  And we're looking at it right now.  This is kind of like a walkthrough based on, you know, up in the top right corner, the images that pieced it together.  And then when you look at the whole thing, it's just this smooth kind of virtual, I don't know, virtual walkthrough.  That's just really, really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm ready. I'm ready for it. I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put that in your in your cardboard.  In your one plus cardboard.  One plus cardboard.  Never settle, Jeff. Never settle.  When did you get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just came yesterday.  Nice. Very nice.  There's no no no forehead grease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's no one plus two in there, I'm assuming.  Right.  Well, that's a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It took me some time to figure out what is happening here.  But they're I mean, they're basically they have two images that are slightly different angles.  And then this technology is creating all the images in between, like guessing what the images in between would look like and then stitching them together.  Well, it's I mean, it's incredible.  And the place that I want to see it is where I think the worst user experience is in Google Maps, which is when you go down to Street View and you want to walk up the block.  You have to click and click and click.  I just want to hold down my mouse, you know, and then and kind of zoom down the block.  Right. Because you're always like a couple.  I kind of want to see what's in a couple blocks where you're where you are.  And it's it's a total pain.  Yeah. Like this Lombard Street movement here.  Like, that's awesome.  That's really cool.  Yeah. It's got that surreal feeling to it.  It's like a floaty dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The world as material design.  Kind of like I'm going to throw up in a minute kind of look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure you want to put this in cardboard.  Yeah, I'm sure this would be better.  But so can they do this with other.  So this is one person's foot, like a bunch of photographs from one person.  Right. I mean, yeah, they do this with like crowdsource it like with a bunch of different people's photographs on the same day or in the same time period like a tourist attraction where tons and tons of photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the key is getting enough of the photos.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't need that many, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they can start.  I mean, they can begin to do it with two images.  Obviously, you're probably not going to get this motion thing, which what you're seeing there is the sequence of pictures as it travels along the path.  But yeah, it currently takes 12 minutes to produce a single 512 by 512 image.  So it's pretty slow.  And apparently it's pretty costly.  So they don't they don't imagine this is something that we're going to see in use anytime soon.  But it's kind of the start of something cool.  Go Moore's law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go Moore's law.  Yes, exactly.  They track down the frame rate and kind of even if you make kind of small images and then a couple of years and things get faster, we'll see this.  Just maybe not just right now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I have a feeling like it.  Well, like I'm trying to think if they would be able to do something this impressive based on like different people's photographs of a landmark from different times of year or whatever.  And I'm not sure it would be quite the same thing.  Because it's not it's not.  It's not even different.  Yeah, yeah.  More like a time lapse.  It would almost I would imagine then be like an approximation of the two.  You know, all of the images in between.  Even though even if they were taken like years apart.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Since we have some other maps news here, we might as well talk about it.  You remember way back when when Google's map maker was I don't know.  Let's just say some people had a little too much fun with Google's map maker.  And they analyzed it more or less.  Well, Google, I guess, kind of shut that down a while ago.  And they're ready to reopen the map maker.  And this time they're emphasizing kind of a community moderation approach to control that chaos as opposed to hiring staffers to do it.  Qualified regional leads are going to be sought out.  Google still plans to approve some edits, although we don't really know exactly what it is.  Google would approve.  But so basically, map maker will be coming back.  But this time community moderated.  Is that the right way to go?  I think it was a pretty popular feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think they should bring it back.  And yeah, community monitoring makes a lot of sense.  Right. I mean, not to bring up Reddit, but sometimes it works.  But it does work most of the time where, you know, people will step in and say, no, no, no, you can't do that.  Let's maybe a better example is Wikipedia.  Well, most of the time that works.  No, I think this is a good way to go.  I'm making jokes.  But yeah, I think they do a good job.  And I think I think, you know, people get really into maps.  I mean, there are some people that just really go nuts over over map and map technology.  And so I think this I think this is a good answer to the to the problem.  Yeah. Did you guys talk, by the way, about the the updates to the map app last week?  I think I grabbed that for my tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can talk about it now.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  It's OK.  No, no, that's OK.  All right.  We'll save it for later.  Let's save it.  Let's save it.  That's a tease, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't mean to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  No, no, that's OK.  I I shamelessly stole it from the middle of the rundown.  So don't you go stealing Gina's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, but this I think yours is different.  I think this is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm talking about the UI, how you can make the UI disappear.  Oh, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what is that?  I think I read something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. In the most recent in the most recent maps update to for Android, if that's been pulled down to your device, you can I can actually probably even show it.  So if you if you see the usually you get the little buttons backwards here, the little buttons in the Google bar at the top and with the latest one, if you just touch it, they disappear.  So it gives you a full view of the map.  And if you want to bring it back, you just touch it again, I think, or just move around or something.  Double tap.  I don't know how to get it back forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're going to get it back.  Now I can't get it.  I can't put it in my.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I touched it the right way that time.  Now you can touch it again.  It'll come back so you can look stuff up.  Yeah, I thought that was a brilliant like sometimes these little things.  Like there's some developer out there that says, I've got an idea.  Why don't we just make the user interface disappear so people can see the map better?  So I thought that was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's nice, especially when it's about hiding the Google search bar, right?  Which, you know, doesn't it does not always.  You don't. Yeah, you don't always get an opportunity to hide that.  You don't usually get an opportunity to hide that, you know, and I just sort of accept that stuff as like, well, it's Google products like it's their search bar.  It's going to stay there.  But I think this is the user centric thing that which I was talking about.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's maps for Android.  Speaking of Android, ten years ago, by the way, this is a quick one.  Google bought Android Inc. for 50 million dollars.  It's been ten years already.  I can't believe that.  That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ten years ago was oh, five.  Oh, man, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I mean, Android was a lot different before it ever even launched to the public.  You know, it was not even I don't even think a touch screen interface in 2005.  It was more meant to look kind of like a BlackBerry approach than anything.  So it changed a lot even before it even, you know, hit the hands of consumers.  But they buy the technology or the staff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ten years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought they bought the staff because Andy Rubin was part of that.  Yeah.  And Andy Rubin came over and ended up being kind of a rock star Google for quite a while.  He's done Google now.  So it's not a Google anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I've been trying to buy a friend look for Android Auto.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  So Android Auto and our so my car is dying.  One hundred eighty five thousand miles dings.  It's dying.  So I need to get a car.  I have three requirements.  I won't fit them all.  I want I need believe it or not.  I need four wheel drive because I live on hills with snow and I got to have that.  I wanted a hybrid.  And I wanted Android Auto.  So I go to a bunch of dealers.  I look at the list that was announced at I.O.  is huge number of you know, it's not Toyota, which is what I have now.  It's not Ford, but it's Chevy.  It's other places.  I saw I go to these places and I talked to this car salesman.  Hahaha.  Android what was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every single case.  No idea whatsoever.  Then I go to Hyundai, which has the Hyundai Sonata as the first car out with it.  And they say, oh, yeah, yeah, Android thing.  I said, when's it going to hit the other cars?  You know, you know, you know.  So then I went last night to Audi and apart from the fact that the sales guy kept calling it Android Audio.  Hahaha.  Right.  Not being critical here.  But there was a guy who really knew his stuff.  And so I just thought I didn't know this.  Maybe you guys do this.  But he said, as far as he understood, what's going to happen is that the cars that have the right equipment at Audi.  It'll just be a patch that will run.  Yep.  So that that made me imagine that I'm going to treat my car just like we all treat our phones.  Update, update, update.  I'll be driving all the time.  Are you ready for an update yet?  I'm trying to get it.  But I'm hoping that I can get Android Auto assured in a car.  We'll see.  Do you guys know anything about this?  Well, you don't want to go the aftermarket route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been looking at the pioneer units.  That's that's what I was going to do is just get one of those aftermarket pioneer units, slap it in there and be good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My car is so so dear death.  Eleven years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you're going to get a new car, you want it built in.  Yeah, you want it all.  Yeah, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My car to know me not pieced together.  Yeah.  Are you going to get these $700 one or kind of waiting to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm kind of waiting to see if they go like the next version and maybe it's $600 or $500.  $700 is just a lot to play for for for basically a stereo.  But this is a screen on those as well.  I know.  But actually, I think it was Phil Nickinson of Android Central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was in for all about Android a couple of months ago, a little while ago anyways.  And he was playing around with it.  He actually said the resistive screen, believe it or not, on a device like Android Auto actually really works well because a screen like you got to kind of punch it anyways.  And that's how you do things on your dash.  You don't like lightly tap like you do on a touch phone, a touch screen phone for things.  And so you really don't even notice that it's resistive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the other thing I've been thinking about, to be honest, is just taking my wife's old Nexus seven that she doesn't use any more and going that route, just hacking it up.  It's more fun for me anyway.  So you might do that.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you're on the hook for support.  So yeah, keep that in mind.  Maybe you enjoy that too.  I do.  At least for myself.  Not for all my friends and neighbors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Use the fourth remote control, switch the input and then move to the second remote control.  No, no, no.  The other second remote control.  Oh yeah.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had that experience this morning with my nine-year-old.  Dad, the TV's not working.  What did you do?  Well, you got to use this remote and then push this button and then set it to setting two and it'll work.  Don't you know that by now?  You're nine years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Geez.  You don't know this by now?  Yeah.  Going back to what you were saying, Jeff, as far as updating the Android Auto.  So basically updating Android Auto in the dash would then be done using your phone as kind of the data access point and transferring that data over?  Is that how it's done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or no, I think that the car company will send a patch to the hardware in the car itself so that that will then enable Android Auto with your phone.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you have to take it into them to do that?  I would bet so, yes.  Okay.  All right.  I was like, yeah.  I forgot.  Over-the-air updates on the computer inside my car.  That just sounds like you're asking for trouble on something like that.  You could do that, right?  I imagine you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With the car.  What's that popular app you can get with a little dongle for your car's diagnostic thing?  Oh, I don't know.  What's the name of it?  I can't remember.  I forgot.  Chat Room will help us out with that.  But yeah, they actually enable that.  They enable you to connect through your phone and get updates over the air and stuff while you're driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My car is so old.  How old is it, Jeff?  It's so old.  It doesn't have an aux plug.  Oh yeah, I know that feel.  It drives me nuts.  So I have a cassette adapter.  I've gone through 20 of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All those cassette adapters.  Yes.  I had this really old car and had to buy one of those cassette adapters.  And the guy at Best Buy was literally like handed it to me, looked disgusted and was  like, you really need to get a better car.  You shouldn't be buying this anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm disgusted that I have to sell this to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he was really angry that he had to dig it up out of the stock in the back.  I was just like, you need a better car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When those salespeople sell somebody a cassette deck, I think they're actually dinged in their  paycheck for that, that they didn't upgrade you to a CD deck at least or something with an aux input.  My car is a 2005 and it has the stereo that's embedded with the...  The stereo and the air conditioner and all that are all in one single unit, so you can't replace it.  It's only a CD player.  There's no aux input.  So what I had to do, I actually had to buy a kit, pull out the stereo and hack into the CD line.  And so I have a blank CD that plays in the CD player and a cord that I've like fused into it, fed out the side.  So I have aux now, but it's a total hack job, but it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you have to play the blank CD.  Yes.  Blank CD on repeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  80 minute blank CD and it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the CD version of the cassette adapter.  It totally is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It totally is.  This is my argument for design thinking.  The secrecy of the auto industry.  If they listen...  Listen, my car is 11 years old, but we had Walkman then.  I had things that I wanted to plug in then, but they didn't listen to customers.  For a 39 cent plug, they could have made people happy.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And now, I mean, you don't buy a car without an auxiliary input, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I don't want to buy a car without Android Auto.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Might as well start off small.  Unless...  Here's my fear about Android Auto.  My fear is it's going to be so safetyed up that it will be less useful than my phone just hanging there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  If it has Android Auto, does that mean that it doesn't have an auxiliary input?  Oh, no, it'll have that too.  It'll have that too.  So you can still use it the way you use it right now.  Yeah.  It'd be like a mode setting.  In worst case scenario.  Yeah, you go mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You hit the mode button until it got to Android Auto.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think this is why you can get your own tweets and your own destinations.  Here's the other problem.  I'm an addict, as you know, of Waze.  Waze is not ported to Android Auto yet.  It's just Google Maps.  I'm not a Google Maps guy.  I'm a Waze guy.  This could be trouble.  These could be future complaints on the show.  We'll just see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stay tuned to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a Google Maps guy.  And I've got to say that they are really...  Google's been doing a good job at incorporating a lot of the Waze technology into Google Maps lately.  Over the past couple of months, the turn-by-turn directions, and now it comes on and says,  you are on the fastest route to your destination.  Or if you're not, it'll say, you can get there six minutes faster by...  I love that.  I think it says, would you like to save six minutes on your trip or something?  It's like, yes, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like software updates for your routes.  Yeah, it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've literally had half an hour saved driving through San Francisco because of one of those that came up when I was late and I got there early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other night, we were coming home from...  Now, get this, folks.  We were coming home from the Taylor Swift concert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're a good dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's amazing.  She's girl power, man.  She's all girl power.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She gives us a great show, I've heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She does.  She really does.  It's quite amazing.  It is in about 12 years, Gina.  Yeah.  And so I always turn on Waze because I actually think it's a generous social act to add my data in and return for all the data I get.  But sometimes when I go on the way home, I'm so automatic myself, I don't notice.  I just notice that, whoa, it's telling me to get off way before it ever tells me to get off.  And I always listen to the Waze lady.  Always listen to the Waze lady.  And there was a terrible accident.  The entire highway was shut down.  People were stuck there for three hours.  Wow.  Waze probably saved me with two teenage girls in the car.  Oh, could you imagine?  Three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jacked up on Taylor Swift.  Yeah.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Singing all those songs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  And I think that's the challenge, right?  Is when you're driving a route that you've driven a million times and you use navigation because you just want to know how long it's going to take to get there.  And then suddenly it pipes in and says, actually, go this way and you'll save blah, blah, blah.  And I have to like, I have to actively trust in Google at that point.  Like, because my my my instant reaction is, no, I've done this a million times.  I know how this goes.  I'm telling you, I have learned the lesson.  No, I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I totally every single time I've had the hubris to disobey the Waze lady.  I have run it.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's true.  So great.  And and by the way, I feel you on Taylor Swift because my daughter has discovered Taylor.  OK, anyways, sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to say it was a it was a geek.  There were geek moments in it because the state has a runway.  I think, OK, well, she's going to come out.  We were we were on the on the on the floor of the stadium.  So we were near the thing.  The runway came up.  I thought, oh, that's cool.  It came way up, moved back, moved around, and she was on the edge.  And so she she she manages to talk to the cheap seats all around.  It's phenomenal.  Oh, that's great.  That's she's she's pretty amazing.  My Nexus six camera did not work at all well in the conditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lighting, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And those I put in one where she looks like she's just an apparition  because the light on her is so bright, everything around.  So it's just this white silhouette.  Yeah.  And also the poor Nexus six couldn't do it.  But nonetheless, so it was OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of camera, I don't know if any of you is not in the rundown,  but it just kind of reminded me of this.  Marques Brownlee on YouTube, he got a hold of the one plus two.  He's not showing it.  He's not showing it off.  So he obviously has something going with the one plus folks.  They gave him one plus two.  He shot a video on like camera performance, like just a bunch of pictures  that he took and everything.  Pictures like so.  So but this is kind of my way to segue into asking you guys like,  are you excited about the one plus two?  Is anyone here going to get it?  Do you think what what are your thoughts?  Where do we stand?  What is this task is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Genis is broken.  Gina has one plus one.  And the question is, is she going the Nexus route or the one plus route this time?  That's what I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's tough.  I'm still using the one plus one.  The heart, the buttons broke.  So I had to turn on actually the software buttons.  So now I'm using those.  That's fine.  At least there's a fallback for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But wow, they broke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were like my daughter dropped it and then the capacitive button stops.  Like the capacitive buttons just stop registering tasks.  So like I had no button, no back, no nothing.  So I was like, what am I going to do?  So I factory set it and there was it was an option in the beginning.  Like, do you want to turn on software buttons?  And I was like, oh, yeah, the software button.  You can do that in settings as well.  Because otherwise I would have had to buy a new phone.  You know, I've had a really good experience with the one plus one, but I had to wait so long for a lollipop.  And I just I feel like out of touch with the sort of pure Google experience, even with the Sanogen.  I mean, I love Sanogen and the extra controls.  I don't like that one plus is like diverged.  Now there's oxygen.  It's oxygen, right?  Oxygen and Sanogen.  I think they're going to push oxygen, which I just don't know a whole lot about yet.  And so I think I'm ready to sort of get back on the Nexus train.  That said, like, I'm not like all fired up about the Nexus six either.  I kind of want the next Nexus, whatever that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sort of hoping that by the end of the year there's rumors of two of them coming out, one with how away, how away,  how do you say how away?  And one with five point seven inch screen says the rumor and one more like a five inch screen with was an LG, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be great.  I would do that.  I would do that.  If that happened at the end of the year, I would do that.  That's interesting.  The Huawei partnership would be really interesting, right?  Because what's his head from the Android team?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Went to went to know you're thinking of Xiaomi, Xiaomi, Hugo Barra.  Yeah, I went to Xiaomi.  Different.  Although that would be.  Yeah, I don't know when that would ever happen.  But I totally would be pretty intense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Played at the two companies because it's like two companies whose names are like hard for me to say.  Right. Exactly.  So you said a five, seven and a five.  Probably five, seven.  Five, seven.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I couldn't go back to a tiny phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I have to think about that.  But I could go five, five.  I could maybe try to go a little smaller.  I might go for the smaller one again.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife's in the market for a phone.  So I don't know if I can hold off till Google announces their next phone, though.  But it's hard to find the Nexus fives.  And, you know, it seems like they're not getting as many updates lately for the Nexus five.  So I don't know.  It seems like Google's maybe shying away a little bit from the Nexus five.  So we'll see. I don't know.  I'd like to keep her in the Nexus family because it's just so much easier to troubleshoot problems and and fix things.  And, you know, she's got the latest update.  I don't have to worry about, you know, going and downloading a ROM for her.  So we'll see what happens.  I really like my Nexus six, though.  So I have no complaints.  I mean, this is one of the first phones where, number one, I've not had to load a custom ROM on it, which is great.  And I've had almost no problems at all with it.  The only thing the only problem I had was not Google's fault.  It was not Motorola's fault.  It was AT&T's fault because they loaded a really obnoxious splash screen thing.  When it comes up, it would display the AT&T logo and it would and it would set the volume for 100 percent.  And for that. Yes, just for that.  Yeah. And it was crazy.  And so like even at work, there's no way to mute it.  So I'd like reboot my phone at work and it would be like, I was like, everybody's looking like,  everybody's looking like, what's going on?  So that's the only complaint I have with AT&T, but not with the phone.  I love it. Yeah.  So we'll see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, like my six after after breaking the.  I don't blame the six for that, by the way.  I just wasn't wearing a case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love to have a USB-C.  I think it'll be coming to everything soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that that's going to be my call is that that's going to be in both of the Nexus's if there are, in fact, two Nexus's,  which would be kind of weird if Google suddenly does a two Nexus release because they haven't done that before.  But there's a first for everything, I suppose.  But I think Google kind of at this point has already kind of made it pretty clear that they recognize USB-C as the kind of next standard for most.  Well, it's on my it's on my Pixel.  Yeah, exactly.  They have it on the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I got the new Chromebook flip.  All right. So let's talk about that.  So it's really sweet.  But I thought the DC is like you can't see it, but the DC is very small.  And the plug with USB charging on this is not a seed with USB.  I thought that's great. No, it's not.  It's just it's just it fools you how small it is.  But this is this is I got I got a review unit.  So FTC to make very clear here what it is and nice little unit.  And of course, it swivels back.  The keyboard then goes off and it's now a tablet with touchscreen.  The thing that strikes.  So it's a very nice little unit.  It's light. It's small.  You know, I compare this with carrying around a tablet with a keyboard.  This is much better than that.  The it like having got my head around yet is the problem of Chrome versus Android.  Mm hmm.  That Chrome is still not built, even though I use touchscreen on my Pixel to use Chrome as a touchpad device.  The axis is a little small.  It's a little bit difficult.  It misses you occasionally just because Chrome's not really built for that kind of touch, general touch use supplementary rather than the whole of touch use.  So I find that interesting.  You know, I wonder whether they're going to start merging Chrome and Chrome and Android finally more.  We've speculated about that in this show for ages ever since Sundar got both both under him.  But this is a really nice little sweet machine.  And I'm playing with it.  I carry it with a carrier is my only machine today when I went into the city.  I'm going to try to work it as my main machine for a week or so and see what I think.  But but I got one from Asus to try out and and I like it.  Nice.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much how much is the flip?  It's like what a couple hundred three thirty nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think something like that.  OK, maybe that's too high.  No, no, that was that was a that's what that's the problem.  We see somebody on Amazon listed as one seller sells it and it's like a an eBay bad deal.  I'm not sure what the price is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I want to say it's like a couple hundred.  It's not a lot of it's not an expensive it's not it's not one expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you consider that if you bought a Nexus nine and a keyboard that it cost a lot more than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two forty nine for the two gig of RAM model, two ninety nine for the four gig.  OK, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I would always with Chrome always get four gig folks don't get to get.  Yeah, I would agree with that.  And now on Chrome you can download movies or shows or whatever.  You can download Google Play stuff into the machine so I can watch it.  Will the experience be as good?  I don't know. I'm going to try it on this versus I mean, I carry my Nexus seven everywhere.  I don't carry a keyboard for it.  I also carry the Chromebook.  Here's the question.  I carried that would that get rid of.  Now I carry both a tablet and a laptop.  It's insane as it is.  Would this one machine replace that?  I don't know. We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm.  Yeah, I think it kind of falls back on is the tablet version of that one machine as good as what you get out of running an Android tablet.  And yeah, I would agree with you.  Like if all I had was the screen of this pixel and not the keyboard, I'm not sure that I could live my life like that in the Chrome universe.  It's it's a touch screen device, but it's not touch first.  And as a result, like you say, like a lot of the touch points are really small and sometimes a little finicky and everything.  But it's nice. It's a nice option to have for certain random things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the other thing I've got to say, you know, this is me, my Chromebook love a year and a half on Chromebooks.  But to get a new machine, put in my ID and I'm on and everything that I have is there in a minute.  Literally, that's really nice.  It's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if what if when you flipped it over, it just went into Android, popped into Android, you had access to all the same files?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think this is kind of what we're talking about as far as like the eventual convergence of of Chrome and Android,  because like if Chrome, if if a Chromebook or Chrome OS really is just kind of like the Chrome browser, but you know, on steroids,  you know, as in an OS sort of environment, why couldn't that be done inside of Android or in some sort of way where they work seamlessly together?  And in that case, yeah, that would be that'd be pretty rocking, I would say.  Pretty cool.  Because because undoubtedly, at least in my experience, the Chromebook is a is a much better productivity device than Android is with a keyboard.  Period. Yes. Yes. OK. Yes.  You know what I mean?  Like I can I can I could commit myself to Chrome OS and have it be my computer for the most part now that I'm not video editing and stuff like I can probably safely do that.  But I could not commit myself to Android with a keyboard, an Android tablet with a keyboard like the Dell Venue 10, 7000.  I reviewed it a couple of weeks ago on before you buy.  And it is exactly that.  It's probably the best one for Android right now.  The best convertible tablet with a keyboard dock that's running Android.  But I couldn't live my life like that.  That couldn't be my one and only device.  Yeah, it worked for some people, but it wouldn't work for me.  So go ahead, Regina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, just like we've seen Android and Chrome sort of dancing around on another, right?  You can run Chrome on Android.  You can run Android on Chrome.  Right. And that one crazy extension, it doesn't seem that crazy.  Right. That one machine will be able to switch between the two of them.  And that is what I'd want.  I definitely want the Android interface.  That said, I don't use the Chromebook.  I don't use the Pixel as much.  So I'm not quite used to Chrome with a touch, you know, with the touch interface.  But yeah, I imagine those Xs are small and it's a little funny.  But my wife uses the Pixel full time and I was using my MacBook and I handed it to her because, you know, to do something.  I needed her to do something on my screen.  And she was like, how do I scroll here?  Like she didn't know.  She just wanted to touch the screen and then she's like, how does this work?  And I was like, it's two fingers on the trackpad.  I don't know what that means.  Like she just didn't get it at all.  So funny. She's trained.  But yeah, Chrome OS to Android flipping back and forth between the two of them would be amazing.  Or they could just merge into Chrome Droid.  That's kind of where I see it heading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I mean, there's still a little bit of a kind of a, I don't know, kind of an attachment when you've got two OSs on one single device that you're switching back and forth.  Has there ever been an example of that that worked seamlessly in a way that everybody applauded and was like, this is how it needs to be done?  Or is it always just kind of like, oh, well, yeah, you can do that.  It does run Windows and it does run this other OS and you can use it like that.  But is it is it ideal?  Like it shares data between those OSs and you want that if you're doing something like this.  But is that good enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if there's ever been a successful implementation.  I think that's the key. That's the key word. Successful.  It's been done before.  I mean, I can switch back and forth.  I mean, just look at like even a virtual box running on my Windows PC or or or Windows guest in my Linux PC.  I mean, I can go to there.  I can map the same drive so I get access to the same files and things like that.  But I don't think there's really been a successful emerged hybrid device like that that's worked seamlessly.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And dual booting or virtualization, whatever it is, if it's boot camp or if it's virtual box or whatever, that's always been an extreme sort of hobbyist thing.  I don't know. We've never seen we've never seen a consumer product do that switch between the two that weren't really kind of niche specialized products that didn't go that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would say Google's in the best place to do it with Android and Chrome OS.  I've since the beginning, I've always said it should just be Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think I think, Aaron, I think I think you're really onto something that if it could be context sensitive to the UI, I mean, Chrome does work incredibly well across all devices.  When I use Chrome on my phone, I use on my laptop, I use on machine.  Right. It knows it's me. It works well.  It does things. So they got that down.  Android does some stuff really, really well for it by by constant chronic complaint about multiple user accounts.  Android handles well.  Chrome can't handle with the crap.  And so there's good and bad in each.  But if you if you take the use case of saying now you're on a small device, now you're sideways looking at a movie, that's better in Chrome, better than Android, whatever it is to start to pull the best based on your use case.  I think there's something to that.  Yeah. And I actually, for a while, I used an Odroid C1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of like a Raspberry Pi.  I was setting up an Odroid C1 with Android on it.  And for a while I had that connected to my monitor at home with keyboard and mouse and everything, just like a normal computer.  And I got used to it.  And it actually functioned really, really well.  And I got so especially some of the apps like Netflix and YouTube.  I preferred using them on Android, even though I had it sitting side by side with my PC.  I really did prefer that interface, even on a big screen.  It was connected to my normal monitor.  And so I could I could use a laptop just with Android running.  Maybe I'll try to hack that together and see how that goes.  Just run Android instead, just like a Chromebook, but running Android instead of Chrome OS for a while and see how that goes.  I've got some old laptops sitting around.  Maybe I'll do that because I really I did not find it when I had the physical keyboard and the physical mouse sitting next to me.  I did not find it unpleasant.  And there was almost nothing I couldn't do.  And like Jeff said, there were some things like multiple user accounts that Android actually handled better than a desktop or Chrome OS did.  Right. And I preferred. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see here.  I thought this was kind of cool. So Google launched Nearby.  It's an API that basically empowers developers to allow their apps to talk to each other based on on a location context, essentially proximity.  And, you know, Google's done a lot to kind of make this simple for the developers, of course.  And along and by the way, this is the same thing that that you see with Chromecast guest mode, which now through this is available to all developers.  Along with this, Google also launched Eddystone, which is a open source cross platform Bluetooth le beacon.  So, you know, we could essentially do things like the minute you walk into the Twit studio, we could have a beacon that shoots the Twit schedule to your device just based on proximity alone.  So Google launched this yesterday and all existing Bluetooth or beacon hardware could actually be updated.  The firmware could be updated to support this right away, since it's just Bluetooth support, Eddystone.  So this is kind of Google's kind of bigger picture, you know, a piece of the bigger, bigger puzzle of kind of the Internet of Things when it comes to what Google's working on in that in that world.  Kind of cool. Have you guys had so I asked this last night and all about Android and I'm very curious from a user standpoint.  Have any of you used iOS and experienced the eye beacon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't. But when I when I visited China and I was in the airport for the first time, my phone just lit up and started beeping, you know, started giving me or I started getting notifications saying, do you want to accept this Bluetooth message?  And I was literally just like passing kiosks or ads and they were they were ads, you know, for things, offers, whatever.  And it was the first time this is a long time ago on like a Nokia candy bar phone.  This is this is a while ago, if I'm remembering that correctly.  But I remember being like, oh, this is weird and intrusive because I just got hammered with so many of them kind of at the same time.  But thinking about it, you know, I mean, I ride the bus a couple of days a week and I'm walking to the bus stop and I'm pulling up city mapper and I'm saying, what's the schedule like?  I would love to arrive at the bus stop and just have the schedule pushed, you know, like next bus two minutes away.  That would be great. Right. And I mean, I'm standing at a bus stop like that's clearly information I want to have.  So I'm definitely open to this if it's if it's done well, like we talked about earlier, like if the notifications are wanted notifications.  If I worked at the Brickhouse and I got the schedule like, you know, buzzing in my pocket every day that I came into work, that might annoy me.  So but I'm sure there are ways to say like, OK, I got this, you know, don't send this to me again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, you could always just turn off Bluetooth, I suppose.  But that's like an all or nothing approach.  Yeah, because you might want this.  But every time I walk into it, I don't need to know the schedule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I live in the schedule. Right. You live this. You are the schedule, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I live within the schedule. It's OK. You don't need to tell me when I walk in the door.  Yeah, that was my main question is, is like, this is really cool.  And I'm sure that this is something that we're going to see a lot more of kind of this beacon technology.  Thankfully, I beacon, like I said, I beacon hardware.  It doesn't take much for that to also support this Eddie Stone, which is Google's beacon service.  So I'm really anxious to know how intrusive it would be in practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know about intrusiveness, but I'm really I mean, when when they first started talking about this at Google, I was really interested in it because in the in the Bluetooth type,  the notification style is actually really interesting at our maker space.  We're putting together all kinds of different things that people just want to hack on.  One of the ideas that somebody had is, OK, if I'm working on a project, maybe I have a little button I press near where the project is or that represents that project.  And then it tweets out to all the other members of the maker space.  Hey, I'm working on this CNC project right now.  If you want to come join me, you know, come on down and we'll work on it together.  I'm working on a Raspberry Pi project, you know, just because you want to let people know, but you want an easy way to do it.  I don't want to get out my phone. I mean, this seems like something really simple for that.  The other thing that we're working on is when you come in the door, you scan your RFID card and it tells you things like, oh, this is your 100 visit to the maker space.  And you were last working on the blah, blah, blah project and things like that and just some fun things to keep people engaged.  So I'm really interested in learning more about this for sure as it develops, because right now I'm doing all that programming in Python and using JSON and making calls to update, push updates to browsers and things.  Maybe this is an easier way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. This is almost like an automatic QR code.  Yeah, exactly.  That's exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the QR code.  I know. That's what I hear.  Meanwhile, I continue to use QR codes and all that Android.  Sorry. Sorry.  All you QR haters.  So Google Photos.  I don't know if you guys heard about this, but there was kind of a thing that happened over the weekend where somebody had Google Photos app installed for a very brief amount of time, then uninstalled it and noticed a while later that photos were still being uploaded.  Even though the app wasn't installed, it was still syncing photos to the cloud.  Cue hysteria as people claim that Google is doing this on purpose to slurp as much of your data as possible.  And I suppose we don't actually know the answer to that question, but the answer lies in Google Play Services.  So basically what this is is Google Photos was essentially a front end, a conduit for enabling you to use that service of syncing all of your photos to the cloud.  But what it's actually doing is it's actually changing that setting inside Google Play Services, which is a different settings pane on your phone entirely.  So yes, that is pretty darn confusing.  When you uninstall the Photos app, it doesn't automatically deselect the sync.  That's still a service that's running and you have to actually know to turn that off.  So not sure if it was an oversight on Google's part.  Google did say that they're looking to address that and specifically to kind of clarify the communication of that.  Like maybe when you go to uninstall Google Photos, it gives you a notification or something like that.  Although I don't know how it could do that because when you uninstall an app, like I've never uninstalled an app for my app tray and had it like ask me a question before I hit OK.  It just says, do you want to uninstall it? OK.  Yeah, if you can do that, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Photos is a web app, right?  Like you go to photos.google.com and your photos are there.  So, I mean, there's an argument for like, well, this is a setting, whether or not you have this is a system wide setting, whether or not you have the Photos app installed.  But that's a very nuanced like that's not something users should know.  Right.  And it does seem like a prompt, you know, as you uninstall would be appropriate.  But I don't think I've ever seen that either.  So I'm not sure that's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if it is.  I know that there's more to talk about.  We do have to thank another sponsor of today's episodes.  Let's do that real quick and then we can kind of come back.  And I'm curious if there's stuff in here.  We've got a lot that we haven't touched on yet.  So I'll kind of leave it in your hands.

You guys got something you want to talk about?  Is there something in here that's just jumping out at you?  Can we talk about the Commodore Pet?  I wondered if if someone would catch on to that one.  I think we should.  I think it's imperative.  Yeah, so I think we have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I saw this yesterday.  In fact, you may actually may have seen this.  Did you post this yesterday on Google Plus?  I did.  OK, so that's actually where I saw it.  If you love if you're a fan of Commodore 64, just the Commodore company in general, you may want to check out the Commodore Pet.  No, not the old Commodore Pet, the new Commodore Pet.  It's a smartphone coming soon to a store near you, especially if you're in Europe.  I guess Europe's getting them first.  But I guess Commodore or the company that bought the right to use the name Commodore is coming out with a phone and it's a reasonably specced phone.  And they're going to call it the Commodore Pet.  So good for them.  I mean, it made me kind of want to buy one.  It's not a bad looking phone.  If you look at the pictures in the story, this is from a story from Wired did this story, actually.  If you're if you're following along or you want to look it up and they kind of go over the history of Commodore and why they're able to call this a Commodore.  Phone. But you know, it's not it's not a bad phone.  I mean, it's got a Nvidia graphics, iOS 2 graphics, Intel Atom processor, four gigs of RAM, terabyte of storage.  Oh, wait. No, that's the Commodore 64 X.  I was like, wait a second. What?  That's the wrong paragraph.  A terabyte of storage.  Let me go down. Let me go down to the next paragraph where I was supposed to be looking.  Here we go.  Here we go. One point seven gigahertz MediaTek 64 bit octa core processor with a Mali GPU and extra storage, extra storage with a cassette deck with a cassette deck and a cassette deck adapter for an Oxford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you mean micro SD card, then you are correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  300 milliamp battery, 13 megapixel camera with 2.0 f stop aperture and videos up to 1080p.  So it's not like the super high end, but it's a high enough end that I would consider buying it for sure.  It is MediaTek. It is.  MediaTek isn't historically the best.  Not historically the best, but it may work.  OK, now here's the cool part, though. Right.  Here's the cool part. And then I'll let other people jump in because I'm excited about this.  It comes with two Commodore emulators.  Yeah.  Standard on the phone.  So you can emulate Commodore 64 and you can emulate Amiga on the phone when it comes out.  And I think that's just awesome.  I mean, that was like the icing on the cake.  Not only is it called Commodore, but I can actually run Commodore emulators on it.  I think I may have to buy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I mean, mind you, it's not difficult to find Commodore emulators for Android.  Right. You can find it.  You can do that on any phone.  But it's just kind of cool that they're embracing that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how much of this is true.  In the article it says, there are customized versions of these emulators.  And it says the team's also working with unnamed software houses to bring some of the 80s best games on the pet before shipping.  So they may actually run a little better.  I'm wondering about that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because how many of those software houses are still kind of around to work deals with?  Yeah. I mean, this may just be what they're saying publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then behind the scenes, they're just downloading those same emulators that we would download.  And getting the same games from the same websites that we would get them from and just loading them on there.  But still very, very exciting, I think.  Cost on this rumored to be between $300 and $365, depending on if you go with less RAM or more RAM, 16 or 32 gigs of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I think the name is really appealing to me.  Oh, yeah.  I love that they're embracing the emulator side of things.  Because I think it would be in retrospect, knowing that they are doing that, it would be kind of strange if they didn't.  It would be like, OK, so it's a phone with a Commodore logo.  So that kind of makes more sense.  Having said that, I mean, it is just to kind of come back down to earth a little bit.  Commodore today is not the Commodore then.  This is absolutely one of those situations where somebody bought the trademark and is just like, well, let's OK.  Let's just release a phone then with the logo and people are going to love it because of that.  So I totally get it. I kind of feel kind of ridiculous for wanting it because of that.  But at the same time, it does have Commodore on there and I was a Commodore nut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I want the trash 80 phone.  Me too. Me too. I'm right with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish I could get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or no, you know what I want? No, no, I take it all back.  You know what I want? I desperately want.  I want the Osborne One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think what this has made me realize is there is a market for retro machines.  Oh, yeah. But like a phone's built to look like retro machines.  Yeah. Like this kind of needs to happen, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is my my former co-worker Andy Bayo did this talk about how he had a son and his son was four years old and he wanted his son to like experience video games in the same order that he did.  So he bought one of those little handheld controllers that had like Pong and like the certain the first first generation of video games and his son played through those.  And then he got the second generation and he got he got his son basically the games that he played in his lifetime, you know, in the order that he played them.  And it was it was such it was so great.  I think it was a it was a talk.  It's online. But in the video, I saw so many games that like I was like, oh, yeah, I loved adventure.  Like, I remember the way that dragon sounded.  It sounded so good.  But like I was like, I want this right.  But I'm like, I'm not a huge gamer.  I get that there are emulators and then you can download ROMs from somewhere and it's not maybe legal.  I don't even really know how that works or like where I would go get those.  So, I mean, this is kind of like a little bit of a black box for someone like me who like casually games like in the 80s.  You know, I love I love some of the old games, but like didn't you know, I haven't taken the time to set it up or I was amazed when I went on Amazon and found that you could buy like the old Atari.  Controller that just like hooks into your TV and has like a selection of, you know, whatever a Pac-Man and the rest of the games on it.  Like, I just had no idea.  So, I don't know, there might be a market for like an emulator with a bunch of games that you don't have to do anything funky to get set up or download anything.  I don't even know how many people know what an emulator is.  I talked to my siblings, what I gained with as a kid for years and years, and I said, oh, you just you need an emulator for that.  They would be like, right.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think at that point, it's, you know, for for folks like that, it's less about you need an emulator and more like you need that phone that plays those games.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I mean, device that pre-installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'm sitting right next to the to the guy who built a main machine all around emulation, which, by the way, I am following in your footsteps.  And it still continues to scare the living daylights out of me just how much planning and preparation it takes to do this.  It is a lot of work.  Not to mention kind of expensive.  Kind of expensive.  I think I thought it was just going to be this this quick, like, oh, yeah, I'll totally do it.  And it's turned into a deal.  But I'm doing it.  I'm committed to it.  So thank you for your help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's three or four hundred bucks if you want to really do it right.  At least.  And that's assuming that you recycle old equipment and you build the case yourself and you do all this other stuff.  Right.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  What I find interesting about it is and you know, just talking about younger people playing when I brought my the same arcade that I brought here to Twig last time, I brought that down to Maker Faire and the kids are coming up playing it.  And there's two there's a two player system.  So there's two joysticks, two sets of buttons.  But inevitably, the kids that were under I'd say ten, maybe under eleven, they would come up and try to use both joysticks at the same time because they were used to game pads that have to you know, like Xbox and PlayStation that have to to pass.  Oh, it's interesting.  I was like, I was cracking me up, you know, because like, why isn't this working?  Like, doesn't this one do this?  And it's like, no, you just use that one.  And if you're playing Atari, it's just one button.  That's it.  One button.  Don't touch anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is fascinating.  Yeah.  And I do think that there's something to be said.  You can speak to the complications of setting up something like that just from an from a system standpoint, you know, particularly when you're talking about something like MAME.  There are however many thousands of games and they all have different controller maps and different idiosyncrasies that kind of appear.  So having a phone that has that all done for you, has it done value to that?  There is.  There is.  Absolutely.  What else do you guys want to talk about?  What else have we missed that that is kind of burning?  You've done a good job.  Have we done our job?  Cover the basics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is just a quick story.  The fact that Google in Google Drive now you can set you can disable printing, downloading and copying for any file now in Google Drive.  It's just an interesting product thing.  So if you're sharing a document, I've created a document, I'm sharing it with Jason.  I just want him to look at it.  I don't want him to copy it or download it or print it.  I could indicate that.  And I guess I sort of get that.  But it's that weird Snapchat thing where it's like, well, you can't take you know, you can't save this picture or take a screenshot of it.  But of course, anyone could take a photo of the picture or like in this case, take a screen grab or copy and paste.  It's just kind of one of the kind of along the lines of the privacy conversation we're having earlier with photos.  It's like, you know, that that thing of like, this isn't really locking down the file.  It's just making it a little bit harder for someone to to copy it or print it or download it.  But that's a new option in Google Drive.  Now you can prevent that.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not something I had considered needing, but it actually makes perfect sense that you might just want to show somebody.  Yeah, like share.  I don't want you to have any sort of control over it.  Actually, this one I thought was pretty interesting.  It's been three years since Google released its spam statistics for Gmail.  Oh, last week they revealed that the spam rate is now.  Let me make sure this isn't your number.  This isn't your number, right?  No, it's not.  They revealed that the spam number, the spam rate is now down to point one percent in Gmail and they're crediting their neural networks that basically better recognize junk and phishing emails and then dynamically create rules as patterns emerge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If only they would recognize PR people.  That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, fair enough.  But I will say for the most part, I don't know.  I really don't even see it anymore.  It's a lifesaver.  Life saver.  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of crazy.  I get the ones.  I don't know if you guys get these now.  I get a lot of them that have just the subject and the email address and it doesn't even seem like they're trying to mask it.  It's not phishing.  It's just like, you know, call us now to get a new mortgage or something like that.  And it's obviously like an email address is from another country.  But then the emails blank.  I don't know if that's Google, like, you know, taking the body of the email out or if these are just spammers that are really bad.  Yeah, just really bad.  Oh, man, I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was no undue send on that one.  Right.  I was like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, why are you sending me this?  Like, at least try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I read the subject line.  You were halfway there.  I know.  All right. Cool.  Hey, I think we I think we touched on the good stuff here.  Why don't we take a look at some numbers, some tips, some things, all that kind of stuff.  Jeff, do you have a number for us?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I found this interesting.  So, of course, watch out.  Get ready. Put me in the rundown again to fix fix what I'm about to say.  Now I can't.  Now I can't call the story up.  Hold on.  Hold on, folks.  So some a few years ago, 2004, saw Italian research, Swedish team.  I'm sorry, an Italian Swedish research team downloaded data from hundreds of online fetish discussion groups and spent three years analyzing their halls as the Guardian.  Right there.  I'm stopped three years going through this right there.  It's just amazing me.  But they now have a ranking of fetishes because of this.  So I'm sure you can't wait to hear this.  I think I'm scared.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  It's OK.  It's OK.  Many concern body parts, feet and toes lead the list, followed in frequency of order by bodily fluids.  I'll let you fill in those blanks.  Body size and head hair.  The least coveted bits by fetishists are nails, nose, ears, neck.  And in last place, I'm very glad to report body odor.  Other fetishes documented by the center are associated with objects on the body, stockings, skirts, footwear, underwear, the most popular.  It eventually dribbles out with some but few people erotically craving diapers, hearing aids, catheters and dead last.  I'll leave you with this thought.  I don't know.  That's my little statistical fun for the day.  That was a stopper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do we follow this one up?  There is a graphic, a visualization in this article, and I think I'm afraid to click it.  So I'm just going to close the article.  Data.  Okay, there you go.  Jabberbee went where I was afraid to go.  And you can't really see very much.  So, yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually good.  That's a good zoom level right there.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fascinating stuff, though.  I mean, I'm sure there haven't been a whole lot of studies on that to that degree.  So let's see here.  Gina, you got a tip?  I got something.  That has maybe nothing to do with fetishes.  Feast that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really, really boring.  You can look up your local fetish shop.  So my tip is for Google Maps in the browser, when you search for an address, place that you're going later on today.  I do this all the time.  I'm at my desk.  I'm coding, whatever.  I look up a place I need to go in Google Maps in my Chrome browser, and then I leave the house and then I have to look it up again on my phone.  Well, in the card now, I guess this is, I don't know if these are, yeah, it's a card.  I don't know if this is considered knowledge graph.  When you look up an address in Google Maps in your browser on your desktop, there's a new link in the results that says send to device.  You click that.  You can choose one of your Android devices in the list.  In my case, I've got one plus here, and it will send a push notification of the address to your Android device.  And then when you leave the house, you can tap on it.  It opens it up in Maps and you can get directions or navigate or whatever.  Just super handy.  There's tons of ways to send links and map links from the desktop to your phone or to any device.  But I found this one to be really, really, really nice because it's kind of right there in Maps and it opens up and you're right there.  So you know where you're going when you leave your desk.  So that's send to device in Google Maps.  And I think it requires the newest version of Google Maps on your Android device to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I forgot, I didn't hear what you said.  You right click on the pin on your desktop to send it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in the card.  So in the results, you'll have a number of results listed.  And it was one of those white cards shows.  So I looked up Metro Tech, which is a big office building near me here in Brooklyn.  And in the white Google, it's the Google Now card.  I guess it's a Knowledge Graph result.  It gives me directions, save the phone number, the address, and under the address, it says send to device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm having a hard time seeing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I don't click on that first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to look up Twitter and see if I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then your details under details.  If it says sent to device, let's say sent to know it says I can print it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, this is walking directions.  Oh, well, not that.  Yeah, that's probably doesn't matter.  Yeah, no, I'm not seeing it.  Maybe I don't have the latest version of Maps installed.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe or maybe it's rolling out to on the web as well.  And I'm seeing I got the Keller Street address and I see it's got links to save and directions and Twitter TV.  And I have this in open today nine to five.  And then I have the same send to device link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're seeing this from the maps interface or the Google interface in maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so like, yeah, maps on the desktop.  Oh, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I've always done the old you look in your search history.  If you search for something on the desktop and then I pull up my phone and if I click on search  and then it says show your history search history, it should be in there if you're logged in with the same account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's yeah, that's smart.  Android police has a has a screenshot of what it looks like in the in the card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we're showing that earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, no, I'm not seeing that yet.  Anyways, stay tuned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be the latest version of Google Maps installed nine dot one one dot.  Oh, that's cool, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love I love that they're doing more of this integration that I think kind of seemed to start with device manager where you could go on the web and look up all of your devices through the web.  And now they're integrating it into even search to search in general.  You can type in a search.  I think it's find my phone and it'll it'll give you an option to do a pull down to find which phone you're talking about and ring your phone.  Just different things like that.  Integrating that in this is this is awesome.  I'll totally use this.  Great stuff.  All right, Aaron, what's your thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my thing today, usually I bring a project and I've got a project in my bag, but as a backup.  But I thought with all the recent discussion around Reddit and all the kerfuffle going on there, at least for me, it made me go out and look at a few Reddit alternatives.  I went out and looked at vote VOAT.  If you're not familiar with that.  That was one that a lot of people were recommending.  But then another one that's still kind of in beta.  And in fact, you have to get an invitation to use it is called Snap Zoo.  Has anyone used Snap Zoo at all?  No, no.  APZU SNAPZU.  This one came up and I thought, well, check it out.  It looks pretty cool.  One of the things that is cool about this is when you look at it at first, it likes, well, yeah, it's kind of a prettier looking Reddit.  But then there's a button.  And John, I don't know if you can click.  There should be a mag button.  Do you see the mag view button?  Watch the magic happen.  So now you have a magazine style Reddit that still has the vote up and vote down buttons on it.  But it's prettier to look at.  I really prefer this view, maybe because I'm used to Google+.  But I really like this this view of of browsing Reddit type content, especially if I'm using a desktop or a PC as opposed to using my phone.  This works really, really well.  I found the content to be pretty cool.  But they have a number of features that make this a real contender if you've never tried it.  One of the things that they do besides just the magazine front end, they have a leveling system for users where you collect experience points for contributing and being active within the community.  So, you know, if this person posted it and their XP is, you know, this, wow, they're really like experienced users.  And people trust that person to post really good content.  They also have similarly a reputation system.  They have a they call it they call their subreddits tribes, but they have a tribe mastery.  So, like, if you are really well known for posting good content in technology, for example, your it'll show your tribe mastery and technology is really high.  And if you don't post a lot of cat content, I mean, who doesn't?  Everybody does. Right.  But let's just imagine that you don't post a lot of cat content.  Your cat tribe mastery level will be low.  So people can look at your profile if you want them to and say, oh, this guy really knows his stuff and technology.  Another thing you can do that's really cool is for content.  I've been frustrated with this before, both on Google Plus and Reddit.  You go to post a picture of something, but then you can't also post a link to something else or a video that goes along with it or some additional content that you can post.  Maybe it's a PDF you want them to download.  They actually when you submit content, you can create multiple content entries.  So you post the picture, but then you also post the link to the website, the file to download, the whatever.  And it all when you pull up the article, all those things come up and not only you can do that, but other people can add to that header of the article to say, OK, I posted this picture.  And then someone can put a link to where to buy that particular item or something like that.  So it's some really cool stuff that they've added to this.  You can follow certain users and things like that.  It really is a pretty good system.  I found and I hope I wish them all the best.  It seems like Reddit's kind of figured out what's going on over there a little bit.  It seems like users are finally over all that mess that happened.  I know I've been going back to Reddit now and kind of browsing at Reddit, but I'm still keeping my eye on SnapZoo for sure, because it's a really, really cool.  They've added a lot of really functional things to the whole Reddit up vote, down vote concept that I think could go a long way, especially if there's another problem over at Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of prime prime time for someone to slip in and for sure and throw Reddit off the throne.  Yeah, we are witnessing the rapid demise of Reddit and literally in a few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was really wondering whether that was going to be the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back.  But it looks like they might be in for one more straw.  Just one more.  One more straw.  I think it's all over.  Just keep in mind SnapZoo is invite only.  You just go to the site, say I want an invite, and especially if you tweet about them, they're using that as a promotional tool.  So if you tweet about them, they'll send you your invite and you'll get in right away.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cool.  Very nice.  Very neat.  SnapZoo.  S-N-A-P-Z-U.  Sorry for that, not Z-O-O.  My pick, if you want to call it that, is actually something that you, I guess you could do yourself because it's open to everybody, but it's intended for kids.  Google has a summer camp for your kids.  It's virtual, of course, and it's free.  Google Camp, it's called Camp Google.  It actually began a couple of days ago, July 13th.  It runs through August 7th.  It's aimed at kids 7 to 10, but it's open to kids of all ages.  And basically Google teamed up with Khan Academy, National Park Service, National Geographic Kids, and NASA for the sessions and activities that they'll go through during this camp.  Every week is a different theme.  So one week is ocean, the next week space, nature, and also music.  And basically there's interactive live streams that kind of focus on the themes, activities, lessons with instructions, and a supplies list so that the kids can kind of be active and involved in learning about the theme.  Learning about this kind of stuff.  Gamification, things like badges for achievements and all that kind of stuff.  And then all the lessons are archived in case they miss a day.  And instead of going outside and playing, they want to learn.  Here you go.  It's Camp Google.  And I don't know.  I think it's kind of neat and it's free.  So if you want to point your kid to something to keep them occupied and make them even smarter than they already are, they should check that out.  So look for Camp Google.  I think this is great.  I think this is really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And not to detract from this, but there's also Make Magazine does MakerCamps.  And what they do is they partner with Makerspaces.  So it's not just the online, but you can actually, if you have a Makerspace near you that's supporting it, you can actually go in.  What they'll do is they'll do the streaming video and stuff.  And then a lot of Makerspaces will have a project to do that relates to that day's particular lesson.  We're going to be doing that next year at our Makerspace.  And this seems like a similar program.  So I think it's great that people are taking advantage of the power of the Internet to make these things possible for kids to do during the summer.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  All right.  We survived.  We did it.  Nice job, Jason.  Oh, we.  Good job us.  We made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We didn't have a technical director before today's show began because normally I do that.  And apparently we didn't figure that out.  So, John, thank you so much for stepping in.  Really appreciate it.  And thanks to you guys for backing me up here.  I guess we'll start with you, Jeff.  Jeff, what you got going on?  Obviously you are the author of Geeks Bearing Gifts.  What public parts?  Plug moment here.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Plug away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll probably do it a lot better than I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing much to do.  I did an audio version of Geeks Bearing Gifts out soon.  And if you're in media, if you're really wonky, check out my blog.  We have an event coming up on membership in media.  I said that's really, really wonky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a couple of things, a couple of things going at the moment.  But if you're wondering what the last thing I released is some new features in ThinkUp,  which I hope folks will check out.  Go to ThinkUp.com.  It's social media analytics for regular people.  And we just added support for Instagram so you can see your best photos of the week, month, year,  who your biggest fans are.  And we also added search.  You can search your followers' profiles for what company they work for,  what kind of skills they have.  So go check it out.  It's free trial.  No credit card required.  That's ThinkUp.com.  And yeah, in a couple of weeks, I'll have something new that will be open to the public.  So yeah, MakerBase, as I mentioned before, is invite only still.  Yes, we're still handing out invites slowly, but I've been hacking on that every day.  And yeah, next time you see me, I'll be talking more about that.  So that is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So with the inclusion of MakerBase, does that just like double the amount of work you have now?  You were focused on one and now you're focused on two.  Is your life okay?  Is your life balance okay right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's okay.  It's okay.  I try to follow my muse and work on the thing that's kind of got me the most excited.  So I go back and forth and then I collapse at the end of the day, like you, Jason.  I know you've had a really busy few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been busy.  But I have PTO this weekend for a week, so I've got something to look forward to.  That's a big reason why it's been so busy,  because it turns out when you're taking a week off, it's not like you don't do that work.  You just do it before you leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or after you get back.  Yeah, or after you get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Oh, really?  Yeah, you can take a look at that post.  I actually got one of the old yellow phones and put it in my kitchen and got it all wired up.  We have the opposite problem of like, you know, always have your phone out.  I mean, that still happens.  But we have those like wireless or cordless phones all around the house,  and they're like in all the seat cushions.  No one knows where they are.  So I said, screw it.  I'm going to get an old style phone, put it on the wall.  It's always there.  It's always there.  Where you expect to find it.  Everyone will know where it is.  That's hilarious.  It rings really loud when the phone rings.  It's like, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So nothing really beats an analog ringer.  Nothing beats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  The old style ring.  It actually has a bell inside that rings.  That's awesome.  Anyway, so that's the kind of stuff you can follow if you follow me on Google+.
