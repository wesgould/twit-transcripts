I only said that Gina because I don't, do you know where Jeff is?  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's on vacation in Florida, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the cover story.  He's on vacation in Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even Jarvis takes a vacation every once in a while, which is, which is heartening, you  know, for the rest of us.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very weird to be here without Jeff and Leo, but I am so psyched about the panel that  we have today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, thanks for not making up an excuse to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really have to go to like Alabama.  Sorry, I'm out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we got some great folks joining us on the show today.  Kevin Purdy, author of The Complete Android Guide and a forthcoming book, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, indeed.  I am working on a book about Google+.  Excellent.  So for O'Reilly and due out probably long after it should be, but you know, working  on it now and enjoying it very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also joining us, former CNET-er.  We worked at CNET together now working at Paid Content covering mobile, mobile editor  Tom Krasik.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, thanks for having me.  You just confused Gina and Kevin by having two Toms on the show as well.  Confusing me.  I don't know who I am anymore.  Let's start off with your column that you wrote for Paid Content.  Why Google is right, yet short-sighted to complain about mobile patents.  Give us a summary of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think one of the biggest stories in mobile technology over the last  six months or so has been these patents.  You know, the way that, you know, both big companies are asserting them against other  companies, mostly Android partners.  But then also, you know, you see the companies like Lodzis and, you know, the patent trolls  of the world, you know, sort of making their voices heard as well.  So I, you know, was trying to sort of, this was also in the light of Microsoft and Google's  little public spat that they had a couple weeks ago where they had the, you know, Google  accused Microsoft of acting against, you know, Android partners and, you know, trying to  compete in the courtroom and not the marketplace.  And, you know, Microsoft fired back and then Google fired back at that.  And then, you know, it just sort of gets to be kind of silly at a while.  But I think I, you know, was really wondering sort of how to express, you know, the fact  that Google's right.  The patent system is messed up.  It's not, you know, there's a lot of patents out there that shouldn't have been awarded  in the first place.  And it's hard for companies to, you know, sometimes know exactly how they're treading  on these patents that shouldn't be out there.  And then they're also silly to complain about this kind of thing because they have to go  out and go get the same patents anyway.  I mean, you know, they're really complaining about the fact that they lost out on an opportunity  to get patents that they then called bogus.  So it's kind of, it's a weird dilemma for them.  They know the system is messed up, but they have no choice but to play the game, you know,  during the weeks and months ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should they be spending more time lobbying the government trying to change patent law?  It seems like that's what Eric Schmidt is supposed to be doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's, I guess, his job now.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I think they can do that, you know, but I don't think, you know, it's  pretty clear the government has a lot of things on its mind right now.  And I don't know if patent reform is necessarily that high on that list these days.  So you know, I think that Google should be doing as much as they can to try to highlight  this issue.  And I think that a lot of people are trying to highlight this issue as well.  But you know, it's going to take a long time.  I mean, there's a patent bill that's about to go through.  The government has said he will sign it, but it doesn't quite go far enough towards  addressing a lot of these issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's already been passed in the Senate House just needs to be reconciled.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so, you know, that will help in some ways and may make things worse in other ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seems pretty toothless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it really is.  It doesn't get at the heart of the problem, which is the fact that a lot of these patents  should have never been issued in the first place.  The patent office is hopelessly underwater with applications that grow over a year.  They don't have a ton of people working there.  I think their budget for 2011 was what Google made in profits last quarter.  So you sort of get a sense of where the priorities are in the government towards these things.  And I mean, Google can lobby and they can complain and they can raise a fuss and all  of that.  And people can go, yeah, you're right.  But it's going to take a lot more than complaining to actually get something done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tom, you pointed out that Google's in a really tough position with their IPO filing.  I think you mentioned that they even said one of the lines they used was we are not  a conventional company.  And now they're being forced to fight this kind of conventional fight that Apple, Microsoft  and other firms are so used to fighting with big stockpiles of patents.  Do you think that Google's just kind of pinched by its own image a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think that a lot of those things in that founders letter have come back to  haunt them over the years.  And it's, you know, they had the best of intentions, of course, when they set out to do it.  Once you get to be a big company like the size of Google, you don't have really a choice  but to engage in a lot of things that a 24-year-old Larry and Sergey probably would have thought  were pretty reprehensible.  There's just no choice.  There's no choice for Google if it wants Android to continue to succeed but to get involved  with this mobile patent scheme.  I mean, let's call it what it is.  So I think that they...  It's going to be very interesting to see what Larry decides to do now that it's pretty clear  that they didn't address it as much over the last couple of years.  And now that he's running the show, it's going to be interesting to see what they do.  They may wind up having to spend billions and billions of dollars to get patents that  may not be valid, which is insane.  But here we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, what do you think?  Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it seems like the issue of patents has come up for independent developers and  smaller developers in the last few years because we have so many platforms which you can release  apps and the lots of issues.  And I feel like Google's making very strong public statements about how broken the system  is and what they're doing to try to protect consumers from the costs that could trickle  down to them if they lose these battles.  But I think they're trying to really rally the troops.  I mean, I think there are a lot of developers who are much more aware than ever how broken  the system is.  And I think that that's part of their...  I think that they have to both complain about the system but work within it to protect consumers.  And if they position themselves as saying, we're trying to protect consumers and make  it so that you don't have to pay an extra $20 or whatever it would be on the handset  to buy all the licenses you need to in order to get Android, which is just now free, but  also say these are bogus and this is broken and we need to redo this.  I mean, I just I would love to see more initiatives like Peer to Patent where patent applications  are public for companies of interest, for everyone to review and discuss and make recommendations  about whether or not the application should be granted.  I mean, the system just has to be overhauled.  And the Patent Office can get companies and experts and people who work in these areas  to offer support and their thoughts about whether or not a patent should be granted.  I don't know what we do about the already granted bogus patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, earlier this week, Mark Cuban wrote a post saying, let's get rid of software patents  and process patents particularly.  And he thinks that will take the burden off the Patent Office, make things cheaper, encourage  innovation.  Is that the silver bullet?  Has Cuban got the answer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it would be nice if it were that easy to do.  But there are legitimate patents.  I mean, this is part of the problem is that in patenting a lot of these things, you don't  necessarily know which ones are valid and which ones aren't until you litigate it,  until you actually get into a courtroom and figure out what the claims cover or the Patent  Office reexamines it, which doesn't happen.  The patents involved in the Blackberry case, remember that way back when?  NTP just this month won an appeal of the reexamination process for that.  So that was five years ago or so.  And they were first litigated 10 years ago.  And the Patent Office may just get around to doing a final reexamination of them sometime  later this year.  Ten years.  So it's kind of, you know, it'd be nice to just throw everything out and start over.  That's not necessarily going to be in the best interest of a lot of smaller companies  who have legitimate innovations and patented them to try to protect their business.  And we need to figure out something to protect those people as well.  I don't know if it's copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And do you think that there needs to be software patents then to protect software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, that's sort of the broader question.  Software is an art.  It needs to be protected in some way.  You can't have, you don't want it to just be open to anybody.  I don't think anybody's really saying that.  But how do you go about doing it?  Do you have some sort of copyright system?  Do you have some sort of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and there is a copyright system.  That's what Cuban argues.  Copyright already protects you from people just imitating your stuff.  So why do we need patents for things that are obvious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, because not everything is obvious, right?  I mean, the iPhone's obvious now.  Was it obvious in 2006?  Maybe it was.  But Apple went out and changed the way that we look at mobile technology.  So you know, sometimes patents...  This is the hard part, is that sometimes patents are justified and sometimes they're not.  And so how do you...  I mean, I think the answer is better examination of patents in the first place, stronger review,  stronger tests.  You know, actually look for prior art instead of, you know, stamping the thing and throwing  it in the next pile on your desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, Gina and Jeff and I talked about this last week, the idea of software patents.  What do you think about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's funny that if you read through Tom's article and also listen to the most  recent This American Life episode, which was called When Patents Attack, it's a really  heated war that nobody wants to be in.  Engineers, you know, the companies themselves, obviously, as Tom's article points out, the  folks who work at the patent office don't want to be in that game anymore.  It's a really heated issue around something that almost universally, you know, most folks,  except for maybe the rare small, you know, innovator who does need patent protection.  It's a fight that nobody really wants to be in, but it's getting increasingly violent  and heated.  It's a really strange story when you think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More and more, I'm of the opinion, and maybe I got swayed a little bit by Cuban's editorial,  that where software is a mathematical equation, right?  I mean, that's all software really is at base.  It's a set of equations, and equations cannot be patented.  I think there are maybe some exceptions to that where software could need a patent, but  if we just kind of enshrine that and say the burden, the assumption is that software isn't  patentable until you can show otherwise, that could solve a lot of problems.  And I think we're seeing a couple of examples of why copyright and trademark might be all  the protection you need.  Apple won a ruling in Germany that blocks the Samsung Galaxy Tab from being sold anywhere  in Europe except for the Netherlands based on community design.  So that's based on trademark.  The look of it has nothing to do with patents, and they filed to target the Motorola Zoom  in that same German court.  Now this is the East Texas of Europe, this court.  They're very friendly to plaintiffs in this sort of thing.  But this is not patents.  This is Apple saying, look, if it looks too much like our trademark, then they can't sell  it.  And again, it's preliminary injunction and has yet to be determined fully in the courts,  but it's an example of not needing patent law to help defend yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One thing that really bugged me about that Samsung thing that I just have to point out  is Samsung did not get a chance to defend itself against that order.  They basically found out about it when it happened.  So they didn't get a chance to argue their case, which is kind of insane to me, but that  sort of speaks to how competing in different parts of the world with different standards  for patent or design or trademark or whatever can really complicate your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think most people who looked at the Motorola Zoom and the iPad side by side would feel  like it was a compliment to the Zoom to say it's too much like the iPad to exist in Germany.  I like the Zoom, it's good for what it is, but it almost feels like Apple shouldn't even  say that in court.  They shouldn't legally say that, oh yeah, this is a very similar product to our iPad  too.  Seems strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I can see the argument for the tab, right Gina, but maybe not the Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, not the Zoom.  So we're talking about the hardware design, right?  That's what we're talking about, not the software.  Yeah, they're pretty different.  I mean, can you, I don't know, I have trouble with that.  Can you say that I'm going to, you know, we own the design for what's basically just a  slab of, you know, touchscreen?  You know, I don't know.  I mean, I guess that the tab is a lot like the iPad.  The shape is different.  The weight is different.  The camera, I mean, maybe I'm splitting hairs, but I suppose I can kind of see the similarity  with the tab, but the Zoom, absolutely not.  That seems crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if I make a knockoff iPad, right, then we would think it's obvious, like, oh, you  can't make something that looks just like the iPad.  So where do you draw the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if something would have to look just like the iPad, for me it would have to be  the same size, the same orientation with the one button in terms of hardware, and then  the software would have to also look the same.  I mean, I saw a skin, at one point we covered a story where they're involved in Android  skin that looked, I mean, it really looked like iOS, the software itself.  I mean, so if you had those two things together, I would say, okay, this is clearly just mimicking  every single little bit about it, but the tab just seems like a good tablet with minimal,  you know, buttons and hardware on it.  And the hardware that does have the camera and the front-facing button, they're different  than the iPad.  Again, though, maybe I'm splitting hairs, and maybe I'm arguing, you know, for the thing  I just argued against, which is that patents are bogus and these very subtle differences  don't count as innovations.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is definitely a topic that's going to continue to be debated and acted upon.  And it's one of those weird things where it feels like nobody who's involved in this,  except maybe the companies like Loadsys that are strictly benefiting off of owning patents,  nobody really wants to be involved with this.  It's sort of a necessary evil for business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't think Microsoft is too concerned about being involved with this.  I mean, I think they know exactly what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they don't want to have to have a bunch of lawyers hired to constantly acquire patents  and defend themselves, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why not?  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make enough money.  Yeah, all right.  As long as it's a profitable business center, I guess they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  And I mean, it also sort of, you know, reinforces the fact that Microsoft can say that we continue  to be an innovative company.  And it's very important to Microsoft to continue to be seen as a company that's on the forefront  of computing, which is a charge that they have to defend themselves against quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's move on into some Android news.  Google is retiring Android app inventor, but in Google fashion, open sourcing the code.  Gina, have you been following this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have.  You know, it's sad.  And I actually am of two minds about this.  I mean, there are a lot of teachers that this app was very popular in education.  There are a lot of high school teachers who are introducing students to app development  using this app.  I use this app.  I made a Valentine app for my wife last February 14th.  Ladies.  You used app inventor?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Was it just because it was faster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I did it because I just I wanted to see what it was like, what the experience  was like.  And I thought it would just be cool to get, you know, a kitten to meow when you tap it,  which is basically the Hello World example in app center.  And it was really good.  Now, I develop Android apps like using like Java with actual source code.  So it was cool to see the WYSIWYG interface.  And you know, as a developer, I tend to look at these tools and think these are cool.  But the reality is you hit a wall.  There's a point at which you just can't do the things you can do if you're using raw  code.  All these frameworks and and kind of pre-made WYSIWYG tools are great, but they're ultimately  they're limited and they're not based pretty much not going to create an app that you're  really going to release in the market and get great sales on.  The community builder in me says that people, new developers who are interested in platforms  need a quick win, right?  They want they want to just work their way through a tutorial and have a Hello World  working and App Inventor is a great way to do that.  So I'm sad that they're discontinuing it.  I think it's great that it's going open source.  There's no reason why someone can't take over this project and keep it going and have it  still available.  Google doesn't have doesn't have to be the one taking care of it.  The way I feel about it is if Google has a choice between allocating resources towards  shipping ice cream sandwich or maintaining App Inventor, give me sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's that's kind of what what has been going on, right?  Is is Larry Page has said, let's focus.  Let's let's get rid of some of these distractions that we've had.  You know, it's been great to experiment and branch out and see what sticks, but it's time  to to focus in on stuff.  And that is that is the other story here.  Lance Whitney over at CNET reporting that Google trying to rush to get ice cream sandwich  out and beat iPhone 5.  We still don't know when iPhone 5 is coming out.  We know it's coming out in the fall.  We know they're in beta five for it.  IOS 5 is in beta, but we don't know anything about the hardware.  So is it a good is it a good thing for for Google to rush or should they take their time  and get it right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They should take their time and get it right.  It is the most important release of Android.  I'm fine saying that and quote me on it.  It's the most important release of Android they're going to do, because if you look at  the widespread, you know, the number of different versions people could be running now.  And if you look at the differences between Android 3 or 3.1 on the tablet and and 2.2  or 2.3 on the phone, the ice cream sandwich is meant to merge them together and give phones  a little bit of the sci-fi techie look of the tablets and tablets a little bit more  usability.  So it's the most important release they're going to do.  And I I really don't think anyone's going to I don't feel like new versions of Android  get enough press play or enough public attention that someone's going to base their decision  on this.  Like if you know everyone knows the iPhone, you know, obviously they will argue in court  that they've spent all this marketing time and effort making it a public brand.  So if you know the iPhone, it doesn't seem like you're going to walk into a store, be  like, I don't know, iPhone 5 or ice cream sandwich.  It doesn't seem like that type of thing.  Like it doesn't seem like the public knows enough about versions that they need to get  it out there in front of the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if ice cream sandwich gets out there first and has all of these great features, they  may go into a store and say, oh, I want that Android phone that has X, Y and Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What you mean to say is that when they get ice cream sandwich out there first on one  phone on one carrier through Best Buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  I mean, how long will it take for the phones out there to get ice cream sandwich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to take a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's the same as the iPhone's going to be on one phone.  It's one phone iPhone 5 available at Best Buy and Apple stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And two of the world, two of the US's biggest carriers.  And, you know, it's hence the rush.  This is a large store full of straw men we're talking about now.  Yeah, yeah.  But no, it's I think they really should take their time because it's, you know, if the  rumors are right, it'll be coming out on the Nexus Prime, which is the next Samsung  phone.  And they should take their time to make sure that it's a well-crafted product that doesn't  lend itself to arguments about, you know, this phone's available on this carrier with  this version, you know, versus otherwise.  They should really try to bring everything under the big tent and spend their time making  it smooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Android team should learn from past mistakes.  Honeycomb was a rush job to compete with the iPad.  Ice cream sandwich should not be a rush job to compete with the iPhone.  It should just be a good job.  That's what I'm hoping.  That's what I'm hoping for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And ice cream sandwich to me, the big advantage is that it's one operating system,  tablet and phone.  And again, like you were saying, Kevin, just about ice cream sandwich in general, that's  not something your average consumer is going to care one whit about when they walk into  a store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if they could, if that average customer could, you know, travel a few states over  to visit their relatives and show their Android phones and their phones looked roughly the  same right now, you know, if I have a Evo on Sprint and I show it to someone who's running,  you know, the Samsung TouchWiz interface, it doesn't look anything, you know, to the  average consumer, they look like two completely different phones.  So if they can get that kind of platform consistency, that would be really nice.  And that would actually give them a pretty good competitive standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  GigaOM reporting on an interesting bug in Google+.  It's kind of convoluted, but essentially there is a way if you're sharing a computer with  someone that your IMs can end up in their Google Plus account.  And let me see if I can get this right.  Good luck.  The way Janko Rutgers over at GigaOM explains it, let's say Peter logs into Gmail and G+,  leaves both windows open on his computer, hands his computer to Mary.  And then Mary, you know, she logs into her Gmail, but leaves his Google Plus open, then  closes the browser window she used and hands the computer back to Peter.  Apparently Google Plus, while it's sitting there in a window that Mary's not using, will  notice that Mary logged into Google Talk when she was on Gmail and connect to Mary's IM.  And then when those browser windows are closed, she'll hand that computer back to Peter.  He'll find out that he still logged into Mary's Google Talk account, but it's still his Google  Plus page because she never used the Google Plus page.  So in other words, the G Talk account logs in on the Google Plus page without logging  him out of the Google Plus page because you get two different elements there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then Richard walks in with an electromagnetic pulse device and boom!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then Bob pops up and says, I'm the man in the middle.  I still owe your data anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So basically they're saying Google Talk floats between accounts.  If you change browser's tabs too quickly, Google Talk could be tied to the wrong account  and float from one browser tab to the other basically.  And if your Wi-Fi goes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But your Wi-Fi has to go out and the ping has to have not updated in the time that Wi-Fi  came back in and logged out.  It's a really obscure...  So much to do the odds on that one.  Yeah, what are the odds on that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a widespread security vulnerability.  And it's actually pretty easy to avoid, which is before you hand your computer over to somebody,  close all of your windows and log out of it.  I mean, not even just close all your windows, log out.  Log out of your account.  I mean, you should be doing that anyway, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty basic security.  If you don't want someone to see what you're doing, don't hand your computer to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But one thing with Google Talk is that you can call people from it and you can do video  chats with it.  So you could, you know, the only danger is that you could like, one of the dangers is  you could prank call somebody from someone's Google Talk account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also another thing is if Mary goes to a different computer and logs in, any IM Mary sends from  a different device would get relayed to Peter's computer if he leaves her logged into his  Google Talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Peter and Mary don't like each other very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not after this, because he's going to find out all kinds of things he didn't know and  that's going to end their relationship.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Suddenly suspicious spouses are rigging up those holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here, just use my computer.  Don't touch Google Plus though.  And drop your Wi-Fi connection.  Yeah, Google Spokesperson said that it looks like a rare bug, but it is being addressed.  So even if you are, even if you're like one of the people out there that like, no, this  is exactly the problem I face every day.  Hopefully they'll fix it soon.  Good news for Google and for Gmail.  Search and email still the top activities.  According to a Pew survey conducted in May, 92% of online adults use search engines to  hunt for information on the web and 59% do so on any given day.  Not a big surprise here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not really.  I mean, was Netflix and porn in the survey?  I mean, this doesn't surprise me.  It's funny how those are never included.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buy a Prado.  Go to a social network, get news.  Those are some of the other things showing up in the top.  Yeah, they didn't say anything about Netflix and porn particularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The growth in the social network usage though, I mean, is obviously what has everyone excited  about all of that.  I mean, it's mainstream now and it really can't be ignored and that's something Google  is obviously addressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google now in the game.  Social network rising would have been a threat to Google in this story six months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they have a good product, but are they in the game?  I mean, how many people, you know, Facebook has what, 750 million people and counting,  you know, so.  I didn't say they were winning the game.  I guess they are in it now.  Without a doubt, Google Plus is the best thing they've produced from a social standpoint  ever.  I mean, I think that's pretty non-controversial.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's canonical.  Yeah.  Any buzz and an eight wave.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're safe to write a book on it.  Oh, that's not nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, knock on wood.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to curse you there.  Inside joke, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Inside joke.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a good punchline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It makes everybody laugh.  It's good.  I'm secure in myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Web developer and self-proclaimed happiness evangelist.  I would like that job.  Francois Buford shared a new video.  This was on ReadWriteWeb, of a touch interface for Google's Chrome browser currently in development.  So does this in some way imply that we get a Chrome OS tablet?  Is this another piece of evidence for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have always heard, every Google I have ever talked to has said Chrome OS is for devices  with a keyboard.  They've been pretty insistent about that, yeah.  Yeah, they've been pretty clear about this.  I mean, this seems like an experimental thing.  It's interesting that the demo video is using a mouse and not an actual finger.  I don't know.  This seems like kind of an experiment.  I couldn't tell if Francois is a Googler or what.  How did he get this?  I couldn't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems Chromium related.  It seems like he lives in the Chromium open source version of Chrome.  That makes sense, yeah.  That does make sense.  There's a lot of...  The mockups for Chrome OS when they first showed up on the web were very different than  what Chrome is now, which is almost nothing.  It's just a browser with tabs.  The early mockups on the Chromium world showed front row style fades and a kind of big background  and stuff like that.  It turned out totally different.  Things that show up in the Chrome world don't necessarily always make it to market, so to  speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Just because it's showing up for Chrome browser doesn't mean it shows up for Chrome OS necessarily,  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  But it's not a bad idea.  If there's going to be that much momentum behind tablets, then why not have a...  Google's vision of the world is that we all sort of go more towards this web OS concept  anyway.  You might as well see if it can make it work on a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually my dream that he had with the Crunchpad, the Ilgan Crunchpad, that they  just say a piece of glass that has a browser.  That's all he wanted.  This would be it, basically, if it really existed.  That's true.  You should have gotten a patent on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feels like web apps are, in general, adapting a more touch-friendly interface.  We're just recently sort of a little more spread out, no matter whether you're accessing  it in a browser or on a tablet.  So it just feels like the touch interface, like larger, easier to find, you know, tap  targets are just sort of generally a design theme right now, which I think is definitely  a good thing.  So this seems like a Chrome experiment.  I don't know.  I don't know if we're ever going to see this.  Maybe they'll make a tablet that you can dual boot Chrome or Android for the Uber nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, somebody could make that.  They could make that right now if they wanted to, especially if they got ahold of this interface.  That's true.  It's not with outside the realm of possibility.  I just don't know if Google wants to have that kind of brand confusion.  Which Google tablet should I buy?  Is it the Android one?  Is it the Chrome OS?  Up to now, I think the reason that they have been so insistent of the separation is because  they want to avoid that and say Chrome OS is a thing.  It's a laptop of its own.  We don't have Android laptops, at least none that we advertise and support officially,  and we don't have Chrome OS tablets.  And we're trying to keep that straight because otherwise it is pretty confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  And I honestly don't think this will ever get to consumers.  I wouldn't be surprised if this came out as a kind of fun nerdy project.  We hack this open source version of Chromium onto your tab and see what it's like.  But I very much doubt Chrome OS has been a productivity machine.  And honestly, to be productive, you need a full keyboard.  The iPads and tablets in general are consumption devices.  They play games, you watch movies, that kind of thing.  So I think this is cool, but I'd be very surprised if it went anywhere beyond just a geeky open  source project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And actually the Android browser on their tablets is pretty Chrome-like as it is.  It's not exactly Chrome, but it's close to it.  So it seems like a weird thing to have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another Chromebook news though.  Three months after being promised at Google I.O., Netflix streaming comes to the Chromebook.  And if you're wondering why didn't they have it, I watch Netflix on my Chrome browser,  it's because the DRM implementation of Netflix required some tweaking in Chrome OS.  But Samsung Series 5, Acer AC700 and the CR-48s all can access Netflix.  So what I'm wondering is when you go onto Virgin America and you rent the Chromebook,  can you use the GoGo Wireless to watch your Netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, I think it would be a little slow.  Also everybody on the plane would hate you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well yeah, because everybody else's bandwidth would grind to a halt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think media companies would be falling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just that you can get through Veronica Mars.  How did you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You think the media companies would be falling all over themselves to do streaming on something  like a Chromebook.  You can't install anything on it.  So the problem of actually sharing files goes away.  You think they'd really want to push that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are no files essentially.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ooh, I like that idea.  Not for me, but I think that's true.  You think that it would be Hulu too.  I hope Hulu comes over to the Chromebook very soon.  It's kind of there, but kind of wonky.  It needs to be smoothed out quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then we've got this infographic from GigaOM in here that compares Netflix with Comcast,  US subscribers in the millions, and just shows visually how Netflix is catching up from Q109  through Q211 to the point where Netflix actually surpassed Comcast in US subscribers in Q2  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It must have been the Twitch sponsorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It must have been Netflix.com slash twit where you get a 30 day free trial.  It definitely must have been.  That was seamless.  That's the only thing I could think of that would explain it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I honestly don't think that that's what pushed it ahead.  But yeah, it's sort of unbelievable.  But yet this is why you have so much enmity against Netflix right now, especially from  the cable companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But did you see those revenue numbers?  That made me really sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netflix had revenue of 2.16 billion in 2010 and 770 million in Q2 of 2011.  So the revenue is going the wrong way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  But no, wait.  It's 2010 in total, all four quarters.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, it's going the right way.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just one quarter of their year.  One quarter versus all of 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a poorly drawn infographic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  Because that big film canister makes it look like, yeah, but it is just one quarter, 770  million.  So all right.  They also have 61% of the digital movie market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's amazing. Netflix is an amazing company.  They're doing incredible.  I mean, the service they provide is well, all right.  I'll stop making this sound like a commercial.  I really do love Netflix.  You started it.  Yeah, sorry.  I'm going to shut up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but yeah, I mean, you know, and if you're curious, there's some curious numbers in these  things as usual.  30% of all Netflix traffic is on a PlayStation 3 versus 25% on an Xbox 360 and just about  20% on a PC.  So people watching it on their televisions and watching it through PS3 more than Xbox  360, which is odd to me because PS3 and Wii went through that period where you had to  order the disc before you could install it.  And it was kind of a barrier whereas Xbox just kind of got it natively in the OS update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's crazy.  Does that correspond with Xbox versus PS3 sales in general in market share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so, no.  Yeah.  I'm eyeballing it, but Xbox has been leading the PS3 in sales for so much that I would  think that that was the case.  I don't know what the install based numbers are though.  That's an interesting question.  All right, let's say, well, we sort of just took a break for a commercial, so let's just  keep moving on.  Netflix.com slash twit 30 days free.  You heard it here first, tell a friend.  And I just have a note about Google Plus that we must play this video from Eileen and I  haven't had a chance to actually view it.  So I hope it's safe for work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's safe for work.  I think Gina has asked me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, did you put this in?  I did.  So is there a setup to this or should we just go in cold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about Google Plus.  It's Google Plus related.  It's kind of a goofy video.  It'll be fun.  I'm going to listen to it and watch.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Checking the email, got an invite to a website I don't know.  Looked like Google Buzz at first sight, but my friend said not to know.  Why did we need another social network?  Doesn't Facebook work all right?  A new thing for me to learn.  This could take all night.  Damn it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What is this Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't need Google Plus.  There's another plus one and another plus one.  What is this Google Plus?  Hey, what's this red thing here?  Go wait Google Plus.  They want me to put my friends in circles, but circles are for squares.  Every day is like Sophie's choice, trying to choose which friend goes where.  When her parents or her boyfriends can't get in without invites.  And when I drunkenly post it, he's cute.  I can edit it later than night.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoa.  I kind of like Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't believe I'm on Google Plus.  Oh, another hangout and another hangout.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I dig my Google Plus.  Hey, all the high school friends, you can't turn my Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Friends had me without me adding them.  That feature's really nice.  Rando's ugly's my popular and all these friends I've never liked.  No one knows my circle name, so even good friends get hand picked.  Did you make it into my main beat or are you in my circle of...  Whoops.  I'm in love with Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She means circle of people who cut themselves accidentally with a pin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's another douchebag and another loser that didn't make my Google Plus.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey, now I'm a fascist pig.  Thank you, Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who made that? Where'd that come from?  Is that just a college humor type of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google wishes they made it.  Somewhere Freddie Mercury is shaking his head.  Yeah, he is. He's rolling over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to subject to all that, but the names of her circles were priceless.  The Mouth-Breather, the Trump films, never really liked you anyway.  I kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was Jeff in the chat room who was like,  oh my god, this thing has been posted so many times on Google Plus.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know on Google Plus I saw somebody say,  this is the eleventh time I've watched this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was my favorite part of the whole thing,  when she's like, you can't join my Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no parents and bosses yet. I like that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It captures a lot of things that are great about it at this early stage,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  especially in the comment editing, which is a really big thing.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and the fact that this is the experience of a lot of people.  I think for all joking, a lot of people are like,  great, another social network, why do I need this?  They get caught up in it and then they start liking it.  That seems to be the experience.  And the red thing too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's good lines in there.  That was my favorite thing about Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing about Google Plus at first was the notifications,  because then I could access it without having to go to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. I like it.  I think it's a thing that really makes it sticky.  You can have email notifications until the cows come home or whatever,  but when you go to the Google search page or any other Google service  and you see that notification that you've got new stuff,  you click on it.  It is that kind of thing that doesn't let you forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Labs has turned into the Hunger Games.  Only one will survive at the end.  Matt McGee has a post up on Search Engine Land.  Google, as we mentioned earlier in the show,  really focusing on things, getting rid of a lot of extraneous projects  and choosing winners and losers among lab projects.  Google Books Ngram survives.  I wouldn't have guessed that one.  That's the one that shows you the history of the use of a word  throughout time.  It's now an official part of Google Books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I feel like I know Google products pretty well.  And reading through this list, I realized how many labs things  I just didn't know or we talked about once and hadn't looked at again.  I think this pairing now that they're doing is probably a good thing.  What does this do to 20% time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good question.  If they don't have as many ways to come up with stuff,  or if you make something in your 20% time,  you want to feel rewarded that you did it, right?  And so you need to have it shown somewhere.  And pairing down these projects, what kind of incentive do you have  to do something in your 20% time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if they're asking engineers, this is totally just speculation,  I have no idea, but asking engineers to build upon existing platforms.  So like build a Gmail Labs feature,  which by the way, Gmail Labs is totally separate from Google Labs.  That's alive and well and staying around.  Or building an app that plugs into Google Apps.  It seems like they're building in the ability for developers  to develop on top of existing products versus making something totally new.  I don't know, that might be a possibility.  I wonder though if the 20% time has changed.  We should get a Googler on here sometime and see if that has changed at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good theory because they really have a strong culture  of dog fooding at Google, so they could just roll that in.  Although it changes the principle of 20% time,  which was work on whatever you want so that we can discover new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gmail was a 20% time project.  I know for every Gmail there are probably hundreds of 20% projects  that either never made it out the door or were an experiment  or were like null or search wiki or one of those products  that never went anywhere, but Gmail was a pretty big win.  They certainly do want to keep that possibility of another Gmail  kind of hatching from an interested engineer open.  At the same time, maybe it's just a matter of not keeping things around longer  or once, I don't know what the maintenance is for projects like this,  but once the maintenance becomes more tedious  then the interest in it, just kill it off sooner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that they should allow,  I'm sorry, do you think that Larry Page has in mind to focus down,  remove things and then open it back up after a while?  Is it going to be a cyclical thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of hard to do, right?  I mean, there's a generation of Googlers that were raised in that culture  and so to put the brakes on that to a certain extent,  I think at a time when they're already struggling to keep a lot of good people  with companies like Facebook and Twitter hiring very aggressively,  I don't know, I think it's a bit of a risk,  but I think it's probably necessary at the same time too.  I think that a little bit of focus for a company like Google  is probably not a bad thing.  It's just where you draw the line, how you balance it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or they could leave the 20% time and say, keep the taps flowing.  We won't have Google Labs anymore,  but if we see something that you're working on that's really interesting,  we'll grab it and actually make it, we'll put more behind the stuff we pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's possible too.  I think, well, Kevin, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's difficult to think about what the grading scale must be  because if you think about the average Google user  who isn't as tied into it as perhaps we are all or the listeners in the show are,  I don't know if people ever tweak with their settings or labs in Google products  or try out, go to the settings and look really deep in and say,  oh, look, I can do Gmail undo.  It seems like if you don't have those kind of,  that whole lab section and blog posts announcing new goofy things  that you're trying, it seems like it's harder to get awareness for them.  So the whole kind of iterative on top of products,  labs development, I think would,  it feels like you'd have less awesome stuff coming out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I do think we should pour a little out for script converter,  breadcrumb, Google Talk Guru.  I've definitely never heard of several of these things.  Image swirl, Sputnik, the JavaScript testing tool.  You'll be sorely missed.  And App Inventor for Android, we talked about that before too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By naming it Sputnik, they kind of set it up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  App Inventor was the one I think that was the most probably remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably the most loved, huh?  Yeah.  Huh, that's, hmm.  Now, one of those 20% time projects that gets a lot of attention  is the driverless car,  which we talked about last week was in an accident,  human caused accident.  But apparently China recently debuted an autonomous vehicle  that is made in partnership with China's first auto works  and University of researchers equipped with a honky HQ3 sedan.  That can't be how that's pronounced.  H-O-N-G-Q-I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That can't be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not right.  Honchi, maybe?  Eh.  Not much better.  Not much better.  Autonomous vehicle made a 154 mile,  I've totally lost my place there,  154 mile journey on a freeway, busy freeway,  from the Hunan province's capital of Changsha to Wuhan,  the capital of the Hubei province,  made it in three hours and 20 minutes.  Driverless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because if you've looked at China's history with data  and privacy policies over the last five years,  the one thing you want is China driving your car for you.  Really.  Obviously they've been so good with not curing people's lives.  That's worse than my Gina joke.  Oh yes, it was.  To China.  To the entire country.  Yes, so who runs the car?  What back end service is it uploading information back to?  Well, yeah, I don't know what,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess we have the same question with the Google driverless car,  but we have an idea of Google's platform.  I don't know anything about the companies  providing the platform for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's got to be a back door for the government to get in there, though.  There's just no way that China does things like that  without at least thinking through what it could allow them to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you say the word Tiananmen Square,  the car comes to a screeching halt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just can't go there.  You can go everywhere else.  Exactly.  You can't go actually to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You try to put it in navigation  and it just tries to reroute you to like a Starbucks or something.  It has no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't you like to go to a fake Apple store instead?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean, you can go to an Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I just got back from China  and I noticed on every freeway, every highway,  there were cameras everywhere, like constantly snapping.  So this just seems like a more efficient way  to gather data about where every car is going in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, all jokes aside,  I think driverless cars are something we desperately need as a society  because I really do believe that humans are probably the worst entity  of any kind to be in charge of a car on the freeway.  And I think this would actually improve traffic.  It would improve safety.  And so the fact that we have multiple entities researching this  is a good thing as long as research is shared.  It's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a question of who.  But I mean, I'm telling you,  the lawsuit when somebody,  when some code error crashes a car for the first time,  oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's inevitable.  Yeah, Nevada State Legislature actually has a law  about driverless cars on the books already.  Already?  Yeah, just in case.  Thinking ahead.  All right, let's take a quick break and thank our sponsor Carbonite.  Unexpected computer disasters are going to happen.  It's not something you want to hear,  but it's something that's absolutely true.  And so if you want to make sure that your data is safe,  if you care about the data on your computer,  if you don't care about the data on your computer,  just fast forward right now, skip, go to the bathroom.  But if you care about your data,  you need to have a good data backup plan.  And the way I recommend and several people recommend  is to have your copy that's on your computer,  a copy on a local storage drive  that's separated from your computer,  but is local to you,  and a copy in a remote location that is away from you.  That way if there's a fire or flood or other disaster  in your locale,  you still have your data backed up elsewhere.  If there's a problem elsewhere,  you've got a copy here,  you've got triple redundancy.  Carbonite.com is my recommendation for that remote storage.  It's absolutely safe, encrypted end to end.  It backs up all of your files.  Once you get the paid version,  everything on your drive goes up into the cloud with no limits.  It's easy to use, it just happens in the background.  You can even check to prioritize it  so that if you're doing some bandwidth intensive stuff,  it doesn't get in your way.  And you get your files back with just a few clicks.  And the side benefit is you can access all of your files  wherever you go on the web using your login.  So unlimited backup of your PC and Mac is only $59 a year  for you got a terabyte of stuff, $59 a year.  That's 16 cents a day.  Try it for free though.  You don't have to pay anything right now.  You don't have to use a credit card.  Go to carbonite.com and use the offer code.  It's up on the screen actually, twig, T-W-I-G.  And you'll get two months free with that offer code  if you decide to buy the service.  So try it for free.  Use the offer code twig to get in.  Then when you buy it,  use that offer code to get two months for free  and be sure to sign up for the free trial  from the homepage if you want to get those two months free.  That's carbonite.com, offer code twig.  We thank them for their support of This Week in Google.  Tony Wang is telling me that Hong Qi means red flag  in Chinese.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we still sure you're pronouncing that correctly?  No, I definitely don't know if I'm pronouncing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was hoping that he was telling me  how to pronounce it properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The name of the driverless car system in China  is called Red Flag, which again,  no cause for concern, anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an international standard.  The red flag means...  All right.  Facebook facial recognition software violates privacy laws  in Germany.  Facebook is now threatened with legal action  over the recognition software that goes in  and suggests when you tag a photo,  hey, you might want to put a tag for Tom Krasik  because this looks to be a picture of Tom Krasik.  Germany says not allowing people to opt into that  may violate the law and it's up for review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not having Jeff here for a story about Germany  and facial recognition is unfair.  I feel like I have to channel Jeff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should I just turn red, have my head explode  and talk about how this is total hogwash?  Hyperpersonal news stream, Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that other one?  Habermas.  Habermas.  Jürgen Habermas.  Habermas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Germany, no fan of Google or Facebook's privacy policies,  let it be said.  But it is...  I think that certain people,  if I talk to my friends and relatives  and they had never seen it before,  they would think it violates privacy laws.  Just that folks who have been using Facebook for a while  I feel are kind of a nerd to it by now.  The whole, well, they know everything  about what I'm doing with my camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it really violating privacy laws though?  I mean, that's the question.  What it's doing is what so much software out there  can do already.  There was a demonstration, I think, at DEF CON  about how easy it is to determine  all of this private information  based on facial recognition software  that's off the shelf.  I think Google just bought PitPat  and you can use that to find out,  to recognize the face from a Facebook photo  and then find out, in one case,  they were able to guess the first five digits  of the social security number.  That's based on location and stuff like that.  But telling Facebook that you're violating privacy  because you suggest to someone,  this person might be in this picture  and allowing that person to decide  whether to tag it or not,  that doesn't seem to be the worst violation to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can upload images of people into Google now  and it'll return Google results  for images that look like that person.  Is that a privacy violation?  I don't know, but it seems a little more...  If I can just take a picture of somebody on the street  and upload that to Google  and then find out who they are,  that's kind of weird.  Wait, is that live?  The Image Search project,  like two or three months ago,  if you go to Image Search right now,  you can upload a picture  and it will return results of pictures  that it believes are similar to that picture.  That's not image swirl, that's something else.  I don't think so, no.  So you can...  I tried it with a picture of myself  just to see what would happen.  I mean, not that I'm famous or anything,  but it did return a fair amount of results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a little camera on the side  and then it allows you to either paste in an image URL  or upload an image.  So let's see.  I'm going to try it out.  Be careful there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now my understanding was that this returns webpages  which contain that same image  but doesn't necessarily do facial recognition,  which is a little different.  Well, pixels are pixels, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think that it's...  So I just tried it with my own headshot  and it showed me a series of other people  who are Caucasian with dark hair,  including Ashton Kutcher.  Because clearly Ashton and I look similar.  But I don't know. Let's try it.  Because I thought that they made a big deal  about the fact that they had the capability  of doing facial recognition, but they weren't  because they felt like it was too...  Oh, well, I picked a cartoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I picked a cartoon version of myself.  That's not a fair...  That doesn't violate your privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not a fair test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  First world problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So I'm going to go into pictures.  I'm going to find...  I really need to organize my pictures.  It's worth noting that in Germany

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with the Street View debacle they had a while ago,  what ended up happening is that folks  in Blermenie, as it's now called,  can... had an option...  At the end of all the legal wrangling,  they had an option to blur their house on Street View.  They had a way to get out of what some folks considered  their invasive picture-taking.  But I guess maybe, if I'm guessing correctly,  Germany's laws would want Facebook to get rid of  and they want Facebook to give everybody that option.  And so if you're friends with someone on Facebook  and Facebook automatically tags them in your photos,  you're not giving them that same kind of ability  to blur themselves, hide themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So I uploaded my old CNET photo.  It's a beardless photo of me from way back in the day.  Here's what I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think any of those people are you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you don't have my screen anymore?  Oh, you never had my screen. All right.  Too bad. I saw it.  I don't think any of these people look like Tom.  I can verify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That one lady, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So did they say this is Tom Merritt?  Or did it just say this is Headshot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it just says visually similar images  and it shows mostly white people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it link to the page where those images are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the visually similar.  So is this guy.  Must be the smile.  Yeah, this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I guess it doesn't violate your privacy  if it doesn't work.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then yeah, if you click on any of these,  then it does go,  it does take you to the normal image search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you could match, you know,  if it worked and it found another picture of you somewhere,  it could match it to that site  and then you find out the name and off you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poor lady. Let's take her on this.  Speaking of, Germany's going to be after us pretty soon.  All right.  If you're mad about this,  along with Germany,  you can join the anonymous protest November 5th,  Guy Fawkes Day.  Anonymous says they want to take it to the streets  against Facebook, not a DDoS attack.  They're asking people to go out into the streets anonymously.  I guess you wear your Guy Fawkes mask.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is the typical anonymous video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For the sake of your own privacy,  Facebook has been selling information to government agencies  and giving clandestine access to information security firms.  So this is the typical plea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're asking everyone to go out on the streets on November 5th.  Where are you going to be? Guy Fawkes Day, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, go out on the streets and like not be on Facebook?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't post anything to Facebook that day while you're on the street.  What does this mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Point to your local Facebook constable area and shake your fist angrily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think I'd rather just not,  opt to not use Facebook in general every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, Emile Protolinski at ZDNet says that anonymous members  may be looking to kill Facebook,  but the larger hacktivist group does not appear to support their cause.  So this may be,  there's a page that says Anonymous does not support killing Facebook on November 5th.  So this may be a spinoff.  Divisions in the ranks of anonymous?  Well, that's kind of the way anonymous works.  They don't have ranks.  They have everything.  It's all about chaos.  They wouldn't be true to themselves if they didn't have divisions.  That's just the way.  I think that's the idea.  You can go in whatever direction you want.  And get a lot of publicity for something that's actually been around for a while.  An Amazon Kindle social network similar to Goodreads  that lifts info from Facebook and Twitter  and shares information about what you're reading,  if you wish.  I went over and looked at it,  and all it has are the books that I have on my wish list at Amazon  included in my to read list,  but nothing else.  Even though I buy Kindle books,  it hasn't pulled anything in.  I'd have to change a setting.  I think it's a good thing that it suddenly got a ton of attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just got an email this week from someone  who was following me on Amazon Kindle.  I was confused and deleted it.  But apparently this was it.  I haven't had a chance to look at it yet.  Goodreads, just because the Lifehacker book just kind of came out,  so I've been watching alerts for it.  And Goodreads is quite popular.  It's not something that I use myself,  but it gets tons of reviews and comments.  And Amazon, this makes sense for Amazon.  I really like the fact that the stuff that you highlight  in Kindle books you can share on the web  and you can keep on the web.  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know some people don't like it,  but I like the fact that when you highlight something,  it goes into a database,  and then I can choose to have that on when I'm reading

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and see what other people have highlighted.  Absolutely.  That was actually kind of a cool experience.  The first time I was reading a book,  and it highlights a certain part of the book  and says this was a really popular highlight,  it's a very private thing.  But then once I kind of get used to it,  I was like, oh, this is cool,  kind of crowdsourcing the most interesting quotes from the book.  And I use highlights extensively.  I have a terrible memory.  I really like being able to look back and say,  oh, yeah, that book, and remember what happened.  So what is the cause for the lift,  the recent lift in this?  Did they do some sort of big launch announce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think a blogger picked it up  and pitched it as,  this is a secret social network  that Amazon is hiding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also just recently launched  the HTML5-based,  what they call the Cloud Reader.  It's Kindle in the Cloud,  which basically can run on any browser.  I've seen people with really obscure phones  saying that it works on their  devices and tablets and phones.  It works on Android phones and iPad,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but not  Android tablets or iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now you can literally get to your Kindle account  from almost anywhere,  and so maybe it's just getting a push  because of that, because now it's out more in the open.  All right, let's finish up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with a little bit about  what's going on in London.  This story is much bigger than  a tech story, of course.  Riots have been going on there for days.  We've had folks from London,  from Birmingham,  on the network talking about  that they're either blocks away  or they got out of downtown  from their job just ahead of  riots going on.  The big stories around this have been  Blackberry, RIM saying,  we will cooperate with the police. Pretty much that's all  they said, and then of course immediately their page  got hacked because everyone assumed they were going to turn over  all the Blackberry messenger text, which they can't  if they're telling the truth.  Everything is encrypted.  And police using Flickr to identify  London riots suspects. So they're  taking camera pictures, posting them up  on Flickr and asking people to help  identify folks for prosecution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it really was a scary  Big Brother world,  everyone who has a smartphone  and has GPS on it, they could have  been tracking everyone that way. They could say, you were in  this area on this night where we know rioting was happening.  We're not there yet, thankfully,  but you could learn a whole lot from  someone in this situation with their smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, should they just upload these pictures  to Google Image Search?  Except it doesn't work.  And then grey haired ladies

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  go get arrested because they look like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In all seriousness, this is the flip side  of the coin, right? In Germany, they're like,  oh, a possible facial recognition  thing that might tell you if someone's tagged in a  photo, that's not allowed. But the  Metropolitan Police, they can't recognize people  so they're going in crowdsourcing it.  Is that a privacy violation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they asking people to  post their cam phone pictures to Flickr or they're  just going in a Flickr and seeing what's up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it looks like they're taking pictures from the police surveillance  cameras and putting them  up on Flickr. So they're crowdsourcing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see, interesting. And asking people to identify.  I don't understand, why don't they just upload  to Facebook? Facebook will do the suggestion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then just tag it for them, I know. Come on, Met.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They did that in Vancouver, right, too,  after the Stanley Cup finals?  That's right. I think I've forgotten about that.  They posted pictures to Flickr, or I forget the service, I think it was Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, those were cam pictures a lot of  the times, though. I think they were  asking for identification of people  who in a picture were obviously  holding up a television they just  committing a crime in this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Looking for a white male, 5'6", can't believe how hard it is to find parking and totting him.  Wearing a Canucks jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh wait, no, you're talking about London.  Alright, well before we  get out of here, let's get our tool tip.  I don't know if we have a number. Kevin, do you have a number?  You have a number? Okay, you've got us covered.  Gina, we'll start with your tip. What do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. Gmail Labs,  which like I said, separate from Google Labs,  Gmail Labs is still alive and well in your  Gmail settings. It's got a new feature  called Preview Pane.  If you go into Gmail settings and Gmail Labs  and enable Preview Pane,  when you come back to your inbox, you get  the opportunity to get a three-paned view  on your Gmail. So you get,  you can view your inbox  and list of labels, the list of messages,  and then preview a message. So it makes it,  my first reaction was, oh, this  looks a lot like Outlook, three-paned view.  And you can do vertical or horizontal.  And, you know, I  looked at it a couple days. It wasn't, it's not exactly my cup of tea, but it's great for really  wide, wide,  wide screens and tablets.  And the only thing is, apparently  it messes up multiple inboxes.  So if you like multiple inboxes,  those two don't play well together.  But with it enabled, there's a  there's a button on the top right hand side  that says no split, vertical split, or horizontal split.  So you can turn it off really, or turn it off and turn it on  really easily. You don't have to go dig through your settings  every time. So Preview Pane for Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent. I like that. In fact, I might  enable that, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very out-looky too, for people who miss the  the Outlook feel in Gmail.  It feels like that kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might get sentimental and put that on  for the Outlook and then enable the Google  Labs thing that allows you to have  the beta symbol back in Gmail.  And I'll just, I'll be like super nostalgic.  Like living in a lab's world.  All right.  Kevin Purdy with the Jarvis number.  What do you got? The Jarvis number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you got? The Jarvis number.  It is 20, and that is  the percentage of respondents  in a survey of about 500 people  by Ogilvy and Mather.  M-A-T-H-E-R. Not sure how to say that.  Ogilvy and Mather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually know this one. It's Mather.  Okay. Ogilvy and Mather. I can't pronounce  Hongki, but I can pronounce Mather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They asked 500 people online,  who do you trust with mobile payments?  And of those respondents, they gave them  11 providers they could choose from.  About 20% said they would trust  Google with their online payments.  So basically relating to their Google  wallet initiative. And that's not a really  high number, but then when you look at the other numbers,  you realize, well maybe the problem is that nobody  trusts anybody with their purchasing things.  Visa actually topped the list at 40%.  Pretty low for a company  that is the biggest credit card.  Yeah. Facebook to the bottom  with 12%. And Apple  was about 23%,  so just a little bit over Google. And  just above Apple was the US  Postal Service.  So all that from ZDNet's  Google and Google blog, and  it shows that maybe Google wallet  would not be all that well  received, but then again, Facebook  wallet would be much worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Apple, which already does  process payments, running  about the same as the Google right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, and just under the US Postal Service.  So, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, is that US Postal Service with my cash  or with my checks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Do you trust the Postal Service  if you rubber band cash and send it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  through the mail? And put it in a see-through envelope.  Do they have PayPal on this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  Yeah, I didn't see PayPal.  Yes, you can head over to the Google and Google blog  and check out the whole thing with a link to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  full survey. Alright, I've got  a tool  which I, you know,  I'm always worried that I'm doing something that has  been done before, but in this case, I actually  don't really care because I think it's an important one.  Recently, there was a story  about how some  ISPs are  actually redirecting your search  terms to individual  pages based on affiliates,  right? So, they  take, like, for instance, Amazon has an affiliate  program, anybody can sign up for it unless you're in  one of those states that has a tax dispute.  And then Amazon doesn't know where you're  using those links. So these ISPs are doing things  where if someone types in a search term  on a search engine, they'll redirect it  to an Amazon affiliate link and try to  collect money from that. There's a way  to stop that and it's to make sure that you're  connecting to your search engines securely.  Now Google, by the way, has already complained  to these ISPs and said stop that. You don't  get to do that and the ISPs have stopped with Google,  but it still works for Bing and Yahoo.  So install HTTPS  Everywhere, which you can get at the Electronic  Frontier Foundation, eff.org  slash HTTPS  everywhere. It is a Firefox  plugin, but it is made  in collaboration with the Tor project  and the eff.  And it works for Google,  Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook,  Bitly, GMX, WordPress, New York Times,  PayPal, several others,  and forces a secure connection  every time you are connected  to these sites. So it's  just good practice to be securely connected  and I'd like to throw that out.  Is that one that's been done before?  Do you know, Gina? I don't think we've done that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in particular. We've definitely talked about using HTTPS  in general when you can  and when it's an option, turn it on.  It's worth the one millisecond of latency  you might get with it, which you certainly  don't get with Google anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and the HTTPS Everywhere  is a nice, in case you forget,  you know, or you just don't want to have to type  in, it'll force it to happen.  So it's just a good fail  safe there.  Hope that helps any. You know,  you're welcome to throw in a tip, number, or tool,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tom, but you don't have to. You're not an obligation.  I did not come prepared with a tip or a number.  That's fine. You can

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  use that time  to pimp paid content, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, sure.  You know, thanks for having me on, Tom.  It's been great to have you.  You can find more of our stuff. We've been covering this mobile  patents issue that we started off talking about this morning  very in depth, and we will continue to do so.  And, you know,  both myself as the mobile editor and Joe Mullen,  who is our legal reporter,  who has been very in depth on this. So you can check us out  at paidcontent.org.  And you can also find my stuff on  moconews.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're still doing moco news, then? I'm still doing it.  Excellent. Good to have you, man. It's good to see you again.  It's good to see you again. It's been a while. Yeah, it has been.  Kevin, pretty great to have you  on the show as well.  And let folks not only know about Complete Android,  but the other book you were talking about as well. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so that's coming  in the near future. From O'Reilly,  a book on Google Plus that's part of their Missing Manual  series, feverently working,  feverishly, fervently,  working on it right now. Both? Well, not right now,  but, you know, as soon as I close this Skype window.  And in the meantime, though,  Complete Android Guide,  completeandroidguide.com, we've just released  a Android app, which is basically  our book and reformatted  for the Android interface  so that when you have a question about your Android phone,  you can actually just pull up the app  and look up the answer to it right there.  So that's in the Android market.  It's a little hard to find, mostly because  the word Android is a very crowded market search.  Yeah, it makes sense, huh?  If you search the word Complete Android, all one word,  it pulls up first. And I also created a link  at bit.ly, bit.ly  slash Complete Android should take you  right to our app in the market.  Bit.ly slash Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably the best way, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bit.ly slash Complete Android, I believe.  Complete Android, okay. Yes. And it's  99 cents. It's my whole book that I,  you know, spend months writing. So  feel free to, you know, grab it,  recommend it to folks you know who just got their phone  and don't know what to do with it quite yet.  We've got some great chapters in there about setting up  your phone, setting up your email, stuff like that.  So that's in the market  and completeandroidguide.com and  Google Plus book coming very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  soon. And Gina  Tripani, always good to be on  with you, smarterware.org. I've got  my think up account up on my screen  if you want to take that.  Eileen, this gives you a little  look at what's going on. This is the kind of  stats you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Awesome. Yeah. We just released  Beta 14 yesterday, like  fresh off the packaging  scripts. Excellent. Fresh out the build  scripts. So check it out. It's thinkupapp.com.  Beta 14 is our last beta.  We're going into version 1.0  land soon in the next month or so.  But thanks for having me, Tom. This is a really  fun show. Both Toms, actually. Tom K,  thank you for explaining patents  to people who are confused  by them, like me. And I can't wait  to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tom starts off with a reference to The Wire, everybody.  So it's a really great intro to the world of patent  lawsuits and fights. Google's  coming. Google's coming. Ain't got no  honey nut. I got some Walmart

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  lines in my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Thanks, everybody. Leo Laporte will be back  on Twig in two weeks after his  jury duties are finished.  And next week, Iaz  Akhtar will be hosting Twig  and Jeff Jarvis will be back. So thanks, everybody,  for watching. We'll see you next time on Twig.  Bye.
