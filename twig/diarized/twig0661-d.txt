Thanks for having me. So nice to have you and even shorter even shorter notice  When Fleischmann is also here  Glenn dot fun. I love that Glenn  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Easy to spell URL as opposed to my previous hard to spell once  Yeah, I was just sitting I'm always ready to go online apparently and I just fired up the microphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can tell you have a real microphone here. You get the headphones. You're set you of course have heard him on the incomparable  he's been a longtime writer for Macworld and a man about town and I think this is nice because I wanted I  Know we're gonna be talking about Twitter, but I'd like to get a variety of viewpoints on here  I did ask and he couldn't do and I wish he could see the Vigen I thought because  Siva who is also a professor of journalism  but at across town  Wrote a piece in salon or sorry slate called. There's no reason or sorry. There is a reason no smart buyer  As let's see, there's no reason a smart buyer has not purchased Twitter  There's there's a reason no smart buy. It's too many negatives. Anyway, there's a reason no one's bought Twitter so far  He says Elon Musk is gonna lose his  Shirt the first thing I want to say before we get into this heavy conversation  Obviously, you know the news Elon Musk succeeded  Where all else have failed in buying Twitter for 44 billion dollars most of it borrowed against Tesla  stock which immediately  caused him to lose a  Significant out of his personal fortune when Tesla stock plummeted in value a hundred billion dollars because the market said oh  He's gonna screw this one up  He will not take over Twitter for until regulatory approval about six months, of course  There's a lot going on there is a one billion dollar kill fee if either Elon or Twitter backs out of the deal a  significant I think penalty  And of course, there are a lot of questions about what Elon is gonna do with Twitter  There there are a number of people some of them very high-profile who have run screaming from the building  There there are a number of others like me who just say well, let's see  But I think there is legitimate cause for concern one cause for concern Kathy is right up your alley, which is the privacy  Cause for concern Elon suddenly owns outright. He's taking it private  Everything that Twitter knows about you and me and everybody else on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  I mean to some extent that is kind of the setup of how we do our platforms that in theory somebody owns stuff and  I mean, but it didn't feel quite as objectionable when it was either owned  By a private entity that you chose to do business with anyway  Or then a public entity that's still subject to certain forms of regulatory rules about what they can or can't do  This feels weird. It's kind of the worst-case scenario where that I where you give a lot of information to somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know you read their privacy policy you say well, that's okay. It's publicly held. They have to you can't lie  Okay, I'm gonna trust them and then they sell it and every all all bets are off right? There's no agreement  There's no privacy agreement between us and Twitter anymore. It's whatever Elon wants to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I thought different things would get sold like I always understand that when companies write their privacy policies  They do sort of tend to put we may sell it and but I've always thought of it in terms of sort of  End gleaning of data that they've learned about people that they will potentially give to vendors or something like that  And a lot of people object to that there are concerns  But that seemed like the normal vector of where I'd expect the privacy to go  This is a little bit different because this is he can in theory see our direct  Well, not yet. This hasn't happened  But if he all of a sudden steps into the ownership shoes, he can see all the directed the direct messages that aren't encrypted  He has all the information that otherwise governments try to subpoena or a private parties try to subpoena in  theory that's all available to him and this is a huge problem for  Twitter has been very aggressive in litigating the the privacy of its anonymous speakers and all of a sudden there's a gigantic vector of  People they were hiding from now own the information that would tell them who they are  That's weird and weird in a really terrible scary way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there's also the issue of  What Elon has said he will do with Twitter and  Your your colleague at Tector Mike Masnick wrote  That his statements to Chris Anderson at the TED talk last week  Demonstrated a complete lack of understanding what the first  what the First Amendment meant  What the algorithm meant the whole thing is basically a  Mass of ignorance before I get to Jeff because I know Jeff  You're I think you're the one with his hair on fire, but we'll check I want to ask Glenn  Because we I don't know what you have unlike everybody else not posted a thousand articles on this  What is your opinion of the future Twitter going forward under an Elon Musk? I just think it's I think it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Potentially devastating move because I don't think his interests align with the majority of people use the platform  I don't think Twitter really knows what it is. I mean, what is Twitter?  You know, it's got its build as a micro blogging service  Which is a term that means almost nothing because there's kind of only one micro blogging service that people use to you know  In any large amount there are some far-right ones that have gotten a little bit of traction  But not a lot compared to it. So it's this unique entity  It stands in opposition or distinct from Facebook. It has they haven't quite ever figured out what to do  That's not just this very narrow set of  Options I love constraints  So I think it's done very well with that  But they don't effectively moderate the platform even though they've put in a lot more safeguards and a lot more  they've made a lot more attempts to make it like fair and  They're fair for people less abusive and to label political content and try to you know  Keep the Commons a little clearer  but it's a it's a very complicated operation with a single line of revenue essentially from advertising and  Musk says he doesn't care about the business basics  But then he structured a deal that's gonna put him on the hook for a lot of personal interest payments and Twitter  Leveraged for payments. It's going to have to make so it can't just turn off the I mean  he could turn off the revenue pipe or  Advertisers could flee if it's ruined and it's not a good place to you know  Put your ads for for cars and credit cards and Squarespace and whoever else up on it  But then he's got to take money from his personal fortune to to cover that  So I don't think I don't think he knows what he wants to do with it because his statements are both vague and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Contradictory, which is the best kind right? I was you know, I mean all last week. I was saying  Oh, Elon doesn't want to buy Twitter. This is this is Elon trolling  Elan's not that crazy  The last thing he ever wanted would to do this effect. This could well be just pump and dump  He wants the price to go up so he can make a billion dollars on his investment things like that. I was so wrong  Elon told Chris Anderson and this was before he got Twitter, but after he offered to buy it  I think it's really important for there to be an including him now an inclusive arena for free speech Twitter has become the  de facto town square  So that's how he sees it  So it's really important that people have both the reality and perception they're able to speak freely within the bounds of the law  Then he says as Mike Masnick points out something completely contradictory  Yes, which is as long as it doesn't break the law it's free speech but no spam which is protected by law  Yeah, that's free speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People have brought up the fact that you know the instant any service is unmoderated in the modern age the immediate  It's a Chan. It's you get CSAM you get child sexualized. Yeah, you get 4chan and 8chan  Yeah, you get garbage no advertiser want and no user would want you have to filter out spam  You have to filter out child pornography and you have to filter out, you know revenge poor  You have to filter out huge quantities of things how to be actively moderated  Just as a starting point so you don't violate the law in most countries on the planet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He also says he wants to open the algorithm, you know, I you know, it's funny the stuff he said  When I on first reading I'm going yeah. Yeah free speech. Yeah, yeah open the algorithm  Yeah, but then after you just consider for a second or you realize well you open the algorithm who takes advantage of that  Spammers they game the system. They know how to get something at the top of the list  Great. You've done you know, this is exactly why Google does not open its algorithm because otherwise it gets gamed  Like crazy. That's a very risky thing to do Masnick's point, which I think is very well taken is  That Elon's saying a lot of things  That the original founders of Twitter and all of Silicon Valley espoused 15 20 years ago  But have learned the hard way doesn't work  And so they've learned that to make a good space you have to moderate you have to have rules and  He masnick saying Elon's just gonna throw out 15 years of learning 15 years of hard-won  Moderation and start from scratch without any real plan for what to do. All right  I've been I've been really doing this to drive you crazy Jeff  You know and you've been really good about not saying anything Jeff Jarvis, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have I don't know what I think I  Think it's wrong to guess what he's gonna do because we don't know cuz he doesn't know what he's gonna do. That's obvious

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although you might say that that's potentially problematic  Forty-four billion dollars on something you know what you're gonna do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the couch cushion, it's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm gonna buy this ice cream cone. I don't know what I'm gonna do with it  Well cross that bridge when it comes when we come to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean I saw that I saw what Twitter is gonna be like last week when I when I put up my tweet and  For 36 hours until they got bored with me and went after you know table the runs or somebody else the Musca bites came after me  He has his own army of bots human or not. Oh, they're they're bots with heartbeats  Yeah  And and so it was it was Andrew Sullivan and Glenn Greenwald and Fox News and they all came after me and they  They think they're clever but they're not and so it's the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over again  And then they and then squirrel they go away and they go the next thing  so I  think  I'm trying to look at this as a business story first  I care more about the speech I care more what's gonna happen  But I'm just trying to I'm just trying to get my head around that in a few ways one  The interest rates have to be awful. This is a leveraged buyout  44 billion dollars the cash flow is not that great. It's is leveraged against Tesla stock, which is volatile  Twitter is not a great venture to start off with  So I've got to believe that he won't be screaming about free speech  He'll be screaming about free cash flow to his managers. I want to plus one what Jeff is saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is absolutely a corporate law story  It's it's where the interest is the the release of the the merger deal is where the really interesting stuff is like  this is  One of the things that's been a problem and I'm sorry  I cut you off Jeff is in this whole space about online speech  we've been just paying all this attention oversized attention to free speech section 230 blah blah blah and  ignoring everything else that happens to shape the space  Including corporate law has been a gigantic voice that shapes things because why is it that companies act the way they do that?  We have whole bodies of law that force companies to act in certain ways or give them a certain liberties or take away their discretion  We create incentives and then we wonder why companies act consistent with those incentives  You're absolutely right that this is the story. It's always been the story, but it's getting ignored  We never get the analysis of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Kathy beyond beyond that beyond the law piece, which I absolutely agree with that's a smart way  You would look at it as I would expect  There's also just the the business part of Musk and I've been thinking that through I got into it with O Malik in  Twitter where he was he was I don't know he was defending  He was defending Musk's business intelligence and it made me think and I thought okay  So fine Tesla world's richest man would seem on its face that he's the most the brilliant most brilliant businessman we have  But Leo you used to own a Tesla and now you own a Mustang and every single car company out  There is going to make alternatives is making alternatives to Tesla  I don't think that's a growth stock one two  SpaceX fine. He can make some money, you know shuttle and back Russians and whoever to space, but that's not a huge business  Three nobody wants holes in the ground. Sorry  Whatever happened to Hyperloop five Starlink. Okay, but the government is what gave him money for Ukraine. We was trying to take credit  I don't know that he's so brilliant at this and I want and I think of you  But I think he is smart enough to know this and this is what he's so in all his oats  This is what I have the most funny could possibly have  And and he's responsible to no one and he's doing what he's doing  but it's disturbing because I was talking to a reporter today from the Christian Science Monitor and I said  People built their communities here  So I quote on the show often Andre Brock jr  Who wrote distributed blackness and his spirit is you're not kicking me off of here. We work to make this place  We're making this ours and Charlotte climber who's a brilliant  Ex evangelical trans activist on Twitter and she said the same thing  And so what happened here was that must can buy the company, but he can't buy the communities  He can try to screw it up  But it's it's kind of passed him now and I don't know what he's really gonna get out of it in the end except a bunch  Of attention a bunch of fun a bunch of trolling  He's gonna get bored and then it could be sold for pieces  private equity or something else  And it's just not a happy place all of this is to say that I wish and I see Dorsey kind of sucking up to Musk  And I think it could because I get along and that's fine  But I also think it's because Jack wants blue sky to happen and he doesn't want to mess that up because that is the only  answer I see going forward is  speech as protocol, which is what  I think we're going to have to do is we're going to have to build a new  original Vester in  In Twitter Fred Wilson has been talking about alongside  Jack and then we build value-added layers on top of that like WordPress org.com on top of org  So I hope there's a function to go before when I looked at Mastodon and there's nothing there

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know where else we go. So I think we fight for where we are. Hope we survive this era and then  Rebuild from there and build something better in the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't think you needed me on the show because I just agree with everything that Jeff said  But I think that's that's right, that's the right analysis one thing I'm missing from the reporting is time scale because I mean  Headlines were all kind of like as of Monday. He owned it and even I was like falling for that  I'm like, oh my gosh  This was so quick and and then like I got my like corporate law hat on and stuff and started thinking about like no  It can't possibly be like that. And so the headlines were bad  And I think the reporting I'd actually like to see some good reporting and maybe it's out there and I haven't seen it  But what is the time scale? What are the things that need to happen because I know some of this there's gonna be due diligence  Meanwhile, there's a  Disparagement clause that Musk appears to be violating like every five minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there is gonna be no due diligence. Actually he waived they basically waived due diligence, which is  Playing house there's rats in the wall. It's like that's fine  Yeah, so but but they so it means that once but they'll be the shareholder vote. There's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's also regulatory  Kathy, isn't there so who is this? He has this is FTC  Does the FCC weigh in on this? I don't SEC. What about the SEC?  By the way, Elon did lose a court case today. The judge ruled that he lose it. Yeah, yeah judge ruled that no the SEC  Is right. You were not coerced in this agreement and this is gonna be interesting  Elon Musk when he owns Twitter will still have to according to the SEC get lawyers to approve every tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think the bottom line is it isn't supposed to work this way and a question I have  on is is did we not have law that adequately anticipated this or  Do we have law that did sort of anticipate this that isn't executing like he  I mean, there's at least little scoff laws that he's ended up with  You know him buying the 10% and not filing the form on time  So there's a number of things that he that there was law that technically existed that didn't seem to be a barrier or both  of some form and the problem is is I think the people who understand know this and understand this have not been at our  Discussion table for a while and I'm really annoyed  I have to dig up my nose for my corporate law class because I thought I was done with all that and but I  Think that's where the story is because now we're talking about the questions just gone to is this an anti competitive problem  I feel like the answer is yes because in  We only had a couple major platforms and he came with his billions of dollars and instead of investing in another one  he  Consumed one that already existed and in a way that's likely to be deleterious to its further existence  So the and the question is how legal is that but that's not the way that when they've been talking about big tech  Regulation and break up big tech this wasn't the vector of attack that they were anticipating

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lena Khan has not written a paper on what happens when a oligarch buys Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and this is a bigger problem than than the mergers. I think yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I want to bring up the China situation too  Which is that Elon Musk is heavily beholden to China and you know  I never want to sound like it some kind of either Chinese conspiracy conspiracy theorist or anti Chinese  Because you know, it's caught China's too complicated to summarize in like, you know a sentence, right?  There's no two you need several books or a lifetime  But but we know we know what China requires of companies that do business in there  We know how they don't operate by  Democratic norms or business norms when they think something has to happen. They'll arrest the richest person in the country  they'll shut things down they'll take the most popular actress off the streets and  Disappear her for months and so forth  So there's no question that China will do whatever is in China's interests and because Musk is so beholden for manufacturing and other issues in China  Chinese that you know, even though Twitter isn't technically allowed in China  What will the effect be given that Chinese diplomats on Twitter are marked as being associated with the Chinese government can be subject to?  suppression and so forth or  fact-checking I  Have huge concerns that his that there's you know, Facebook isn't beholden to China  Apple is in a lot of ways and in Musk is there is a great piece by Pete Sweeney and Reuters

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Breaking views Elon Musk buys Tesla a pounding Chinese  headache and  This is this is gonna be a really interesting  clash  Because yeah  I  Don't know  I mean Elon wants to Elon's building Tesla's in China  Elon wants to stay on the on the best side of the Chinese Communist Party

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not just China it's it's gonna be countries around the world  Yeah, you have Europe coming after him already saying whoa, you think you're not gonna moderate anything. We got laws over here  We got an SDG. We we got all this stuff. You're gonna be doing that and then today right before airtime  Elon's latest  Dumber and dumber tweet was I quote for Twitter to deserve public trust  It must be politically neutral which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally in the US that might make sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's even but then it's a global country

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was what's politically neutral in Mexico in Nicaragua and Sri Lanka. Have fun Elon  It's a big weird mean world out there. Your simplistic vision is in for a wild time. Also Kevin Marx says

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Upsetness is not a metric to run a company on  It's also not something you want to incentivize  Yeah, so let's upset everybody. That's that's my biggest fear because I like I think everybody on this panel  Think Twitter has some value maybe less than most but I do think it does have some value and I don't see any way that Elon  Makes Twitter better in any respect good point. Good point. Well said no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be great if you would but I'm viewing Twitter right now as if it's like Russia after the Ukrainian invasion  As people are wondering how quickly they can get out of the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have a 362 percent spike on our mastodon instance not like a hundred people or anything  But it's still it's still there are I today approved 20 I think 29 new  Members at twit.social because we have you know, we that's this is the login  but we do have our own mastodon instance, which I will now log into and  Apparently not on this machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have a whole this whole story is engendering me with a lot of on we because for a couple reasons one is that  We just discussed like Musk is wandering into an area where he's acting like at last  Somebody is here to do the big thinking that has been neglected all this time and it's I'm sorry  No  These issues are a lot more complex and and and hard and a lot of really good decent talented smart people have been thinking about  For quite some time but quite frankly his nonsense is very similar to  Regulatory nonsense of they walk in and say at last a big thinker is here to solve all the problems  It's like no the problem the reason the problems weren't getting solved is  partly because they're rather difficult and intractable and partly because  Idiots keep showing up and pretending that that last they are the expert who is coming to the room to solve all the problems  so  So this is almost boring to me because it's kind of the same old same old and it's like I don't really like him or anything  He promises to do but it's I see regulations coming out of Congress that are like almost equally as violent and equally  rooted in any

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gonna get worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Worse because of this kind of crap. Um, so I am hoping I want to be  Mostly so I can get up every morning  I want to be more optimistic about this and see this as a chance for opportunity and I think it does present a few  I think you know one of the things rhetorically that kind of makes it interesting is  there's been a lot of difficulty in people understanding how  Platform moderation is really a First Amendment protected activity because people don't recognize it when that editorial discretion is in the hands of a  Company particularly a platform company, but it's easier to see when it's an individual because you can see it for yourself  Like what are the comments you allow on your Facebook post?  Obviously, you know if somebody insults your kid and calls them ugly  You're gonna like delete that and people would understand intuitively that of course you have the First Amendment right to make that decision  So we tend to see those decisions as First Amendment protected when they're manifest in the individual and lose sight of them when they're in the company  So I'm kind of hoping rhetorically to point out that okay now it's back in the hands of the individual  This is all on Musk. You can see how he's making these choices and  Hopefully that maybe we can see how he would have the right to make the decisions  Even though he's going to make them really badly because he's rejecting all this prior knowledge  So, I don't know and then I don't know  I just  I  Want new Twitter  I want I want all the good people and all the good money to flee immediately and go start something new and better and leave  Them to this flounder his floundering thing and I want that to happen as soon as possible  Except I am also really intrigued and back to the corporate law thing  I want to understand this dynamic better because I want to understand how likely it is and on what time scale that this transaction  Actually closes and what will and let's get the popcorn because I don't know if it's quite as much of a slam-dunk as it's being reported  Okay, I don't have the knowledge to wait. He that out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The time well I was gonna ask Kathy that the time frame I've seen quoted is six months. I think that was the New York Times  Do you think look why wouldn't it close he doesn't own any competing social networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to understand that a little bit better. Oh and Glenn may actually have some answers. So well, I said I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have things I can make up is that  We don't need your hot take here  I'm so think of your Kohler take is I'm sure I imagine many people  listening to this and on this panel read Matt Levine who is  Bloomberg goes great free newsletter and he's great because he does all the hard work for you, right?  And when you pick apart the deal and also I've been following people on Twitter who have picked apart the deals term and and  what the agreement was that was signed and  Moskos he's not he's both highly leveraged and not so much  But I see a scenario in which if Tesla shareholders well, you know a there's a weird thing  Which is the major shareholders of Tesla if you look at the ten biggest ones  there is a strong overlap with the top ten shareholders of  Twitter it includes, you know, like fidelity and Blackstone and Vanguard most of which, you know  They're holding this in mutual funds and index funds and so forth  But still it's kind of weird that the two companies share so many major shareholders and that the board clearly  Solicited their opinion before they went ahead  So these major shareholders who then now own stakes in Tesla that dropped a significant amount because the market as a whole  Responded so negatively. So one thing that could happen is that Tesla could keep getting hit they could have some you know  They've been doing incredibly. Well, we saw the earnings just was that  This week, right? They've done incredibly well. They've executed extremely well  There's lots of complaints about the cars that get circulation  but if they have a bad quarter in the next two quarters or the stock continues to fall because people don't have the trust in it and  Suddenly, he's already got personal guarantees against chunks of his Tesla stock  He'd have to exercise options the banks could require higher margins  He's putting up 20 something billion dollars of his, you know, quote-unquote own money like cash  But he may syndicate some of that and there's some big question about yeah where that cash comes from  Yeah, yeah, and so he's and he's guaranteed the way the deal was signed because there's no due diligence  There's very few conditions apparently under which he can back out without I mean to pay that was about a billion dollars, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I've got Matt Levine's column here and by the way his lead is I guess it's worth saying Elon Musk does not own Twitter  He did not buy Twitter. He did sign an agreement to buy Twitter  That's a big step and he probably probably he says will own it in some amount of time  Maybe six months here is the timeline that he he he talks about  I think Levine probably knows better or as well as anybody what's gonna happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's been covering this so closely. Yeah, too, because it's a great intersection  You have a company with you know with reasonable value, although not, you know Twitter's valuation  We're talking a lot about a company worth under 50 billion dollars or valued at that now  Where there are multi trillion dollar companies in the world right now and Twitter somehow manages  Because media people like us are so interested in it and because it's been a whole show talking about yeah  And it's you know, there's companies that are was it I can't do the math  400 times larger that probably get less attempt Microsoft is very boring compared to Twitter for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess at some point we might spend a minute or two on Google's quarterly report which came out yesterday  This week in Google and what are we talking about Twitter occupies the imagination? So here's the Levine  Timeline Twitter most notably Twitter shareholders will have to vote on the deal  Twitter will have to write a proxy statement explaining the deal run it by the SEC  Send it to shareholders give them some time to read it before voting that alone those things may take months  Then there are regulatory approvals that they have to get before closing the deal  When the deal closes, he'll have to have the money, you know have to be able to write it right a check, right?  He doesn't just cuz he's got those agreements doesn't mean he has the money. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and and and and as Kathy's someone else come along at any point in this process  So yeah, yeah, and I think they had I would anybody as Siva says

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter's been available for some time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you buy it right now? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For the very reasons we're talking about I don't think if I were a sensible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Institutional investor I know well, I don't want to completely throw Twitter completely under the bus because I think there is value there  Yeah, but nobody has figured out how to make no investment

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody's figured out how to make money on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but I think the people is like, you know  The next oligarch billionaire who is bored and wants to go toe-to-toe to with the lawn musk  I mean I could easily see a play there and there were like weird tweets from Jeff Bezos

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like the white knight who rides in he says, you know what I can't let this happen  I'm just gonna lay out some of my own cash and he's been a good Washington Post owner

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I would rather have that billionaire than this  World where that's not my choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The next thing that will happen is a proxy statement will have to be filed within the next few weeks  Levine says watch the proxy statement. It will be interesting  One interesting part will be the quote background of the merger section

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Describing the history of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably some mention will be made of various tweets  Probably the lawyers will have to finesse a bit about how Musk characterized his Twitter stake as a passive  Investment with I didn't realize he tweeted this April 4th with no intention to change control of the company  Yes, and then made a takeover offer saying  nine days later

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's simply still the case that he made the money by not revealing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean I I'm really uncomfortable with this because we could I mean whether anybody should be a billionaire is an open question  but it sort of seems like  Small little technical indiscretions which exist in them in the law for reasons in order to make things fair and give everybody a fair shake  You know all of a sudden don't count. They don't really apply to you and I don't know  It's just a form of lawlessness. That really makes me like I feel like things fall apart when  Rules don't matter and it's not that I'm a huge law and order person. I like mercy  I like I like a certain degree of discretion and some of our laws are just dumb  But I kind of don't think they're all dumb and it's sort of nice to know that they help level the playing field because it means  every single person sort of has equal protection under the law and like this isn't if if all of a sudden like oh well  You know just has so much inertia we can't really stop it like too big to fail like it doesn't feel fair for everybody else  Who's left?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kathy don't you think this boils down to I mean I shouldn't say it boils down to but one of the reasons we have so  much discomfort with Elon Musk is that he exposes the way in which somebody who is like a Trump who's completely shameless and  uninterested in  In worrying about what the law is he's more eager to take action and then often is able through through money or luck or whatever  To escape the consequences so the the pedo guy lawsuit that turned on some interesting technicalities  But he was able to make that statement and then defend it and then essentially prevail in court in a way that seemed implausible  And if he were a person with more shame he would never have said it or he would have  Settled if he were a person with less money  He would have been required to settle or maybe not have the representation that would allow him to win and it feels like the  Same issue with all the SEC enforcement. Well, that's the lesson of the last five years

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that we don't know how to handle somebody who's willing to dash norms. We don't yeah we  And how much we rely on norms not laws not regulations  But norms to get people to behave and then once people are willing to say screw the norms

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then their troops follow behind them to do the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know the law in Finland if you speed in Finland  You're your traffic fine is proportionate to your earnings and I thought we need a law like that for  For various kinds of financial and other crimes in America if if you had to pay something that actually hurt you in the same way  That a traffic fine did in Finland. Maybe it would change behavior 20 million dollars, which is Elon's fine for that tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody did the calculation based on his net worth is about the equivalent of a small fry at McDonald's to the rest of us  It is a tiny  Fraction of his income you mentioned Jeff that  Unaccountably Jack Dorsey was all in on this  Dick Costolo who was the former CEO of Twitter and is quite bruised from his battles  Leading that company tweeted two hours ago bullying is not leadership  Two days ago. He tweeted shout out to the writers room at Silicon Valley for tonight's wild episode  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think the other thing is I think the board  So I I buy a few shares of company here and there so I can get notices everything  So I bought a few shares in my in my 401k for Twitter while a while ago quite a while ago  Are you gonna get one of these?  Proxies that's the thing. That's why I do it so I could I can get that stuff and  So as a shareholder the board violated its fiduciary responsibility to me  They should have shopped this thing around they should have said fine  You want to do a tender offer go fight for it. Good luck. They should have they should have fought  Well, that's just they just that's another

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Section of the proxy is the opinion of Twitter financial advisors again Matt Levine  Which will describe the fairness opinion opinion that Twitter's board got from its bankers concerning the price  He says I think it was probably not too hard for the banks to reach that conclusion

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was 70. It was $69  Late last year, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right the question was  What were the prospects for Twitter?  Levine says I joked yesterday the bankers would have to tweak the model until makes a horrible clattering noise and bolts start popping off  To get to a 5420 valuation for Twitter  In other words, I don't think they have too much difficulty justifying accepting the offer  But you're right. They didn't they didn't do any  Nobody's doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Quick yeah. Yeah, but the problem is I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they said we're into a poison pill and then 36 hours later, okay, we give up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I mean that narrative doesn't quite there's a panic in this and you really the stakes are too high for the speed  That everything is happening where matters of huge consequences are all of a sudden because the problem is is if this deal fails  Either because I don't know for whatever reason it fails. What have we done? What has just happened?  I mean people's livelihoods are currently like hanging in the balance people are already shopping resumes because how can they kind of sensibly not?  And you know, even if they want to stay and fight like what are we gonna see we are going he I  almost wonder if that actually is worth the billion dollars to him just to mess up this company and and  He's vandalized it essentially already where we've already seen  Depletion and oh my gosh, what a shame and that really isn't something that should have happened  No, I don't know how we forestall it necessarily, but I'm sorry. Sorry about that. He also schmutz

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the  concept of free speech  So like all okay. Hold that thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold that thought because we've been talking about the the corporate law aspect, but let's talk about some other  Aspects of governance. We got to take a break but  It's just a great conversation Kathy Gellis. Thank you so much for joining us  I know you got to go in about half an hour  We're gonna get all the good stuff in here Jeff Jarvis, you're stuck with me stay here  Glenn Fleishman, hey, I wanted to get you on forever. I am looking at the quality of your video  I am looking at your microphone. I am books  I room Raider is giving you five out of five not just for the books ten out of ten  Not just for the books but for the black and white photo of people gazing in awe at what looks like the original  iPhone over your left shoulder and the Steve Jobs time cover

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it's a Ted Turner Ted Turner appropriate for the CNN perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I work I work and his mini type library on his shelf behind them over. Oh, I see that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, tiny light type over there. I think I I think I get the better compliment cuz he's willing to put up with me and my  crappy Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although our personal room Raider here said points off for the electrical tape holding your microphone  We got it we got to work on that we got to work put some green screen on  Anyway thrilled to have all three of you this conversation will continue. Yes, we will get to Google's quarterly report  Maybe eventually there will be no change log though. I've got to have to draw a line here somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The change log by the way really sucks today, so you don't want it folks. There's nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Len and Kathy probably don't know this but this used to be a show about Google and  In order to kind of pay lip service to its origin and name we do every episode something called the Google change log  Which is new stuff from Google and it's gotten worse and worse and worse over the years and at this point  It's just it's a litany of depressing  Not I was almost Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was always gonna put in there a story about how Google was was making it easier to find some commands in  Docs and I thought no even Leo can't do no even even I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Refuse I do want to talk about somebody. I'm very happy to talk about its code Academy  These guys are really really great a way to learn to code 50 million people  learning to code at code  Academy and if you want to change your career there has never been a better time to become a programmer  There's a huge need a demand for programmers and as you probably noticed it's a great job great starting pay  huge  Exciting opportunities all over the country all over the world and with code Academy you can learn to code on your own  terms  50 million people already know code  Academy is the best way to learn to code because code Academy not only teaches you job ready coding skills  But also helps you build unique projects. That's important for your portfolio  Companies will judge you on your you know your github projects you can earn certificates great for putting on your LinkedIn page  You can even prep for technical interviews, so you'll be ready to get that job as soon as you complete it  It couldn't be a better time really  to find a new job not not a  Not a crap job if you've recently quit if you're part of the great resignation  Now is the time to take some time and learn to code with code can be so fun  And I've done this I've taken their Python courses  It's nice because as soon as you start coding a code Academy day one. You'll be writing real code  It's an interactive platform  You're actually getting instant feedback because your code is tested as soon as you submit it even with the very first lesson  So you always know if you're on the right track and there's something  Anybody who's learned to code knows that the very first time a computer does what you told it to do is  It's an epiphany. It's such an amazing thing and it powers most of us who like to code has powered us ever since  So you'll get that magic moment where you hit the submit button, and it goes yeah, and it does what you said it  Oh, it's incredible. You'll be learning at your own pace in an area that you want in fact  One of the best things about code Academy before you even start they have a programming personality quiz not not math questions  Not technical questions, but more about you the stuff that makes you excited the stuff you enjoy doing  I took it and said well you should take our computer science. You know track Lisa my wife did it  She's our she's our CEO and CFO and longtime numbers person  They said you should learn statistics and are because you really know your numbers think they nailed it  So do do at least do that go to code Academy comm  Use a promo code twig take the personality quiz  So you'll get that tailored career advice and course recommendations just to see you know  What do they think you'd be good at what what what is your passion?  You can choose everything from building basic websites to writing the next great AI  No matter your what your experience level you'll be writing real working code in minutes  Python HTML and CSS  sequel  JavaScript they I think they just added us a swift track  So you're really learning real languages that people are using at work right now  It's an interactive platform, so there's never a dull moment. It's so much fun work at your own pace  I think you really want to check this out  And if you've got a young person in your family somebody who has some interest in technology people are always asking me  You know I've got a bright 12 year old. How do I how do I teach them how to code?  This is a great place to go this is not just I mean I I probably code Academy doesn't want me to say that but  It's really great for kids to code Academy  Join over 50 million people learning to code with code Academy see where coding can take you get  15% off your code Academy Pro membership all you have to do is go to code Academy comm and use the promo code twig  promo code twig  cod  CAD  My code Academy comm for 15% off code Academy Pro the best way to learn to  Code coding is so much fun  I encourage anybody who's interested to try it even if maybe you don't know right now that you want to get a job and  In programming it is a wonderful hobby to code Academy comm promo code twig  Thank you code Academy for your support of this week in Google  So Elon Musk  Clearly buys Twitter because he why Jeff  I mean initially I thought always trolling us. It's a pump and dump as I said  Obviously there's more than that. You don't spend 43 billion dollars of other people's money unless you really have a plan  Why does is he a free speech advocate? Is that really what it's all about? I don't think so. Oh  Jeff you're me. I think it's male. It's male ego. It's male ego is primarily the reason  So when Jeffrey Ellison was competing with Scott McNeely to have the tallest yacht  That was cool, okay, that was fine  But now it's like who can have the rocket to the moon who can have the Washington Post

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he also likes to cause trouble. He likes to have attention. He likes all that  Yeah, but I'm gonna say before before the break is that by the way  Imagine right now Mark Zuckerberg sitting back saying you thought you didn't like me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is nearly tweeted something on Monday like congratulations to Mark Zuckerberg for no longer being the most detested  CEO

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a there's an opportunity  Well, you're gonna make them crazy here, but we'll be the first time I think there is an opportunity for  For Facebook and others read it and others to come along and say  What he's doing to free speech we don't agree with this is what free speech means to us  This is what quality speech well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's an opportunity right in the US is celebrating this they see him as a hero  Sean they want to attack everybody and not be stopped for doing Sean Hannity's Twitter account made its  Triumphant return to Twitter pretending that it has anything to do with Elon and not deleting the tweet that got them in trouble in the first  Place yes  So the conservatives say this is victory is it a victory for them remember Elon Musk somebody tweeted Elon Musk stood six hours to shake  Barack Obama's hand  He likes power he wants me around his power. It's not about it's not about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if the way the winds blowing is you know the Republican Party could be back in charge of  Two of the houses both houses of the Congress after the midterms  And if that were to happen he would be positioning himself really well if he unbanned all the banned right wing and far-right people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, when does this deal close vis-a-vis the next election?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  November October November, so it's not that he wants political, but he is a businessman  Right, so is he trying to do what's good for his business other business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't think he's necessarily  The evidence that he's actually good at stuff is actually really slim  When I think one of the problems we have with like American mythology is like oh well if the person has a lot of money  They must have somehow merited it in a way and that's repeatedly shown to be a fallacy  And I think it's you know years a very large exhibit a that that isn't necessarily true  but at a certain point when you have resources you have gravitational pull for other resources because  You have power and people want to be in the orbit of that power and money has interest in  Compounding and stuff like there's a certain point where you have escape velocity where if you've managed to fail your way up  You're gonna keep going up because the physics don't allow you to get clipped very effectively by the way  I want to apologize. I mean that's all that you can say for sure. I want to apologize

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I confused Sean Hannity with Tucker Carlson. I don't know why it's  Tucker Carlson who's back not Sean Hannity  I'm sorry. Yeah, I want to make sure that gets corrected as quickly as possible  But this is this is the animated gift that somebody a Tucker Carlson fan posted  In response to Tucker's we're back. Okay. There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well  No, I think we just have to evaluate things more carefully and like everybody take a deep breath and take a look and let's  understand what is the reality before us which is  You know, I we give I'm sure there's things he can do competently  So I can't completely say he's a doorknob but like you we may be presuming too much  Especially when he's obviously wrong in terms of his how we articulate free speech, which no, that's not how it works  That's not how any of this works. So  Even crediting the business decisions isn't necessarily the thing that we need to do  Especially given that sometimes the things he does on the business thing is cheap like with all the SEC troubles  so I  Think we shouldn't just overly credit it but at the same time not necessarily  underestimate him either because even if he accidentally falls into more or more power more more resources such as the reality that we're dealing with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ishaan who of course we've quoted a couple of times a former CEO of  Reddit  Has a new tweet  Thread today  Which he talks a little bit about this this whole issue and and how difficult it is to do this kind of moderation and  specifically talks about  free speech  Everyone knows this  Implicitly because quote we will defeat spam bots is actually a containment of free speech spam bots are expressing someone's view  He also says it's not what you say. It's how you say it  Here's another misconception people often make perfectly reasonable person a holds and expresses viewpoint X  Okay, crazier volatile person B also holds and expresses viewpoint X quite loudly B gets banned  A then believes that viewpoint X is being censored  It's not the case. It's how you say it not what you say. Is that  Accurate is that the right way to moderate a platform like this and can Elon do something like this?  Is that what he means by free speech? No, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't think this is a fully fleshed out coherent view of free speech because it's not well tethered to what we already know about free speech  So you could make some arguments to say under current First Amendment law in America. I think X Y & Z doesn't make sense  Here's why and here's how it should be different and you could I don't know if I'd agree but you could probably  Intelligently make a cogent argument for why or how things should be different. That's not what he's doing  He's sort of like stomping his feet and denying that gravity exists  Like it's not new he's not the new expert to just all of a sudden show up and say at last  I will think about the things that everybody has just been neglecting all these years. It's not how it works  It's not how any of this works and oh my gosh in this space all  all around  regulators billionaires everybody just stop stop and take stock and figure out  things were  Because if we're not careful we're gonna break stuff and we're gonna be really sad when it's all broken and gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kathy I was just prompted by something you said earlier just a moment ago  Which was I think there might be a lies to reality ratio that determines how rich you can get and so if your ratio is  too high you were Theranos and  Elizabeth  Black get her last name Holmes Holmes. Thank you. So she had show her reach exceeded her grasp by too much  It's not totally implausible what Theranos could have done  You know, it seems like it might be beyond current capabilities and you have Steve Jobs, right?  Who's lies to reality ratio sometimes got bigger or smaller but executed and Elon Musk somewhere in there  he has audacious things that he says that are  that are easily not  backed by  Verifiable information so not as early lies but exaggeration  That have helped him amass these fortunes and he's always willing to push up against that line as far as possible  But then deliver enough so I kind of think that  He doesn't have that same thing going with Twitter that he did with Tesla like Tesla arguably pushed the world closer to electric cars  Faster because Elon is willing to disregard environmental regulation and workplace regulation  Work hours, you know SEC rule like there's a whole litany of things  There's these allegations of racial discrimination in his plants  There's all kinds of things that he disregarded in order to push this technology further and get us electric cars faster  So you can say well, it's reasonably the richest person in the world because he has pushed the entire economy of the world closer to electric cars  But we had to deal with all this stuff and on the Twitter side  It's all abuse like what is it that he's gonna do that's gonna push the world to a better place in spite of all the abuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He causes and inspires. I don't see what it is. Yeah, I don't see a value at I mean to your first point  I might also say what you were like  Is there a ratio and I might say can we control that ratio for gender because I'm not entirely sure the standards are quite the same  There may be certain things of like I don't know really like Jeff was saying  Or he basically said as much like it's boys with toys and like oh well  You know boys will be boys and stuff like that and they're well, of course, you know, we can't help himself  So, you know, he's gonna you know  Infringe a few work rules environmental rules. Like that's just who he is  I mean cuz we did that with Donald Trump for four years as well. Oh, oh, that's how he is and and  our tolerance for  The intolerable I think may need some tweaking and it's not to say that we should have  law that is overly punitive or no mercy or anything like that, but I think this idea of  Too big to fail too big to punish too big to you know  Hold to the same standards that everybody else's is something that I think we that's something that you know  If regulators would like to pay attention to is I think we've got some really big structural problems with how we organize our society  And our law reflects it our issue Twitter is Twitter is the canary that's tweeting away the warning of what is going on  That this is happening is sort of like hang on  I think we have problems because he could be doing this to Twitter  But he could be doing this too in a whole bunch of other contexts and none of them would be good  But I think because it's interfacing with speech and expression and the ability for our community to hold itself together and talk to itself  Talk to each other  That there's this particular kind of pain that will come out of  Essentially what's recklessness and you know the recklessness Nate may hurt him  But the rest of us are going down with him and that's a problem because he can absorb the fall much better than the rest  of us can

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Derek Thompson writes in the Atlantic that  Elon could actually be good for Twitter unlike the board. He actually uses Twitter  And actually likes Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which makes him a candidate  To fix it no no no no for a couple of reasons and one of the things that I want to praise Twitter for at least  Historically is Twitter has been unique and at its best moments  One of the reasons that it tended to grow and improve was because it was very  Responsive to its users and I think one of my favorite things that I don't think I'm making up  I don't think it's apocryphal is even the way we do the at's  Being hyperlinked and the and the hashtags turning into hyperlinks was I think a Google engineering essentially looking at the  The lexicological behavior of its users and saying oh this seems to be how people address each other  Yes, yeah, and they recognize that that's what people were doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Christmas scene added the hashtag and and then Twitter said oh, yeah, that's a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, and the answer and to build the hyperlinks around it like it looked at what the users were doing and  Built responsive design to what the users were doing and that's Twitter at its best  That's any platform at its best when you look at your user community and you build the tools that they need and so he  Doesn't because yes, he's a user and yes  He has his own personal this that or the other thing  But he certainly doesn't have an endemic view of like what most of the lived experience would be of any other  Twitter user other than the other billionaires like it's so exceptional  He can't walk in anybody else's shoes and he's not interested in understanding who else is in any other user shoes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So am I alone on the panel in saying I'm gonna wait and see and give them the benefit of doubt and maybe it'll get  Better or is that just not possible Jeff? You don't see me. Yeah, you're long

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My very own yeah, I will tell myself whatever lie I need to to sleep at night  But I'm not entirely sure than the light of day  I think I have a tremendous sense of optimism of a Twitter of a must controlled Twitter  Except to the extent that it might somehow manage to be a catalyst for  Leave him to his crumbling empire and the rest of us will go build something good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Breaking views just put up a piece  I just put on the rundown bottom of the very long Twitter section that says they don't they don't think he's gonna buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? I was gonna willing to pay a billion dollars to walk away

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure willing but he may be stuck with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean not Levine argues that actually he can't walk away  Like he can't just pay a billion dollars at Twitter board could go to him and shake him down with the deal  So you made the deal because it's a personal contract

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can force him to do it says it could cost as much as 21 billion his personal stake in it  Which I mean, I know Elon has 270 billion  theoretically less today value  But I don't think he has 21 billion hanging around in the closet  So why so they say Elon mess?  This is Lauren Sylvia Silva Loughlin and Gina Sean writing it on writers probably won't buy Twitter  I love the the the anecdote the beginning four years ago Elon Musk vowed to set up a peanut brittle company  To take on Warren Buffett's iconic US confectioner sees candies  Then he changed his mind. It wouldn't be surprising if Musk's deal to buy Twitter went the same way  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I mean this is I go back to the corporate law because you need a path for failure  You can't just decide it  But there's something about this that just smells so iffy because we can see the iffy is all over the place  So this is not how business typically done in any respect

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are paths for failure if there's a mass exodus and suddenly Twitter  You know as a falling apart that that way I give him cause for withdrawing Twitter could withdraw because there is a non-disparagement  Clause in their agreement and clearly he's already violated is already violated that so there are ways out  And a billion dollars is not the end of the world for Elon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might be for Twitter Twitter has earnings coming out shortly, too  And so some people have suspected the earnings may be terrible which would give him an option to get out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe Elon has been trolling us all along knows that these earnings are gonna suck

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know this isn't miscellaneous people have noticed and they thought that some people have thought that that's why the board actually took the deal  Because they thought that the earnings were gonna deflate the stock price and this might be better  I think I mean, it's hard to say what should happen  There's just this is just such a crazy deal that maybe it was the right move  But such a borderline right move that it's hard to say and everything is changing under our feet immediately

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other the other thing that's telling is the actual stock price of Twitter because in theory if Elon's gonna pay  Right fifty four twenty for it. The share price should come close to fifty four twenty anything less is a profit  It's right now at forty eight sixty four. It's dropped two percent today, which tells you that that's the stock market saying  Yeah, we don't think it's gonna happen. If they did they'd be buying we're gonna hedge the bet. Yeah  What happens to parag agro agro are  First of all, I hope he's gone because I can't say his name agro wall. That's a terrible reason and parag. You're a nice guy  I'm sorry. What happens to parag though?  He just became the CEO of Twitter  Is he's gotta be gone, right? Oh, they all have change of change of ownership clauses in their contract

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, he has I think a huge parachute several Jaya got a who's brilliant. Who's the head of safety and law?  Musk set loose his dogs on her. It's just awful. So they're just waiting until they can cash out  They're actually I'm what I am wondering to what they extend down the tree those change in ownership clauses may actually be in other people's packages

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Agro walls golden parachute is 39 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jack Dorsey not commit could based on his 2.2 percent of Twitter make  978 million. No wonder he's happy  Could it be rats deserting a sinking ship going to the moon?  Could it be rats deserting a sinking ship going? Yeah, Elon  Come on  It was awfully quick. They changed their tune very fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, I'm wondering if um, very very very smart people on the twitter side actually do know what's going on  I do not think that if I were to put sort of  Who I think there's more smart people on the well, this is mathematically true  There's more smart people on the twitter side than there are on the alan musk side

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just by sheer numbers numbers alone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think I meant that as more of a compliment that I think twitter may have more smart people in the right smart people  Who may be wise enough to try to guide this more carefully and I don't think that care is necessarily on the musk side

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I don't want to underestimate him either. It does honestly look like a terrible business decision on elon's part

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, unless I mean I would say does he have an incredible plan, but he  He's never given any instance of that  There was a great book a few years ago called the accidental zillionaire about paul allen  Yeah, that came out at exactly the wrong time. I know the author a little bit and  Uh is a great book, but it came out exactly when all of paul allen's foresight paid off  So up until that point you can make the arguments right everything he'd done had been  Happenstance and the timing and then suddenly everything because he was so far ahead everybody else with so many ideas  And then they all paid off and then and then for the next I think 15 years after the book came out  It was like oh no, this guy's a genius but in 2002  He didn't look quite so bright and i'm like does that happen to elon musk  Do we think this guy became the richest person in the world?  Because he had a few good ideas and he'd work people to death  And then this magical thing happened and then rest of his life. We're like, oh no. No, that makes sense  It makes sense. He made all this money. I I don't feel it or the opposite or he's already he's already

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So made the contract with with the devil dr. Faust is here  Um has gotten what he's gonna get

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of a shame  I think we'll see this i'd say this looking back on it  That's something that had such promises twitter and and really was so important for quite a while  in the national zeitgeist  Uh should end this way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I want to make sure that um, i'm very very very sad for this platform that I think a lot of really dedicated people  Have been very genuinely working very hard to build into something cool  but my  Concern is that we don't survive the loss of it because we've so hobbled the ecosystem that we can't get something else  That's new from these ashes. We have to get something better  we need to get more better and I think my my closing comments was to repeat what I was saying is  Take a deep breath people keep breaking things. They don't understand. This is elon musk breaking the quality of his own investment  This is regulators who keep trying to misunderstand the problems and propose solutions  And everybody needs to stop and take a deep breath. That's regulators in washington. That's regulators in the state. I point to  Minnesota's currently trying to move something really this is going to make a mess. Don't do it everybody stop and let's have europe  Name it. Um, we need to be more careful because this whole pretense that at last  We are the smart people who are going to come and take care of everything  Is not smart because it ignores the smart people who have already been there and working very hard at things  And I think we need to listen to who's in the space and who's paying attention and these are hard complex  problems and issues and also really exciting things that provide value to everybody humanity democracy speech communication  This isn't going to be solved overnight not with simple legislation not with a weird takeover thing  Like we need to we need to be careful because this is really important stuff  That an awful lot of people lives livelihoods are all depending on so be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where I got to me. Yeah, I used to I guess I say jeff and i've said this to you privately  It's such a pleasure because I grew up reading you in tv guide and there's always something  I mean, I don't want to age you but it was  It's a it's like seeing a caricature come to life

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I say that every week. Yes, he's a real person

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A real person  I feel the same way glenn I grew up reading him in the well not grew up  We're the same age but I read him in the examiner when he was here in san francisco for years  And i'm very familiar with the byline and so it was a real thrill when when he started working here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I feel I try to explain to my kids, you know  There's a thing called tv guide and we used to get tv listings and you'd look you'd pour over them on the couch  Circle things you'd plug in your vcr plus number

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was really important and it had the easiest crossword in of any major publication  They don't want to make you feel it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  I use twitter I used to get razz fusing twitter because I used it almost like my own personal message board back  When it was younger and I just I just was on it way too much and posted it was kind of always there in the background  And then at some point, you know when you exceed 500 000 tweets one must reevaluate one's life  So I deleted a lot of old tweets. I just deleted most of my history at one point after politics got too complicated to  Leave one's message online. Yeah, a lot of people I know have self-deleting tweets, which is great  they like I think Marco Armit has a  Your creator of overcast and other fine products  He has I believe a thing that just goes through and like after maybe a few days deletes all the tweets older

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, what a good idea actually. It's kind of neat. It's like it's my memory. I have to go back

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I I know I linked to that  I know I talked about that and I use twitter advanced search all the time to just find stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't remember because i'm old well, and in fact, I think I know about you glenn because of your prolific tweeting  I'm sure that's i'm sure that's where I first became aware of you. So it was fun. There was a point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were when twitter was fun. There was yes before right wing politics  And I mean, I don't want to listen listen  I try not to be too biased in anything I say but it's that  It was that there was a particular kind of mode on twitter or mood on twitter and then it wasn't that there's anything  Specifically wrong with people who have right of center beliefs  But there was a specific trench of people on the right and particularly far right and even you know alt and nazi, right?  Who invaded twitter and made it kind of unusable?  Through abuse and other stuff and so it wasn't you know, it wasn't like I don't know  It wasn't like a george will republican who's not a republican anymore, right? He's not even registered as much  It was a very specific attempt and that was game of fires  It was attested with gamergate years ago and then rolled out with the trump campaign and now became the dominant way that twitter gets used  Uh in political battles and other things and so there was that time when it was fun and you'd meet people and be like hey  I made friendships you go to absolutely you'd know 100 people when you came to a new town

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that ended in 2016. I feel like it ended earlier than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, 2014 2013. Maybe it's been a while, but if you're and honestly it wasn't rising tide

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not the content of tweets, uh that ever bothered me. It's the the just as as yushan says the delivery  It's how they say it not behave. They say it's behavior. Yeah  um, and and for many years, I mean  I I got on twitter first in 2006  Quit it briefly because uh, I was concerned about name confusion  Um, and then uh, I think it was ijustine said no you have to be on twitter. So I rejoined in april 2007  And I don't think I have a half million tweets, but I was very active in the early days. How many do I have?  Oh god, I was yeah, but i've deleted i've deleted all up to a few years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's dangerous if you find out how many you've made but you know, just on it even as we do the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is which is much to my chagrin. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's the foundation of my and so many other people's independent careers too is i'm a freelance journalist and um,  Yeah, I became a type and print historian  You know kind of through the back door by by tweeting a lot and meeting other people. I have a I've developed a  group of fellow aficionados of this kind of paper plate that was used to cast metal plates before  Offset printing called flong and I mean you find the most obscure subgroups and we  Talk about I wanted to go to one of glenn's events and it was sold out already

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a long event for god's sake long event sold out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, yeah, it's but it's great. Glenn. I want to show you this. I want to show you this. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a book about gutenberg. No, no, it's a pop-up pop-up. It's a good bird  Pops up a printing press

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did somebody send you that jeff I bought it from the um,  Uh, this was from the uh museum of print in hayborough mass nice great institution. I've never been there  Oh, you you'd fell there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I would just I would have to move in just down the road from mark twain's linotype in hartford, connecticut

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark twain who funded the uh, the uh machine that bankrupted him the typesetting machine that bankrupted hard to believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there is other elon musk news  Hard to believe but it may explain why  Broken-hearted he's buying twitter in the trial the the libel trial between amber herd and johnny dep  Amber heard said she never really loved elon musk  And was filling space with him following johnny dep break up pulling out of the heart  I never loved you elon. I'm buying twitter  Oh, so now we know I think now we know exactly what happened  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh god, he's just incredible that trial. There's too much. We know too much about too many people  Yeah, exactly what twitter's about so yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, just so uh, maybe it's probably not time to eulogize twitter  Or maybe it is  But what are some of your favorite? Uh twitter tropes or twitter moments or uh, you know  things that happened on tour remember when people used to  Uh instead of doing a google search they do a what do they call it a twitter search or a twitter?  a crowd  Mind yeah, what was that called? That was fun. Yeah, hive mind hive mind or something and they would they would say on twitter  Well, what do you think and you'd get hundreds of tweets about a subject?  Oh, those are always fun  I think things started going downhill when people started doing long threads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe 280 characters wasn't a great idea. No, I I was against 280 at first, but no, I think that's wrong  I liked it. I mean I I met glenn  Because I got in all my gutenberg stuff and there's this guy who's doing this amazing stuff around gutenberg  It was purely in twitter. We took a course. He also it was because of him. I I saw that he was taking a course  uh in um, in the gutenberg bible we ended up taking it together virtually it was great. I have my um,  Uh gutenberg my my book history walks  Uh twitter list is my happy place when all this gets to be too much lists. I go there. There's another thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  twitter, uh  Doesn't really bring to the foreground but is one of the most powerful interesting things  I know that I follow your uh, I followed during the covet pandemic your covet  Experts list jeff. That was really a great thing to have  Um people don't use lists all that much but that was another nice feature of uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  early early twitter we I remember I always go back to his uh, you know the drill account the uh,  That dril which is this guy. I think he finally admitted who he was but it's it's this whole uh,  um  He just does these amazing strange tweets that are incredibly zeitgeist and funny and yet impossible  To explain even in context and there's one he made many years ago  I'm not owned. I'm not owned. I continue to insist as I slowly shrink and transform into a corn cob and some days  That's the only thing  It's just it's just all of what people are doing right? It's just uh, it's the 20  2011 it just  Summarizes so much of discourse people saying, you know, especially people just they start shouting louder and louder. I didn't i'm correct  I'm not wrong. It doesn't matter that you have tapes that show me saying i'm lying as they shrink into a corn cob

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, that's a good point. One of the things elon says is everybody will have to have be authenticated use their real names  One of the best things about twitter is the parody accounts the fake accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, the weird times news spot is the is the best of the time it is is you follow that I hope yeah, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brilliant and the times is on it. Is that is that that one? No, no, no, no, this is different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is doug j balloon the the ny times news bot  And and so it's it's it's inside his head. I presume it's his he calls himself dog, but it's made up name  Where he comes up with the headlines that he's sure the times is going to do  And then sometimes he tweets an actual times headline and it's like is this the onion is this news bot?  It's the oh no, the times really didn't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  um, and there is also i've just found searching for that a  A  Account called impressions of the times that creates uses an ai to create illustrations from times headlines. Oh, that's pretty isn't that interesting?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When muskva worships sunken russian disinformation faces a test was the inspiration for this  Beautiful work of art kind of lovely. Yeah impressions of the times. That's a new account  Uh, we early on we, um, we wanted we tried a novel  Uh, I think it was called novel 140 where you could only write a 40 140 characters  Of the novel and we had a bunch of people each writing between  Succession the novel never got very far, but it was kind of interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought twitter would be used more for fiction at times  Yeah, we've seen examples of it and one thing I was hoping is that people would play games on twitter  These are the things that so so twitter has left all this low-flying hanging fruit  Why not not gamify twitter but not I mean you could have scripted events or even improv events happening among accounts  That would be incredibly fun to observe  In a sort of special space or a timeline  When you lose your cat, you know you you post hey, I lost my cat and people in timbuk2 are retweeting it  Yeah helpful. I appreciate the sentiment, but why not have regional local twitter sections instead?  They're like well clubhouse obviously a great idea  Let's make twitter spaces and do audio on a text oriented medium. That's been very successful  So I just feel like there's a it's not that there's a possibility of ideas  I just don't feel like they push in the right direction  So one part of me is like all right in the best complexion  Even though I don't think musk anything he said indicates trust in this direction in the best way  It could be what if he did bring in a bunch of new ideas or brought in a really interesting  challenging staff that just totally shook things up and they kept the best of twitter and  Tweaked it and added stuff. We actually liked I mean, it's not infeasible. It's unlikely  But there's so much room for those kinds of things to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, he may have to do that because I don't know how much of  The current twitter team is likely to be around when he walks in the door

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were asking about that earlier  Is that if you have options with strike prices and so forth you you join because you hope there was an upside and if the  Upside is exactly five fifty four dollars and twenty cents. There are things they can do to keep employees where they  Uh, even though it's a privately held company they can use different valuations  So there's more to sweeten it  But if you join in the last couple of years, you might have no opportunity to have an upside  So why would you stay you just have your you know, keep your options you have  Your options will be redeemed or or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  um if they weren't doing stock one of the reasons silicon valley companies go public is so that they have a liquid market for  options that they can then hire employees with private companies  I've been screwed by private stock in private companies. It's great. You know, there's a long. Oh, yeah  Sorted tail there, uh  If it's not a public company forget it, right? It's not a real option  So there's that's a good reason to stay public and that's the thing. I had phantom equity

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah in entertainment weekly and in advanced local. Sure. I had phantom equity in tech tv  Yeah, finally stop our cheers away  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I almost had phantom equity in cnet, but uh that that didn't materialize. So never mind  Um speaking of cnet, what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Glenn right here is an expert in typography. I want to get his view

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of the typographical of artistry of the slogan. So yesterday a number of people were shocked when they went to cnet.com  Let me refresh the page so you get the full effect  And what is the typeface here that they're using?  it's a kind of archaic looking glenn you might  you might recognize this there's a sans serif menu bar, but the  But the headlines are in some sort of weird serif

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ifty tool the font's called sentinel. I have an ifty to called what's that font and I click on it  That was fast. It tells you what the font is sentinel. Yeah monument grotesque is the uh, the  aptly named for tech money  Uh, and then uh, yeah, it's sentinel. These are probably open source fonts. Uh, yeah, it's a little bit old-fashioned. It has horrible  Uh quotation marks though, don't you think they're like straight curves? Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like when you forget to use the right quotation marks. Yeah, yeah, but it's tilted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like an inch mark or a foot mark rather  Don't get your inch and foot marks together or the or the stonehenge order will be the wrong sign. There's some very odd

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like look at tv look at the uh,  The turning there is very strange

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's I don't know. You know, there's a trend that every tech site  Uh in a lot of other sites move from intricate designs that maybe were over designed to it's just white  It's just some black text on a white background. Well, yeah, once you get past to differentiate once you get past the uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The the sentinel you get a very bland kind of sans serif for the rest of it  Uh, I've made a lot of money doing this redesign. It's a big redesign. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at that a grotesque by the way is just a uh, a sans serif font. Oh, okay  Yeah, it's the old old term for gothic. It used to be called. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is also called. Yeah, like uh, so glenn when I when I started entertainment weekly, um  I um  We had we had a logo that was controversial because it was it was tilted and they didn't like it  Duh, duh, duh  And so the the bosses came after us going fix this and you gotta do this you gotta do that  So I go after the design director by the way, we had design problems  But he said this the font was grotesque. I said well, can you find something that's not grotesque?  How about this black letter do you like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Helvetica is derived from uh, accidents grotesque is the the rich is like the the predecessor

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is the etymology of grotesque? That's very strange. Oh, it's one of these german

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a it's one of those german things. It's uh, there's a german derivation of it because it doesn't mean grotesque as we speak it  right, um  It's it's a specific  Thing that became applied to like a uh, uh, what's the thing like not burlesque? Um, uh  You talk about something me over elaborate  Um, um, um, brokoco. No, bro. No, uh bro. Right. It's kind of like grotesque is just a combination word that comes from that  So it's but it sounds it it meant more like interesting and fantastic  And so it was a different when this when serifs were everything then a grotesque was a different was used for display faces  The same thing like a gothic, uh, like franklin  The franklin gothic typeface is a classic san serif from before san serifs were designed like helvetica helvetica kind of ushered in a new  Way of designing typefaces without serifs  Um, so yeah, you can get these hilarious names for uh typeface. So it's originally g-r-o-t-e-s-k

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, um not the not the traditional grotesque. Did you know that there was a typographer a type designer who was hitler's prisoner?  No, I don't know about this at all. You don't oh goody. Oh, I don't want to  so so, um, uh  You know you've seen the gutenberg, uh, uh  Type which is which is gothic and not in our sense gothic is oddly we over here call that helvetica  But gothic there is is that stuff looks like the gothic cathedral, right?  And it's what the german publications all used and there was actually a debate  In the german parliament about what the official font of germany should be and back and forth  and and and fracture one  and hitler  Liked it for a while  but uh, then he decided that um, uh  It shouldn't be because all the lands they were conquering couldn't read it  And so they decided it was a jewish font. Oh, meanwhile, there's a guy named jan  chicold  Uh, i'm not i'm gonna mispronounce his name. Um, exactly. He's pronounced exactly correctly though  Good, uh who pronounced wrote a book called the new typography  In which he called for a single typeface without ori ornamentation. No serifs. No nothing  and um  He condemned the german front fracture that it was the the exclusivist character of that  And this was a dangerous view  and so, um  He said that his views would have died anyway  But a few years after his book hitler came he was accused of creating un-german typography and art  And so they arrested him for his font  And he got a passport out to leave germany and became the designer of penguin

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, i'll be damned. I can tell you the so fraktur was so associated with german  This is a quote. I i'd learned a few years ago auto von bismarck the you know, the um, oh, what was he?  You know, he's the uh chancellor of germany in the 19th century president president. Sorry  And he said he said if I can speak some german  Which is I don't read german books in latin letters  He was to send them back if someone sent him a so was everything in fractor  Yeah, it was impossible to read. It's very difficult. I used to read someone. I took german classes  You get a book that was printed. Oh, it's hard. Oh, it's so hard k and the l look  It's it was hard for the I believe I read a statistic  I think it was people who read fraktur read it 40 more slowly than reading the same text in latin alphabet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does fit the pronunciation of german though. Yeah, it's very very nice  I always I think if I look at that now i'm i'm becoming literate  I always look at this thing was like gothic or something, but fractor is very specific

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's yeah, it's fraktur was a very specific. Yeah, it's got a uh  There's a there's a typeface designer who um designed a this guy named uh, uh  Bertold volpe who designed albertus, which is a face once you see it you will see it everywhere  It was used in the prisoner 1960s prisoner tv series  it's just ubiquitous for having a certain kind of uh  It feels like a unique appearance, but it is everywhere and volpe was jewish and he had to  Leave over, you know sort of over typeface design also in the 30s because he was no longer allowed to work even though he had  Uh, he had just developed in fact a very nice frac to her face and then went to england was sponsored to go there  Was sent to australia by boat during the war through u-boat infested waters with other german nationals even though he had to flee germany  Then they brought him back  And um lived a long happy life and made a lot of very nice book covers. I shall be using albertus from now on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a wonderful all of my all of my printing and instead of the quick brown fox  I'm going to start saying waltz bad nymph for quick jigs vex  That's great  Do you you know, do you spend a lot of money glenn on fonts and typeface digital fonts? I don't I have uh, I just one could

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could yeah, you could blow a fortune on them, which is great too because the market for them is smaller  There's some great stories too is the person who developed the typeface you think of as the harry potter typeface that's used on merchandise  Uh, it's guy, uh rich kegler of p22  Uh, he's not allowed to disclose the term  So if you ask him, he can't talk about it  But uh, was it warner brothers owned it at the time they licensed the font for certain usage  Then they stuck it on merchandise without having the license for it  So I expect there were a lot of zeros behind whatever number that was settled for  But it was right when harry potter was incredibly popular  So if you'll see a face you'll be like, oh, that's that face  That's that harry potter face and it's because of that popularization  But I own a bunch of p22 fonts own some monotype fonts, but I bought a lot of typefaces a long time ago  Uh, yeah, it's not that one. There's one it's on like merchandises and bags and things  It's kind of the book. Uh, sometimes you'll see albertus on harry potter  Sorry, I don't mean to devolve into the no no no no, and I've got one more question

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean i'm so sick of twitter. I'm much rather talking about this  Uh, I we will get to the google, uh, that google quarterly results in just a second  But uh, I I want to ask you so there are a lot of free fonts for instance  This albertus is being offered for free on cofonts.com  Are those not as good as you know the fonts that you might get from well-known foundries that cost hundreds of dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, because uh in the united states specifically and in certain other countries in the world  You can't copyright the appearance of a typeface. You can only copyright the underlying  Code that makes up the typeface so someone can't copy your postscript or open type code and produce it  But after some lawsuits I want to say in the 90s about it. Uh, it became clear that you could  Essentially re-outline typefaces and then release them. So when you buy but the the key thing is there's all the kerning, uh, and  Special tweaking that goes into a font. They can't take that because that's software. So the makers of duplicate fonts  Some of them are adaptations and are perfectly good fonts of their own right and you can go to google fonts and  There's a group called is isle. It's uh, there's a group that supports  Uh lesser used typefaces or lesser use scripts that are used for typefaces  So native american languages and languages in asia and other countries where they have developed really high quality typefaces  Which often include latin characters and characters in these languages that aren't otherwise supported and give them away for free  So you can go and find super high quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Free or phenomenal what's available? Oh my god, where would I find that because  I I am a font nerd, but I don't want to i've spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on fonts for no good reason  Uh, and I would like good quality fonts, you know most most google most  Linux and mac distributions offer a lot of fonts for free for download the nerd fonts and so forth  They're I collect programming fonts monotype fonts  Um, where can I go to get good fonts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For free out of this group. Well, I mean google fonts is a great source and if you if you literally search on um,  I wish I could remember the name of this i'd compile a list at one point  But there are places that will that list if you can find a place that lists google fonts and some other  foundries you'll find lists of  Typefaces that are freely licensable but designed, you know in-house essentially or designers contribute and uh,  They're often licensed for you know unlimited use or sometimes for non-commercial purposes  but uh, yeah if you find albertus in most places, that's a  copied version and um  And it won't have the quality of it and uh, actually a friend of mine  If all I became friends with because he did the new version of albertus for monotype at toshio magari  He developed a kind of revival version of albertus that is fantastic and comes in greek and russian  Cyrillic and uh has a little picture of its designer vertovulpe is one of the characters. It's very that's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a uh favorite body type font

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh gosh, i'm I am a big fan of minion. I've used a lot. I like minion too. That's an adobe  Yeah, that's from the 80s as roger slimback designed that and uh, it's just an amazingly  Personal typeface. I use a lot of um, I use bimbo sometimes again. That's a that's a font that dates back to the  dates back to the  hypnerotomachia polyphole the uh book printed in the  1400s uh  About dreams. Um, so there's a lot of yeah, a lot of safest like that  There's a great story, you know about how this fellow in uh, who I got to meet him when I was in london. He  Figured out that uh, well the 1910s this person who was slowly losing his mind had had a falling out with uh with uh  He was a printer needed falling out with his business partner  And the business partner agreed to let the printer keep the typefaces and the punches from which they are made  until uh  Some certain period of time I think until his death or something like that  And so the guy who's losing his mind slowly starts dumping all of the type into the tems  He carries pounds of it in his pocket. It's beautiful font ever the doves bible font. Oh, it's incredible. It is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Magnificent, uh thomas cobden sanderson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, cobden sanderson and you can read his journals and you can see how the man it's really said you did working with lead  Maybe he was having lead poisoning. I don't know and then when it's all done  He triumphantly announces that he dumped it all well  So this fellow robert green says well  What if I could figure out where it was and he pinpoints where he thinks it is and he finds type and then  He uh hires the divers from the city of london and they dive and they retrieve, uh, I don't know hundred odd pieces  I've been to his home and held some of the dove type in my hand and it's what a wonderful story  Now the funny part is I have found two maybe three other stories in which type has been thrown  in a pit of a bit of peak or  As in despair into a body of water type designers are nutty people. They are maybe  Maybe it's the lead. Yeah, I have a book. I want to write called the lead heave in the lake. I think something  Bad is that  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo if you look up dove bible

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll see what I think is the most gorgeous well, there's a good and i'm showing it right now a good bbc  uh news story on the whole recovery of the fonts and the  Of the type and all of that you can buy robert has a modern rendition

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has spent so much time looking at the work of the dove press

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is this is tell me if i'm wrong here. This is derived from what is my favorite base font, which is jansen  That's right. That's right. So it's a type

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my god, we have we have fallen into the type hole here. Yeah, sorry. This is what happens. That's what happens  You know, I love it though. I love it up here with type. It's it's uh fast  It's very nerdy, but it's fascinating by the way if you go to glenn.fun  What is that font because that is a nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've chosen a nice typeface for your uh, what if I uh now you have to write I think it's uh  Now and of course the one typeface. I don't know is the one that's on my own site the one you chose  It is I have to load it and use my tool. It's a very nice grotesque font. It's museo sands  It's a modern typeface that comes in lots of weights and uh,  That's the other way you can do it too is if you have an adobe  It's gonna sound like an ad it is not an ad  It's not an ad if you have an adobe creative cloud subscription  They include what we used to be a former service they bought have all of the type kit  And with type kit you get a light included you can use  Tons of fonts including as web fonts many of them are available

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I have a link to a bunch of sites is the asterisk here a dingbat or is it an actual the actual asterisk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a unicode character. So it's a rendition in museo sands of an eight-pointed star  And the funny part if you're on mobile, it's a totally different character. Oh, you want to talk about unicode now? I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, this is the greatest thing about being a nerd uh is or a geek is  It doesn't matter what the topic is if we can dive deep and get some passion  It's fascinating and I love I love going down that rabbit hole so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So much fun. There's such great characters in in the font world  It's you'd be you'd be surprised that that story glenn just told is my very favorite. It's gotta be the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only I never

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Glenn I know you study this formally you you you know  You're actually a designer and you've and you've you've actually you says in your webpage the last

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Last generation at least the only thing I know is and it's a wonderful book  I've recommended many many times is stop stealing sheep. Oh, yeah, eric spiekermann. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just funny. I just was exchanging tweets with him on uh on the twitter machine  It's why part of why I know him is because of twitter  A fantastic designer typeface designer very interesting guy. I have a giant book if you look behind me  Oh, it's two below below. It's a book called  Uh, what is it? Hello? I am eric and it's about it's written about him

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, very interesting cat. I like this book so much apparently i've purchased it twice according to amazon. I don't know why  Maybe that was as a gift. I don't know. That's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's been eric developed this way of doing what he calls digital letterpress as he uses a  A modern machine that makes plates from digital files in a very particular way  He had to spend 60 000 euros to modify an off-the-shelf device and then he can print  On a an old letterpress on a automated like motorized sort of one of the last modern letterpresses  These very high quality books. So he's done a you know, relatively small series  But I have a few of them and they are they are absolutely letterpress  They feel like it but they're this interesting hybrid between old and new and I mean that still has the bite. Yeah  Yeah  It's the bite  It's very black ink because letterpress ink is often much blacker than the they can use with offset because of the way it applies to  Paper and anyway, it's the intersection between that old and new that I think is the most fun is there's a lot of stuff  That's you know vr and ar is totally new and it's its own beast but where you can hit  Physical and digital things together. I just think you know 2d printing and 3d  3d cutting and 3d printing that kind of thing somebody in our irc chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Has discovered  The unicode for the eight-pointed star and put it in our irc chat  If you have a client that does unicode it really looks good. It's nice. I had a look it up myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Warning is in ios. It looks like a weird. It's a little weird. It's like a little starburst instead of this beautiful  Thing that you can see in a desktop browser. It's really nice. Yeah, unicode every every platform a new a new experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google did not have a very good quarter  It's interesting. We were talking on windows weekly about microsoft which had an excellent quarter  And and you know lots to celebrate until paul mentioned but by the way  With google's terrible quarter their revenue far exceeded the total revenue of microsoft their revenue in  advertising alone  So you have that puts it a little bit in perspective  um the  It's google said it may be the war. I don't know but digital ad sales  Down quite a bit was hurting badly. So that may be tiktok  Maybe from tiktok youtube ad revenue, which the analysts had thought would increase 25  Only increased 14 percent. See this is the problem with this. It's a miss but it's not a drop. It's it's a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's yeah, it's still a lot apple's uh, when apple stuck in the do not track me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could be it could be part of that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I think youtube suffers less than that because they feed people their first person

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So first parties in fact benefit from apple's att because att means you can't  Track people as a third party google doesn't need to  That's totally true. They are the first party. They're the first party for everything you do  Although I thought it was interesting after all the time we've talked we had richard gingress on to talk about google amp jeff  You know, I was not a big fan  Jeff tried to explain why it was a good thing google's amp seems to be now losing ground. It's over. Yeah  Yeah, which is surprising

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because you know and and fine you can complain about what I was there when when it was first discussed with the newspaper industry  And the news industry and one of the google executives who was there not richard just said you guys are never going to trust us  To do this. Yeah, you need that's what happened. You're not going to trust doing that's what happened  They tried to make it open source, but it never fully was but the truth underlying was still the case media companies effed up the web  Miserably threw all kinds of crap on that's true  Editorially plus the ad departments and the technology departments just just just horrible slow miserable rotten irritating pages  So there was a need  For an amp. Uh, it just that wasn't the messiah to be had I guess and I think that generally people had the attitude

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just like a land grab from google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, it just and it doesn't really wasn't because it wasn't that's the thing people assume google has these land grabs  They got plenty of land right like they don't need dues. They don't need a happen. They got they got plenty of land, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all the problem for google. I think it didn't solve enough of a problem for everybody else

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why that was the real problem was yeah, the the newspapers weren't seeing the revenue  Uh, it was hiding who was looking at their stuff google was getting all that information not the newspapers  youtube advertising revenue six point eight seven billion dollars  Uh wall street's mad because they thought it would be more sounds like it's yeah per quarter. Yeah, that's important to say per quarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they were fools to have bought it for what was it 1.6 billion? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's definitely generating for them. They've started they've announced they're going to start putting ads  On youtube, what do they call it the shorts the the their their competition with tiktok, which that new thing  Yes, they're tiktok that out yet and it can and it confirms I think what some of what you just said, which is  TikTok must be hurting them  a little bit  um  Ad growth revenue slowing but not  shrinking  uh  You google told shareholders youtube shorts is doing great  Don't worry about tiktok. It's not all about tiktok  um  Let's see. That was a headline from tech crunch  Ruth porat the cfo said the slower rate of growth is more a reflection of last year's  Unprecedented gains that may be true, too. I mean even netflix which had a terrible quarter  But that was coming off of a gigantic growth through pandemic  Maybe that's this maybe that's the thing ad revenue in 2021  Q1 had increased 49

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On youtube, that's not what people reality is now competing with uh youtube is uh, you can do real things

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go into concert halls and see people. So yeah, right right that too competition from reality hurts youtube revenues. That's a good headline

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I hardly used youtube I felt like for general viewing  Before the pandemic and now I feel like it's kind of the first stop  That we put on the agenda partly because we watch a lot of uk tv shows that are available through it  But also it just um, it has gotten to know us maybe a little too well  Although my 15 year and I you're an old and I joke all the time  We're watching something last night and the ads that threw up were like I don't need that medication  We're not investing in that we don't buy cars like that  They and we're like, oh, this is good youtube completely doesn't know who we are like whatever they're doing for personalization  They've gotten us totally wrong. You know what I find interesting though glenn

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly the same ads I get get on cnn  So interesting. It's the same advertisers. It's big pharma. It's automotive  And actually in a way that's a real story because for a long time digital  And I know this from podcasting was looked down upon by brand advertisers. They said oh, no, you can't do brand advertising  On digital. Yeah at scale. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So by the way back to your point though about youtube there's there's a paper that just came out from  Colleagues at cuny by the way and others  That debunks the the youtube rabbit hole  Argument and says that the worst stuff is is viewed  Little by few people and they come to it not from the algorithm. They come to it from outside links  It's just a serving platform for the for the far right  Which is interesting, too

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know research facts. Oh, yeah, that's I know is that facts is that facts? I don't know  researchers, okay, must be true  other than us  Yeah, I mean my empirical research is  Google's best known for bikini rich content, but that's just me. Well, that's your problem  I never see any of that. I don't know what you're watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey by the way, by the way, this is i'm serious about this  So the last week people have been talking about how there's porn on twitter  I have never seen any porn on twitter. Does it think i'm presbyterian still you just have to look for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't stop it. They don't stop it  So you have to uh, that's actually that there's a really good example of why twitter works  You follow who you want to follow i've never seen an inch of bare flesh  On twitter, well i'll send you a list

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It only comes up in if you search for certain things and I think flong is one of them by the way  Seems like innocuous terms and then flong means something in the tagalog  I think because I see it come up in posts from people from the philippines and i'm like, I don't know what flong means but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not what I think well, and that's an interesting, you know, elon says free speech, right? Well pornography is protected by free speech  Spam is protected by free speech  Uh a lot of things that elon may not want on his platform are protected by free speech  so it's a very uh  You know tumblr got rid of the porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I mean you heard it immensely because it wasn't really important it was  Alternative creation. That's the problem. Well interpreted as I mean it was there were you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could go and find naked pictures of people. I mean if that's what it was  I  Don't know. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a if you if you look at where the sex workers go you can see what's going on with the platform because  They're the least tolerated people on the planet. And so when a platform, uh, you know soup  It's you think they might start with nazis and fascists and people who want to overthrow governments and commit violence  But they usually start with sex workers and trans people and people who lack a strong political voice in the country in which they're  Which they live and you know, so that's again sex workers are always the canary in the columbus like we have to stop this problem  So we're going to ban uh  Sex workers and that will fix our platform and hurt the sex workers every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's from the back into the arms of of pimps and make their lives worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So like the back page thing like all these things that are they're ostensibly they're all about their puritanism as opposed to  Providing if they're you know, you have to provide other opportunities people if you want to do things  You don't you don't ban them from a platform in order to protect them  But it tells us what else is coming on a platform because it's always first the weakest people with the least voice and who will defend

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Them the least well, so then upwards from there. Well, isn't congress now looking at essentially a return of  Uh sasta and festo i'm trying to remember what the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's always simmering there because it's very easy to sell your constituents that you're doing something  If you tell them you're banning people from something  Yeah, I mean this is why all there's been all the cries of pedophilia and grooming and so forth is it's a very emotional appeal  And right, you know, and who's there who's for that nobody's for that. Yeah, that's right. It's a very easy  I'm i'm gonna you know, you know if you're old enough as we are and you remember the satanism panic of the 80s  This is a replay of that just at its incredibly magnified scale  But it's exactly the same playbook and exactly as ridiculous it was it was it was daycare, right?  Everybody thought that yeah. Yeah. Yeah people they're eating babies and i'm like show where are the babies who are missing?  Yeah, they're the babies exactly  Where yeah, this is you know  I did this piece for boing boing a few years ago because people were throwing around a number about human trafficking  And if you dig into the numbers, they said there's x hundreds of thousands of children go missing a year  When you look at the numbers missing can be as little as four hours  It can be that somebody didn't come home at the time expected it was reported briefly  And when you dig down to it, there are something like under 200 incidents a year  In which a child goes missing because of strangers involved. It's almost always people they know almost always close family members often a custodial dispute  Or they got lost stayed at school long or a parent didn't realize they were out  And so we have this incredible national panic, you know, lennor sconesi has been a great voice on that and she's I think libertarian  Maybe in focus, but she she's a very interesting person always loved her npr commentary  I mean, she's been a great voice for the and she did that tv series even the reality show about  How do you get parents to  Understand the actual risk instead of these risks that poke up  But it's so easy so primal to say my child could get hurt  There are 600 000 children go missing each year footnote. Well, really it's only  200 or something and you listen to that top number and you keep your children indoors

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at the long-term consequences kids don't play outside anymore because of stranger danger  You know, I saw some kids playing outside the other day. I was stunned

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We used to we give our kids a we give our kids a box a broken glass just like my parents gave me  And we put them in the back seat and drive around. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what your yeah, and what about the razor blades and the apples on halloween night? I gotta ask you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my favorite

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My parents would go to parties and we would my sister and I would sleep in the back of the station wagon  Unlock parked out front. That's right while they drank and then drove home after a few more days and there were no seatbelts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they were driving with they're driving with a drink and one in a cigarette the other and using their elbows to steer  We came out we're fine. Yeah, we survived. Oh, no. It's uh, yeah, there is the balance  I unfortunately I live in seattle which you think it was a pretty calm city and we didn't let our kids play out  Side much because we were near we're in kind of a fairly residential part of seattle and the streets are too dangerous for  From cars. We honestly that's the biggest

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For me the biggest threat to humanity is it's for so many reasons as cars  For so many we're safer in the street

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We would let our kids run free if the if the roads the people that didn't drive, you know in our 25 mile an hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're very excited in san francisco and jeff. I know you joe jfk boulevard through golden gate park  Unbelievably in a very controversial vote. They just voted to close it to automotive traffic forever. Oh my gosh, that's fantastic huge  Yeah, uh  And uh, it was extremely controversial. It leads all the way through, you know golden gate park  Incredible, it will make the park a hundred times better for roller skaters bicyclists

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The pedestrians the people out there. They're absolutely will we have a long stretch in seattle lake washington boulevard that they close in the summer  At certain points for biking only days and during the pandemic they put on all these safe streets where they closed off city streets  Except for local residents and set, you know put bumps in and so forth and they've been doing incredible traffic calming  And I just think you know, it it hasn't because of the reduced traffic volume we have which may be forever  Maybe we I mean not it won't not that it won't ever go back up. Well, that's what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We all saw how great it was in pandemic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, right if 25 percent of workers are now working from home one to five days a week  Yeah, you don't need as much maybe we'll become the netherlands. Yeah. Oh, wouldn't that be nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to ride my bike everywhere. I really do and it's too dangerous. I'm too scared to do I just don't dare  You have driven it to your to the studio. I used to ride to work until  Uh, I saw a ghost bike on the bridge that I cross over every time a guy got squished  Uh, it was broad daylight  Uh a driver an elderly driver who was on meds  Veered over crushed the guy on the bridge. There's very little bike path there. So it is a very dangerous  Crossing point. I saw that ghost bike. I said and I haven't ridden my bike since  Oh, i'm sorry. It breaks my heart. I love it. Uh,  I is my hope that in my I know I only have a few years left but in my lifetime  We might be able to get rid of personal car ownership so I can ride my bike when I am 90. I am hoping I am praying  Uh, google says sundar pachai says the pixel phone is pixel six is the fastest selling pixel ever  Which is faint praise indeed  They also said that and this is probably of more interest and maybe to help the stock price  Uh, they are going to do a 70 billion dollar  buyback of alphabet stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So before or after the split?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, let me see. They didn't say when they were going to do it. So is this did the split happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe it did already. Yeah, I hate buybacks buybacks are the worst the worst thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well shareholders like it because uh, you know, it increases their value  But it does kind of obscure the real value of a of a company with antitrust going after them. What can they buy?  They're not going to get them in trouble. Yes, apple has done very well with its stock. I mean look at apple stock  Uh, because they have a huge trove of cash and they've got nothing better to do with it. So they buy back their share 70 billion dollars  um  Alphabet purchased more of its own stock than any other public company last year except for apple  Uh, so it was apple google or i'm sorry alphabet and then i agree with glenn

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those resources could build they could build that next twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They could they could they could give us back. Why is it? Okay, so it's bad because you should put it into rnd  Is that why it's bad? Yeah, yeah, it's not it's not productive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does it does reward shareholders, but you could do you know, you could do a special dividend if you wanted to reward shareholders instead of  trying to I mean, they're always playing games with uh,  Stock price because even though stock price, you know  If if apple's stock were a thousand dollars a share it shouldn't be the stock shouldn't go up if there's a stock split and it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, that's the weird part of yeah shareholders. Yeah, the stock market's not rational necessarily. So that's part of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's part of it as well as they want to increase they'd like to tweak their  Uh, you know tweak their numbers by having less outstanding share fewer outstanding shares facebook shares also spiked

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On better than expected quarterly earnings

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  um  18 in extended trading today  Jesus earnings topped estimates revenue disappointing though  Again, this is beating the all you gotta do is beat the analyst's estimates in your and everybody's happy earnings per share  272 versus two dollars and 56 cents expected  Revenue 27.91 billion versus 28.2 daily active users 1.96 billion  Almost there almost so close to two monthly active users 2.94 billion  ARPU which everybody talks about now ARPU which is the average revenue per user  Nine dollars and 54 cents, which also beat the street  So good news for uh meta  I'm having a hard time calling an alphabet in meta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am the block head the head of block

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'd like to give us something to talk about the issue with meta  I think as it always is is that they make their  ARPU is a great number to look at if you dig it out or dig out to the regional numbers  They make a lot of money from people in north america  A bit of money from people in europe and a lot of nothing. I mean very very little from people in the rest of the world  And they don't seem to have been able to improve that over time. It remains kind of in that division  So their growth has to come from markets that are smaller and more fully established and you know  That's going to be their long-term problem, especially as they have this, you know, the negative pressure against advertising against how they're governed  Uh sheryl sandberg against sheryl spamberg personally, I think  against zuckerberg  Unlike twitter facebook has classes of shares though, you know, so zuckerberg can never he can ever lose his control of facebook  Twitter has no classes of share. I looked this up when musk was talking about taking ownership  It's so funny that you said that I did this most they did not build the company that way  They built them what I think I I think classes of shares for publicly held companies without very specific rules should be  not within the regulations because then it doesn't give sheryl as a way to  Influence or change the direction of a company ever it feels like it's we're going to give you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to give you some shares in the company. We're not asking for your opinion though  Yeah, we we just want you know, you could participate in our success

Transcript:  It's great when we met last one week ago. We were saying oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel really bad for them because I do too. I don't I don't have it's like there's a lot of there's a lot of  Media sites and media companies and everything that you know  I might have be a negative about like do I want them to succeed do I think cnn i'm pretty neutral about I think  They do good reporting they're interesting and they hired interesting people a lot of people stake their careers. I'm moving i'm changing jobs  That's where I feel bad  Yeah, and then it's like you're not as a corporate and then it's but but you understand the time  I kept reading the timeline like how did this happen? It's like oh because they were they were actually unlike an elon musk  allegedly they were completely scrupulous about not talking during the  Period before the merger closed when they weren't supposed to talk about significant business stuff. They call it gun jumping

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  oddly enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they didn't they did they did the right thing and everyone involved in it did the right thing and for cnn  They should have launched that service before the merger because they had invested in it and it was a smart long-term

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Move that they couldn't predict but discovery didn't want them to do it discovery couldn't tell them that  Uh, but the minute discovery comes in looks at the financials. They said okay now you're closing it

I'm sure chris wallace will land on his feet  I'm not exactly crying for him think he'll have a problem. No, but uh, a lot of producers  Yeah, yeah a lot of producers a lot of talent  And uh  I I think also when you looked at cnn plus and saw that there was no live news  It was like well, why would I want that?  I mean as just purely as a customer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there wasn't a lot there, but I guess they you know  But they they promoted it so much and hadn't built out a a service  I mean honestly, isn't that the fox news plus whatever they call it. It's pretty thin too  There's only a few original shows  I've not i've not been a subscriber i've read about people have subscribed to test it out  But a lot of the news services seem to be kind of thin and I don't know who their audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we've talked about this. Of course, they don't want to offend the msos the cable operators  Who are their bread and butter so they cannot, you know  Cannibalize the real product  Even though streaming is the future  And they know it so they're kind of it's it's kind of what planting a flag.

Transcript:  We'll be here wall fetishism though. It's also everybody's gonna have a paywall and sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not all of you are worth the paywall.

I don't want bezos to own the post  I love it that these people are patrons of good journalism. I don't want them to run  the shop though, so the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, but you know what the ultimate this is I don't want to go back to musk  You know, the ultimate thing would be he buys twitter the deal goes through and then he says  I'm not bringing any of you back at all. You all suck and and it would all be the best troll for him to just to not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Let him be there. It's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, I think we have done  Uh everything we need to do any I want to talk more about typefaces to be honest with you  But uh, I don't think the audience will tolerate a bit more of that. But you know what? Here's my proposal  We will have glenn back very very soon. You're just great  Love that. Thank you. I pleasure. Have you ever been on any of our shows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I you know  now you this is gonna be the funniest question you ever asked and i'm gonna need to run a clip of this for the  incomparable because  I was on we do a game show at the incomparable and every two weeks and it's a different thing  We we do some classic games and like trivial pursuit things and things like but not family feud  And uh, there's a game that lex friedman who now works for amazon by the way in the podcast division  He came up with a game called friendly competition  And it's uh people he asked them to do things so we have to do some tasks beforehand  And then it's just a silly game and we're sort of competing for meeting his inscrutable rules  And one of the rounds i'm gonna i'm gonna slip because the episode isn't out yet was called hashtag glenning  Which is what people call me whenever I name drop some of the people I know  and he said one of the questions was  Uh, so the round was which podcast has glenn been on and there were points off for non-uniqueness and someone put twit  And I said they said have you ever been on this week in tech and i'm like, oh my gosh, I don't know  And they're like you're to you don't you know, I think i've been asked  This I haven't been well set up for video before i'll be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like I said 10 out of 10 on the room. I'll get the i'll get the duct tape fixed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But anyway, so it was literally a question what you just asked me was literally a question and we had to research it during the show  You didn't know  And I think what's happened is I think i've been asked to be on thank you on on multiple occasions over the years  And I think of it. Oh, i'm not really set up with video yet. So I finally am and that's why jeff said hey  And I said I was thrilled  Because I thought you had something against me.

Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, wow, that's confusing and in my mind too. I  I haven't been on that many different podcasts  I used to be on I used to have a regular gig on local radio station and so forth and  Uh do a lot of incomparable stuff and was the host of the macworld podcast for a few years  Several years ago. And uh, anyway, it is just funny that i'm like, all right now i've officially  I know you two have encountered the same problem  I have officially done so many things in my life that are different  I can't remember all the things I did or if I did something. Oh, absolutely obvious question  Have you been on this week in tech? Well, you think I would know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the fact that I asked you is exactly the same problem neither of us knows 10 000 shows i'm not sure  Well glenn I I am deeply sincere  You're going to be back and back as often as you will do it because you're fantastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pleasure, let me come back and talk about usb c cables. That's my latest book is about

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my god, we were sorting out cables. We just spent a half an hour talking about on mac break weekly  Oh my god, because it's a nightmare

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you know, I write the mac 911 column for macworld and so I get user it's the best thing to write because  In this world, I can't cure cancer. I'm not a medical researcher. I'm not a  I can't help people directly with their with their bodies or disease or maybe fighting war. Those aren't my  My specialties but I can answer questions about macs and iphones. So I get these emails people  I can't do someone I have an ex-boyfriend who's looking at stuff on my phone and i'll write back  I'm like here is an answer and like thank you. I'm like, oh my god  I made somebody's life a tiny bit better but cables people write in more about  Oh, yeah cables and ports and standards anything else? I wrote a whole book for the uh, the take control book series a whole book about

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cables if you can believe that so we uh, we were talking about yesterday. It's a nightmare  Benson leong who is the google engineer who was doing all of the checks on all of these cables  Is actually on our twit social mastodon instance and I was I was  a little starstruck I said  Benson leong  So and more about the standard he knows a lot about this stuff  He this is what is part of his job at google  So, um, and he had the machinery to test these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the hard part. Yeah, that's where people are like, I have a cable. I don't know what it does  How do I tell them? How do you know plug it in?  You got to plug it in see what doesn't work and which is not a doesn't feel modern

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It came up because we were showing uh, the apple has a hundred fifty nine dollar thunderbolt 4 cable and we were showing  The the teardown of it and it's got huge. It's got eight chips in it. It's huge  It's a hugely sophisticated device earning its price  And so we were started talking about well, what do you get for a twenty dollar thunderbolt 4 cable compared to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we can get a good one now. It's uh, if can I mention a brand name?  Yeah, i'm not sponsored by them. It's uh other world computing makes now. Yes. I mentioned that one  It's like 40 bucks. Yeah, it's uh, yeah  They have like it's 27 for a really short one up to 59. I want to say I trust owc 6.6  Yeah, I bought a lot of stuff from them  I have a pile of them because I was trying to sort that out  But yeah, it's it's uh, if you get a thunderbolt 4 usb 4 cable you can be in good shape

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's funny because that's what we concluded is that from now on just buy thunderbolt 4 cables  Because they're going to do it all they're affordable. Yeah, they're affordable and why not? Yeah  All right. Let's take a little break and glenn  We have a tradition at the end of the show pick of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just something anything could be a typeface a story or it could be it could be something in your in your collection there, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, something pretty cool anything you want a book whatever you want a tv show you like  A podcast you'd like to be on whatever whatever you want a ranch before we do that though. I do want to talk about  the  Biggest change in sleep technology. I have ever experienced we talk a lot about sleep  You know micah sergeant did a podcast about sleep for a long time. He subscribes to the journal of sleep  Pathology or whatever?  And is very interested in sleep and i've been talking to him about this kevin rose was the guy who turned me on to it  It's called eight sleep  Uh amy webb got it when she was on with kevin rose. She said  Leo you have to get this you can get it as a mattress or what we did at home  We got the pod pro cover. We got about six months ago. In fact, jeff remembers the story of me putting it on wrong  There is a very good video. I hasten to add  On the eight sleep site if I had watched it, I would have been able to put it on right now  What does this do?  It is not a heating pad. It is a heating and cooling  It's not even a pad a heating and cooling cover that can go as low as 55 degrees  Which is pretty chilly on a hot night. I can't wait to a hot summer night and try that to 110 degrees, which is definitely  hot  A heating pad hot and anywhere in between here's the thing. It's connected to sensors  It does biometric tracking it knows the temperature of the room and it will adjust the temperature of your bed  As you sleep and it will continue to adjust it  To give you the best night's sleep you ever had and I can promise it really  Works. I have never slept better than the withy eight sleep  I need not say I think sleep is the holy grail for all of us. It is nature's gentle nurse  It is it is it is the ultimate game changer in in your life yet  30 of americans struggle with sleep and temperature is one of the main reasons why ever wake up sweaty at night?  That's the worst or freezing cold  Our bodies are designed  Biologically to go to bed when it's warm, you know, you put the fire out get in bed. It slowly cools off during the night  Until the morning and that is what we expect and yet we live in such climate controlled circumstances  We don't actually experience that so the eight sleep does that and you can set it lisa sets it a little higher than I do  By the way, if you get you know one for a double bed or we have a king there are two sides  So lisa gets her settings completely independent of my settings  Dynamic cooling and heating with biometric tracking can go on any mattress  It watches your sleep  And it gets you into a deep sleep and then gets you out of it  In fact, I have it set to warm up when I have to wake up in the morning  It's the best alarm i've ever had no sound  Nothing. It's very quiet. I just I feel warm and I go. Okay, i'm ready  Eight sleep users fall asleep 32 percent faster reduce sleep interruptions by 40 percent and get overall more  Restful sleep imagine 30 percent more deep sleep  What could you do with that you just would feel a lot better throughout the day  I will vouch for this because we've been using it for six months and i'll tell you what i'm never stopping  I'm never not going to use this go to eight sleep  Eigh t s leep dot com slash twig check out the pod pro cover  You'll save 150 at checkout if you go to that special address  So please do that they also then know that you saw it here and that helps us a lot eight sleep  Eigh t eight sleep dot com slash twig. I like to as part of this ad and I have not done this yet today  Check my sleep score just to see  And it's down a little bit. It's down a little bit. It's 92 sleep fitness  But I have to tell you somebody who's lived the last 10 years at 60 and 70 percent  That is awfully good. You can see the temperatures. It has a lot of information in here  A heart rate variability you have complete control with the app on your temp dial  So I could turn the bed on now if I wanted to get in and get warm and you can see how it cycles through  the temperatures from 10 pm  my bedtime  Until wake up time around 8 a.m  Yes, I like a lot of sleep  92 sleep. Let me tell you something. It feels really good. It feels really good  In fact last time I showed this last time I did the ad it was 99 percent  Which I have never in my life ever had before  I I can't recommend it more highly the pod pro cover  Go to eight sleep dot com slash twig save 150  At checkout eight sleep currently ships within the u.s. Canada and the uk eight sleep dot com  slash twig speaking of amy web we wanted to have her on the show  Because we knew aunt wouldn't be here this week  Uh, she said unfortunately she was doing a stern school alumni event tonight  Couldn't be here. She will be here soon because I have got to hear what she thinks about all of this. I think increasingly  the sense I get is  The billionaires are out of control  And it's time really as a country to think about and maybe as the world to think about do we need these oligarchs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still like glens finland  The finland fleishman fleishman finland trip. What's that? Tell me about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But oh wait you get you get your driving if you have a driving in fact fraction. Oh that one. Yeah  Yeah, percentage of your uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so if jeff bezos jaywalks in seattle, you'd have to pay a billion dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes  Now jaywalking we have to understand was invented by the car industry to penalize pedestrians. I'm sorry  So we will not give him a fine for jaywalking. That's not that is some good history. I think that's that's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's great. Just watch who framed roger rabbit for more information about  The demise of cars I get all my history from roger rabbit. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, no actually I have been following  a subreddit  I am  Propagandized by reddit, but I think in a beneficial way anti-work has taught me how many awful bosses there are in the world  There's a slash r slash  Uh, I can't say it on an impolite company f cars  That really makes a strong case for getting rid of private car ownership. We need obviously trucks. We need  You know conveyances, but uh, but private car ownership is not it's not good for this world nor our oligarchs  Uh glenn, do you have a pick for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is uh, this is a site. I read every day  It's called web three is going just great. I love this site  I figured you would know this and I don't know why like okay  So there are positive joys in this world. There's things that we celebrate because they we love them. We see a picture of a puppy we see  Uh ukrainian people rebuilding their cities already after the russian forces have moved on  Incredible things that bring us joy in different ways then there's schadenfreude  And we've been talking a lot of germans episode  Schadenfreude is that guilty joy you have a joy of misfortune  My german teacher in college said schadenfreude is when you see someone  Your enemy wearing a bowler hat the enemy wearing the bowler hat is the best part crossing the street their bowler hat flies off  And is crushed by a passing car  Right  So for my so for an ironic bowler hat is the best part of them. Yes, that's right  so if I want to go like a  Layback and just you know relax in a pool of schadenfreude  I go to web three is going just great because every day I now I want to distinguish  I feel bad for the people who are being bilked by  cryptocurrency scammers and nft scammers because the most of the coverage is how  Uh this or that coin drop or nft or new cryptocurrency or whatever how it's gone  belly up and  Uh how all the money is gone all the crypto is drained out or there was a bug  And everyone's money was stolen and I feel terrible for the people who got scammed into this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know some of them are wealthy a lot of people. I don't mind if bitcoin bros get scammed  In fact, yeah a little schadenfreude there, but there are a lot but the only but the whole purpose of their  Uh promotion is to get normal people to sink money into it so they can get out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think this this cadence of a blowing kazoo that molly does where it's just like  At the funeral, you know, it's like it's the it's the performance that tells you  You can't believe in this stuff because here is a drumbeat of everything the billions of dollars that are being stolen  Uh all the time. So I I love this site in a perverse way and molly is also great on on twitter  I think she's she's she's molly zero x fff, which is a great hexadecimal programming joke  On twitter and she's just a terrific person. Is her last name white or black is white. Okay  and she  Oh  That's a clever. Oh, that's I didn't catch that. Oh, you didn't know what x

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the hex of her last name oh my gosh, that's perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But she like david garrard's another person who uh, who is extremely expert in the topic they would like  Cryptocurrency or cryptography based financial stuff to become  Uh a reality in some fashion. They're not opposed to it  They're painted often by people who are hypesters that they hate this stuff. They don't they actually love it  They understand it incredibly well  They just hate what's happening right now and they're willing to poke holes in it instead of promoting it  And uh, anyway, so I knew it was I knew I knew the trouble was afoot when my daughter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Asked how she could invest in dogecoin. That's when I knew there was a problem by the way molly brilliant  She has a thing that I think should be on many websites. It's the grift meter in the lower right hand corner  You can see it starts at zero and as you scroll through the losses  Rolled up by bitcoin people the meter goes up  As the money goes out  Yes, ladies and gentlemen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the f company.com. I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's f company 3.0. Yeah. Oh my gosh. No, it totally I love the eight bit

Transcript:  Um, so I I was I liked the fact that reddit  I mean, you know youtube gives away money to people to make stuff and we know that we know how that works  But reddit has just created a one million dollar fund  To just fund users best ideas  in that reddity way  Which is what we need to do  We need to be encouraging and supporting the good stuff and and good voice and good creativity  And so I just want to give them a shout out for that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know increasingly reddit has become my social uh network  That and discord which i'm in love with our club twit discord is a great place to hang  Uh, I like our forums we use discourse  For our forums, that's the twit community forums and I have to say I am now going to really spend a lot more time on mastodon  because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the where where do you which one i i ours we have one three people. We have one jeff yours twit dot social

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The reason the one of one of many reasons that mastodon is great is elon musk could never buy it  Yes, there's  thousands of independent  Servers which are all federated together  Jeff when you when you join twit dot social, I guess this is becoming my pick when you join when you join  Yeah, well i'll show you a couple of things about mastodon. First of all, we don't call them tweets. We call them toots  So that's very important. Okay, you're you're tooting and instead of 280 characters  You actually have 500 characters. There are some really nice standards  For instance, you see this toot has a sensitive comment a content banner on it  It is it anytime you think an image might offend you but you just press that sensitive content  It's about baking. What could it be? Well, you write you some people don't want it  Some people don't want to see pictures of bread. Oh, that's obscene  Makes me hungry makes me hungry. So you can write your yeah, you can write your content warning here. Watch out  Glutens, you know or whatever it is  On your picture of bread. I like that feature  When you're when you're tooting  You're you're tooting to the local mastodon instance, but you're also tooting to anybody  Who is federated and wants to follow you so your name is qualified  So my name on twit social is atleo my global name though is  Atleo at you could show this atleo at twit at twit social over here  And so you can follow anybody if you know what instance they're on there also is a search function  So you can quickly find what instance they're on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we can as find out who from twitter all my twitter friends are here more and more people are going in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which I think is I think maybe is a good sign  It has all the benefits of twitter except it's just not as many people in there and it tends to be somewhat geeky  You should look though and there is a long list of mastodon servers  You may not want to join ours. You may say well, I want to hang out with a bunch of type nerds  And there may well be a type nerd mastodon server because seven of us. Yeah  well because it's um  Federate it's easy to start a server. Oh, my server only has maybe a few hundred  Maybe I think it's actually a thousand people on it now  I don't you can also as a server not federate with servers. You don't like so gab is on mastodon as well  But I don't federate with them  So I don't see anything from gab and they don't see anything from twit social  There are a number of directories of mastodon servers, but if you don't have a particular preference  Then I would suggest you join twit dot social  But the point is you can do that anywhere, you know, you can follow anybody anywhere from any server. So you're never really  Limited  Uh, I think it has everything that good about twitter except for the community, unfortunately

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh, yeah, I think we're gonna see a lot of retreating into uh discords and slacks and discourses and  Mastodon instances, uh, it'll buy it  But you know actually the it's almost like we're retreating into caves waiting for the flood to be over or something  Right the weather to change. Oh, there's a dove on the horizon

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right, where's the mountain

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If we could get and then someone could build something request  Pardon me. Oh, yeah, so I approve them. That's the other thing  As a moderator one of the things I do is I uh, I approve them and it's not so much because I want to keep  donald trump off my mastodon  uh, but because um  There are a lot there's spammers. All right, so um, and I can always tell because when you join I ask you to say something  About why you want to join and when people say I wish to share news about my fine company  Uh, I do not in fact let you try said leo told me to yes. I see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so one of the things uh, the xoxo conference that uh is I think on a hi hatus right now because of the uh,  You know the pandemic, uh, I think in the first year  They sold tickets to the general public and they they knew they were going to be oversubscribed  They asked everyone who wanted to buy a ticket  There was like a question which was tell us something you made recently and they said later this basically filtered out all the marketing people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's brilliant because the market wasn't that they're not creative things, but they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their orientation wasn't such they could fill that question out in a way that or at all  And so it just turned it also when you call it event hugs and kisses xoxo  It tends to turn people off. I want to come and talk. It's a wonderful event

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think that's probably one of the reasons when on the as you notice it looks a lot like tweet deck jeff  Uh on the right you can follow the local timeline, which is just twit dot social  Or you can follow the federated timeline, which is a timeline of all the people on all the you as the boss choose  What to federate with the default is federate with everybody and then there are a few there's really only two  You eliminate some yeah, there's only two i've eliminated now. I get it now. I in fact here's something in german  So as i'm saying, you know, i must effect has uh secured

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Digital courage. Oh, I see. It's a site called the must effect is a secure digital courage dot social  uh weather  Uh for a profile and cost imply it's gonna if you want to profile you're gonna have to pay one euro a month  I think it's next is  Yeah, that's right. It'll be terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I seem to have lost control of the language of this show, which is the first this is actually a first  Uh for my  We'd love to have you twit dot social it is you know, if you're looking for twitter, it's not twitter  But honestly, there's nothing to keep it from being twitter. Yeah, exactly  That's the first piece is what got me if if all the people who say we want a community on black twitter created a mastodon instance  That could be it  Um where people aren't happy with it is you're not broadcasting to this vast audience  Which is frankly with the benefit of this from from my point is what that's why I like instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean instagram and mastodon actually have things in common in a weird way, which is that instagram?  It's not a it's not a walled garden or a closed garden  But I don't have to see much on instagram beyond yeah  What do you call it my chart and it's great. I see babies and dogs and art and people.
