Zeve Zoolander  after last week's episode where Stacey really looked like Princess Leia. She had her headphones  on. She was wearing a white down jacket with a big high collar. We were talking about how  Ant really is the Bob Ross of photography and if he only had a giant curly hairdo it  would be perfect. Zeve did a little Photoshop with Ant retouching Stacey. That thing is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  gold. It's awesome. It was fantastic. I really appreciate it. Nice job Zeve Zoolander. This

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is in our Twit forum at twit.community if you want to download a copy. I think Ant tweeted  it as well. I did. Here's a happy little tree. Exactly. Don't you think Ant kind of is the  Bob Ross of Twit? I kind of think yeah. Oh man. You're a warm, relaxing person. You're  forgiving. You're just like it's all good. He makes everybody feel better. I do love trees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I try to just relax when I'm editing photos so maybe I see where you can make that equation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what hands on photography is going to be. I told you make it Bob Ross. We will

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have some editing segments of my shots and even some of the listener's shots on hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on photography. Can I send you shots and have you add puffy clouds? Puffy little clouds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Happy little trees. I know what you're looking or you're dressing as for Halloween. That's  all I can say. They were castigating me in the forums because we got a little heated  last week and I stomped all over Stacey's many brilliant thoughts. All of winded points.  No, you're thoughtful and I'm just loud and obnoxious so I apologize and I'm going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  stay out of your way today. It's going to be a very different show this week. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know if we're ready for this. I should also point out that I'm going to be gone for a  month. I won't be back here until November 20th. So these shows are really going to be  difficult. This is it. I wonder how relaxed I'll be when I get back from vacation. Probably  pretty relaxed. Somebody says they want you to be the Bob Ross not the Sam Kinison. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  man. Oh boy. Say it! Say it! He can do it. Sam Kinison was hilarious. So yesterday, yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we got up early. I got up early and I watched the event. Jason Howell, weren't you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I was. You just don't remember? I think I was. This all feels familiar for some  reason. A lot of people were disappointed with Google's event yesterday. They said it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was boring. I was like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't  know. It was boring. Why were they disappointed? Is it because we already knew what was coming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Be hard for Google to get any excitement going about, hey, and it's got two cameras. So maybe  that's it. I thought, no. Go ahead. It was because of the leaks. Everything was known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you knew right up front that they were just going to own it because as soon as Rick  Ostrillo got on stage, within about a minute, behind them he said, we're going to talk about  new products today. And they showed the entire lineup right up front. They didn't hide it.  They didn't hide it. So it's hard. I mean, they embraced these leaks over the past several  months at some point and just said, we're just going to start putting our own stuff  out here and keep people talking. And that's smart. But that makes for a very challenging  event to have the excitement. And I will say this, having any Leibowitz there was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was low energy. She was kind of...  She didn't really add much, like you said, energy-wise, but it's nice that she can endorse it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was nice that she was there. And the funny thing, when I go to these events, I look back  at the teleprompters behind us to see what they're about to say. So during the Annie  Leibowitz segment with Lilly Lynn, and I know Lilly from working with her, she's in PR at  Google. She's fantastic.  Poor Lilly. Oh, poor Lilly. I was feeling poor.  I was feeling poor.  Because Lilly had questions that were better questions than she asked. But because Annie  was kind of zigzagging around rambling a little bit, it didn't work. Those questions didn't  work. So Lilly made do and she did a great job, given the situation, in my opinion. And  it's not a knock against Annie Leibowitz. I mean, she's a fantastic photographer. It  was awesome to see her there, but a little low energy. And that didn't help, is all I'm  going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was also disappointed you didn't suffer this because you at least were able to see  the pictures over Annie Leibowitz. But those of us watching on the stream, they kept cutting  away from the pictures to Annie and Lilly. So we didn't really, now, fortunately, TechCrunch  has many of these pictures, but we didn't get to see the pictures anywhere.  Oh, what a shame. They looked fantastic.  It looked great. Actually, there's just one picture, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a shame because she got great pictures of Megan Rapinoe. She got pictures of people  I don't know, but they just were phenomenal.  She has some Rapinoe shots? Oh, man.  Yes, two of them. And honestly, they look like she just used whatever DSLR or whatever  equipment she normally uses. They were that good and they were taken with the Pixel phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although somebody did point out, you could give Annie Leibowitz anything.  It's like saying, look, Aunt can lift this bottle. It's so light.  It's like, well, yeah, because he's so I wish I would have loved to have seen those images.  You know, the one I wanted to see was of the and Annie Leibowitz talked about it of the cadet,  the Military Academy cadet, the boots or Citadel.  OK, and the boots she had worn all four years of the Citadel.  And we saw it for a second. And I would really like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a story. Photography is about the story, it's not about the megapixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's so good. I feel bad for Ivy Ross, to be honest as well. Ivy Ross.  You know, I saw a bunch of.  Twerps, for want of a better word, on Reddit saying when that old lady came out,  she seemed so unexcited about the Chromebook, they didn't know who Ivy Ross is.  Who's Ivy Ross? Destro Design.  She's she gave Google the material aesthetic.  She's the one that's put fabric and I think she's their head designer.  Got it. And a legendary designer.  You know, I would say she's as well known in design as Annie Leibovitz is in photography.  But if you don't know that you were like, why is this woman talking about the Chromebook?  And she they said on Reddit, she doesn't she doesn't even seem like she's excited about it.  Some people, when they're nervous, their energy goes down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not everyone is a showman or showwoman on stage.  You know, they're passionate about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually honored Google for bringing it.  You know, sometimes companies to get women on stage or people of color on stage will find  those they're like, is there is there anybody like get that intern? Right.  But I honored Google for bringing out their head designer to talk about the Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. That's what it should be.  It's me, subject matter expert. Yeah.  Oh, please don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, we don't we don't need those words.  Before we move on, I actually found on the Google blog a listing with a link to the to Annie's photos.  Oh, good. Nice.  Yeah. On line 24 in the notes, you can take a look and there's a link in there.  Hallelujah. Scroll down, scroll down and you'll see that that cadet picture, for example.  Yeah, that's the link. Full collection.  Nice. Back up a little bit. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you can see. Oh, man.  Oh, good. I'm so glad because these are really stunning images.  Yes. She talked about what how she did it, which she took two pictures.  Here's an example, a guy taking a selfie of himself.  And actually, it's fun, because if you look in the left corner of the mirror, you could see Annie's  and his hand holding a pixel for the guys, apparently using a pixel three, I guess.  And then next to it, his clothes hanging on the door.  And I thought that was a really interesting idea to do that.  She's an artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. I think the cadet picture is the next one, if I recall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that. So she's a citadel, which is actually a high school, right?  It's not a college.  No, no, it's college.  OK. And Charleston.  Yeah, very well known military school, very tough, rigid, not a US military academy.  It's a private, but it is a very tough school.  And look at those are the boots she wore for four years.  There's a big contrast between her dress, blues and her graduation outfit  and the boots she wore for those four years.  It's very it's beautiful shot.  Just just a gorgeous shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're looking at that at this page, scroll up to where  or she's shooting Miss Rapinoe.  See that? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the pier there. Yeah.  No, you go back, Carson. You went too fast there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right there. You notice the rig that she's holding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, she's not just holding the camera by itself, is she? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I tried to mention this in our live coverage that  Apple and everybody else will have these ads after the phones are announced.  It says, hey, this ad was created with our phones.  The difference is people like Miss Annie is a pro.  Yeah, she understands I need to be stable.  So she has this rig on that on that camera.  And there was also another shot.  I don't think it's on this page, but I noticed it in the stream.  She had a soft box on the set. Oh, that's extra lighting.  That's a whole different thing.  You know, so that's how those shots are going to look as great as they look,  because she's a professional photographer and she knows the fundamentals of shooting.  It's not just that camera. There's more to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always say that when they when they show the shot on iPhone stuff is a pro.  The gear isn't as important. Right.  As knowing what they're doing, composition, composition.  I have to say my favorite part of the event, I'm curious what you guys thought,  was Mark Lavoie.  He is the guy who was at I think it was at Stanford.  He's a professor emeritus now expert on computational photography.  He's really the guy.  His explanation on HDR.  And he left Stanford to go to Google.  And yeah, I thought that was a that was what I would have liked to see more of  that throughout the event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm hmm. That was fantastic.  I mean, that's probably my favorite part of the event as well.  And just what I loved about it, besides not getting too down in the weeds,  he explained everything in in a way you can all understand,  but also even gave tips like when you use the new pixel four camera,  where we have our hybrid digital zoom, optical digital, don't crop in,  you know, zoom in, frame your photo and just take the picture  and trust it. And I actually took one of those today.  And he's right. It works the way he said.  It's fantastic. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Stop cropping. Start zooming.  That's going to be something everybody's going to have to remember.  And we're all in the habit of taking an image  and zooming in on it in Lightroom or Snapseed.  And that's how we zoom in. And that will not be as good.  That'll that's the old kind of traditional digital zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These cameras are much smarter.  They're better now because you couldn't do that in the past.  You just hit that zoom and it would just fall apart on your screen.  Oh, God, it was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was always I was taught zoom with your feet.  So, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're still right, by the way.  But I have to say, even the Pixel 3 XL, I was in New York last year with the 3 XL.  And I was outside the Broadway show of the Harry Potter  and the Cursed Child, and they had a really beautiful sculpture.  But it was up on top of the roof of the building.  And I was able to zoom in with the Pixel 3 XL  because I was kind of testing it and I was really impressed.  So that's been around.  But I but this is what's so great about the situation we're in right now.  And by the way, give Apple credit to you because they're doing amazing,  great stuff.  And I don't know if you saw, did you see the Verge article  where they compared Pixel 4 images to Apple of iPhone 11 Pro images?  And it's it's really interesting.  There there there's no clear winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's going to come down to personal preference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's going to get better, too, because their deep fusion software  is coming out sometime in the future.  But but but yeah, Mark Lavoie did the same wink wink  because remember he was showing the image of the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He took a jab saying, here, we can give you a moonshot.  Here you go. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then the sky is bright, but the scenery below it is dark.  And he said, we can't fix that right now, but stay tuned.  So the strong impression and actually Google did this last time.  Remember, there was a there's this is the verge picture.  So look at this one, though, the red.  So the on the right is the picture with the iPhone.  On the left is a picture with the Google  Pixel 4.  I don't the problem is I don't know which red is correct.  Red is historically hard for digital photography.  There's the the Google's is much more toned down.  It's almost a brick red.  Whereas the iPhone's is a fire engine red.  One of those is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. One of them is a little.  I think the fire engine red is a little too saturated.  Maybe that's it.  Mm hmm. But that's my actually scroll down a little bit, Karsten,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because I think we're missing the other way, the top of the photo.  Because the yeah, because the problem, as you can see, is  there is a very bright light coming from the sky above.  Right through those windows.  And so Google toned its picture down so that it's not blown out.  With the skylight, Apple did something else.  Its picture is brighter.  I think the highlights might be blown in the sky.  So that's a choice, though, the software makes.  That's what's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When when when the HDR software  was first implemented, I believe it was around Nexus five,  Nexus six, somewhere in that area.  I didn't like it at first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought here's it.  Get this one. This is the.  Look at this.  It was a Tom Warren, whoever wrote the Tom Warren.  Yeah, so he's Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Center it.  Yeah. Get the line out of the way because he was terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So on the left is the Pixel four, which I think looks better.  It's a little darker than the iPhone.  And this is portrait mode.  Now you can scroll all the way to the left.  That's the iPhone version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's too blown out and fuzzy.  And yeah. And he just has.  It was like a yammer. Uncanny.  He looks he doesn't look like a person almost.  Right. Like HDR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Apple will get better with this in time.  Yeah, this is pretty.  They're going to keep working at a pretty deep fusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you could get this out of the pixel for really easily just by  just by pushing one slider in their photo.  True. Just by this.  This is just push the shadows up a tiny bit.  And this would become this would become this shot in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My only beef with the pixel shot is the white balance looks a little too cool.  But again, that's my preference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, that's and again, they've got a slider for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And the Google or you can, you know, do it in post.  I mean, honestly, any picture you get can but but can be changed.  But what I think the point of all of this is most people aren't going to do post  processing of the hair. And this is interesting.  Yeah. Here's Tom said the color was accurate on the pixel,  but the detail was more accurate with the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and it's definitely warmer.  Yeah. Super warm versus cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. He says, though, that's the color.  The one on the pixel color is the actual color for hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So see, see, the thing is to me, and I'm not a professional photographer.  So, and you you tell me if I'm wrong, it's not all about just capturing  a photo of what you saw these days.  It's being creative and making the picture the way you want it to be.  Like I do a lot of approach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that? Yeah, that is exactly my approach.  There's a lot of times I'm out  because I like doing a lot of street photography first and foremost.  And I'll snap someone's image while I'm out there.  And when I get back to my editing station or what have you,  I'm visualizing that moment when I was out there and what I felt.  And that's what you're trying to duplicate that.  Right. And that's what goes into the post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody who's ever taken a picture of a sunset knows that what you felt  and what you saw cannot be captured in the camera.  Nope, it just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Your eyes are much better at receiving the light and processing it  than than these high dollar cameras are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The point, though, is that most people by a camera phone don't want to do posts.  They want to take a picture and it's done.  A filter at best.  So I would imagine both Apple and Google's real goal is.  Not to sneeze during the show.  No, bless you.  Thank goodness I had the phone to capture all that.  Oh, yeah.  Oleophobic coding. Yeah.  Oh, look, it came right off.  That Apple and Google's goal is to make it be.  This is the the we call it IQ image quotient  that this is the best, you know, out of the box by itself without any posts.  This is what people, real people, regular people.  And I presume they focus group in all sorts of stuff.  I don't know.  Samsung does a lot of a lot of post-processing in the camera.  And a lot of people hate what Samsung does with their images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So would would now be a good time to show an unedited photo from the pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for Excel, one that somebody named Kevin Toffle might have snapped.  I'm not naming names.  Yeah, let's see. Do you have a name and names?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a link there for a let's see.  Where is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can line 42.  Line 42.  I guess that's the easiest way to find things.  I took the pixel for Excel outside last night.  See it. I have it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Carsten is not line 42 anymore.  But yeah, yeah, it's moved down.  But I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's as soon as it loads and Google photos, we'll see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I wanted to see the astrophotography that they talked about there.  And this is I have a lot of light pollution in my my my area.  I took the pixel for Excel, put it on a tripod,  didn't set it up for night center and just said, take a photo.  And it said, OK, and it set its own timer for the exposure  at this particular one, I think was three minutes.  What? Three minutes.  It will go up to four.  So you don't have to say was it pitch dark when you took this?  It was it was only eight to eight fifteen p.m.  So not it was dark, but not as dark as it should.  You know, it should be if I was taking real astrophotography photos.  Right. In any case, if you zoom in, if you can,  because it doesn't look that impressive there.  But now when you zoom in and start looking around,  you can see a heck of a lot of points of light.  That's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's a lot of light pollution where you are. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I've been scrolling around on my phone with this and going, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are there a million points of light?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A million points of light. Yep. Wouldn't be prudent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm hmm. So you would want to go somewhere  where there's no light pollution from cities and stuff. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really get absolutely.  Yeah. I'll never see the Milky Way where I live, but in, you know,  the demos of the nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I'm going to be somewhere like that.  I'm in the middle of the Dead Sea.  I'm going to be in places like that. Yeah.  I am going to be in the pyramids in Egypt.  I'm going to be Petra and Jordan.  I'm going to be in Athens.  And I don't have a pixel for it. It kills me.  I would really love.  But you do have that A7R4.  I have a good camera and I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max.  Set that thing to bulb mode.  You know, I'll take I'll take good pictures, but I just would love  to have that one. I'm going to bring a Pixel 3XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the camera that's in your pocket. So close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My Pixel 4 will come while I am gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In addition to the the way it's handling the light,  look at the clarity of the foliage right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, what's interesting is I'm going to bet that that foliage in those three  minutes moved a little bit. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not going to be that completely still.  I would say the stars probably did, too, which tells you instead of seeing,  you know, our dreams of light. Right. Exactly.  It's it's compensating for all that based on the exposure time.  That's just beautiful. Nice work. So what?  That's crazy. Wait, I took the photo, and we talk about.  Oh, yeah. Nice work, Mr.  Tuffle. All I do is hit a button and walk away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and I think that was the goal.  There's lots more to talk about that event had a lot.  And I know, Kevin, you probably want to talk about the Pixelbook Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So she's just not here because I'd love to hear what Jeff has to think about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the Pixelbook. Hold your thoughts because I want to do it.  I want to do it. Add. But when we come back, we'll talk about.  And it's funny because nine to five Google.  Was right. I mean, they had the images and everything before the event  took all of the surprise. Wait, wait, don't. Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I had the very first image and they yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You had it. Sorry about Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a calm. No, I get no. Listen, I give them a lot of credit.  They came up with the whole device.  They had a prototype and images.  I had some of the first images earlier in the year, but kudos to them  because they really they killed it. That was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I dropped the ad. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was wondering, I'm like, what is Leo doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you. He came all the way from Melbourne, Australia to pick up my ad copy.  I appreciate it. Oh.  Stephen Wozniak, ladies and gentlemen in the studio today.  Our show today brought to you by Express VPN.  So I'm going on a trip. Maybe you heard.  I know I talk about it too much. I'm sorry.  But I don't blame you. I'm going to be in hotels.  I'm going to be in coffee shops.  I'm going to get in Wi-Fi wherever I can get it in some pretty sketch places  in Egypt, in Israel, in Dubai.  I want to protect myself. Lots of snooping eyeballs.  You don't know what you're going to get.  I'm bringing Express VPN.  You better believe I'm bringing Express VPN.  It's already on all my devices anyway.  I love Express VPN.  It is a VPN, a virtual private network that protects your privacy,  keeps you secure no matter where you are, even at home.  And I have to say, it's so fast.  Sometimes when you use a VPN, you feel like, oh, it's a...  I'm slogging through molasses here. Not Express VPN.  They have servers all over the world.  So you're, you know, you can use a server near you or a server  in a country that you want to appear in.  If I want to watch Netflix while I'm in Dubai,  I'll just log in in the United States and I'm going to be able to watch my Netflix  or my BBC or whatever.  But it's fast, too.  In fact, I have a perfect proof of that because I turned it on on my iPhone.  It's really easy to turn it on and off with the Express VPN app.  No settings changes or anything.  You just press a button, click, you're you're secure.  But I forgot I turned it on and I left it on for a couple of days at home.  I didn't even notice. I didn't even notice.  I don't think you can do that with any other VPN.  It is it is fast.  We know it's secure because they have had audit.  They completed a third party, third party independent audit that says,  yes, their privacy policy is exactly what they say.  They do not log. They do not keep track of what you're doing.  You can even pay for it with Bitcoin if you want to be completely anonymous.  Furthermore, they use this new trusted server technology,  which in effect puts the VPN server on their end  in a sandbox. It cannot write to the hard drive.  It lives in memory.  When you log out, it it shut down and a new one gets started.  So there is no record of your visit.  And the third party audit confirmed that's exactly what  the their server technology does, exactly what it said it would do.  Trusted server works 160 locations, 94 countries.  CNET said it's their number one VPN provider.  I say it's the number one VPN. I love it.  30 day money back guarantee.  So if you're not 100 percent satisfied, you no charge.  Internet without borders, internet that's secure, internet that's anonymous.  This is what you're looking for in a virtual private network.  Express VPN, I want you to try it with a very nice deal.  It brings it below seven dollars a month, less than seven bucks a month.  Right now, if you go to express VPN dot com slash twig,  you'll get three months, three additional months free when you buy a one year package.  That's the best deal. Three additional months free  when you buy a one year package. And you will want to.  But as I said, you got a 30 day money back guarantee.  Express VPN dot com slash twig.  Do that. TWIG, because then they'll know you saw it here and that's good for us.  We really like these guys. Express really a good company doing a great job.  It's the one I use, the one I recommend.  Windows, Mac, IOS, Android. You can even put it Linux.  Yes, you could even put it on your router, which I think is a really good way to use a VPN.  So everybody in the house is safe.  They have a VPN for your Wi-Fi router. Express VPN dot com slash twig.  They really know what they're doing.  All right. It has that funny, grippy rubber bottom.  And I'm not talking about it.  I'm talking about the Pixelbook Go.  You nailed it, right, Kevin? Everything you thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yes, because I had been tracking the baseboard that's inside there  called Atlas for about 18 months. Oh, wow.  And I read I bring that up for a very specific reason,  and I'll get to that in a few minutes.  I wrote a post about three months ago, maybe even four months ago,  because based on what I was tracking, based on the code commits I saw for Atlas  and based on geek benchmark benchmarks,  I wrote a post saying it may not make sense to wait for the next Pixelbook.  And I didn't. I bought a higher end Acer Chromebook spin with  16 gig of RAM for much less than Google is selling this for with 16 gig of RAM.  I this the Pixelbook Go is not for me.  Who is it for? Maybe. Well, that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't have a pen. It doesn't have a fingerprint reader.  Nope. It is just as expensive as a Pixelbook, right?  It's pretty much, you know, the high price spread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically it is because you can go up to 1399 and get the 4K screen  and 16 gig of RAM and a Core i7. Wow.  I have a couple issues with this.  First of all, I think, and I will ask,  be talking to Google later this week, actually, and I'm going to ask this question.  I don't know if they're going to answer it. Did the plans for Atlas change?  Because there were a lot of early code commits that showed that it was going to  have faster memory. I'm sorry, faster storage with NVMe.  That was yanked. It's all EMMC.  Do you really think you'll get an answer to that?  All I can do, all I can do is ask, you know, I don't know. I don't know.  I suspect it was changed because there are several high end Chromebooks out  there that cost less, give you more performance,  and they weren't there 18 months ago. They're available now, obviously.  So what Google basically did in my opinion, well, not even my opinion,  I mean, it's a fact that they took the guts of the Pixel slate from a year ago,  repackaged them into the Pixelbook Go and made it a clamshell.  And yes,  they reduced the price because with the Pixel slate you had to pay an extra  hundred fifty to two hundred dollars for a keyboard, right? So, you know,  I mean, 999 I paid for a core i5 with eight gig of RAM,  and then I paid another 200 for a keyboard.  Obviously this comes to the keyboard because it's a clamshell, it's a laptop.  Right. But if you look, and I don't know if we have any images,  if you look at the Pixelbook Go from the side,  I literally, I have a Pixel slate here and it's,  it looks just like this from the side.  The USB ports are in the same spot, everything.  So all the guts of the slate are in here.  The display is here too.  They remove the display and put in the new hush type keyboard on top of where  the display was and added a display for the clamshell and called it a day.  And I just, I just,  I'm not, I'm just not overwhelmed by this decision,  but I get it because there are better, there's, there's perfect picture.  That's exactly what the slate looks like from the side.  The base of the Pixelbook Go.  So I get it.  I think the market changed on them in the last 18 months and they decided,  we can't compete on price because we don't get the bulk discounts on Intel  processors that everybody gets because we don't sell a lot of laptops compared  to a super-sized laptop.  We don't sell a lot of laptops compared to a Sue's or Acer or Lenovo or Dell.  And they changed it up and they changed the target audience to,  I want, they say people on the go, but my comment to that was,  aren't we all on the go? I mean, really that's kind of lame, but it is lightweight.  It is thin. But I do think it's expensive for what you're getting there.  There are the chips inside here are still the older Y series,  eighth gen Intel processors.  They're not going to be used by developers, not going to be used in enterprise.  Not with the folks want this.  Well, I thought maybe,  and I put a post out the day before the event saying,  maybe it's a showcase for Stadia and we'll know if they include like a year's  worth of Stadia access and so on. Obviously they didn't do that. So I was,  I was wrong on that and whatever, but I was,  I was just trying to put the pieces together. So instead,  this is basically a Pixelbook for the masses,  but it's a Pixelbook that's a year old for the masses,  if that makes sense, because the innards are just not that exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the outside with the sticky rubber bottom is neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that's why I think maybe not masses, maybe it's a student laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I would agree with that. It's a student Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Students are going to lose pens. Students don't want or need fingerprint.  They do want sticky bottoms. Some of them have sticky bottoms.  Depends on the age of the student, I guess. But this seems like it,  the problem is it's not student priced.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not starting at 650 for the core M3 with eight gig of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Compared to any MacBook that you'd be buying for a student,  I think this is a perfect student.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but the point is you don't,  you could go get the Acer that Kevin got for 650 that's, you know,  got higher specs in every respect.  There are plenty of Chromebooks that have better specs for less.  You don't have a grippy bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  I think the appeal here compared to the higher performing Chromebooks that you  can get for comparable or lower prices, it's light and thin compared to those.  This is literally a 10th of a pound lighter than the Pixelbook was.  And that was pretty light at 2.4. This is 2.3 pounds.  It's a little fashionable with the color.  1080p display is perfectly fine for students.  If this came in at like 499, wow, then we'd have a game changer, I think.  650 to start and then 850 just to jump up to the core i5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I noticed during the keynote, they didn't mention the price of them.  I had to wait until the keynote was over and look it up to see the price.  And I was really disappointed to see that i5 pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's with 8 gig. If you want 16 gig, now you jump up to at least 999.  And then if you want the 4K display, that is only available on the core i7.  So you have to pay for the i7.  So you have to pay $1000, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And then you're at a MacBook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  $1399 at that point with 256 gig of storage.  It's just, I think they kind of got pushed out of their own market by the, by  their partners, quite honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's because Google isn't a hardware company.  I mean, and they were trying to, we'll get to that, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But a lot of people I talked to didn't really disagree with me.  And, and it was almost as if they put this out because it was expected to have a  Pixelbook, so they just met their time table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were expected to have a Pixel watch too.  They didn't bother with that.  Yeah, I wanted to watch.  The expectation doesn't necessarily mean they're going to do it.  The good news is for Chrome OS that there are a lot of companies making Chrome OS  devices.  Yes.  It's, you know, Google's can declare victory.  They don't need to make them.  No.  Of course that's true of Android too, isn't it?  Why do they keep making phones, especially, and I saw a lot of people  complaining about the price.  The Pixel 4 is a fairly expensive phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really think their focus was much more on design this year than any year before.  For the Pixelbook.  For the Pixelbook Go, for the buds, for the, I mean, the floor, all of their products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is why they brought out their lead designer, Ivy Ross, to talk about the Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they really told us a design story this year rather than a specs story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But really, what is the...  And that's, well, that's what Apple's done for decades.  So if you look at, I mean, think about all the times Johnny Ives has come in and said  aluminum in an Apple event, right?  So they're just, they're following along a bit with that and trying to, I mean, in a  way this is good because it's Google trying to be more human and approach people where  they're at, as opposed to like throwing their engineering, everything over the wall and  just saying, here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't feel that way about the Pixelbook, as far as you saying they're acting human.  I felt more that way when they mentioned the Nest information and how they work with the  mics and making it feel more comfortable in the home and making home feel a little  more natural to have technology in there and giving you that dream world of the Jetsons  where you can just speak into the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Possibly the best thing they announced as somebody who has a lot of Nest devices is  the Nest Cloud Recording Plan, the new flat rate pricing on cloud recording for as many  devices as you have $10 a month for a 10 day history, $30 a month for a 30 day history,  $5 a month for a five day history.  And see, I think that's brilliant because they're going to sell a lot more cameras  because in the past, every camera you had to have a subscription for.  Right.  I have three Nest cameras, a Hello Doorbell.  And by the way, Stacey, I love, you know, I replaced the ring with a Hello on your  recommendation.  The best part is, first of all, there's no delay.  There's no lag between somebody at the door ringing it.  And because I have a home hub, Nest Home Max, Hub Max, when they press the doorbell,  the Max immediately puts video up and says, someone's at the front door and I can see  them immediately.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's so much better.  The little things, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I told you to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were smart.  That was exactly the right recommend.  I, it's like night and day.  And I thought the Nest was amazing.  I mean, I was really happy with the Nest, but there was always that lag.  You always saw the back of the AUPS guy as he drove off.  There he goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But by the way, those are the old plans.  The new plan is six and $12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, oh, I'm sorry.  That was the old plan.  Right.  The new plan.  I'm sorry.  $6 for 30 days.  Compare that to $5 for five days.  $12 for 60 days.  You're exactly right.  That made me happy.  I mean, that won't be available till next year, but you will get the option to switch.  And I will immediately because I have four, four devices, but they're smart because I'm  much more likely to buy more now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all about the ecosystem.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It's a good ecosystem play.  Did you know, Leo, we talked about this, Stacy and I talked about this this morning on  our podcast.  Did you know the Nest is always recording?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  That's the other difference.  The hello or the, wait a minute, the Nest is always recording?  No, the hello is always recording.  Nest Hello.  Yes.  Nest Hello.  Oh yeah.  The ring is not.  And that was always, there was the other problem with the ring.  It only recorded when there was motion.  So yeah, I can always, and that's probably why it's quick to pick up a picture.  It doesn't have to boot, turn on, turn on the camera.  Wake up.  How long?  Wake up camera.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that is really, really nice.  I just, I'm a big fan of that and it makes you want to get more Nest hubs.  It makes you want to, you know, I'm  all in now on the ecosystem.  That's the Amazon approach.  Hook you in.  Yeah.  But Amazon has missed the boat a little bit.  Ring is Amazon.  They've acquired all the stuff.  They've got the, they've got everything, but I think that Nest  is actually doing a better job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's, that's been our, I mean, that's been kind of our experience.  But my family is so conditioned to Madam A.  Right.  Even though I have Google stuff around the house, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody says hello.  You know, Guillermo.  Yeah.  Everybody's saying hello.  Micah and Matthew on their smart tech today are trying to come up with new  names, but Andy and I'll go already says serious Shlomo Google is Guillermo.  Echo is, uh, Al, Alio, Alio, Alio, Alio, Alio, Alio, Alio, Alio, Alio, Alio,  and I don't know who Cortana is, but nobody ever says it.  So it's okay.  Nobody says it.  I like Madam A.  I like your Madam A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, he calls Cortana Bixby and Bixby Cortana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That helps confuse the issue.  I don't know.  Again, Bixby never comes up in conversations.  It's just a jab.  It's just a jab.  You were talking Stacey about new chips.  Is this a chip that's appearing in the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, to be clear, we think it's a new chip.  They didn't talk much about it.  Did they Kevin, the machine learning chip in the new Nest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is in the Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If this is in the Nest and I do have one, I have not even powered it up yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, can I just say I like that color much better than the, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I just say I hate Kevin Toffle because he got everything in a bag swag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess I should put that core i7 pixel, but go aside and, uh,  turn around the, uh, the new mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't it have a little hook?  No, Kevin, it does.  It does have a hook.  Why didn't they do that from day one?  Why doesn't Amazon do that in the dot?  That's so obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I think cause, uh, a lot of people are making, you know, third parties are  making little holders and all that.  And magnet mount.  Magnet.  Now, is that what you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I just like, I love my cameras because of the magnet.  Now, cause I can stick it on fridges and banisters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Outdoor cam does that it has you, you have a mount, but then that makes it very  easy to swivel in position.  Um, but I just liked the idea.  I feel like that's a natural thing to do with those little minis is put a hook in  the wall, hang it on there.  You'll have a wire coming down to the plugs.  You have to hang it over a plug, but that's just a natural out of the way thing.  I, my counter space is kind of dominated by echoes and homes and, oh, it's just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for your breakfast laptop because I don't have room for my blender anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It probably helped with the acoustics as well.  I would think for music.  Oh, good point.  Hey, how does this sound?  Have you played it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you?  I am.  I don't expect these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plug it in dummy.  I have, I honestly, I have been on the go.  Like you would not believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they said better sound.  They said twice the base, whatever that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They, what is, what is two X base feels like twice the base.  I can't really say.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it twice as loud twice as rich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it?  Like three inch speakers inside of these?  They can only sound so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it doesn't sound good, but it does sound better.  The original, the original sounded really not awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Always better than the dot though, right?  The dot was the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't listen to music on the dot.  So I'm like, sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Better with their, their, their newest dot got a little better and a little bit more.  I'm still on the original dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the echo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're whatever the dot three, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon, if you give the original back to them, they'll give you like five bucks.  What?  Trades in.  Yes.  Trade in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have trade in.  Yeah.  Yes.  So Kevin, plug it in.  I want to hear it.  Just put them on the spot.  Why don't you?  All right.  Yeah.  I want to hear, I want to hear if it's got two X base, whatever that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I can tell you that I'm very impressed by the, yes, the color, but these mesh coverings.  Did you happen to notice that they talked about, they are using recycled plastic  bottles, so one plastic bottle makes two mesh covers for the, for the net.  That's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They really emphasize how they're, uh, you know, they're buying carbon credits.  There's zero emission equivalent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is, this is part of the grand trust strategy.  And we'll talk about this when we start talking about ambient computing, but this  is, this is part of the, we're not evil.  We love you.  We love the environment.  We value what you value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So does Gladys.  Yeah.  Under 50 million in revest investment in renewable energy.  You know, when I, I think this is actually important because when I think about  Stadia, um, all of the work for gaming and Stadia is done on Google  servers out there somewhere.  Lots of nice, there's no heat.  There's no, you know, you don't have to pay attention to it.  Your electric bill, but somewhere there are massive gaming machines,  somewhere in North Carolina, you know, there's these giant farms.  And I honestly think that, you know, we've, we've done it in so many ways in our  lives, but that it's doing us a disservice because we're getting disconnected from  the actual costs, the actual energy cost of what we're doing.  And I just think if, if all these people subscribe to Stadia, they're going to  have to build more and more centers and network operations centers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a point at which it won't make sense.  And then we'll start seeing, and this is why we're talking about like computing,  going to the edge very broadly is because right now, if you look at the data  generated by things at the edge or things trying to consume data, you know,  CDNs happen because we were trying to consume data.  So it moved out.  We'll see that happen probably with Stadia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in theory, you're going to move those operations centers somewhere where  it's renewable energy, you know, so hydro because that's cheap.  Right.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in some ways it's awesome because Google and Facebook and Microsoft have  invested a lot of money and intelligence in creating the best performance per watt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in their interest.  It's in their economic interest.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if, if we're all running these, it's kind of like Bitcoin mining when all these  people were running crappy Bitcoin.  Right.  You're like, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's too much cost right there on the energy side.  Let somebody who knows what they're doing, do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is worse, a million Xboxes or a million people playing on servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure Google is going to spend a lot less money on  their, on their machine than I spend on my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stadia launches November 19th, 9 a.m.  Pacific time.  I did buy the founders edition.  Oh, you did?  You know, I didn't want to, but I did.  Uh, I got one of the, what did they compare the controller to a knife?  By the way, I liked that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I liked it.  I liked the narrative.  I want to hold something I can stab people with when they play games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't it great to see Baratunde Thurston?  It was.  He's been on our shows many, many times.  We love Baratunde.  And I guess Google hired him to be, you know, kind of a pretend journalist in  their videos for all this stuff, but he was so good.  It was good.  It was really nice to see him.  Yeah.  I really liked seeing him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did like the narrative about the controllers because if you think back to  the NES and that how that controller was just a flat rectangular device and it  felt horrible trying to play games for hours on end and how they went through the  evolution of the control has got to be a little more ergonomic, but you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  even though we know it was just like a candy bar, it wasn't ergonomic in any way.  I mean, it's taken us a while.  It has.  We've gotten there.  And as somebody who's suffered for gamers thumb with gamers thumb for many decades,  I'm, I'm glad.  Stadia is going to be a challenge for them.  We were just talking on Windows weekly because Microsoft's X cloud, which is a  similar idea is coming.  Microsoft's known for gaming.  They have a lot of titles.  Google has to, I don't know, it's going to take time.  Make a deal.  You have to buy the title, which is weird.  I'm sure we don't know, but I'm guessing Microsoft's service will have a pass.  Kind of like Apple arcade where you pay a flat rate and you get a bunch of games,  not with Google, you pay the $10 and you got to buy the games and they live on  their server, not on your computer.  And that's associated costs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you think that's fair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's, you know, it depends what they charge, but I think they're going to  charge 60 bucks, just like if you bought the game.  Oh, that's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause you can always sell them and trade.  I mean, like they buy one copy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's so many games you don't need a computer to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's if you have, but they're going to do AAA titles.  If you have, it comes with destiny too.  That's a AAA title.  That's a, that's a high end gaming title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you have their controller and if you have a, a, a Android phone, an Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  phone or Chromebook, which is really, I think, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, that's dongle attached to your TV.  All you need is a dongle attached to your TV and their controller and you can play  whatever game you want at launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to ours, Technica, the controller will only work wirelessly when playing  via a Chromecast ultra on a TV.  So you'll have to wire it for your phone or your, or your Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, it will be a game on their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not sure about that.  Oh, a lot of people, a lot of people play games on their phones.  I'm not one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always his pick of the week was it.  Thing that you put your phone on that you're, it holds your controller so that  you could play a game with a controller.  Hardware controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sony announced that, uh, you can play, uh, their, uh, their titles on a phone on  any Android phone now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Yeah.  Do you have to have a PlayStation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to have a PlayStation.  I think it works.  I, I think it works with their version of X cloud stadia, whatever the  PlayStation go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to ask some hardcore gamers because I don't know if it strikes me.  Gaming is kind of a puzzle to me.  It's very, it's very stratified.  So there are people who are PC gamers and that's all they want to do.  And they mock console gamers.  Right.  Yes.  And there are people who are console gamers and they mock casual gamers.  And then there are casual gamers, which I think is probably the largest number.  There are people who play on a phone or a tablet.  I think they're playing a lot of candy crush.  They spent a ton of money.  Right.  Cause it, cause a PC gamer spends 60 bucks for call of duty and then maybe  10 bucks for DLC and you know, but, but a casual game, I spent $300 on  Simpson's donuts without even blinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God.  My daughter has spent like $600 on horses, virtual horses and accessories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does she ask?  She's a good girl.  She asks you first, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  This is, this is like birthday money and things like that and her own money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But just like Michael does that too.  Still a crime.  His family and friends, our 16 year old know that the best  gift for him is a steam card.  And then,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, buying a steam card for someone is just up.  Or buying any steam related stuff other than the card is  ridiculously difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we let Michael buy everything else.  He gets the steam card, puts it on a credit on his account.  And I see all the steam charges go through my credit card and I see them on my email.  Every night I go home, steam, steam, steam, steam.  So I don't, I don't, I've never added it up, but I guarantee you he's  right up there with your daughter.  I mean,  And he's not hardcore though, right?  Oh, he's fairly hardcore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the PlayStation story I was talking about.  There you go.  Yeah.  See?  It's yeah, you can stream any, you can basically play your PlayStation from any  Android.  Here was my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a console gamer, do you want to do that?  Or do you want to go home and play on your 4k TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I'm commuting, if I'm on the, if I'm on the bus, if I could play on my, if,  if I still took the subway and if I could, uh, could play this on the subway,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  then Mary Jo Foley said that everybody on the subway in Manhattan is on their  phone playing the game.  I didn't know they're playing games.  I thought, Oh, they're texting, Snapchatting, they're doing other stuff.  She said, no, they're all playing games.  Wow.  I sat next to someone on an airplane for five hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They paid some sort of, not like the same candy crush.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're swiping a game.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I was just like, that is a really long time to play a mindless game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the whole point.  It's mindless.  Right.  You're stuck in that tube.  Lisa plays a game where there's candy and they're swiping.  It's like bejeweled or candy crush with a little wizard guy and there's like  candies.  It just takes you away.  It's actually a fun game.  I've played it.  And then, uh, she also plays words with friends.  So that's a, you know, but those are, that's a casual gamer.  That's the other segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You make paper clips and, and, and, and you cannot, you cannot talk about casual

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  game, casual games habits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you're the terrorizing goose guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most casual game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the best.  All right.  I'm going to show you cause you mock it, but it is the best decision problem.  Dot com slash paper clips.  Show my screen.  You start with a box of paper clips.  That looks riveting.  Oh, it's even more riveting.  Let me make this big.  Cause this is the whole interface right here.  You have a button that says, make paper clips.  You could set the price.  You can raise or lower the price per clip.  You can eventually buy marketing.  Let's make a paper clip.  Look, we made a paper clip.  Now we're going to make another paper clip.  Now we're making another.  Okay.  Oh boy.  I'm making the clips, making clips, clicking, clicking, clicking.  I've made so many clips.  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, why is this happening?  Okay.  You know what, Stacey, I defy you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked that question.  My code download this game on your iPhone or Android phone or go to  decision problem.com slash paper clips is free and just start.  I'm just saying I defy you to play.  I'm shocked.  It gets more complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It gets so intense.  Let me show you.  You, you use up the entire universe.  It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've done that and I will show you.  I have made 30 times 10 to the three, six, nine, 12.  I don't know how many paper clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you have to click that many times?  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eventually you get a wire here.  Wait a minute.  No, I just, I earned five bucks.  Look, Karsten, I can buy an auto clipper.  It's zoom out for five bucks.  Oh, now I got an auto clipper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I totally like this game.  So then you're now a tycoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you eventually, you generate an artificial intelligence, which  makes the paper clips for you.  But then what happens is you forget to tell the artificial intelligence.  Once you've made a billion paper clips, you can stop.  Stop.  So it eventually consumes all the resources on the earth and  turns them into paper clips.  At which point the AI says, well, we must explore space.  So it sends out drones.  Eventually you consume, as I have here, the entire universe.  And there's nothing more to do.  You've, you've actually turned the entire universe into paper clips.  So there's a problem with that.  There's nobody buying paper clips.  It's an old AI thought.  There's one problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the problem is not AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is no one's buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is actually a well-known thought experiment in artificial intelligence.  If you don't tell the, the AI to stop, it will optimize for making paper clips.  And, uh, AIs are good at optimizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I give you that, but I'm not going to play this game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So while you were making paper clips, I was connecting and setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was stalling.  Let me do an ad and then when we come back, we're going to hear the mini.  And then I do want to talk about whatever this chip is in the nest that  you're talking about, cause I, Stacey's are, are, are Silicon guru.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it ties back to our other, it'll tie back to ambient computing and I  don't have the Silicon, like I don't have a block diagram, so I don't know.  Let's do ambient computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you talk about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A hundred percent and so can Kevin.  So we'll get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But first I'm going to show you my shirt.  My Taylor store shirt.  I love this.  Flamingo.  It's got flamingos on it.  Isn't that great?  This is going on the cruise.  Nice.  This is going on the cruise.  This is from Taylor store.  Folks, if you don't know yet about Taylor store, go to Taylor store.com slash twig.  Let me tell you about this.  I've always, all my life, I've wanted a custom shirt tailored to me all my life.  I thought I had to go to Hong Kong to get it.  You do not Taylor store.  It's a great Swedish company.  So we know it's, I just love the Swedes.  They come up with great stuff.  They, uh, have an app you put on your phone, Android or iOS.  You position it.  They tell you how to position it.  You stand in the app, you take a picture, you turn sideways, you take a picture.  That's it.  They send your measurements.  They are using artificial intelligence, machine learning and  statistics to figure out.  Now you're, I'm going to think, did you do this yet?  I haven't done it yet.  I need to.  Cause you're so strong and you've got a big chest.  I want you to do it.  Cause I want you to see if it'll work.  Yeah, I would be a good test.  I have a normal body and it worked out of the box.  It fits by best.  Yeah.  See, he's going to be a challenge.  I think it's going to be a good challenge.  We're going to see Jason Howell, who's extraordinarily tall, like eight or  nine feet, his, he likes longer, um, uh, shirt tails, right?  And so he didn't like them.  They were too short.  So this is the beauty part.  If it doesn't fit, no problem.  They said, fine.  Oh, we'll make another one.  You keep that one or donate it or do whatever you want with it.  You don't even have to send it back.  So cool.  You don't even have to send it back.  The other thing that's really fun.  Now you can get some kind of standard shirts.  They have all kinds of fabrics, but they also have all kinds of settings.  You could have cufflinks.  Look, I got double buttons on the, on this one.  You can have piping.  You can have different spread.  This is a spread collar, but you can also get a preppy style  collar button down like a hundred different options.  You get a pleated back.  So you can get the exact.  Precise shirt you want, or you can choose if you're not the kind  of person that likes to do that.  I actually enjoy it.  But if you're not the kind of person that wants to do that, because I  like the paperclip game.  So of course you can also get some, you know, like standard shirts,  but they're going to fit.  They're going to fit beautifully.  And this perfect fit guarantee takes away all the risk in ordering.  It's not even like you package it up and send it back.  You just keep it and they'll send you the right size.  Oh, another thing I have to really admire them.  So they're Swedish.  They're very conscientious.  It's a 100% carbon neutral business.  These shirts are made in Sri Lanka.  In fact, this is another nice thing.  They gave the seamstresses camera phones and they take pictures of your  shirt that's being made and they email them to you so you can see your  shirt being made.  It is a completely conscious company.  And so these people have, there's, there's not a sweatshop.  They have great jobs.  They, by the way, if you're ever in Sri Lanka, Taylor store invites you to  tour their factory, actually it's more than factories now they have one.  There's one town in Sri Lanka.  Everybody works for Taylor store.  They outgrew it.  So now they're going to this town next door, but they love Taylor store  because they pay well.  They, they are conscientious.  They take good care of their employees.  They're carbon neutral.  I just love these guys ready-made garments.  Forget it.  You know, off the rack, forget it.  You deserve a shirt that's tailored exactly to your size.  This is Taylor store.  Get the size me app.  You, you, you know, and then once you do it, man, you're going to love it  because you just, I, I've now ordered several dozen shirts on Taylor store.  I'm so in love with it.  Now we've got a very good trial for you.  Each customer, if your new customer gets a dress shirt starting at $39, it's  50% off the regular price.  So this is a great way to try it.  39 bucks plus free shipping.  It's Taylor store, T A I L O R store.com slash twig offer code twig free shipping.  Some terms and conditions apply.  They'll explain it all to you.  Taylor store.com slash twig.  Do use the offer code twig.  So they know you saw it here.  Cause we want, uh, we want them to know, cause we want them to come back.  Cause I want to buy more shirts forever and ever.  Isn't that great?  The full name is I got some really great shirts, all the cruise shirts.  I've got a black one.  Uh, I got a Royal blue one that ro, but Robert was, Bob was about to steal.  He said, that's true.  Is that a nice try?  I said, no, it fits me perfectly.  You can't have it by the way.  That's another thing.  Nobody else can get it.  No sharing.  It's not extra large.  It's not large.  It's Leo, uh, Taylor store.com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to blow everybody's ears out.  So Carson, you tell me if I'm like gonna blow up the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm ready for all that base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  So I'm just, I have Spotify on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  So you don't have to say, Hey, yeah, no, I have Spotify on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, some fresh vines, whatever, whatever that is.  I will place up with it.  Yeah.  Play something that's Queen B that'll have some base.  We want base.  This has some base.  I think I listened to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, during the ad all about that base by Scott Bradley's jukebox.  Please don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, yes.  No, play Beyonce.  Whatever it is doesn't get taken down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me, let me, let me just play with it.  Let me just play what I have queued up and we'll take it from there.  So I have the mini set to the minimum volumes and I'll bring it up.  Okay.  So I'll hit play and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  listen to that base.  I already hear it.  I am surprised.  And you said good.  It sounds good to me.  Sounds great.  Well, yeah, really it's up to you.  I think that's a surprisingly big bottom for something that small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm, I'm surprised.  I mean, it's not an obviously a direct comparison.  I don't have another one here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But in your, so I think honestly the Google, uh, home max is the single  best, uh, smart speaker out there.  It sounds fantastic.  I'm in love with it, but it's this.  And it weighs a lot.  I think it sounds pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Considering the size it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we're hearing it through a microphone through compression through Skype.  What does it sound like to you?  That's really what matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, I feel like it can easily fill this office, which is like 12 by 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should let him listen to a Beatles song because that's what he listens to  all the time and he can actually do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll take us down.  Oh no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I won't do that to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although the new Abbey road remaster is going to ask you, isn't it?  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it great to hear those outtakes?  Had you heard any of those before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  I'm not to get off topic, but you brought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I want to talk about it.  I bought it immediately.  I bought Sergeant Pepper.  I bought the white.  I think I'm just going to buy the entire Beatles catalog.  50 years later, all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  So the, so the one outtake I love the best is the ballad of John and Yoko where  John says to presumably Ringo, he says, Ringo, you got to speed it up a little bit.  He goofed because Paul actually plays the drums on that song.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Because Ringo was not there.  So what, you know what Paul does without missing a beat.  Okay, George.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But only you would know what's going on there.  I thought that that was the one where Ringo says either I'll play it faster  or you guys come in slower.  That's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.  That's a different one.  That's the one that Ringo sings on.  He's like, I came in too early or you guys just came into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.  It's so great to hear that.  It's awesome.  It's what's nice is it's fresh.  You're hearing, I know it's 50 years.  What?  What?  Yeah, exactly.  What, what, what, what are you wondering about?  What part of this do you not understand?  I could post this card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you all still speaking English?  I didn't understand a word of that just now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, what, what token live up to Lynn?  Oh, okay.  So, um, it's what's good about it is you're hearing with new years, the songs,  you're hearing these guys 50 years ago, young, this was the last album  they ever recorded together.  So, uh, they're, you know, there's a little, maybe some tension, I don't know,  but they're still love each other.  You can hear that and it made it all fresh and new again.  I, I am so glad they're releasing these outtakes.  I just think they're amazing.  They're not out.  They're not outtakes.  They're additional takes of the same song.  Yeah.  So you can hear them doing Rocky raccoon and kind of, or old bloody  old black and kind of getting it closer to the song.  It's just, I want to hear more here in the creative energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I dig that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you going to buy it?  Yeah.  It's, it's my favorite album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a, yeah, me too.  And I think it was the first album I ever bought myself.  Um, it was Abby road.  It was 1972, 70.  When was it?  No, 69.  It must've been 69.  No, 69.  So I was 13.  It was my first album.  Uh, and I'll never forget putting it down and hearing boom, boom,  and going, how are they doing that?  That is, I've never heard that sound before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's, that's one of the very few albums and maybe the first of the  Beatles that actually use eight tracks to record, not four or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Cause they really were playing with it.  But I'm right.  It's, it was not the last album released.  Let it be was the last album released.  Correct.  But Abby road was recorded after let it be.  So this was the last album they recorded together.  And so it's poignant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The first song I learned how to play on guitar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and something, which is a George, there are two George  Harrison compositions on this something.  And, um, what's the other one on here?  Uh, Oh, is it why my guitar gently weeps?  I can't.  Oh, I hate that song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, what we, I don't friend you.  What I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am not doing the podcast anymore.  Why am I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just had to throw a monkey wrench in this Frank Sinatra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Frank Sinatra said something was the greatest love song ever written.  George Harrison, but this was late.  In fact, I love the text in the book because, uh, Paul kind of refers to that.  He talks about here comes the sun.  Here comes the sun is the other one.  And that is perhaps really beautiful.  It's a beautiful song.  And hearing George play it in the, in the take four demo, there's a demo demo.  That's right.  It's really good.  So what you get is four discs and a great book.  I didn't think the book is worthwhile, but you get four discs.  Disc one is Giles Martin's remix.  He's George Martin's son.  So he's been, one of the things he's been doing with this project is taking the  masters and remixing them in stereo.  According to the notes, a lot of times the stereo mixes, I don't know this late  in the game, maybe this is not the case, but in early Beatles, the stereo mixes  were not done for the Britain British market, they were done for the U S market.  And they were done really terrible.  They were awful.  They were terrible.  They were just thrown out.  These Americans, they don't know.  They don't know.  So, uh, and I don't, by Abbey road, they must have been doing it in stereo for  everybody if they're doing a track.  But anyway, Giles takes the notes remixes based on what he thinks was the goal.  I guess.  Right.  Am I right, Kevin?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it was to replicate what the Beatles wanted it to sound like at the time.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think the remixes are beautiful.  Um, George and Giles worked on love the, uh, Cirque du Soleil, uh, remix and it,  it blew me away if you get a chance to see that in Las Vegas too.  And so I think these remixes are nice cause it's, it's the same album.  You don't like love?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Kevin.  I've seen it.  I've seen it a dozen times.  She hates the Beatles?  No.  I've seen it a dozen times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's okay if you hate America, but if you hate Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.  That's it.  Every CES, I say, Stacey, I'm taking you to the love show.  You're going to love it.  It's awesome.  And she weasels her way out every year.  Smart woman.

Transcript:  I just want a perfectly loopable version of She's So Heavy.  That's all I want in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is take four.  She's So Heavy on the new release is fantastic.  And it gives you insight into the song.  Right, Kevin?  Yes, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want that song to go on.  Take four.  And for people who don't want to drop the money on the vinyl or the, the  CDs or whatever, most of the streaming services now have it.  Which surprised me.  I have it on Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bought it just cause I feel like the Beatles need the money.  Yeah, just a little more.  Oh, okay.  I don't know why I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, say something.  So...  Hello, am I better?  Much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Much better.  And you're going to the love show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Say something about, about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could I talk about ambient computing?  How would you feel about that?  Please, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want a commitment that you're going to go to love with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've already booked my tickets and my hotel.  So if it works, Tuesday night is love night.  Oh, I definitely can say no to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can we go to a matinee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, I feel your pain.  I'm seeing what you're dealing with now.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't go because I'm staying all the way down in the other side of Vegas.

What did I say?  60 segments?  No, no, 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say you didn't say that many.  30 segments.  Well, 30 segments.  We talked you down from 40.  It was 40.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought, hey, we can easily do 20 a day.  But anyway, all right.  No, you're doing 10 a day for 30 days.  OK, 10 a day for 30 days.  But then on Thursday.

Transcript:  No, I've seen aunt.  I met aunt for the first time at CES and he was delightfully calm and pleasant.  You know, he's a sweetheart.  I am.  Yep.  I was like, what is happening here?  This guy is just like, he brought me down.  Like all my energy went down a little bit and I was like, I can relax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to tell you the truth.  It's the little guys who are who put you on edge.  The big guys, it's like a big dog.  They got nothing to prove.  Nothing to prove.  It's just like dogs, the little dogs.  Nothing to prove.  Big dogs, just relax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin doesn't put me on edge.  No, just kidding.  Are you a little dog, Kevin?  He's picking heart.  No, ambient computing.  Yes.  Let's go.  Google, Google.  OK, so I was like, should I introduce this?  Weasel down again.  She's weaseling again.  No, no, no, no, no.  OK.  All you need is love.  I'm just going to put this on the screen until you start talking about it.  All you need is love.  So this is actually Kevin's take from the show.  And it's a good one.  Kevin wrote about this.  Oh, sorry.  You got to open my you got to open my site like more than once every two weeks.  All right. So I subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google, Google talked about this at I.O.  They talked about this concept of ambient computing, which I think Kevin and I have  been talking about for years, and Kevin has talked about since what we talked about  yesterday, 2013, I think.  And it's the idea.  Yeah. It's the idea that Google has all the information or could get all the  information it needs to be this real assistant in your life and not an assistant  that's actually tied to an echo where a lot of people think Madame A is tied to.  But just, hey, gee, help me out here in this situation.  And Google has all the pieces to make that really come together in a way  that's really awesome.  And they showed that today or yesterday.  Kevin's going to tell you more about this because he does it really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Kevin was checking for more songs with bass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was trying to set you up because you do a good job on this, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it was a great setup.  But you could speak about this just as easily because we have been talking about  this for so long.  And in fact, we started talking about this when they put Google now on the watch.  And I said context is king.  And, you know, it's yesterday at the Google event.  Yeah, sure. It was all about devices.  But the fact of the matter is all those devices are just sensors and input  for the smart home.  But the problem is the smart home has not been smart.  It's not taking advantage of all that data and doing something with it  that makes it beneficial to people in the home.  But finally, aside from the chips and the silicon, the cameras, the microphones,  the screens, they have unified everything under this new improved Google Assistant.  So by taking the software to tie all these signals together, the home can start  doing things on its own that help you out.  So like if you if you leave the house and you forgot to set your alarm, your nest  alarm, for example, the home can say, oh, I noticed that you've left the phone.  Yeah, exactly.  And it can set the alarm for you proactively.  Or maybe you've gone to sleep and you've left on appliances or lights.  Huh? Nobody's moving in the house.  I don't see any motion that probably asleep.  I'm going to shut these lights.  So really, the ambient computing is part of the story here because Google  Assistant is the software that ties the smart home together now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I would say it even goes beyond the phone.  Sorry, I'm going to jump in and then go.  Go. So those are great smart home examples.  But if you think about having the earbuds and then having things like your phone  around you all the time, we're seeing Google try to pick those in with the  earbuds, you know, they understand like ambient noise and can adjust  sound related to that.  So Google's like the whole idea is making your life easier.  And Lord help us.  Yes, their helpful idea is really great marketing around this, but it really is.  It's like if you give us everything we want to know about you and your  surroundings and we can really make your life easier, you'll think less.  You'll have less mental overhead.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Is that worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that trade's worth it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we're going to have it like.  Yes and no.  And I today it's worth it.  And I love a lot of things about it.  I say no, because.  I think we are moving towards a more surveillance surveillance, heavy state  in the government itself and having Google or anyone have all of that  information becomes a problem.  And that's where the no is coming in, because right now I kind of have a lot  of distrust around what our government's doing around this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you watch the democratic debate last night, there was a consensus among  all what have it, 253 candidates on stage that these companies should be broken up,  that they're too powerful.  I mean, there were some dissenters, but the, you know, there was pretty much a  consensus that these companies should be broken up.  And the thing is I would like the choice.  I would like to be able to bathe in the warm waters of Google's ambient computing.  If it's my choice, I want to do it.  I want to do it with full knowledge of what I'm giving them, of what I'm trading away.  I don't think it's right for government or anybody else say, well, Leo, you, you're  ignorant, you couldn't possibly know what Google's going to do with this.  We won't let you.  Right.  I think everybody should be given an informed choice, but they should be given a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I like Google's, the way Google is better than anyone because they say  they, they are recording you.  They, they, they are very upfront about the fact that they are recording everything  you do.  And here's the page on the web that you can go to, to delete every recording we have  of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Or just delete last week's what have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, Apple's added that now with Siri, you can say delete the recordings.  Amazon did it first.  Google's doing it now.  They're all doing that.  You can with your voice say delete my recordings.  It's, but honestly, I don't care if Google saves my freaking recordings.  I, I really fear, and this is the Jeff Jarvis moment.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That, that thinking about you, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jarvis, that the fear people have somewhat irrational fear people have of, of technology  and computing is going to lead to regulation that prevents this kind of innovation.  And I don't want that to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it has to.  And like what Google's calling ambient computing, let's think about, remember we've  talked about it a couple of times on the show, this concept of ambient privacy, which is  with all of this data being sucked up.  There is the ability of people and entities knowing where you are and what you're doing  in all aspects of your life that could be discomforting and not because you're doing  anything wrong, just because nobody's, nobody's going to look good if they're being looked  at 24 seven, right.  Through a microscope.  So I think we need to be, Leo, I, I'm not going there.  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Subjective.  I mean, if you feel that way, fine, but I don't want to be told that I can't be looked  at 24 seven under a microscope.  That's my choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The issue isn't that Google's collecting it.  The issue is that our government can come along or an entity that has the power to like  detain you or to negatively in fact affect your life in a really tangible way, can come  along and use that data for ill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're asking the government the same, that same party to legislate this.  So we are in, you know, I don't think you can't have a, as they trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing.  Where's the, where's the, what's the cost?  What's the cost?  It's going to make it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why should anybody be able to tell me I can't have Google looking up my butt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we're talking about two different things.  Okay.  I'm not saying that Google can't gather this data.  If I want to opt in to get this data, that's fine.  Good.  What I'm saying is we need rules.  We need rules that dictate how that data will be used and by whom.  So we need the equivalent of a legit search warrant.  I wouldn't go that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say we need full transparency and disclosure and then the choice.  And it's certainly up to anybody to write.  Well, here's why you don't want to give them that information and so forth.  Um, there's sure, you know, of course, constitutional restrictions, search  warrants and all of that, unright.  You know, I don't want the constitution to be under, under, uh, mind.  And so the right against unlawful search and seizure should apply to this too.  Yes.  I'm not saying abandon that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you read the New York times article probably a week and a half ago about  people in my neck of the woods using Palantir and other companies to Palantir

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is problematic.  I agree.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's not just Palantir.  I mean, Google and Facebook have some of the same information.  They're just not at this moment making it available as a service to  the government, for example, but they could.  And so, and this is where it starts.  We need to, if, if not, and we can't just shut down everything by saying,  I don't want regulation because regulation should come from us having  conversations about what we want to see and what we value as a society,  as a democratic society.  And what's happening today is every time we try to have those conversations,  we get shut down or we're like, we're not able to meet in the middle and  talk about it.  We're just like, I don't want any regulation.  It's my right.  Or I don't want, you know, any of this data anywhere.  So I would like to start trying to have these conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I think you're right.  I think you're right.  And I, and I'm not going to shout techno panic,  get it out your system, sir.  No, it's a, it's just cause I'm channeling Jeff, but, uh, you know,  I think this stuff should be regulated, but boy,  I did get a little chill down my spine when I heard Elizabeth Warren and Bernie  Sanders and Kamala Harris and all, and you know, these,  these candidates last night saying, yeah, we've got to break up big tech.  Cause I just feel like the way they're going to break it up is with a  buzz saw and it's, and it's kind of, they're not really going to break up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tech can't, I don't think this is campaign talk.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But still, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, Warren is so up in, up in arms about Facebook, but yet she still uses  her account for campaigning.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she has to, I mean, if she's not on Facebook, she'd

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, John Constine, I think it was on tech crunch had a great proposal.  Here's the solution.  Facebook should not sell political ads.  Period.  Simple enough.  And then if a candidate wants to put out a message, they put it on their page.  They can lie if they want, whatever.  They just shouldn't sell political ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's too simple though.  It's a very simple solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or they make a lot of, they make a lot of money, but they  still will make a lot of money.  They're not making, you know, that's not the biggest money flowing in.  They should just stop selling campaign ads.  That's, that's the problem in a nutshell.  That's the Russians bought them last time.  They should just not have them.  They can have groups all they want.  And if people want to share it back and forth and, you know, that's fine.  But the ads I think are the, maybe I'm wrong, but I agree with Constine.  I think that that was exactly the right.  Stay tuned tomorrow.  What's happening tomorrow?  Oh, Mark is talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mark is, Mark will tell us all what he thinks about who should do what on Facebook.  I'm so done with that.  And let's just skip it until then.  I'm so done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so done with this whole thing.  It's so sad.  So I have a favor to ask of you, Kevin Toffle.  Oh, what's that?  Do you still have your mini plugged in?  I do.  Would you say, okay, you got it.  I don't, you're going to bloop it later.  And I apologize to everybody at home for what I'm about to say.  Say hot word.  Hey, hot word.  Talk like Issa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just try it.  Hey Google, talk like Issa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Issa Ray here.  I lent my voice to your Google assistant so you can hear me do things like answer  your questions, breathe you on the weather and tell jokes while the regular  assistant voice does the rest.  Let's do this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you now have Issa Ray on your Google.  So John, she sounds very robotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds more robotic than the assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So I had John Legend for a long time, but apparently as of October 10th, Issa Ray  is also an option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the mic's off.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what, Issa, in your Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I use like the Australian woman accent.  You use red or whatever.  I forget what colors it is, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I like John Legend.  I have John Legend wake me up every morning, but now I have Issa wake me up every morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a question for these two.  You know, we talked about this ambient computing.  What do you think is the next phase?  What could potentially be the next milestone if you look in your crystal ball and say,  hey, this is the next offering that could really help out in the home and help people  be even more comfortable with smart tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you want to have a fun game?  Let's write the word on a piece of paper, Kevin, and see if we write the same word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please.  I don't think we will because because the tail end of ants question and I don't have  any paper.  Oh, what's the paper?  You just say the word first.  Say the word first.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me answer the ask the question again.  Now, what will the next phase of ambient computing be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the next milestone?  Because this is a big milestone.  This Miss Stacey, you know, mentions with we get in the software there and now we have  these chips in place to do it all right there on the device.  What's the next milestone in this in this phase of ambient computing?  OK, getting one word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Stacey's already written it down.  I have thought of a word that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of have a different.  Oh, so I'm like, oh, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll give my word because the second time you asked that, you didn't put the scary  part in, which is good, because my first answer would have been scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one word is presence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was my word.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You guys should play password or whatever that game is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should do like an IoT podcast together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, what's happening?  What is presence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two berries in a pie crust.  Hey, kids, what's presence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So presence is the next step in context of the smart home where it knows where a specific  person is in the home.  So when I walk into the room, my lighting preferences go on as opposed to somebody else.  I like that.  I dig that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Google's actually sort of working with.  So presence is a key part of any contextual awareness.  And Google's working on it with like the voice understanding, like or attempts to  understand that I'm asking for things like call mom and then it calls my mom.  But if my husband asked for call mom, it calls his mom.  So just imagine that applied to your location in your home or the fact that you're the  person driving the car at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My hub, Max, when I walk in front of it, it sees me and it pulls up my calendar and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stuff. So that was kind of my second thing was computer vision was going to be my.  That goes hand in hand.  It can.  It can also do a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yes, when Bill Gates, 20 or 30 years ago, became the richest man in the world and  he built his underground bunker in the Seattle area.  One of the things he put in, everybody was so, oh, this is so modern, so forward  thinking. Every guest who was invited to stay at the house would be given a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  some sort of a little NFC card or a card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when he walked into a room, his favorite or her favorite art would appear in the  magic frames of the room.  Right. That's right.  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And where it gets interesting, though, and what I think is kind of fun.  To think about is if Kevin and I are in the same place and are like we're in the  same room, whose preferences win or mine?  What does the assistant do?  Are we going to have to listen to my while my guitar gently weeps?  So if you want to take it further, then you have to start thinking about how the  digital assistants for each person mesh or does a person need their own digital  assistant? And then the family gets a digital assistant.  It's kind of fun to think about.  It'll meet in the middle and play Rocky Raccoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to figure that this house that he built in Medina, Washington, for  one hundred fifty four million dollars, is now 40 years later kind of a museum of  out of date technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure it's been up to.  Oh, is that on Lake Union?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You've seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen it from my friend's boat.  There's a bunch of houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A million.  Like a complex.  Oh, yeah. It's a it's a I don't remember.  It's like 80,000 square feet or something.  It's a million dollars a year in property taxes alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the sound system is run on a zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you don't see is a lot of it is underground.  You're just seeing the surface buildings.  There's a lot of it's underground, including a big parking garage, a zoom.  Yeah. Everybody gets a zoom when they check in.  It's like when you go to those hotels and they've got the 30 pin docs for your  clock radio, we're hip and with it.  Technology changes way too fast.  Clearly.  Yeah. You can't really build it into a house.  But that's I honestly think that we're really getting to the step.  I saw this right away when Amazon released the Echo, the idea of talking to your  house, those devices kind of disappear.  And that's what to me, ambient computing is.  It's not device tied to a device.  It's just ambient.  It's around you.  And any time you want something, you ask for it.  Yeah. And your little plastic pal helps you somehow.  And that's cool.  But that also could be creepy to some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And after that, you won't ask it.  It will suggest to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Let's see. That's that's that's the next phase is how are we going to get people  more comfortable with knowing that these devices are here in our quote unquote  surveilling, but it's also something that's useful in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there are six kitchens in this house.  Just six.  Very modern.  Look at the size of the TV.  It's like 42 inch TV in the kitchen.  Oh, M.G.  OK, I'm just saying, you know, that's the problem with this.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you were going to say, look how small that TV is for his kitchen.  That's what I'm saying.  It is tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a 42 inch TV.  That's the problem is that, you know, technology ages so fast.  So in a way, you better not build it into the house.  You know, you better let Google take over.  And I do think that people.  See, different different people have different places  where their creepy line is crossed.  Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I actually I wrote this in last week's newsletter.  I talked to somebody who did focus groups around Madame A.  And he said in the focus groups, there was a very clear delineation  of people who associated Madame A with this embodiment  of a digital assistant in the cloud.  So it was everywhere, which is kind of how I think of it.  But there was a really large group of people who also thought  of Madame A as being tied to a particular device.  That's what that's what they don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so I think part of this is education.  Part of this is, again, the trust, because these companies  are going to know so much about you that if you don't trust them,  you're not going to welcome them into your home in life.  And honestly, you know, some people will never be convinced.  Some people are like, I can walk over and turn the lights on for the switch.  And I don't think those are actually the use cases  that will get people excited about this.  I think it's probably more the security and monitoring kind of things or like  I call it education.  So things that will educate you or make you do things better  because they're just simply smarter like the June Oven.  So, yeah, I think there's there's a wide range for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the thing that's going to be the problem is interoperability.  Somewhere on your refrigerator.  Well, that will be a problem, too.  But interoperability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you do you do different things with different things.  No, that's not what you want.  No, I think of Madame A is no, that's not Madame A is my IOT  and speakers solution.  Google is my thing that knows stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And but that's dumb.  Who was it? Was it somebody just said or maybe it was  Windows Weekly that I think was Paul saying, I've got Echo  and Google devices everywhere, but but everybody's used to saying  the A word and nobody ever says the G word.  All right. You just it's which that's a semantic  burden that we shouldn't have to carry.  You know, we're I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You call sir. Well, wait.  So you do ask certain friends for certain things like I've got a buddy  that I'll call to go out and meet for gin, you know, because she's a big gin fan.  I'll have got another buddy.  I meet for cake because she's the only one of my friends that eats cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't you like it if all your buddies like gin and cake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's awesome. Yeah, that would be amazing.  But it's not the way the world works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is the way digital world could work.  My point. It could.  Why should you have that's an artificial distinction?  But when you're you got plastic pals,  you shouldn't you shouldn't even have to say  the key word, as you pointed out, they should know what you want.  Or you should just say out loud, boy, I sure like a cup of hot tea right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's a totalitarian viewpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, your creepy line is not my creepy line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and you might end up buying a digital assistant  and being able to apply it to all of your devices.  And then later you may buy a different version.  So maybe Apple's series suddenly gets loads better  and everyone goes out and buy Siri and applies it across.  If we're talking about interoperability, I think we have to figure out what layer.  So if you're talking about interoperability at the digital assistant layer,  we're not there yet, but we could be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That could get interesting.  The kept home automation from happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I would argue that now we have interoperability  between most of our devices through a digital assistant platform.  I really believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm hmm. That's true. I can ask.  Well, no, because the hello doorbell rings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My Google device largely solved this and Google has largely solved this.  They've all largely solved the the the IOT.  Everyone talking in different languages problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK. Carson's like, and that's the final word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're wrong.  We're moving on to new problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Daydream is dead. Do you care?  Nobody cares. No.  Was it ever alive?  Was it ever alive is a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People need content for that, right?  Oh, yeah. I feel sad for their content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But does Samsung do its gear VR either?  I don't think so. That's dead, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I'm one of the few people that actually still use the daydream  because it was really nice. It was comfy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Phone VR is dead, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see, I didn't use it for VR.  I just used it for that Hulu or Netflix.  It was it was great.  It was my sleep mask locked in.  And, you know, it was immersive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I made the mistake of the first time I tried to do Netflix on the daydream.  I watched Hardcore Henry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that must have made you nauseous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there was there was there was vomiting involved.  Oh, man. Oh, that's the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all first person like running around.  Oh, there's a bless your heart. Quick, write it down.  Clips clips is dead.  I came so close to buying that that was the little camera  you just put there and it would automatically get the best pictures.  I guess people thought that was too creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was silly and creepy. Silly and creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a bad combination.  And then Stacey wrote an article, Why Google risked  customer goodwill to kill.  There's a lot of because in this  sorry, can you rewrite the headline without the  X? Yeah, yeah.  Why Google risked customer goodwill to kill works with this?  Why did they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, see, this is this actually talks about some of this stuff.  Like the future.  I get the newsletter to Jehoshaphat's.  It shouldn't do that every time.  I'm sorry.  Don't apologize.  I want to yell at my my guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have ad blockers on our studio computers.  So so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's why I'm running you blockage Argent.  So there's no way it could know that it saw this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Know that we've that we've been there.  OK, I'm not letting you track me.  It's it's totally our fault.  It is not your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am disabling you block for this site, so I will see all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are no other ads on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know you don't you all have first person ads on this.  This is very well done. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's there's like a logo for somebody in the corner, but that's it.  Yeah, very nice. Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Beautiful. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I could pay Kevin.  Yeah, actually, Kevin should be the one wooing, I guess.  But I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So tell us about this, because this really upset people when they abandon  works with Nest. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now they've they've gotten back into  they solved a lot of the problems that people were most upset about.  So back when they killed works with Nest, they were like, we've got to kill this.  They did a terrible job explaining why.  Basically, what happened is when they decided to kill it,  what was going to happen for people's devices is Nest used to always  Nest devices had the ability to trigger their own events.  They were like their own little brains inside the smart home.  And Google was like, we're going to make the brain Google Assistant  and Google Assistant will control all the devices.  And people were like, but I have a Nest device that talks to my light bulbs and.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, shh, shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're good, by the way.  This is a negative side of ambient computing is that you have your voices a lot.  And I've gotten used to it.  Have you gotten used to it?  Like I my Siri is babbling in on all the time in the kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just so glad you all have joined me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's just voices like that constantly babbling in the background.  And I just accept it.  Yeah, it just goes away.  I just pretend it's all Karsten.  All right. Oh, terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my solution. All the voices are Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you had the slightest bit of mental illness in this modern world,  it would be challenging, could you? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or Google could become your friendly, your friendly voice in your head.  It's an interesting question, I wonder. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, go ahead. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's OK. Anyway, so now.  So if your Hue lights talk to your Google or Nest thermostat,  now they would have to talk to the Google Assistant.  And people were like, I don't like that.  Rightly so. So then Google was like, OK, we hear you.  We're going to let you keep your Nest accounts and, you know,  you just won't get anything new later. But yeah.  And most people I ask Google, they would not tell me how they plan to  how many people actually didn't.  Oh, what's the word? Didn't switch over.  My great. My great. My great.  My great. That's the word.  So now what they've got with this new thing, the Works With Assistant program  will let certain third party companies  talk directly to your Nest devices.  So it's just like the old days.  But now Google's saying to become a third party who has that ability,  you have to pass a security certification exam.  Good. Every year.  And that's why Google did this, because they had to.  The Verge actually had a great headline on this.  I'm really pissed that I didn't think of it  because I even thought about Cambridge Analytica while I was writing.  But they were like, Google wants to prevent Cambridge Analytica in the smart home.  And that's what they wanted.  That was why they were trying to lock this down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. They had all these third party companies  accessing tens of different APIs on different devices.  And so now they've locked that down, hopefully.  And now they're starting to open it back up again.  So now you've got those people who are allowed to use these things  or talk to Nest directly.  The other thing they did is establish home routines.  And these are easy routines that basically,  you know, Google's making the first ones and then later next year,  third parties can also submit routines as well.  But, you know, popular ones might be, hey, your Nest Protect is going off.  Let's turn. Let's flash the Hue lights, you know, so people can see  that there's smoke in the building. Right.  And then they also for smart home people,  they're at some point in time that they were not clear about,  are going to let us play with the devices and have access to our Nest devices.  And part of this is any time you're going to give access to a third party,  to your data from Nest, you have to opt into that.  And Google's going to make it very apparent what you're sharing.  So that's what all of this is. Transparency.  It's transparency. It's trying to make it more secure.  And it's also locking.  I mean, it's locking down the ecosystem.  But it's still trying to give third parties and customers  the ability to play with others.  And I think that only came about because we had this wild west era  where some things were allowed to become popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least something good came out of Cambridge Analytica.  Lesson learned.  But yeah, if we don't learn the lessons, then, you know,  then that is really is worth nothing.  Hey, let's play the trumpets because I think it's a quick change log,  a couple of highlights, and then we're going to get your picks of the week.  Play those trumpets, Karsten.  The Google change log.  Really good news if you use Google Maps,  especially if you're blind, they have added in depth  walking directions with detailed voice guidance.  So it's like descriptive audio for maps.  And Google rolled this out on World Site Day.  In-depth walking instructions in Google Maps,  including the distance to your next turn, a warning if it's a busy  intersection ahead, notifying you if you go off route.  It's available in English for the US and Japanese for Japan.  More languages and countries are coming.  So we had, yeah, we had a group of people in here.  I think it was Sunday for Twitter, one of whom was blind,  but all three worked for an NGO in the UK to promote accessibility.  They were really happy about this.  They were actually about to go to Google and then Microsoft and Apple  and talk about accessibility.  And I asked them, I said, do you think Google and Apple  and Microsoft are doing a good job making their products accessible?  And they said, yes, absolutely.  There's, you know, there's things that could be approved, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just the little guys that's not doing so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, these guys are big enough and I think they're committed enough.  Google calls its security key the Titan.  They are now making this kind of like a YubiKey.  In fact, YubiKey is making this one.  They're working with them. Yeah, they're making this one.  In fact, I have this YubiKey.  Google is going to brand it their USBC Titan Security Key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's exactly I'm so glad they're making it with YubiKey because they  they had problems with security in their last one.  Yeah, they were.  They were on the verge of completely Sherlocking YubiKey with their with their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  Although, you know, there are a number of companies I just bought.  In fact, I'll do a review of an open source key company out of Germany.  They make open source keys.  But this is the YubiKey version.  And I think you can tell it's exactly the same with the buttons on the side.  And all I do is I love this.  And so I have a dongle, right?  A dongle to my dongle.  This is on a chain, so I don't lose it.  It's a USBC to USBA adapter.  So that makes it work.  The only thing I need is USBC to lightning  because I can't use this with an iPhone.  And by the way, I know that's my barcode.  And if anybody wants to go to the gym on my behalf, please feel free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the original Titan Security Key,  which I locked down my Chromebook and my online accounts.  But it frustrated the crap out of me that it was USBA  when I have all USBC devices.  They needed to make this, especially because they're all in on USBC

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with their phones and with their Chromebooks.  Yet the last holdout is Apple.  Everything else works with this. It's Apple.  And actually, the iPad even works with it.  It's just the iPhone that doesn't work with it.  But this is a great way to go for two factor.  It's a hardware dongle better than SMS.  You know, I don't know if it's better than an authenticator.  I think it is.  I think, and I actually should have brought this up at our last pass event.  I'll ask Steve Gibson about this.  But understand how an authenticator works.  There's a secret code that's yours and yours alone.  And then it mashes that up with the current time of day  to give you a six digit code that changes every 30 seconds.  But that secret code is just really another password.  It's just another password.  If you have the secret code, you can make the authenticator work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And if the authenticator apps that are on your phone,  your phone runs out of battery.  Well, it's kind of useless.  So I'd rather have the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the key is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, if you get if you get jacked, then you're the guy's going to grab your.  He could get your chop your hands off anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it doesn't really matter and your phone.  And then you have a little harder to get my keys than it is to get my phone.  But strong piece of advice, I know you did this, Kevin.  In fact, Google does it automatically with their security system.  Get to because what you don't want to lose this.  Oh, yeah. So if you get to Google, Twitter, Facebook, everywhere,  you use two factor will let you register more than one device.  You want to register at least two.  I actually have three registered.  So if you lose it, you're not out of luck.  Yeah, that might be a problem.  But you don't keep those on your key chain.  You keep those somewhere safe, a safe deposit box and a secret  compartment underneath your desk.  Oh, no. Forget I ever said that.  Google Jim at your gym Bill Gates Basement.  I'm praying somebody goes to work out for me.  I am Leo Laporte going into work out.  Yeah. Yeah.  Google shares downtown West Master Plan for mixed use San Jose campus.  This is for the last several years, they've been planning a campus,  but they hadn't really given San Jose a master plan.  This is it.  Like their Mountain View campus, this is not the Mountain View campus.  This is another Google campus.  Three thousand to five thousand residential units.  That's interesting. You want to live in Google?  The building will accommodate 15 to 20 thousand Googlers.  There'll be an event space for the company.  That's actually good.  That's what Apple's done. That way, they don't have to rent space. Right.  Google said it's 5050 of site area of office to other uses.  So half of it is something that the city of San Jose can use.  That's a good idea. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it really right next to where the sharks play based on that top map?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Good luck with traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, see this Caltrain? Yeah.  Train goes right there. OK. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Bart is going to go right. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bart would be nice, too.  Caltrain's great. I used to take Caltrain  every day to work, and it was wonderful.  I really enjoy taking the train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like Caltrain. Yeah, it's a good train system. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hardly anybody jumps in front of it anymore.  So it pretty much is reliable.  Thank goodness. That's actually I'm sure it's true in the subway.  It's true of our smart system.  It works flawlessly until somebody jumps in front of it.  Yeah. Please don't do that. Yeah.  Please. I beg of you.  You're ruining my day.  You're ruining my day. Yeah.  I'm going to be late for work because of you.  YouTube gets alleged copyright troll to agree to stop trolling YouTubers.  This is victory.  This was a lawsuit YouTube filed last August.  Christopher Brady was issuing false DMC takedowns to other YouTubers.  Under the agreement, he's banned from submitting any notices  of alleged copyright infringement that misrepresent the material  hosted on YouTube.  This is a real problem with the automated takedown process,  is it's easy to cause havoc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wait. So basically he just has to use the system as intended.  That's the victory.  Yeah, but he didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He so he targeted a couple of Minecraft and gaming creators  using false copyright claim takedowns.  The company removed the videos as YouTube is required to do  when a claim is submitted.  It's happened to us many times.  But what Brady was doing was using copyright strikes  as a way to pressure creators into paying him money.  So really, it was more of a blackmail scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So extortion extortion.  Yeah. Be ashamed if anything.  So did they get him under Rico?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yes. Oh, that'd be great.  That means they could take everything, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So but this was a settlement with Google, not anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, well, Google told him to court, but they I get look.  I gather this was an out of court settlement.  I, Christopher L. Brady, submit admit that I sent dozens of notice  to YouTube falsely claiming that material uploaded by YouTube  users infringed my copyrights.  I apologize to the YouTube users that I directly impacted by my actions  to the YouTube community and to YouTube itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, that's not very effective, but OK, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twenty five thousand dollars in damages to.  And he can't do it ever again.  You can't do it. It's it's actually a big problem on that platform.  We get takedowns all the time for all sorts of nutty reasons, not for extortion.  Most often, I think it's just flawed content ID  that it thinks it heard something today.  This show will almost certainly get taken down. Right.  Because the music for that, because the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the thing.  And this array ain't happy either.  I thought it was all automated. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So well, it isn't all automated. It's content ID.  But well, for instance, when we streamed the Apple event on YouTube,  Apple has a lawyer found us connected with YouTube,  took our live stream down for how long was it, Carson? Weeks.  It was a couple of weeks. I remember. Just over 45 days.  Forty five days.  So we stopped streaming Apple content on our YouTube stream.  When Apple does an event, we don't put it on YouTube anymore. Right.  That's nice. It's not legal.  It's fair use. It's commentary. It's not.  But was a more broken system. It's just a broken system.  A couple of quickies.  Oh, that's the Google change log.  UK has dropped its porn block.  This is such a bad idea.  They were going to get you if you wanted to watch porn in the UK.  You had to register and prove that you were over 18 among all the registrars.  One of them was the largest porn distributor in the world.  So you go to the porn distributor, prove you're over 18.  They now have everything, including your driver's license.  Then the other place you could go was a pub.  You go into a pub, provide ID and the pub would give you a waiver.  This was such a terrible idea that finally the UK just said,  Oh, forget it. This is such a bad idea.  It's got bigger problems. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They, they, for,  they delayed it. They deferred it. They said, no, no, we're going to do it.  And they finally have just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So someone walked into the bar and asked Sam for, for a waiver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Ask Woody. Cause Woody will give you the waiver.  And he'll sell you an ounce if you ask.  Huawei reports stronger sales growth. How about this? This,  the, the Trump administration's blocking of Huawei gear in the United States has  really hurt Huawei to the tune of a 25% increase in sales growth.  Increase in sales. Most of that, obviously not in the U S all of that in China,  I would guess. Right. But what happens is of course,  Chinese people patriotically said, well, the hell with that.  We're buying Huawei. So,  it kind of backfired a little bit. If that's what they were trying to do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it was punished last week when I said the Chinese seem to be very patriotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are very,  Yep. Yep. Sales from January to September,  $86 billion.  And they sold like 110 million handsets, which is a good number.  That's a decent number.  Huawei's laughing to the bank.  Did you, do you play anybody play Fortnite?  It will be no sir.  Your kids play for them. They don't play it anymore. Did you stop?  My son does.  So I, I don't,  I wish I'd seen this, but apparently, you know, they have seasons.  Fortnite has seasons. Right. And it was a season 10 at the close of it.  A black hole devoured the world and that was it. Screen went dark and that was it.  It's over. No more Fortnite. No more Fortnite for a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fortnite was down for like two days. This is, this is marketing genius.  It's brilliant. Zach plays, right?  Zach plays a little, but no, he, he,  he mostly plays Nintendo stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is brilliant marketing. So, you know, there was an Island. It was bad.  It's a battle Royal game. The bus would drop you over the Island.  The bus has gone. The Island has gone. The map is gone. There's just darkness.  A black hole consumed all of Fortnite world.  Now they've relaunched a brand new location. The new Island,  according to the verge looks wilder and more untamed, plenty of forests,  mountains and lakes to explore fewer city and urban locales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just needed a couple of days off of rest is what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Battle bus is back though. This is chapter two and there's new gameplay  features, including fishing, swimming, boats,  and pogo sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought the idea was like destroy everybody. So,  are you going to take time off to do it with a pogo stick? More power to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alrighty.  Yeah. I guess, you know, if there's fishing hooks hurt though,  if a hundred go in and only one comes out,  I'm thinking the one is not going to be fishing, but you know, maybe,  maybe just stay there. You fish a little bit,  let them all kill each other and you win. I don't know.  It's a better strategy than mine. Yeah, I don't know.  That is strategy. Yeah. Isn't that, you gotta give Epic some credit.  Really, really smart stuff. And I'm thinking,  father Robert might've had something to do with this.  The Vatican has launched a click to pray wearable rosary.  It has an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Capitalize baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's 110 bucks. It's intended for,  I gotta think father Robert's involved here.  Text savvy youngsters to attract them to the church.  The click to pray E rosary.  It's a wearable device connected to a mobile app that's activated by making the  sign of the cross. The device can be worn as a bracelet.  It's got 10 consecutive black agate and hematite rosary beads plus a data  storing smart cross. There it is. That's the smart cross.  Once activated,  the wearer could choose to pray the standard rosary contemplative rosary or a  thematic rosary, which will be updated throughout the year.  The Vatican says the device part of the Pope's worldwide prayer network is  designed as a tech based teaching tool for learning how to pray the rosary for  peace in the world.  The app features personalized religious content, health tracking.  It's on sale now for 99 euro. Talk about ambient prayer.  Ambient prayer. All right, let's take tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get it, get the app and up so and so needs last rights.  Yeah. Got to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think father Robert thought this one up. I just feels that way to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The chat room clearly feels that way right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's got LEDs that we know it was Padre S J.  Unbelievable.  Our show today, we're going to get our picks of the week. Standby.  Our show today brought to you by worldwide technology, WWT and their ATC,  their advanced technology center. They built, they started building this 10 years ago.  Now it has more than half a billion dollars,  half a billion dollars in equipment from all the big enterprise OEMs,  key partners ranging from heavyweights like NetApp and Cisco and VMware to the  little guys, emerging disruptors that you need to know about like Tanium and  Equinix and Expanse. You know WWT, I'm sure.  I mean customers have been with WWT,  we often have been there for a decade or more.  They are a trusted partner for enterprise technology and this ATC  originally built for WWT's engineers.  They would use these environments to spin up proofs of concept and the pilots that  use the sandbox to experiment with different interactions and technologies.  That way they could recommend the right solutions to customers.  It also means that they could go from concept to delivery in much less time.  I mean it's a huge boon,  but now ATC is making this available to you and that is pretty amazing.  On demand and schedulable labs,  things like NetApp's cloud volumes on tap, on tap on flash,  NetApp disaster recovery as a service,  plus hundreds of other labs representing all the newest advances in things like  flash storage, multi-home cloud, hyper-converged infrastructure,  cloud data management.  This is lab as a service.  I'm going to coin that last.  Lab as a service.  It's a dedicated lab space within the Advanced Technology Center where you as a  WWT customer can perform programmatic testing of your own using this incredible  half billion dollar infrastructure.  And because it's virtual, you don't have to go to St. Louis to do it.  You can do it anywhere in the world and you can do it 24-7.  This is such a great idea.  We've been talking about it all summer.  It's finally here.  They have opened their digital platform encompassing the ATC ecosystem.  This lab as a service creates a multiplier effect of knowledge, speed,  agility, anytime, anywhere around the world for WWT customers.  You get access to articles, you get case studies,  you get hands-on with these new technologies,  all sorts of tools that make a difference in today's fast moving enterprise  technology world.  You need WWT.  Don't do it on your own.  Do it with WWT, a trusted partner.  Learn more about WWT, the ATC to sign up for access to this new on-demand lab  platform.  It's simple.  Just go to www.wwt.com slash twit.  Worldwide technology simplifies the complex.  www.wwt.com slash twit.  Really a great idea.  We're really proud to be partnered with WWT, delivering business and  technology outcomes around the world.  I don't think you hate America.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think you hate the Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you think both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was about to say, I think now people are going to start like finding me and  trying to hunt me down for hating both America and the Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, pretty sure that's punishable by death.  Kevin, how can we get her to love?  How can we get her to love?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got to get her to love.  I'm going to put it on her calendar and we're just going to drag her there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to put it on her calendar and we're just going to drag her there.  I will buy the tickets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mindlessly follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All four of us will be going.  You don't have to sit next to me, Stacey.  You could sit next to aunt.  You can have anything.  It could be an aunt and tofu sandwich.  And we'll leave early.  I'll be over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see.  Stacey and I are actually staying at the Mirage, which is where the love show is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Please.  It's just downstairs.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not playing when I'm there normally.  Otherwise I totally would have gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen it twice now and I want to see it three times.  What's your favorite part, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my favorite part is the part I haven't seen yet because they've  redone while my guitar gently weeps.  Oh, Stacey's favorite song.  I'm serious though.  They have it.  It was nice before, but now they've added a lot of technology to it, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trust me.  There's, oh, it's high tech.  You know what?  I'm going to make a plea because I know that people watch this show.  I remember we got an invitation to go backstage and see the stage and  the technology, a huge amount.  This is a custom built stage just for love.  And I remember they sent us an email.  If you're watching, if you can get us backstage, Stacey won't be able to say no.  Right.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If there's IOT in there, I got to go.  There's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I did that with the, with the Ka show.  I actually tweeted something about Ka at CES and they're like, Hey, come see the  show tonight and then see the second show behind the stage.  And my wife and I went and it was phenomenal.  The amount of technology, timing, communications is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen every Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas.  I think now it's really, really great.  Wonderful.  I love the resident shows at Vegas because because they have custom built  theaters, they can do such amazing things.  It's so much fun.  All right.  Well, Stacey, you know, if you want to, if you want to, you don't have to  could we though, I'm just thinking, I know you're going to be really busy, but  maybe if aunt and I and our excellent adventure could meet up with you for an  hour, you could show us five cool IOT things.  That'd be really fun.  Please.  And thank you.  Would you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure we can make that happen.  And Kevin will be with Kevin.  You're there.  Right.  Both of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless I'm at the Beatles show.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is your pick of the week?  Mrs. Higginbotham is Stacey.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to go with, I got a new device, but I'm going to show that to you next  week because I haven't had a chance to play with it.  So I'm going to give you an article from the New Yorker.  Can a machine learn to write for the New Yorker?  Oh, wow.  Mostly because it's very well written.  And at first I was, I was like, Oh, this guy is so hysterical.  It's a, it's a humorous article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it starts out humorous, but it's actually quite serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he does, he talks to some various like legit people, like David Ferrucci,  who was the guy behind Watson and Ilya.  Yes.  The man from uncle.  No, no, no.  The open AI guy.  But what they did is they fed the New Yorker articles into the, the, the  into the open AI GPT two database, which lets you, which writes on behalf of people.  And so learned how to write like the New Yorker and it kind of freaked him out a lot.  It was just a nice humanizing article for this sort of thing.  And I think I learned something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the Yorker does have kind of a distinct style.  I guess it would be possible to absorb the style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, uh, and you know, it did a good job.  It really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, actually, it's really good.  By that I mean, it seemed to want to distinguish my feelings from my thoughts.  To put it another way, smart composed seemed to want to know me.  That's that was artificially generated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And he threw a quote in there from Steven Pinker, and then he had like fake  Steve, Steven Pinker in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fake Steven Pinker.  Yeah.  So for all we know, fake Steven Pinker wrote his last four books.  The results of the first year of this work are promising, but the big  issues are about to be addressed.  I asked a mode if we should be worried about AI surpassing humans in an  array of specialized fields.  No, I think we can understand.  It's not going to be a society where people are robots.  He said the safety of any, this is the robot.  This is why you can't trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said he stopped writing.  He started putting his notes in as prompts, but it started  generating realistic quotes.  And so he had to, he had to stop.  Was that real or was it generated?  He was forgetting like what was real or what was fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  This is a good article.  And by the way, I am, you know, the New Yorker, which is a print magazine.  This is nicely produced for the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they have a really good web team.  And I have always liked the New Yorker because they write about so many things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their tech coverage has gotten really good, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But they, I mean, like the art, when they write about an artist or even a dance  show, they always have, you know, links to more content basically that helps  make the writing come alive.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very good.  I've been a reader for my whole life.  I think my dad subscribed and as soon as I could pick up a magazine, I  probably started reading it mostly for the cartoons.  Thank you.  That's what I read when I was a kid.  Yeah.  Good pick.  Really good pick.  That's where you get your twisted sense of humor.  Indeed.  And you got a pick for us.  Oh, this is John Seabrook wrote this.  Oh, he's one of my favorite writers.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And my pick this week is a little bit different, a little bit more on the  inspirational side.  As usual.  You know, you know, I'm a big fan of that little university in Clemson, South Carolina.  Well, I met a guy several years ago over Twitter and his name is Jock McKissick.  I knew of Jock McKissick as a Clemson football player.  I watched him play on the defensive line and just crush people with this  athletic prowess, of course.  But Jock didn't necessarily want to try to go to the NFL.  He wanted to be an actor.  He wanted to be a star on the screen.  Good for him.  And hearing that back then from him, somebody that's, you know, that grew up in, I  believe it's Opelika, Alabama.  And can you just imagine how many people told him, you are crazy?  Yes.  That's so stupid.  You need to go get a real job, if you will.  But he continued to pursue it and went at it and got all of his support from the  coaching staff at the time at Clemson University.  He was able to attend some classes.  And you know, here it took him about four years before he finally got a credit.  But he kept working at it.  Started his own little production and started writing.  And now I think he has 36 credits.  There he is.  You know, he's done his own short films.  He's been in a couple of big screen films.  He's a regular on, I believe it's called Queen in the South.  It's a TV show on the USA.  And he's just been absolutely crushing it.  And the first time I saw him on TV, it was on the blacklist.  He came across the screen and I was like, wait a minute, is that Jock?  Holy crap, that's Jock.  So I get on Twitter and it's like, dude, yeah, I'm on blacklist.  You know, and he's just so nonchalant.  But at the same time, when he's not on the screen, he's trying to tell people,  hey, you're in there, do the work.  Keep fighting for your dreams.  Just keep trying and keep grinding.  Keep grinding. That's nice.  So Jock McKissick, shout out to you.  Or as you like to say, salute, salute. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mr. Kevin Toffle, what's your thing this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I kind of feel bad because every time I bring a new thing to the show lately,  it's like programming.  And that's because of my classes and we're still doing  we're still we're still doing Arduino's and assembly code.  So my pick is actually something I stumbled on just yesterday.  And it is a tutorial that for just a few bucks,  you can get yourself a cheap little Arduino and you can basically  start learning about machine learning and train a model or several models  with speech recognition, gesture recognition, person detection.  And I'm not going to lie here.  I've been talking to Stacey about trying to get more to like coding and stuff.  So, Stacey, this is sort of for you, too,  because I know you like the machine learning aspect of things.  But this is definitely a great tutorial.  Look at look at the the gestures and the emojis. Right.  You know, and it's not going to cost you an arm and a leg to get a little  Arduino BLE device.  It's the Nano 33 BLE sense is cheap.  It's cheap and you can learn an awful lot.  I mean, it's think about what Google and all these other companies are doing.  You can do the same thing on a much smaller scale and learn a heck of a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would like what I just got, Kevin Toffle.  What's that? The Amazon Deep Racer arrived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh. It finally came.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I ordered that like a year ago.  Yeah. Now, this is well beyond my abilities.  When did that show up?  Yeah. Well, it's at home in a box.  And I'm not going to get to do it until after I get back.  But this is not it's not a toy.  It's not it's a remote control vehicle, but it's to teach you  what what Amazon calls reinforcement learning,  which is a kind of, I guess, a kind of machine learning.  It's a little road racer.  You you build a track for it.  You teach it autonomous driving.  You want to come over and play with it?  That's cool. We can do it.  That is freaking cool.  So I just wanted to let you know, I have it.  But I mean, this is that's not going to this is going to take some time  to get into.  And maybe I should send it to Kevin since he likes his programing so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey and I were just talking about that device a couple of weeks ago.  I think maybe four years ago.  Years ago. Yes. Yes.  And we weren't we thought maybe like they just kind of shut it down  because nobody seemed to have them  other than a couple of beta testers a year, a year and a half ago.  So it's amazing that they're shipping now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome. I bought it when they showed it at whatever event it was.  I thought this is great, which was dumb of me, but I did.  And and now I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have an illness.  That's all I have a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. You are going to learn something amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do it. What is reinforcement learning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's where you tell it's where you tell the Google  where you tell the Google where you tell the model  what you want to have happen.  And every time that it happens, it does it achieves it.  You're like, yes, do it more.  Otherwise, how they change shock it.  No, that's how they trained.  I think that's how they train the go model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  I know for years I had a screensaver called Brev Walker, which was like that.  It would try to walk, but would start with no legs, no information about it,  and then would try different configurations.  And if you kept running  iteration after iteration and hundreds of thousands of iterations,  you'd actually get a four legged walking creature was really fun.  Cool. So I think this is kind of like that.  So and then I want to think about. Oh, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I was going to tell you for people want to know more.  AlphaGo zero starting from scratch.  There's a whole deep on DeepMind.  There's a whole article on how it trained,  how they used reinforcement learning to train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so OK. So I thought they let it just go.  So they were giving it. That's what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're you're letting you're giving it an outcome and you let it  just optimize for that outcome, kind of like you're Rob Walker. Yes. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So you don't have to shock it or praise it.  There's no carrots or sticks involved. Yes. Yes.  OK. It's so in other words, I can set up.  I can set up my Robo racer and say, I want you to go around this track.  They provide you very thoughtfully with a half a roll of masking tape  so you can set up a track.  And then I could say, OK, and then just tell it,  figure out how to get around this track.  And then it will just run over and over and over and over and over.  Wow. I can't wait. And that's nuts. That's going to be fun.  That's going to be really awesome.  I want to give a plug to Karsten.  When are you taking your time off to do this pretty soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm I'm not actually taking much time off.  I'm going to be off on Friday and Sunday every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For the last few years, Karsten has taken time off around this time of year  to do something, I think, really, that helps people.  It's kind of a habitat for humanity, but for ghosts.  He builds a haunted house for the high school.  And it's the Anza High School, where his kids go in El Sabrano, California.  And it's expensive, isn't it, Karsten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It cost me a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to become an advanced spooker.  So I'm going to give you a little money on Patreon.  And now you will get your very first payment because it's currently at zero dollars.  But I will really want money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want people if you're in the Bay Area to go to the house, if you like Halloween.  Next Saturday, we will be having a haunted house at De Anza High School  on 5000 Valley View Road in El Sabrano.  Oh, it looks spooky.  From four o'clock until nine o'clock at night.  Four to five is for kids who don't like being scared.  There won't be any scary people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No jump scares. That's what really scares me.  You just walk around and look at the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And from five to nine, then you can you can have people jump out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can I have my ten dollars back?  I got a free ticket. That's all right.  That's good enough.  Yeah, it's on Patreon.  If you want to know more, Patreon.com slash Karsten Bondi.  And there's Frank that you built that last year.  You're doing something Frank like this year, though, I know, because you injured yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man. Yeah.  I it's not a good project.  Project project unless I injure myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then it's all vertical.  You want to see the 2018 version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are going in.  This is the little kid version.  All right. So this is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is this raise money for anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This raises money for Deanna High School,  for the parents, teachers, students, associations.  Nice. Good. Very good.  It's a it's a public school in a district that is not all that well funded.  So we try to do our part to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Karsten, are you the only are you like the chief builder?  I feel like you're pretty much the only builder.  Yeah, you're like this.  All of this high tech stuff is Karsten's doing, which is kind of neat.  Crazy, Karsten. Yeah.  This is really if we could figure out a way to tap this energy,  we'd have a much scarier twig.  Thank you, Karsten. That's awesome.  Nice work. And thank you, Stacey Higginbotham.  Stacey on IOT.com is her fabulous podcast.  She does with Kevin Toffle.  You can find out more on her website, Stacey on IOT.com.  And by the way, subscribe to the newsletter and it'll stop bugging you after a while.  She's at Gigastacy on the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was great. And you should do like a.  Well, no, I'm listening.  A standalone episode for how to shoot for the holidays,  how to shoot like new babies, things like that.  Like not. I mean, that's another show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's well, I mean, I don't know if there's enough content.  This show is retouching.  That show would be a good idea, though.  I think we should do that show and make it so we do have some ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we got some common shooting.  The act of shooting something in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, not just the act, but like everything tied to that one thing.  So like shooting your baby and retouching it or whatever.  I don't know. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called ambient photography. Ambient.  Stand still. Stand still.  I will not be here next week.  I will not be here the week after.  I will not be here the week after that.  I will not be here the week after that.  I am going far, far away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll try not to burn down the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to have a lot of fun.  I know we're bringing in guest hosts.  So the twigs show never ends, but I will not be part of it.  Sad to say, as I go on vacation through, I'll be back on November 20th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will you will you be posting any pictures and like maybe a Google  photos shared album?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's a good idea.  I hadn't really thought about doing that.  I'll probably blog them.  I have a smug mug page at WWW.Leo.Camera.  I'll probably put my I usually put my best shots there, maybe on Flickr.  And then I'm going to do the postcard thing.  So I did this last year.  I set a postcard every day from the trip.  I picked a pick one shot and then a postcard.  So I'm going to send them here.  So I'm sure the hosts will share some of them with me.  So there'll be lots of ways to keep up with me.  I don't expect anybody to do that.  He is not using Instagram. I was here.  No, I know.  I'm not using Facebook or Instagram.  That's right.  Yeah. Yeah.
