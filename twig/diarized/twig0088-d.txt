And of course, we couldn't do it without our great panelists, starting with Gina Trapani from San Diego, California.  Greetings.  Blogger at SmarterWear.org.  It's great to see you.  She's a Gleek.  Good to see you too.  Proud to be Gleeked.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  And Jeff Jarvis also here.  It's always good to have Jeff on the ranch, on the reservation.  His book is due out in two days.  The final edit.  Well, not due out, due from me.  Yeah.  You're due out of your hands into the hands of the ginormous metal machine that will...  Do they still use hot metal?  No, no, no.  They should.  I want a letterpress version of your book.  I'd like that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd like to feel the type on the page.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, we've got a Googler with us.  I'm very happy to welcome the Uber tech lead for search quality and user happiness, Dan Hulme.  Dan Russell.  Dan, it's good to have you.  Good to talk.  It's good to see you too.  Does the card actually say Uber tech lead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My card actually says Uber tech lead with the Umlaut.  With the Umlaut?  Search quality and user happiness.  Wow.  That's not even a tweet.  I mean, it's just too long.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can barely fit it on your lower third graphic on the video.  It's stretching out.  It's stretching out.  We had to combine concatenate search quality and user happiness into a Germanic single  word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And only on this show would we use concatenate in a sentence.  That's true.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I love this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a smarter show than your average geek escapade.  So Dan, how do you quantify user happiness and how does search quality lead to user happiness?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think you know that people are pretty happy as they're searching.  This is one of the reasons why Google is where it is.  The quality part is, you know, does the query response, does the search engine results page  actually contain the stuff you care about?  Happiness, well, comes from a lot of things.  One thing it comes from is whether or not you get that sense of delight.  So if you, for example, did weather San Diego, you would instantly get this sort of what  we call the one box result at the top, this sort of little cartoony thing that shows you.  It's that stuff that you don't anticipate.  You type in something like 23 euros in USD and it converts it for you automatically.  You might not have expected that, but that's a kind of delight.  That's a kind of way of making people happy.  We spend a lot of time and effort to make sure we do that on a constant day to day basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So things like the Uber tech lead, which appear to be mere whimsy, actually, there's a philosophy behind that.  It's about delighting.  It's the Google doodles, the graphical elements in the search results page.  All of that is really consciously put together to create an experience for the end user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hesitate to use deliberate and happiness in the same sentence, but yes, it's a very conscious thought out thing that we want.  It's a part of our brand we want to preserve.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that from day one?  Well, Jeff, you would probably know.  Is that from day one?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dan will know better.  How long have you been at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been here about five and a half years now.  In Google terms, that's an old timer.  How do you prepare for a happiness job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you prepare for happiness job?  Wow.  Are the drugs really good out there?  And who did you work for before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?  Kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I worked at Apple for five years.  Okay, they're experts in the same thing.  I worked at Xerox PARC for 12 years and I worked at IBM.  Well, you have quite a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was your unhappy period, right?  Quite a pedigree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just proves I can't hold a job.  What did you do at PARC?  Kind of the same stuff.  I was not a user happiness researcher there,  but I did human computer interaction.  The key problem at that time was we were building big,  hairy copiers for Xerox and big, hairy computer systems and all this.  And we were trying to figure out how can we make that simple and easy to understand.  And that sort of led to a large part of the InfoVis world.  How do we make the graphics, the computer graphics, the interaction  so that you can actually explore data, you can understand it?  It led to things like the Xerox Star, if you remember that.  The Alto?  Yes, the Alto predated that, but yeah, exactly.  How can we make all that stuff easy to use, easy to understand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina just took Edward Tufte's class.  Oh, excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did. It was really good.  So it sounds like user happiness is about Google trying to anticipate,  and Jeff talks about this a lot, Google trying to anticipate what it is the user is looking for  and getting that moment of like, oh yeah, that's exactly what I wanted.  Maybe a step sooner than I thought.  I thought I was going to have to click off to weather.com to get the temperature in San Diego,  which by the way will always make you happy.  But it's right there on the page and sort of along the lines of instant.  Google instant often delights me and knows what I make suggestions.  Well, there's Google Suggest and then Google Instant.  It sort of knows where I'm going with a query that has words that could have many meanings.  Right.  So that's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one way.  If we could read your mind in some way or sort of help to presage what's coming next,  that would be great.  And so instant is exactly that.  It's one of those things where as you type, it's running the query in the background.  And often it will do the query and give you the results before you realize that those are the results you needed,  which is fantastic.  And the role of Suggest, as you know, is that it puts up the suggested queries that other people have made on that same topic.  And often that will let you help to refine the idea.  So often we'll see people either in the lab or in the field where they're trying to work out how to ask that question.  And they'll see something in the suggestion box and they'll say, ah, that's it.  They click on it. Bang. They're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I always say that Google wants to intuit your intent.  Yes.  And then that the God of Google is relevance.  And, you know, those who act like relevance is just certain it is just randomness.  You know, I say that it's not serendipity is unexpected relevance.  So I didn't expect that I would like this or know this or need this.  I still want to get back to the measurement thing, Dan.  So when you when you invent something new and crazy, like, I don't know.  Oh, plus one.  Which we're going to talk about in a sec.  I know.  Yeah.  I wanted to say it first.  So that's not like doing an A.B. test.  You know, how do you test that for something like plus one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do dog fooding to begin with.  And so we we build out the prototypes.  We then deploy it internally and do an extensive series of sort of, gee, how did you like it?  Asking all the Googlers we know, sort of checking it that way.  So we get a ground truth check very early on.  The other thing we often do, we'll do we'll do lab studies where we will bring people in, NDA them, see if they can understand what that's all about.  So we do a combination.  Yes, we'll bring them in and have them do some tasks and try to recreate as real an experience and watch how they use it.  We also watch the ways in which they don't use it.  So we're also trying to measure their level of non-understanding or unhappiness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It strikes me this is a there's a fine line between love and hate.  Sometimes by attempting to do too much, you can actually peeve people off.  And I think there's a little bit of a drawback to testing it on Googlers.  I think that this is one of the criticisms that Google often gets is that the in-house tested stuff often Googlers are not not like you and me.  They are not representative of the general population.  They probably are like Gina, Jeff and me, but they're not like real people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not like real people. That's it. That's a key idea, actually.  So part of my job is actually to get out of Google, get out of Silicon Valley and go other places in the country and other places in California.  So a couple of months ago, I was in Merced, Mariposa, eastern California, interviewing people there, seeing how they understood parts of the Google user interface, the parts of the Google experience.  So you're absolutely right. If you ask nine out of ten people here in the Valley understand what a file structure is, that's not true in the rest of the United States.  I'm not sure I understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we've said we've said this a lot on this show is that what Google needs is not more computer scientists, but more social scientists.  Is that kind of what you are? Is a hybrid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, actually, I have a PhD in artificial intelligence.  How's that working out for you? Yeah, I recovered, got better.  And actually, what really happened, the seminal experience for me was being at Park and I had been working on a very fantastic total AI logic theorem proving system that would help people use this very complex copy that we built.  And we did an early user study and we actually had a Nobel Prize winner come in and he was completely lost using that system.  Oops.  This is my on the road to emphasis moment.  And I realized that you could have the most fantastic AI in the world.  But if the interface doesn't communicate what it's about, doesn't make sense.  You're lost. Yeah.  So that was really the moment I sort of switched from doing AI to doing HCI.  And that's when I started realizing I needed to understand the humanity of it and how people really thought what they really understand, what they like, what they don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Little side note.  Four o'clock this afternoon, we're interviewing Ray Kurzweil, another AI legend.  I wonder what his road to thesis was.  Thanks.  So let us we're going to what we're going to do.  Dan, you're here.  If you guys want to ask Dan some questions, we have a lot of Google News as well.  I guess I'll leave it to you, Gina and Jeff.  You want to quiz Dan some more or include him in the conversation?  Let's talk about plus one, for instance.  Yeah, let's talk about plus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm wondering how much Dan was involved in that and whether we should chat about it while he's with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's briefly discuss what it is.  It sounds like you can dig Google search results, basically.  Yes, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, plus one, just to let you know, I was not really involved in that.  I certainly know what it is.  And in calling it the sort of digification of results, you know, saying that you like a particular result so that, you know, shows up higher in your next next time you search for something like that.  That's basically what it is.  It is an effort to try to take advantage of the global network of people and what they know and try to build that in a little bit more.  We realize that that's an important part of our online experience.  How can we do something with that?  Does it show up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see it yet on the Google, on my Google results.  Does there get a little thumbs up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can sign up in the lab.  Ah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to opt into the experiment.  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's actually a good point because we do a lot of experiments about different kinds of things.  We're constantly changing the UI.  I guess people know this generally, but we're constantly running hundreds and hundreds of experiments on live traffic.  And this is one of them.  In this case, you can opt into it.  In many cases, we're doing things where we move things around or change the colors or the layout or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't tell me.  I know I've caught you doing that.  That's true.  It's true.  So you do it to some of the users, a subset of the users and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  We do it for we do a random, a random selection.  So it's like a one percent or five percent or something like that.  And it's basically all random selection.  And so we by that we can tell whether or not with a change we've made actually is a positive change or a negative change.  And that's another important aspect of what we do.  So we do things like lab studies.  We do field studies and we do live traffic studies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That cut says the address is Google dot com splash slash experimental.  I've been trying to find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, good.  Google dot com slash experimental.  So how do you get metrics?  Do you are the metrics, Dan, on how speed?  I mean, you're not watching people.  You're not doing eye tracking on your users out there.  How can you tell what kind of result you're getting with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We we have a lot of sort of secret sauce analysis that so I'm not going to tell you a lot of details about that.  But what we're doing basically is seeing whether or not people are successful at completing their task.  Now, we don't always know what their task is, but we do have measures that tell us that the experience is going well for them.  It's in essence, we're trying to see if you're in a flow state, if it's working.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Flow is the word.  Flow is the word.  We don't exactly have a flowometer, but we do have ways of sort of seeing whether or not things are clicking are on well for you.  And you're going smoothly from thing to thing to thing.  And that is a little bit of timing kind of sort of.  Yeah, that's a good way of thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's making me uncomfortably reminded of my urologist, but we won't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so I've turned it on now.  And so I see a little, this is interesting.  I see a little plus one box.  Now, how is now, you know, I've seen this before within my account.  I can rearrange search results, but this is not the same thing.  This will say to whom that this is a better result, for instance, than others.  It's basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what we're doing right now is it's just affecting your results.  But, you know, in general, you can think about, you know, we're going to be using this information to help potentially change the way in which we think about assessing relevance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have a bury button.  Good news.  A what?  A bury button.  That was what pretty much killed Dick.  Right.  Right.  Dislike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dislike.  No dislikes.  Minus two.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this part of the MatCuts world that is trying to find more signals of quality to improve search results?  Yes.  Is this us helping Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're constantly looking at many, many factors to improve quality.  If we can figure out some, you know, that every third character, if it's a consonant, improves the quality, that's something we'll try to discover with our data mining and our experimental studies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt also points out in the chat room that you can block results, guys, by clicking on a result and then clicking back.  And there's the Chrome extension to block sites.  And I presume that's more data for you as well as to what problem sites there are.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's an extension you have to add, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So our goal in all of this is how can we make the search results increasingly relevant to you?  And if we can make it relevant, more relevant to you by using a plus one signal, that's fantastic.  This is all part of our goal to make you happy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So my so I, I totally understand that.  And I think this is cool.  I think I think from a user perspective, though, it makes me feel like I'm so confused.  Like there's starring, there's bookmarking, there's sharing and liking and reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's I mean, I get different results depending if I'm logged in or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to logged in for this to make any sense.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But when I when I log out, I actually get different search results.  Right.  Like my profiles on top when I'm logged in, when I'm not logged in, it's down towards the middle of the pack.  Which actually is nice.  It wasn't on there at all before.  So I appreciate you at least giving me a profile.  That was Matt, not me.  Thank you, Matt.  Thank you, Matt.  For a while, I actually asked Matt about that.  And for a while, Matt said, oh, you're a celebrity.  We don't put your profile in search results.  Yeah.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt has the smoothest.  Yeah.  He's so charming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He can make you feel like a rock star while basically saying no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So me and Mick Jagger, we have the same issue.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Well, I think this plus one is, you know, it's an experiment.  I know you can only do one experiment at a time if you go to that google.com slash experimental.  That's kind of cool, though.  There are other experiments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's had a pretty big launch for an opt-in experiment.  Right.  Because those experiments kind of update fairly often.  Right.  I guess some get more attention than others.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are lots of things that go absolutely nowhere.  Some that take off really well, and then they get incorporated into the main search results mechanism.  So some experiments fail.  If you're not failing at some experiments, you're not doing something right.  You're not trying hard enough.  Completely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whereas Lady Gaga said, if I'm not standing in Marissa's shadow, I must be off campus.  Something like that, though.  Something like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It's worth knowing that we run, like I said, hundreds and hundreds of experiments.  And I would say the vast majority of them don't work.  And that's okay.  But we learn something in the process.  We learn things that don't work.  And so we can try to design the whole experience, design the visual appearance of the page,  the way things flow from one property to the next.  So all things start to work together to be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very cool, actually.  I love seeing a little bit behind the scenes of the process, because this is such a difficult thing to do and so challenging.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  And from my perspective as a researcher on this, the challenge is both at the very large end where we look at, say, millions of interactions through logs,  but also looking at the personal one-to-one kind of end of it.  For example, I've been interviewing people about how they, for example, use the advanced search page.  And I've had people say, ick, I hate this.  Unfortunately, that doesn't show up in logs.  Right.  So part of my job is to bridge the qualitative behaviors we see in the field, the people saying ick or saying they love it,  and then being able to go look for evidence elsewhere in the log behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we need an HTML5 element that can grab user facial expressions when they...  Oh, that'll be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google would like to watch you while you look at this page.  Say yes or no.  You know, there's also a big issue of unintended consequences because Google is so big and so powerful.  I'll give you an example.  Amanda Hesser wrote an interesting guest blog post.  I think it was on TechCrunch.  She's a recipe writer and wrote a great cookbook for the New York Times.  And she pointed out that billions of recipe searches a month on Google, billions.  It is simply the largest, most influential arbiter of how to cook food in the world,  much more so than any food blogger, than Epicurious or any magazine.  And she said, you know, Google recently made a change, a seemingly sensible change, to the recipe search.  You can constrain the search based on ingredient, amount of time to cook it, and I think there was a third constraint.  But she said this has an unintended consequence.  People are going to make worse food because it artificially promotes sites that have the manpower  to put this metadata into their recipes.  And the simple cooking blogs that just have great recipes are going to be left out with this kind of thing.  You must pay attention to these kind of unintended consequences, but it's very hard to predict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  The good news about that particular thing is the microformat syntax is relatively simple to do.  So the amount of manpower it takes, person power it takes, is really small.  I mean, you can go in and just very quickly edit that HTML and just add it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She also points out that the longest cooking time is an hour.  It is constrained.  She says, so let's say you want to make cassoulet.  There is no cassoulet that takes less than four hours to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. Or a decent loaf of bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So she found a lot of cassoulet recipes.  There's a one minute cassoulet, but it wasn't cassoulet really.  Crunch, crunch, crunch.  And there's also SEO issues where people will artificially change the calories or the cooking time.  Lie about the calories, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's, you know, we have SEO for absolutely everything.  I'm not surprised we have SEOs about K cal's as well.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, but you know, I think I want to call you on the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was the Huffington Post, by the way.  I should just real quickly say it was not TechCrunch.  This is a Huffington Post article from March 24th, if you want to read it from Amanda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  The microformats problem there, you know, I agree, but I think that Amanda's right that if you get to, you know,  I know a lot of food bloggers and they're bloggers.  They're not data sites.  They're not going to do a microformat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not.  They're not going to know how to.  And so it really is Google's job to format for them.  I would argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, to the extent that we can extract that metadata and assemble it properly, we will.  It's largely a problem of making the parsers robust enough so that they can crawl arbitrary content  and then extract the metadata and do the right thing.  It's very hard.  To give you another example of that, we also have this fantastic feature in search called define.  So you say define colon word like define colon peruse.  And we crawl the entire web looking for definitions.  You know, peruse is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And, you know, that's a kind of thing where we have unintentionally made the world's biggest dictionary as well.  But what's it doing to the dictionary manufacturers?  Right.  It's another resource.  Right.  It doesn't exclude them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when we started Epicurious back in the day, back in the 90s, we had thousands and thousands of recipes from Gourmet and Bon Appetit.  We had the same problem then with the metadata and getting them in.  And we had them taped, honest to God, by troops of monks.  Yeah, monks are good.  They had good attention to detail.  The only problem was that when you hit a certain part of the year, they had to break off to make their fruitcakes.  Oh, those monks, they're good.  The mechanical Turk of the 90s.  They were real monks.  They were honest to God, real monks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I've had those Trappist fruitcakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, at least they weren't in the fryer business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, thank you very much.  He likes puns too.  So just, you know, going back to Amanda's article, and it's best place to go, we go to her blog.  Let's not give HuffPo anymore credit.  Food52, the number 52.com.  Did Google read this?  Did Google read this?  And is there a response to this?  I mean, obviously you can't jump to respond either because then you might have other side effects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I personally haven't read that blog yet, but there are many, many blogs on Google and I can't read them all.  I try to stay busy on top of stuff, but that particular one I don't know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an interesting indictment of, and I only bring it up because it's about unintended consequences.  I'm sure Google with every intention of improving recipe search, you know, made added these three parameters.  What's interesting to me was also that a billion recipe searches a month just shows you the power that you wield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think there's a different kind of savvy web users know that, like, you know, if I'm looking up a word I use define on Google a lot.  If I really want to see the whole definition, I click through, you know, I'll glance at Google's definitions aggregated from various sources.  They don't click through. It's kind of the way I deal with Wikipedia.  I'll skim Wikipedia if I just want to kind of overview.  But if I really want to know the details, I click through to the sources, you know, the kind of the original sources.  And, you know, I know that that's kind of, you know, I spent a lot of time on the web, so I've kind of figured that out.  But I don't know. I think that's part that's something that users should know about, too.  By the way, Google did respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kavi, who is in the he says, I'm the project product manager at the Google search quality team and was one of the people who helped create recipe view.  Long, thoughtful response. So Google does pay attention. Absolutely.  Wow, that's quite a response.  Yeah, really long, long, thoughtful response. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll put up a link just now to Jonathan Stray wrote a blog post this week that got around a lot of attention on the editorial bias that is human bias that is built into any algorithm.  Yes. And we know it's there. We sometimes forget about that. But of course, it's there.  That's right. Yeah. I mean, there's editorial bias in everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I was going to say there's editorial bias in everything.  We tend to think of libraries as not being having a particular point of view.  But in fact, every book in the library is curated. Someone had to acquire it.  They had to decide to not pick out the other 10,000 books.  And so libraries have a bias as well. In fact, it's much smaller than the corpus that we operate under.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David Weinberger does a great spiel on that. The co-author of The Cloutre Manifesto that goes through Dewey and says there's a hundred numbers for Christianity, like two for Judaism and one number for everything else in the world.  That's an excellent point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Dewey has bias.  And I think people feel like, oh, computer algorithms are inherently unbiased, but somebody writes the algorithm.  That's right. That's right.  In fact, there's the guy right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another thing I want to bring up about unintended consequences is, you know, one of the things I discover when I go out and watch people search, because I do that a lot, is they'll, for example, land on a very long search page, results page, and they won't be able to find the words that they're looking for.  Right.  And so what do they do? Well, if you're a digeratis, one of us, you know how to use Control-F or Command-F or Edit-Find.  And in my researches, I've discovered that 90%, 90% of the U.S. Internet-using population does not know how to do that.  That means when they land on that landing page, they cannot find the thing that they're looking for and they have to read through it line by line.  And if it's 140 screenfuls long, that makes them crazy.  So you notice in the preview thing that we did, if you click, it actually will highlight the search terms on the preview doc so you know where to go look for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. And Gmail does that as well, right? Gmail uses the kind of yellow highlighter.  Exactly.  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's one of these things where we found out something that we hadn't anticipated.  We added a new feature that's intended to really accelerate people's use of the tool so that they can get to their results faster.  They don't have to think about it as hard. We can just make their life faster, simpler, more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I really like what you've done with the search, the recipe search.  Now that I look at it, on the left side, we can turn off ingredients.  Yes, of course, admittedly cooking time only goes up to 60 minutes and calories only go up to 500 calories.  But that's, you know, you're a fool if you're looking at cassoulet and say, well, I'd like the 15-minute version.  But there's, look, the search results are great, frankly.  And I love this, you know, additional capability. I don't think I'd see anything wrong with it.  And look here, something different with the confit risotto to jean paella and gnocchi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are other areas of life that will be good for this kind of search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, for this kind of metadata-faceted search, you mean?  Yeah.  Well, generally, anything that has metadata, right?  Right.  But more generally, there are large numbers of domains.  And I'm not going to give you any pre-announcements here, but you can imagine areas of knowledge where there are different facets like this.  In this case, we have dimensions like calories or ingredients or something where you want to include or exclude particular properties.  The easy one would be something like, you know, imagine something that does travel.  That's the example that everybody uses.  I want to have things that fit within these constraints and not those.  So anytime you have a domain of knowledge with a lot of dimensions, a lot of constraints, you can apply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can do it with retail.  In terms of travel, what I would wish is I could do that with restaurants and go to the next level of knowing what their menu is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you could do something like that with our shopping results now.  You can, for example, limit it to within a particular price range.  And that's another instance of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One thing we talk a lot about on this show is the ascendancy, rapid ascendancy of social search and Facebook's advantage there over Google.  And that would be another way to add metadata, to add search refinements with social.  But it's a thorny, a challenging thing to incorporate social into the user experience in a way that isn't, first of all, creepy.  Right.  You want to go right up to that creepy line, but not cross it, but also useful.  What are you doing there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I can't.  First off, I'm not involved in that, so I can't tell you any secret stuff.  I don't even have any good secrets to tell you about that.  But you can imagine you're absolutely right.  You recognize the issue, of course.  Absolutely. Absolutely.  And it's clear that it's a great repository and of information like this.  And it's clear that search is becoming increasingly personal, increasingly social, increasingly local.  So there's all these new properties that we'd like to be able to bring into it.  And this is something we'll have to try to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to thank you, Dan, for joining us.  We really appreciate it.  We don't want to have the same thing happen that happened last time.  So I will let you go.  But it's really great to talk to you.  Thank you for volunteering to be on here.  My pleasure.  I really appreciate Google's openness and willingness to talk in a public forum about what it's up to.  That's great. Thank you, Dan.  Take care.  Thank you for having me. See you.  It's great to have you.  Our next guest also is Uber tech lead at Search Quality and User Happiness at Google.  We're going to take a little break, come back, and talk about lots of other news with Google.  And then we'll have Cassoulet for all.  But I'm cooking it right now.  I got the 15-minute version.  It should be ready in a second.  But first, let me talk a little bit about GoToAssist Express, those great folks who make it possible to do remote support without tearing your hair out.  GoToAssist Express is a company who supports family, friends, or does it in business, supports clients, colleagues, knows how challenging telephone support is.  And you don't always have the ability to go down the hall or across town or across the country to fix the problem.  So this is where GoToAssist Express is so useful.  It allows you to do remote access to the problem, fix it yourself without walking somebody through it.  And it is incredible.  If you're on the phone with somebody, you send them a link, they install it.  30 seconds later, you're in Mac or PC, completely cross-platform, fix a Mac from a PC and vice versa.  And just the easiest to use.  First of all, it's fast.  Nobody's going to use a remote support platform.  No tech person is going to use a remote support platform if they have to move the mouse and wait as they watch the pointer go across the screen.  This thing is just about as fast as can be.  Citrix really knows how to do all sorts of clever tricks to make sure that it feels snappy and responsive.  They even do things like they allow you to have eight sessions at once.  So you can start and install on a machine and then move to the next and start a scan and move to the third.  And that way you're much more efficient with your time.  That's probably why Frost and Sullivan, which is an industry analyst group that specializes in this particular sector of software, gave GoToAssist Express the name  market wide, world leader, number one remote support solution worldwide.  Easy to use, 100% secure using 128-bit SSL.  Very simple for your clients. They don't have to have it installed.  You just send them a link, as I said, and it couldn't be easier.  It is just a great way to do support.  And I want you to try it.  Believe me, one of the things I insist on with all of our advertisers is a chance for you to try before you buy.  And Citrix has been great about this.  Not just try it for an hour.  30 days free.  Go to assist.com slash twig, G O T O assist dot com slash twig.  I know a lot of you who watch our shows are in the support business.  Your I.T. professional software support people.  Certainly we all support family and friends.  This is a tool you want.  They have day passes for those of us who don't do it all the time.  Go to as well as the monthly subscription.  Go to assist dot com slash twig.  Twig, we thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Gina, I want to ask you about this word now that Honeycomb will not go open for some time.  Yes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Andy Rubin said that they rushed the zoom, the Motorola zoom, which is the honeycomb sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you mean the one we we spent six hundred dollars on that Motorola zoom is not ready.  Oh, somebody else bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So a little birdie at Google who shall rename nameless sent me a Motorola zoom.  You didn't have to buy it. Well, that's my I've I've yeah, I've been test driving for a week.  And wow. So what do you think?  It's well, it's my first tablet.  So I'm having that first novel like, holy crap, tablets are cool moment.  Yes. But I also I like it very much.  It's a big slab computer.  The on button is in a really weird place, but I like it very much.  I'm still getting used to it.  I've only had a few days with it and I'm probably going to give it away to one of my contributors on think up.  But for the for the most part, I like it.  I wouldn't have spent my own money on it.  I still think that the price is too high and honeycomb still not fully baked.  Well, that's the question.  This story. That's that's that's this story. Right.  Right. So Google is not releasing honeycomb source code, which has open source enthusiasts and religious and zealots kind of up, you know, up in arms.  How open really is Android?  I have to tell you, and this is probably going to get me in trouble with some of the more sort of religious types.  I'm OK with it.  I'm OK with Google holding on to honeycomb until they feel like it's ready to release.  I don't think if you've taken shortcuts in code and you've written crappy code, especially if you're Google, you don't you don't release it yet.  I think they're you know, they rushed honeycomb to market.  The zoom is obviously still unfinished for whatever their reasons were.  Maybe the iPad.  But, you know, honestly, I think that Google should have a little more control over Android.  I'd like to see them up their standards a little more and enforce some more rules around who can put the Google name on on every device and what it does.  So I'm OK with this for now.  I know I'm supposed to be enraged, but I Android is open enough for me.  People are upset.  They feel like Android is using open source as a marketing tool, but it's not truly open source because true open source projects, you know, the sources.  There's committers outside outside committers.  There are nightly builds.  The source is always available.  You know, Google holds back and does releases in batches.  And now this honeycomb release, there's no telling when it's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't this what happens though every time it seems my memory is that every time there's a new version, there's a period of time, sometimes months between the release of the version on phones  and the open sourcing of that right version.  So that is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The difference this time is that there's no date.  I mean, the announcement was we're not releasing this yet and we don't and maybe never.  It sounds like the way for never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not it's not I don't think it's going to be never that that I just mean there'll be a next version of ice cream bar.  I see sandwich or whatever that this one may never be ready for prime time.  Gina, let me let me ask you this.  You know, in the older days of software, the choice that was you always made was whether you used it inside your enterprise.  Then you can always fix it.  If you had to shrink rapid for others, it had to be of a higher quality to support.  Is that true?  Even in something like Android that that that OK, fine, we can make the zoom work.  We can work with Motorola and it'll fine.  It'll work.  But if this thing starts propagating against other devices, we could have a lot of problems.  I think even more so for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even more so.  Right. And phones, it's even more so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's the company line.  Right. Is that releasing this code would would create a bad user experience because folks would start putting on devices and it's just not ready.  They took shortcuts and there's code there.  They don't want to release to the world yet.  It's a big deal when you put code out there, especially when you're Google, you know, because everyone's going to grab it and start using it.  And you don't want bad code to kind of kind of propagate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they all Andy Rubin also said that we did it for a tablet.  We didn't want to think this is a quote from Bloomberg.  We didn't want to think about what it would take for the same software to run on phones.  It would have required a lot of additional resources and extended our schedule beyond what we thought was reasonable.  So we took a shortcut.  In other words, they said we're going to make it available for a tablet.  Right. But it's going to take a while to get it ready for phones.  I don't I agree with you, Gene.  I don't think that's so awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that's so bad.  But you know, you have someone like Cyanogen, you know, he would have grabbed Honeycomb and had made it ready for any, you know, you could try it on your phone if you want it.  If the compatibility to smaller screens wasn't there, it would have been a crappy experience.  It would have been bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, so which hurts Google more holding it back or putting it out as a crappy experience?  Uh huh. I would say I would say they should hold it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it's not real. Yeah, I kind of I kind of agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think so long a really interesting line here, especially since it never really is fully open source in the sense that you can't go to GitHub and download Honeycomb.  You couldn't go to GitHub and download Gingerbread.  You couldn't do that with any of them until Google officially dropped the code.  So this is no different. Exactly.  It's no different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only that it's not it's not clear when it's going to drop.  Normally it drops after the first devices that run it come out and there's an expectation that's coming out and the Robin community is ready.  So people are upset because they feel like this sets a bad precedent and Google is grabbing more control of the source and they're not contributing back upstream to Linux the way they should.  They're not behaving sort of like good open source community members.  You know, I think Google just needs to make Android a really good experience.  I think they need to do what they need to do in order to achieve that.  But they're walking a tough line and I think they're doing I mean, I don't think anyone's really done this before.  So they're sort of blazing a new a new path.  It doesn't it doesn't bug me, but I can see how some open source zealots are upset that this is a bad precedent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Open source zealots get upset if you call it Linux.  I mean, it's not I mean, there's all sorts of up, you know, it's not it's not a monolithic community and not everybody's upset.  Some people aren't some people aren't right.  That's true. I would say it's pretty clear that Android is not a traditional open source, fully open project.  No, nor has it ever been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And Google's a company that makes money.  We're almost developing Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there almost needs to be a different word for that between between API and open source.  There's this kind of controlled source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's it's it doesn't it doesn't really bother me.  I think Google I'll tell you one thing.  Google's put so much value into open software in so many areas in so many ways that I think you can cut them a little slack on this.  Maybe not. I don't know.  But it just doesn't feel to me like they're this is malicious.  In fact, I think they're being very, very transparent and saying, hey, this was this isn't ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I thought that the real story here was the admission that Rubin said we took shortcuts and we shipped this device before it was ready and we know it.  And we're saying that concerned me.  I was like, well, it's kind of remarkable.  It's like, well, OK, Google does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's to me if there's a I'm sure Jeff, you wrote about this, but it's kind of stunning how open they are for a publicly held.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I interviewed Eric Schmidt on the topic for the book.  And this is controversial, too.  But he argues that Google is, and I quote him, as open as it can be.  Right. I'd say that's true.  Yeah. You can't make the algorithms open.  You can't reveal certain financials beforehand.  But that, you know, that he says that if you have a problem, you write down the problem and you do that.  You know, there's there's in the Google cafeteria this week, there's a lot of crow on the menu.  This is one and not to go too far afield from this topic, but the FTC of one of the buzz, the buzz crow, the buzz.  They did a settlement with the FTC over the privacy problems with Buzz, which, of course, lasted about a weekend.  But they were, you know, as we criticize them a great deal for them, they were pretty severe.  And the admission on Google's own blog of the problems is pretty stunning.  Well, they just said we screwed up and we did this wrong.  And this is what we're going to do. We're going to take our medicine.  And I know there was a lot of negotiation behind the scenes about that, that I'm sure we're in a different kind of like it, though, that they just said, hey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they threw themselves into the soil. Yeah, I apologize again today.  An update on Buzz user trust really matters to Google.  That's why we try to be clear about what data we collect and how we use it.  That said, we don't always get everything right.  The launch of Google Buzz fell short of our usual standards for transparency and user control.  While we worked quickly to make improvements, regulators, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, unsurprisingly,  wanted more detail about what went wrong and how we could prevent it from happening again.  We'd like to apologize again for the mistakes we made with Buzz.  We are 100 percent focused on ensuring our new privacy procedures effectively protect the interests of all our users going forward.  That's Alma Witten writing. She's director of privacy product and engineering.  Good for Google. Yeah.  Now I want to sound like a Google fanboy, but that's you rarely see people fall on the sword like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true. But you know, this FTC settlement is kind of embarrassing.  I mean, this is unprecedented, right? I mean, the FTC is going to check in on Google.  The FTC is basically babysitting Google's privacy practices for the next 20 years, which is not in that blog post.  They said every two years, but it's going to be for the next 20 years.  That's kind of a big deal. Jeff, has something like this happened to any other company in terms of privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft got, remember, a pretty big slap on trust and they had a regulator sitting in on Microsoft.  I think still is sitting in on Microsoft decisions, but I can't remember anything like this with privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, if you go to the list, I think is the official FTC release.  Oh, I'll find it here. It's on there as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  FTC.gov. Let's see what the FTC says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know, the odd thing about this one to me is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like the FTC found that it was malicious, deceptive.  Deceptive, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because what happens was if you, I forget, it's funny wording because I forget what the wording was,  but if it says, if you click on, you bet this will happen and no way that will happen,  whatever the language was, a little farther down.  And you know, the odd thing about this to me, again, sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sweet. On the day Buzz was launched, Gmail users got a message announcing the new service and were given two options.  Sweet. Check out Buzz.  By the way, this is more of that delight that Dan was talking about or, nah, go to my inbox.  You know, I have to admit, the FTC is right here.  Nobody wants to be a nah kind of person. We all want to be a sweet person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what they're really saying is that if you clicked on that, you were still including Buzz in ways you didn't know.  Bzzz mistake.  Yeah.  You know, but what's not in here is, and I had this problem too, 11 privacy commissioners, including Canada and Germany,  sent a letter to Eric Schmidt about a year ago advising that Google should not put out data.  Now that shows such a complete misunderstanding of this new culture where the government people think that failure is death because people will come after them.  You would make a mistake and we may not allow a mistake.  Yeah, exactly.  And this whole idea that they're going to open up and the process of opening up is collaboration and mistakes are necessary in that process.  And as part of learning, they're bringing this government mindset, this old classical industrial mindset to the new digital age.  And there's nothing clear to me that shows that difference in the private way of doing things and the public way of doing things.  And if you're going to put out betas, the irony of Buzz, of course, was it should have been called a beta.  And that might have saved them a lot of problems.  It wasn't a huge mistake.  They didn't say it was a beta?  No.  Oh, that's ironic.  The first major product release from Google was not a beta.  That's ironic.  It was the one that most needed to be.  Right.  But what disturbs me about that is that they're saying you shouldn't try things in public in collaboration with the public, that you should make them perfect beforehand.  Of course, there is no perfect.  And I find that very disturbing in our new culture.  I agree.  You know, at the same time you have today, for example, three senators are trying to take out of all the app stores an app that will tell you where DWI checkpoints are.  Now, I understand their objection to it most certainly.  But they can put it in the newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could put it in an app.  Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so is there a First Amendment protection of apps?  Hell, yes.  Is there a protection?  So Google's problem here with Buzz is that did they F up?  You bet they did.  And they admit they did.  And if they did that with with, you know, audacity and nastiness and left it up forever and didn't care, that's one matter.  But if they said, oh, OK, we learned we fixed it.  And we all remember that weekend when they spent the whole weekend hauling ass to fix this.  The government is saying here is that even if you make a mistake for a short time, you're guilty of something.  And that's going to make everyone more cautious, except lawyers, in terms of getting jobs.  They're going to stop you from doing things, saying, well, the FTC could come after you if you screw up here.  And that's chilling on innovation.  And I'm a very for that reason, I'm now getting very upset.  I'm getting back in Jeff mode here.  I'm getting I agree with you, though.  Be upset.  Yes.  The FTC is pissing me off again because this is none of their damned beeswax.  Well, wait a minute.  OK, I will disagree.  Not none, not none.  But to the extent that they went to this, the extent that they said that a short term error is as bad as a long term error.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think demanding no betas is one thing.  But the FTC saying we'd like oversight is not that's that's that's representing our interests.  And I think Google, it's in their interest that they have that you have to see people sitting there because that reassures people about what people are scared of Google.  So I think this is in Google's interest.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But let me ask you this, Leo.  Is this the most heinous case in privacy?  Oh, hell no.  Right.  So is this the one that should have brought down this hammer?  Well, but you know, but I have this at a precedent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They had this at a precedent and they had to make a statement.  Right.  This was the buzz thing was a huge failure.  And there were real consequences.  Right.  Andrew McLaughlin's contact list was published.  I mean, that was that was a pretty serious consequence.  I have to say, I looked at what the FCC did.  I don't want chilling effect on innovation either, Jeff.  But I looked at what the FTC did and said, OK, you know, they lowered a pretty heavy hammer.  And I encourage our listeners to read both the Google blog post and then the FTC statement, because they are the tone is very different on both sides.  Google has its tail between its legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, they're really going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And as we said, for a reason, it was a screw up.  It was it was appallingly handled.  I absolutely agree with all that.  I just think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was a technical error.  It was not malicious.  It was a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, Leo, no, they're kind of saying that the Google lied to you, that if you clicked on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I guess.  And this is a question to an intent that we can't answer.  And do you think that there was an intent to gather information against our will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think I think it was not a technical error.  I think it was a human error.  But they said Google offered a turn off buzz option that did not fully remove the user from social network.  Yeah.  That is colossally stupid on Google's part.  Right.  Right.  It's it's and they've done colossally stupid things that put them in a bad position.  The grabbing of data from Wi-Fi and Street View.  Right.  You know, had that was a bug.  That was an error.  But well, even if it wasn't, you know, some say that it was a geek going too far.  It had no commercial use.  But the damage to both Google and the cause of technology and innovation was great.  Google's going to understand that it has this this higher calling.  But we also have to be cautious.  I think and I'm going to sound like a libertarian.  I'm not.  I voted for Obama and Hillary Clinton.  But government intervention at this level, I would have referred to settlement that was more fully private.  The Google came up with very open ways on its own than the FTC now having clear government control over this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't know what it is.  I don't think that I guess I don't fear the FTC having oversight of Google.  And I think it's in Google's interest.  To be honest, I think that's one of the reasons Google was quick to tuck its tail between its legs is this is something that Google this is a potential is a minefield for Google.  And so it's something that they probably really truthfully welcome because that will improve people's trust.  Google has to have our trust.  They're dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then that's not just Google.  That's the entire industry.  And I'm you know, I fear the do not track legislation is coming up, which will surely pass because do not anything is going to pass in Washington.  Yeah, but that could be very, very damaging, as I've said on the show before, to the business of media.  And so I've been critical of the ad industry that they and media industry that they've been absolutely colossally stupid because they have not been transparent.  They've been deceptive.  They've creeped people out and they should have been very different.  So the issue here isn't so much that Google should have had the hammer come down.  The issue instead should have been that the industry should have.  Well, that's true.  Have standards that if that Google and the FTC could have worked together to say we're going to the positive way to put this was we screwed up and we're going to turn around and we're going to set a new bar in privacy for the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think how bad it would have been for Google had the FTC and Google looked like they were in collusion.  They said and the FTC said, oh, no problem.  It's Google.  You can trust them and said, you know, fine.  Everything's fine.  Google wanted to be spanked, needed to be spanked.  I see what you're saying.  There's a huge risk if the FTC doesn't spank them.  Much bigger risk than having some guys sit there in the in the meeting.  Big deal.  Send them over to the cafe.  Have a nice lunch.  Enjoy.  It's a good job.  I'd like that job.  Can I be the privacy watchdog?  I'd like to do that.  We're going to take a break when we come back.  There is a lot of news, including James Gosling going to Google, which I think is a huge story.  But that's just me.  Before we go on, I would like to tell you a little bit about a great place to have a website.  It's called Squarespace dot com, the secret behind exceptional websites.  We use it right now for our inside tweet blog.  And it's been such a joy to work with.  First of all, so easy to design a Squarespace site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Put me on skinny, please.  Oh, you're gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop it.  So James Gosling is the guy who created Java is one of the most brilliant computer scientists in the world.  He was working at Oracle.  Kind of.  Well, yeah, I don't know exactly what he was doing because, you know, he the Oracle got him when they bought, you know, when they bought Sun.  It was only I think a matter of time.  I think you see a lot.  There's been a lot of people leaving and I think this is just one more person.  He was former vice president son.  He didn't want to work for Oracle.  In fact, he called Larry Ellison the Prince of Darkness.  OK, well, maybe he wasn't happy.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love the bearded curmudgeon developer, a brilliant engineer.  We should try to get him on the show.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  I would love to I would love to talk to this guy.  That would be great.  He's so brilliant.  So I don't know what he's going to do at the Google.  But what a good place for him to be.  Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, indeed.  Right.  Because Android is so Java based and that it at Google in lots of ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was actually a little disappointment of mine was how much Google likes Java because I'm not a fan.  No.  I guess for what for the for the phone environment, I guess there's probably nothing better.  But they really they Java was on his last legs and they brought it back.  I guess that's it on getting James Gosling on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was a great idea for about five.  Yeah, no, I but I I love Java.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it.  I think I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you do you like writing in Java?  I do very much.  OK, very much.  It was my first like, you know, truly kind of like object oriented, strongly typed language.  I have that.  It's like that first love thing, you know, it's like, oh, you know, feel about Java like I do about C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I love C. OK.  And Java is very C like it's got garbage collection and the C doesn't have and it's got a lot of nice features and it's object oriented, which C isn't.  But but it's very C like basically C syntax.  Well, anyway, about English English.  What a language.  What do you think about Amazon's cloud player?  And actually, there is a an Android link to this because, of course, they've got the app store now, but they also have an emulator.  Apparently, they're using EC2 to do a Android emulator.  You can you can try any app for an hour.  Did you know that?  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think I heard them mention this on All About Android, Eileen's new show, which I love and watch live this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give it a plug Mondays at 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern on Tweet.  Great show. Eileen rocked it.  Yes, Eileen and Jason Howell do a new and our new Android show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Totally rocked it.  And so I heard them talking about this emulator, but I didn't get a chance to to try it.  So this is within the cloud player.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that clever?  Clever. So now this is one of the things I've always said is great about Android to begin with is that you have the ability to download.  And if you don't want a program, delete it and then you'll get a refund.  It was originally twenty four hours now.  It's like 15 minutes or something really, really short.  But if you look, you have to go to the Android store and you'll and look and do it on your browser.  Right. If you go to the Android store and the Amazon's browser and not all apps will do this.  Let me see if I can find one that has a try it.  Do you know offhand Diner Dash just downloaded that.  That's actually a great program.  So test drive now.  Look at that.  Try this app on your computer.  You could. It's Java.  Look, look, this is look how fast that loaded.  This is the actual game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's awesome.  That is amazing.  Yeah, that's really cool.  Yay, Amazon.  This is just like playing the actual game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe it.  And it has the same problem where I don't know what to do at that point.  Oh, good.  OK, here comes the dot show the numbers.  This is a fun game.  So this is a great way to to learn how to or at least get a sense of a game.  I don't know how long you can play that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one step ahead of Apple, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, it says here 30 minutes remaining.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to figure out how to enable this for my app.  That's very cool.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So control the app by clicking and dragging features that access device features like the hardware camera may not function.  Obviously, keyboard import is not supported.  I don't think it's Java because it was so fast.  This was so fast.  Oh, Java hater.  No, nothing loaded.  I don't know what there.  This must be HTML 5 or is it flash?  It's not flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How would you know?  Just go to source.  Right click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, right click.  If you get a zoom, get nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, that cool.  It's got the volume buttons right on it.  What happens if I press the home button?  Oh, my God.  Full on emulator.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Hey, honey, come here.  Look, if you ever wanted to use Android, it's built right in.  Holy camole.  Look at that.  I'm using.  I'm using.  Wow.  I mean, I have a half an hour now to use the Android phone.  I wonder if I can make a phone call.  Huh.  Well, that's weird.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is disabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently, I'm calling somebody.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that.  So is this is must be the SDK emulator, but it didn't take any time to load.  I don't understand how it's doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the SDK emulator, a lot of this stuff, phone calls are disabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As they should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's like a rack of Android phones at the Amazon headquarters that are making calls for Leo right now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we can't get through, but we'll let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.  But cloud player is really cool.  It's like it's you.  This isn't this is kind of an old news story, but it's a new since I last knew it's a good story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get five gigabytes free to store documents and multimedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's not just it could be other.  It could be anything.  It's anything.  Yeah.  So you can see your documents too.  I just thought it was music and video.  So no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this is the beginning of cloud storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if I buy an album from once a year from Amazon, I get 20 gigs free and the albums are there for free no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so does it have like a web dev interface?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there any interface to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, there is like a it's a browser based uploader.  This is the thing I didn't like.  This is the thing that this is an API.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not Dropbox.  It's not Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dropbox nailed this right.  And no, Amazon hasn't quite gotten there yet.  I mean, the the MP3 streaming is awesome.  So you can listen to your music wherever you are.  That's really awesome.  But but right, it doesn't have the Dropbox client.  So it's not this like constant sync.  It's a browser based uploader.  I'm hoping that's going to get a little better.  But but yeah, it'll scan your entire iTunes library and upload what you want to do it.  And if you buy MP3s, like you said, from Amazon, which I always do because iTunes drives me crazy, those will get free.  This is huge for them.  I mean, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They barely beat out Google by all accounts, beat out Google and Apple to this.  Yeah.  And what excites me so much about this going too far, which is what I always do.  That's my stock and trade.  This starts to kill the networks.  You add this to Netflix, having a new show that they bought.  Yeah.  You have this ability to watch this stuff.  Everything's changing.  It's changing a lot fast.  And the whole idea that you can control our media and content and bits starts to go out the bloody window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now I'm just uploading files to this folder.  So there does need to be some sort of it'd be nice if it was WebDAV.  I bet it is WebDAV if they would just like that.  They need an app.  But if it's WebDAV, then it would just be anything could use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to get Verner Vogels, who's the CTO of Amazon on the show.  So we'll try to get him next week.  Good.  That'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and now can I share this with people too?  Is there sharing?  I think so, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.  I have to try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, I'm liking this.  I just thought I completely missed the real import of this.  I thought I was just music.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  This is Amazon.  AWS comes to the common man and woman.  Wow.  Yep.  For backup.  Because now Microsoft's offering SkyDrive 25 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, everybody's in this business.  It's funny.  Amazon's getting all the attention.  Microsoft's been doing this for months, but nobody's paid any attention to that.  Well, here's my question.  First, they don't sell any music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does this compete with Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it enhances Chrome, right?  Sure.  Because all your stuff is where you need it to be.  I mean, similar to Dropbox.  I mean, you can listen to your playlist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We kind of had this conversation on MacBreak Weekly.  I think probably Google welcomes this.  I don't think this is a competition.  This empowers Google.  They didn't want to sell.  I mean, they did talk about Google Music, but I think they didn't really want to be in the music business.  Let Amazon do that.  Right.  I don't think they really care if Amazon has an app store.  That's good for Android.  Look at that emulator.  That's fantastic for Android.  Beautiful.  Let somebody who knows retail, knows how to do all this, do that.  And Google doesn't make money particularly that way.  Yeah.  Although they do now have in-app purchases.  I wonder if they're going to take that 30%.  But I'm asking something else, though.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have an app store, you have an emulator, and you realize that you could run programs on Amazon.  I guess what I'm asking is, does Amazon at some point get the ambition to have an OS?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think so.  What do they need an OS for, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they just have a UI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they love control, right?  They love to be able to be, they're rather Apple-like.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm listening to my music.  It's a con, Trina.  Oh, this is so cool.  Wow.  Isn't it?  Now, don't please try to analyze why I played another one bites the dust.  Apple.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very interesting.  Wow.  Good for you.  I'm glad.  So are we going to see Google Drive anytime soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that the, I mean, there's been kind of rumors about a G Drive similar, you know, that offers something similar to this for a while, right?  And Google Docs is sort of touch this line a little bit.  It'll be interesting to see what that offering will be like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing is one of them better by Dropbox fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Dropbox is now suddenly worth 30 billion dollars or something.  I mean, Dropbox is nail-sinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, that's what I love about it.  It's not just that it's in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's distributed.  There is a Java based solution that's very job Dropbox based or similar to drop Dropbox that is owned by Lassie called Walla.  You know about Walla?  Oh, this could be the dark horse in in all of this secure online storage works very similarly to Dropbox.  But you can it's a peer to peer system.  You can add to the walla storage that you own for free by giving up some of your local hard drive space to walla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, like a peer to peer situation like so it's similar to Dropbox in features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Business perspective, that's so fascinating that it's like Netflix getting out of disks to go into online.  This is Lassie getting out of hard disks in your home.  I know. Isn't that funny?  They're a hard drive company.  What are they doing?  They're selling the secure online storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very smart.  And so, you know, it's kind of an interesting a little bit of a different model than Dropbox.  Randal Schwartz told me about this, but you can you can buy, of course, space, but you can also trade.  You can trade space.  You can give them space, which is really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, is there any security issue there you mentioned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I don't I don't love the idea of strangers sort of reaching into my hard drive and using space, but I there are a couple of programs and the names are escaping me.  But there are these programs where you can set up a deal with like your best friend across town and say, hey, I'll, you know, back up to your computer if you back up to my computer.  And I love that kind of federated.  I mean, I love the idea of being able to share hard drive space and people that I trust.  But, you know, whenever whenever they're a peer to peer programs running on your machine with ports open and, you know, there's always security risks.  It's a little scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even if it's Java.  Even if it's couch surfing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, man.  The people in Google Kansas are so upset.  Yeah.  Topeka changed his name to Google.  Google even kind of changed their name to Topeka and a nod back.  But it's not Topeka.  It's Kansas City that gets the gigabit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People of Topeka reportedly crestfallen.  That's got to be a gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an engaged headline.  I wonder if they actually talk to anybody in Topeka.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to see stricken photos of citizens of Topeka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Google reps say it's the beginning, not the end.  This is just the first market.  Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please.  That's a, you know, that I understand as a kind of a promoting the idea of gigabit.  But does Google want to get in that business?  That's a weird business.  Does Google?  Well, I guess in a way that might forward their interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is if they hadn't played the devil's deal with Verizon,  I'd still think they were on the side of net neutrality.  I don't believe that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube says 33 million streams in 189 countries around the world  for the grand finale of the YouTube Symphony Orchestra.  That has to be a record for the number of streams.  I can't even believe.  I remember just a few years ago when Live Aid got,  they had 170,000 streams and people said the most streams ever.  Amazing. 33 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is nuts.  That is some serious traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, the total, oh, no, wait, the total mobile live streams was 2.8 million.  Geez.  Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did they play?  I don't know.  You know, like this isn't Lady Gaga, folks.  This is Google changing the culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here, I'll, yeah, that's right.  That's true. That's a good point.  That is a good point.  It's a symphony freaking orchestra.  Yeah.  At least it was an opera.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, Shostakovich's Symphony in D minor.  This is, I don't know, I made that up.  Is that Sydney? Is that Sydney Opera House?  Where is that? That's beautiful.  Oh, I'm sorry. I pushed the wrong button.  There we go.  Now you're watching it.  So we're going to take a little break.  Come back.  I'll leave this on.  This will be our musical interlude.  It's probably a complete violation of all this holy,  but I'm going to play it anyway.  We will take a break.  Come back with your tip, number, and tool of the week.  But first, this word from our friends at MailRoute.  I've talked about this before.  It's since 2004, I've been using MailRoute to stop spam on my Leoville server.  If you run your own server, and that's the key on all this,  if you run your own server, go to MailRoute.info  and find out about simply the best anti-spam filtering.  One of the reasons I like it is that you don't actually see the spam on your server ever,  which you've got to love.  You just simply change your MX record to point to MailRoute.  Your mail goes to MailRoute.  There's the music.  It goes to MailRoute.  They filter out all the lumps so you don't have to see them.  And it comes back to you spam free.  Give it a try today.  10% off for the life of your account when you go to MailRoute.info.  Here it is.  From the sands...  to the seas.  So the YouTube Symphony Orchestra, the whole idea was like these people  played the individual instruments on YouTube,  and then they put it all together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alright, let's jump ahead.  Nice organ.  So then they bring them all together later.  You know, obviously they're now all in the same place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the cool job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Phantom of the Opera time.  It's a giant pipe organ at the Sydney Opera House.  33 million people watch this?  That's bigger than the Eurovision Sound Song Contest.  I mean, that's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's incredible.  And so, folks, this is a big medium.  They streamed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, only Google would have enough server power to do that.  Bye-bye, Kahnpassed. Bye-bye.  Yeah, I think this is exciting.  It's good for people like us.  Yeah.  Alright, we've got to get out of the way here  because we've got another show coming in here,  the Fabulous TNT with Mr. Tom Marrett.  So let's get to Gina Trapani's...  I like the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina Trapani's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking of Cloud player, if you've got an Android phone,  the Amazon MP3 app can stream your playlist directly to your phone,  which works really well if you're running out of space on your phone like I am.  Right.  I've got Wi-Fi at the gym, so I can stream my kind of workout-way playlist,  which I've got going on here.  I've got some Lady Gaga and some Glee on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did. I immediately deleted all my hard drive-based stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. You can free up space on your phone, stream,  and obviously it works much better over Wi-Fi.  And also, you can transfer items to your phone.  So there's a download button within the Cloud player app.  So if you do want to grab a file before you are somewhere where there isn't Wi-Fi,  you can do that as well.  So if you haven't checked out the Amazon MP3 app for Android,  which is still in the approval process for iOS, definitely check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got the store or the player.  Yep.  And then, oh look, wait a minute, wow.  So this is, remember I copied those files over just a minute ago?  They're now here on my phone.  Yep. Yep.  Wow. That's pretty cool because they're audio files.  And then there's the Queen stuff. So this is all playing from the Cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's much nicer than connecting your phone with a wire to transfer over files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Store all are, and the nice thing is if you buy music from the Amazon store,  it doesn't count against your 20 gigabyte total.  So you could have, this has got to be really scary for Apple.  It's really got to be scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not only that, but the music labels and the entertainment copyright holders are going...  Sony's a little worried about it because they have a similar service,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and apparently they're not too happy.  Right.  They're not too happy at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon will fight that fight though.  I'm sure that other companies are glad that they're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come and get us, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your number of the week, Jeff. I hope 33 million wasn't your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it wasn't. It wasn't.  And the campaign to ruin the show and now make it not this week in Glee, but this week in Gaga,  two weeks in a row, you got to mention Lady Gaga, nine million followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  On Twitter. Is she the top followed now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, number one. She has been for a while actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, she's got the megastardom, but also she uses the tool well.  She talks to her fans in an authentic way, you know?  Not to use that term, which is overused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that was it. Simple number.  Well, my tool of the week is, I think, pretty exciting.  Let me just pull up the screen. It's cloudgirlfriend.com.  So here's... No, I'm just kidding.  The social network girlfriend. Step one, define your perfect girlfriend.  Step two, we bring her into existence.  Step three, connect and interact with her publicly on your favorite social network.  Step four, enjoy a public long distance relationship with your perfect girl.  They say launching soon, but due to high demand, we're only able to accommodate  a limited number of users to this site. Register early to get in line.  So just in case you wanted a girlfriend. I don't know if there's a cloud boyfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So glad that this show did not land on April Fool's.  I think this might be April Fool's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You think?  I think so.  I'm signing up.  Okay, welcome back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google, Anil Dash and April Fool's.  He did a great piece a few years ago about how your joke is stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love April Fool's backlash, but you know Google does something every year, regardless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now this is my link for cloudgirlfriend.com.  Gee, I don't know why, but I have a link now to...  I'm going to tweet it.  I have a cloud girlfriend.  All right, the best way to get a girlfriend is already have one.  Oh, I'm married. I guess that counts.  I'm going to tweet it. What the hell? Let's give it away.  No, my actually my tool is insanely much more useful.  It's the new Google Guru and instant messenger Google thing of a gob.  I don't know exactly what all it does.  It's a bot.  It's a bot.  It goes back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody said it goes back to 2001.  Oh, this is when bots were hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to have a Leo bot that would get smarter.  I forgot.  Yeah, I had a Leo bot. I put it in the chat room.  It would get smarter and smarter and smarter.  And you could teach it and pretty soon the chat room.  Anyway, this one.  Let me see if I can pull this up.  Why I have too many buttons on here.  So I'm in my instant messenger.  It works with G talk.  You add a guru at Google.com to your friends and then you can ask it questions.  Like weather.  You said San Diego is nice on San Diego and it will tell you that it is mostly cloudy 21 degrees centigrade.  It'll be sunny tomorrow though.  It's a little cloudy today.  I could do other stuff with this, but I don't know what it is.  I feel like define and a word calculator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't that Google search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Google search, but in an I am window.  Basically.  OK, it's cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think maybe I should go back to cloud girlfriend.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
