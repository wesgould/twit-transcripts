Transcript:  This is Twig.  This is Twig. This Week in Google.  Episode 488 for Wednesday, December 26th 2018. The year's best.  Well, happy holidays everybody. I wish Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham could be here.  But we gave them the week off as I think is appropriate on this Boxing Day.  We want to instead of doing a new show give you some of the best moments from 2018.  Thanks to our producers and Karsten Bondi especially who put all this together, our editors.  We have some of the best moments of 2018. So I'm gonna sit back enjoy some eggnog and  as we travel back through time some of the best moments from this week in Google  2018 enjoy.  Speaking of sealing the deal Logan Paul. God dang it.  This is the YouTube the I gotta say the  the  nihilistic YouTube star who is you know  I mean he and his brother have done things like burn mattresses in the swimming pool of their Beverly Hills home  to generate YouTube views. They kind of they took the cake on this one. They  he was in the famous  suicide forest in Japan and  posted a video of a suicide  which I won't show of course. In fact, he took it down after three days and 6.7 million views.  But you know, I think the point is clear here.  As some have pointed out no AI is gonna be able to find that video and block it and  there is an intense race now to  become the next most extreme thing. You saw it last year with PewDiePie and his racist stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me try to find some good news in this which is  that our norms  survived this that that that he was roundly condemned at all quarters. He had to take it down.  Yeah, no, I apologize.  And and might have ruined his chances to make money. That's up to YouTube. I think they should ruin it and  So, you know there there are limits and that's what we're setting. It's what we're negotiating. It's what we're trying to figure out.  Now, can we automate those limits? That's that's hard at scale. The scale where we are is very hard. But but norms one  Civil civilization one civilization didn't say okay. What's the big deal? It's a video burn. No civilization said F you  Mr. Paul, right and made it take it down. But that's a good think you'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Have long-term harm or maybe it would in fact help build his brand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's that's say with PewDiePie  That's up to a great measure the platform is whether they choose to have their brands associated with the likes of this if I were  A brand I would say no, you know one strike you're out. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  PewDiePie is still on YouTube  All they did was they took him off of their VIP advertising program which did cost him millions of dollars in ad revenue you  He only made 15 million last year. Yeah, I  Just feel like there's such a there's such pressure it's like link bait  And when it was mainstream media, I think there were you know, societal restraints that kept them from going too crazy  I mean we they went crazy enough with reality TV and stuff, but I feel like on YouTube  First of all happened so fast that and it's like a issue. Yeah, it happens so fast that it's I mean three days  He gets six point seven million views. Those views cannot to be taken back  I don't know how many kids saw I don't know how many kids were damaged by it or upset by it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another question there is is how long did it take people to report this?  That's what that's to me the most disturbing part

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  How long it take YouTube to react apparently they it was reported some say it was reported and YouTube did not react and that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You know if it's if it's ramping up that fast it would probably be in the top, you know  Fraction of a percent of videos on YouTube and so therefore should be on to review Q quickly, right?  You know YouTube yeah, YouTube has a lot of videos and you can't review them all we know that  But it should be to review the ones that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Ramping up the trending trending. Well, you both have teenage teenage sons as our young sons as I do  Henry's 23 still just no

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They're not teenagers more but 21 and 22. Yeah, and same Jake is about that age

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm 25 so I'm on the boat with these kids and I'm watching the videos they like and they have a very  And they've developed a very extreme taste for videos on YouTube. That's  This has pushed them to a more extreme taste and the stuff they watch is  And they were telling me about the people they like they watch a guy who eats hot peppers hottest pepper  Possible when you watch him in agony as he's eating this pepper. They love that they laugh they howl  There's some other guy who is just completely an anarchist  He has a beautiful set starts his show before he gets his first guest on he destroys the set  and  Then does the show and then and there's this appetite for more and more extreme stuff and the and the kids eat it up  They love it. That's what they want. And that of course when they try to watch something like this, it's like well did nothing happens  You didn't blow anything up. What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you had David Letterman back in the day threw things off the roof. Yeah, you know, and I have immense respect for him  But yeah, he was he was in essence doing a baby version of the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah  I'm just saying that mainstream media because they were run and I'm not praising mainstream media by any means  But because they were run by big corporations like General Electric that a reputation to maintain  There was always a little bit of a lid on this I  Mean obviously Google and YouTube's are big corporations who have a reputation to maintain but I don't I don't know  I mean if you I feel like there's such incentive to get more and more extreme. I don't see it going the other way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see it coming. No, it's the issue of scale too  It's it's that is that case on YouTube of the ridiculous made up videos  Yeah, that figured out how to manipulate the system, right? Yeah  well, the stuff like

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Like  synthesized  Kids cartoon videos, right?  That stuff is is creepy. There's there's a sort of and this is in Charlie's talk as well. There's  People are now starting to throw weird  You know weird AI machinery at these things to try and make make stuff up. That's that's more convincing  But also they're attacking this attacking multiple levels  This weird thing of there what they're actually trying to do is game other computers  So it's sort of adversarial AI fighting AI there. They're trying to game the ranking other in in YouTube  They're trying to game the censorship algorithm YouTube as well trying to produce something that looks enough like  The things that should be let through  But before the ranking algorithms and therefore generate ad revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I feel like sort of it's very very strange Nick Bostrom was kind of sort of right  But it's instead of paper clips is the four Channing of the world the entire world is just gonna turn into 4chan

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This one I'm gonna go back to my good news thing  There was also a study out this week that said that you know all the talk about fake news in my world  You know, I've got money to deal with it said, you know, the impact is actually very small  Oh, I hope that's true. I hope that's true and other study another study. These were both on the rundown said that  Let's see if I got this one straight. This one said that when I'm not picking on Trump in this case or Trump voters in this  Case, but when Trump voters Trump fans were exposed to stories about the Russian  connections  Their opinion of Trump and trust in him decreased which is to say that news has an impact on people  You put the two together and and there is an opportunity for a flight to quality here  There is an opportunity for us to negotiate our norms for an improved society  You know, you're gonna hear my spiel for the hundredth time it's early days  1479 Gutenberg years we're figuring this out. We're smart as a civilization. We will figure it out  Society's not in the dumper quite yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So this was an IOT CES, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is that was the big theme of the show. I've I'm pushing anything. It's all IOT all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Like a Michael Mike multi cooker with the assistant built in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, let's not focus on the assistant the big focus everyone's like voices everywhere  Yeah, what's really awesome about it is?  The fact that voices everywhere means we finally stopped talking about standards  We're never gonna get there on standards, but we found a way around it

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I mean like Zigbee Z-Wave and all that all of that. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We in even things like device schemas which super nerdy but like saying things like I'm a light bulb  I can do the following things like my hope was there would be like a universal protocol that does all that  We never got there  But now because the Amazon echo and Google assistant and all or try it they're building that for us  So it's not ideal. I would rather have it be more open, but it's where we are. Hey cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Did you tell tell us about some of the?  Devices or things you saw that you thought were interesting  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you guys are gonna be so mad at me, but I haven't had much of a chance to walk the show floor  So I've got a couple things that you've been doing meetings the whole time  I've been doing a lot of meetings. I Kevin is the guy walking the floor. Okay. I do have some cool stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I would never I would never call Kevin a floorwalker, but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He excels at that he walks through and he's just like talking to people or a floor runner  Exactly. Well, that's true. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Matthew Kevin tofu

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's awesome, okay, so the coolest thing yeah  Okay, I'm trying to decide okay one for normal people  I love the fact that both Kohler and Delta are doing faucets with not just Amazon echo enabled  But are doing it to add additional values so you can tell your faucet  Dispense a cup of water and it will do it exactly a cup  Exactly a cup or you can even train it like my spaghetti pot  I can train it like fill the spaghetti pot and that means fill this much water  That's cool. And then later on I could do it. So I love that. I also saw some cool  This is super geeky, but Bosch was showing off a MEMS projector  That  Basically is this tiny 30 by 70 millimeter module and what it can do is it can project a display?  It for 480 to 720p  It can even run video and you can actually interact with that display on any surface including your skin  so your couch your skin your  I don't know kitchen table like an Amazon echo like device could project it an  image of the people walking up to your door or

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know, you don't need a screen it almost could just appear

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, that's exactly it. I like that. It's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Is that available this year or is it a concept or no, it's it's an actual working. It's a MEMS product

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's a semiconductor product. So people will have to build that into their devices  So you won't see that for another I don't know 18 months to two years. Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Wow, that's cool low low power

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's  Relatively low power. What's unique?  The most unique thing about it is its form factor is now small enough and it can project on any surface without  Messing messing things up. Oh, look, you found it. Look at you finding these things. That's Karsten. Good. He's the best  It can show video actually I don't think this is actually that's the accelerometer  But  That's okay, I did learn about the accelerometer I can tell you why that's cool if you really want to know they use MEMS

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They use MEMS for that as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, MEMS are I always explain MEMS to people like MEMS are the hidden heroes of the Internet of Things  yeah, because MEMS are these tiny things that take the analog real-world signals of every day and they  convert it  To digital for the computer street. So you've got the real world meets the computer in this one tiny little device

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Neat they these this projector uses lasers to it. It's just cool lasers lasers  Lasers so we were talking about this Bosch bathroom  Because they've got a toilet they've got a shower. They've got a tub. They've got a faucet  I do like the idea of every kind of that's you came up with it and I mentioned  Well, the idea is you tell it you know  You what temperature you like the shower to be and have you know  Have it warmed up and ready for you and that kind of stuff  But now you know that this the central hall is at a complete blackout for about an hour and a half  It's just now coming back. I  Kevin told me that he's like he's like I had to move what would happen to your fancy  Bathroom if you couldn't use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right guys, here's here's what happens it reverts back to state  Okay, it has a faucet  Yeah, I have a faucet that's a capacitive touch faucet. Okay, and when the power goes out then I use the hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  you just have to live like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like like a savage

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We actually can't use anything now we can't because we have a generator but we have  Well water. Yeah, so if you lose power we lose the water too. I know yeah, that's bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So it's like when an escalator breaks it just becomes stairs

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What else what else come on you're our your eyes and ears in Vegas  You put okay, how long have you been there when did you get there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Monday, okay. Okay, go to go to our Instagram and I'm not doing that to advertise but I'm doing it to  What's your offer like it's Stacy on I its Instagram whatever slash Stacy and IOT because then you'll see  Everything that Kevin and I have seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Basically, okay. So you saw these little Sony smart speakers with Google Assistant  Nice. Those are not exciting not exciting. Here's the Samsung smart thing refrigerator

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so that's a really big deal in like  Samsung three years ago Samsung was like  IOT is gonna happen. It's gonna be open. It's gonna be awesome and  We it was very kumbaya and Kevin and I made total fun of it along with the rest of the industry this year  They actually are making that happen and they're doing it at a higher level. So  Three years ago, they talked all about like Tizen and stuff like that. Normal people were probably like  Now  They're basically they've integrated all of their like 60 some odd apps into the smart things cloud  They built all of their back-end cloud stuff is now smart things. This is the new interface

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is the TV showing this yeah  Oh, that's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So your TV is gonna be able to control all these crazy devices and it's gonna have the same interface across all  Samsung products so it's a big freakin deal and it doesn't have to be just Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I see we have an Arlo camera on here. We have an air purifier

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Light they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So many devices are already integrated. Oh, there's Kevin Kevin and believe it or not. This looks like a selfie  But no, he's looking in the mirror. This is a smart mirror. Oh  See what?  It's the music so you're in the bathroom you're looking at the mirror  It can be connected to a scale and a skin sensor so you can see that's from higher. That's kind of cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm getting I'm getting a smart mirror ship to me  I think next week so I'll bring it on the show either next week or the week after I love this

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I would get a smart build one  How do you do it? You is it like something behind the mirror that shines through I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Guess it is. Oh the screen on the mirror. Yes, I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Stayed in a hotel once it had a mirror, but when you turn on the TV  It was shit. It shined through the mirror. She's like one-way mirror or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  There was a Google engineer who built one with the raspberry. Oh, I remember that yeah, we talked about yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, right higher. I'm sorry Huawei. You can't use these because they're from China  Has a bunch of sensors cameras motion detectors, I'm just going through  Yeah  TDK sensors

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's tons of sensors. Everybody has a smart home section  Yeah, I mean I don't know what else to say about that Lenovo  I'm sure we'll get there eventually but Lenovo has a very nice Google Assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's the echo show for the Google we talked about that and I'm excited. They won't be out till the summer. So it's beautiful  Oh, you heard it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got a 10 watt speaker in it. It's yet the the big ones 249 the small ones 199. I think that's a very competitive

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Price that's basically an echo show which is a 7-inch screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that it looks good I  think  In Google, I do believe Google will probably win this race if you start thinking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They're starting to pull ahead you here you are at the Wemo booth. And of course Wemo announced  HomeKit compatibility across the board which is a big deal because Apple HomeKit has been very slow off the block  But I notice a big hey Google site in the back there. So obviously they also work with Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm  Kind of down on HomeKit. There's a lot of HomeKit compatible stuff as usual Apple is not here  But I just found out that earlier this summer. I'm trying to get rid of that blue line there  earlier this summer  Lenar had partnered with Apple for HomeKit enabled buildings like smart smart new builds for homes and they actually  Switched over to smart things now. So I was like, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's no good you saw the jibo there now I have to say I my jibo failed and  As long as I have a dead jibo, which is really really but I wasn't too unhappy because I'm sure there's a way to turn  This off, but I couldn't find it the jibo snored  I'm not kidding  It was totally a cute  The first time it didn't sound like it would just like make little  Sounds every once in a while, which was disconcerting you that's to comfort you. It didn't comfort me  It was creepy. So I was kind of glad when it died  I have to I have to contact the jibo folks and I don't know if I want a replacement or I might want my money  Back on it. How much was the jibo 500 bucks?  That was a special Indiegogo price, I think it's more than that now  There are robots here are there. Did you see the current curry that we was our advertisers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they there? I didn't see the curry. I saw I want to say it was the Aurelius maybe a  You curry was supposed to be out by now and I'm worried that they aren't out. It's hard to build a good robot. It's hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Stacey, did you see the Chloe video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  LG that didn't work LG was trying to show their yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I saw that I saw that after the fact the guidance couldn't get it to respond at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So I was very interested. I don't know if you saw this  Johnson controls has a  Beautiful thermostat. That's a glass  $319 Cortana thermostat. Yeah GLAS I loved it. Did you see it? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have seen it it's pretty go look for it because it's there gorgeous. Yeah. No. No, it is gorgeous  I I'm hoping that technology comes down in price because  that really that changed the game in the way nest quite didn't quite and making a  Thermostat look like a luxury object. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Here's the solace my home solace 250 Google assistant or echo enabled and this controls  Every these are everywhere everything. This is a very common category

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah panels of stuff with little tiles on them that control all your devices and have a bajillion radios. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yes, the Fibaro. I like the name smart plug  Monitors and yeah with the USB

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Charger and that I like that because I was gonna have to rip out all of my outlets and put USB chargers

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Those and like a smart plug-in from Fibaro the blink doorbell  Mm-hmm battery powered front door. So it competes with our sponsor ring looks similar

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does yeah, and you know Amazon bought ring or sorry Amazon. Sorry Amazon bought blink  Oh, this is Amazon's company now now this is like  Christmas like the 23rd or something. It's when I came you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And they don't charge a monthly fee for this storage video storage  So that's a big problem. I think with a lot of these devices is that you they all add up. Yes, the storage fees  You get pretty soon. You're straight hundreds of bucks. Here's the net at most smart home bot

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like lighthouse  Without a video it's talk to it like a human being and then it does it could you switch the lights on? Oh, that's nice. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm just going through. Oh the spire. I had a spire

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did too and I was kind of like on this but supposed to be sexy  The new one is an activity tracker  So activity respiration heart rate  Oh, I feel like something else and the coolest thing about this is you buy them in a pack of like eight or ten  This is a good in your underwear. Yeah, and they're washable. That's a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Because that's the problem with all of these things they're easy to lose if you wash them that breaks them the one on the right  Is the original spire so they've replaced it basically with a with a wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is an additional because the original spire didn't have all those features right right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Did you say stick it in your underwear? Yes, she did that is where you're supposed to stick it. Did that excite you Matthew?  Not exactly  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Know when you get to your age the underwear sticks you  This is the Kevin  Which is named after your co-host  Indeed, what is the Kevin do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, I don't know it makes heaven when you leave home it automatically

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Makes sound and eliminates randomly. Oh, it makes it makes it makes people think you're home

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Okay, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have an app that does that on my wink. Yeah, who's home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we left Kevin to take care of the house. That's what it simulates arguments

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plays the one from last night

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  As you point out as we've talked about Google is everywhere Google Assistant is what is this a gumball machine that you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey Google to what is this? So this is in the sands. It's a gumball machine  You tell it like hey Google do this and it does it and it's just it's eye candy  and then over at the Las Vegas Convention Center, they have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Slide in a big not a booth. Yes, but they had to close it because the rain  So it's a water slide there are the people in the Google outfits that we were mocking with the little wears Waldo hats and the  White jumpsuit they're everywhere. Good lord. Oh, it's kind of I guess you

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's creepy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's cute that in I  What would be creepy is if they had like random facts memorized and when you said hey Google tell me this

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  If they're human Google assistance, that'd be funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be awesome. Actually Google totally could have done that  They could have been an assistant using their voice kit thing and then when you talk to it, oh you put it in their answer

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but I'm thinking could you actually get gumballs though? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't know if you could I did not stop to try to get a giant bowling ball size gumball

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Here's that Lenovo Google assistant speaker. We were talking about what this is cool  This this view is good because it shows you how it stands up. It's got a curved back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's bamboo and it's so pretty that's kind of cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know people hated how the echo show looked

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's a million of those. Oh, the other thing on this is it has a camera cover  I think that's really oh, yeah, and I found it interesting coming from Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is not yeah. Yeah, I generally make fun of camera covers, you know, because Mary but in that case, I absolutely agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, you know that Echo spot that I showed before I left the alarm clock with this camera on it  When I when I got home it was face down  And so I moved it out of the bedroom because it probably shouldn't have a camera in the bedroom. It's in my closet though  There's not much to see in there. It's usually dark  Here's another Google assistant speaker from JBL 8-inch link view nice screen high-res audio and video  Video calling as well. Does it use them? Does it use duo when they do these use these?  It does. Okay, so you call any phone that oh now duo makes a little bit more sense  Because it's the phone well  I who is gonna use it right but now it makes sense because you if if people have a duo speaker  You you could they could call you on the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Wasn't there a report that Facebook was gonna make a video screen calling device. Yes. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Here's those here's that oh, this is a Delta faucet that you have capacitive touch on your faucet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is I do and this one has Wi-Fi and talks to the echo and dispenses and does all the magic stuff  All right, you've obviously I'm trying I tried to convince the guys at the booth to retrofit my faucet with the Wi-Fi module

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  and  finally a very cute picture of the two of you ah  The TOEFL and the Higginbotham the IOT podcast team in action the Higgin TOEFL the Higgin TOEFL  The viral hit of the of the week is this Google Arts and Letters app that everybody's going  All the kids are going crazy about that takes a picture of you. It's been out for months  We've known about this for months, but all of a sudden it was discovered  Thank you Instagram for making it a hit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't they add a new feature? It wasn't the matching was a new feature for this app. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  so what you do and you've not done it, but I'll just give you an example and maybe a  Cautionary word of warning. This is what I did. I did this. I can't remember which  I  was doing  So that I'm just warning you the results are not always flattering. So what happens is it takes a picture of you and  In the app you it's a little hard to find what I'll help you do in a second  And then it goes through its vast arts and culture collection of artworks and comes up with what it using face matching technology  What do you think Jeff is that that's a pretty good likeness you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Net neutrality, so I'll give you what I you know, maybe it's the good news state of Montana  Has voted  That if you want to do business in Montana as an internet service provider, you have to have net you have to be net neutral

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's a good thing right what's what could possibly that's that's definitely good news if all the states do this if

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  California did it it would be a big thing  Montana's I mean it's populous, but it's not like  I'm just saying that  Montana like a rural area most of them don't want to serve rural areas anyway because it's highly expensive  You know if they can get out of that they would so imagine if  You're like you have to be net neutral. They're like, oh, okay. Never mind. Bye. Bye, you know, it's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It was an executive order the governor Stephen Bullock just declared Monday that any internet service provider with a state government contract. Ah  Cannot block or charge more for faster delivery of websites to any customer in the state  I mean, however, of course remember the FCC said we don't want the states to make their own rules  Right, so there could be legal challenges

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  But I admire them for doing that. I mean, it's I think it's still worthwhile that they that they're even trying to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's better than lots of places and then this one Randall Randall Stevenson of the CEO of AT&T  Said AT&T is committed. They bought big full-page ads in a bunch of newspapers  Saying they want net neutrality AT&T is committed to an open internet. We don't block websites. We don't sensor online content  We don't throttle discriminator grade network performance based on content. They want zero rating

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and they also want Facebook and Google their arch nemesis is nemesis  To be nemesis  To be subject to regulations as well, right? They are trying to write this is there. Okay, I go for that  Damn it. It's a wrong. It's it's a different they need to be regulated in a different way  I'm not gonna argue that we should not do some form of regulation over like maybe data monopolies  I actually had a guest on my podcast talking about  What an anti competitive regime for the 21st century looks like and it was a really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  When you read that it's AT&T you have to scratch your head and go. Okay, what are they up to because they have never been really

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, they want theirs. They want their definition of net neutrality. So their definition includes allows them to do things like zero rating

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Which I think should not be allowed they they want the Congress to pass and which by the way  I think the congressional solution is the right solution if you can get if you can get congressional agreement and we're one vote away in  The Senate but that doesn't mean it's given close to passing in that house  Congressional action rights AT&T is needed to establish an internet bill of rights that applies to all internet companies  by which they mean us and  the information services and guarantees neutrality transparency  openness  Non-discrimination and privacy protection for all internet users, you know, I don't tell me why that's a bad thing. Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so my my issue is  Regulating ISPs net neutrality is a solution for  Provide a lack of competition. It's it's a lack of competition at an infrastructure level  Now it is the right solution  So common carriage type of rules are the right solution when you're dealing with physical infrastructure in a non-competitive market  now where it gets interesting and is  When AT&T is like let's let's do the same rules will follow the same rules that Google and Facebook do  I don't think that's right because they're in a very different competitive environment  Their competitive environment isn't necessarily based on physical infrastructure  Although their data centers are a huge element of that, right?  But they're in their competitive advantage is based on data. So then they should be regulated based on  that competitive advantage so you what you really need is two separate laws and  You can talk about yes, you have other Google is still you know, I use duck duck go  You know, I don't have to use Google you can use Bing blah blah blah  but you know  there is a data monopoly developing among the big companies and we do need to look at that and figure out a solution for  making sure that having all of this information doesn't create a  Barrier to other companies being able to come in and innovate and that's that's fine. I think that makes sense  I just don't  Cause it  Putting the same rules around them in AT&T don't make sense at all because AT&T is providing

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Physical infrastructure physical access exactly. How about this Burger King? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, we forgot to talk about that. Yes. I am really jumping all over today. I apologize  Burger King deviously explains net neutrality by making people wait longer for whoppers  That is pretty awesome. Is this real? Yeah, they really did this to people and recorded it and apparently some people whopper neutrality  Net neutrality was just  And it's very confusing  Some people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For what it's worth just no one ever stops me on the streets and asked to find these terms

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because if they did and they recorded it they wouldn't use it they wouldn't use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They wouldn't use it right it's the same thing with you know, they do that on the late shows, right?  They ask people who's the president States?  Eugene Debs and then actually that's exactly what you start once they throw  King Kong and  Knows and everybody laughs at how stupid people are but that's because they as as 20 people to get the really done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So they also as you said lack pain they don't have pain  They're very low metabolic and respiratory rates  You too could live like a naked mole rat. I'm not sure if I'd want to live longer  Their legs are thin and short  They can move backward as fast as they can move forward their large protruding teeth are used to dig and their lips are sealed  Just behind the teeth so that their mouth doesn't get full of dirt

You do not know our culture our ethics or the unwritten codes  That already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your external  impositions  You claim  There are problems among us that you need to solve  You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts  Many of these problems don't exist  Where there are real conflicts where there are wrongs  We will identify them and address them by our means  We are forming our own social contract  This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world  Not yours  Our world is different  Cyberspace consists of transactions relationships and thought  itself  Arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications  Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere  But it is not  Where bodies live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh the daily yesterday it was actually a an observer guardian that they gave to the new york times. Is that the way you're talking about?  Uh, well it was in their podcast. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It was the daily  But it may have but yes observer had the had the story of course  Yeah, broke the story and it was a whistleblower christopher wiley from cambridge analytical who went to the observer  but I thought a very good synopsis of this which I will kind of attempt to rehash because  the  I think before we even talk about facebook's culpability in all this  It'd be good to understand what exactly a lot of the coverage is the way wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and it doesn't make a lot of sense for facebook to parse  Breach versus not breach, but it does make sense for us to get the facts, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So, uh this began christopher wiley, uh, we'll start with him. He was the whistleblower  He was a high school dropout from bc from canada  Who became fascinated with data big data when he was volunteering at the obama campaign  in 2012  And was very intrigued by what data would tell them  About reaching out to voters, you know how to advertise to them. Uh, who to who to advertise to and all of that stuff  he  Had was following an interesting study  And i'm trying to remember if that was from cambridge or somewhere else, I think not  where uh  Some researchers found out that if we get 50 of your likes 50  So who's 50 of your likes we can tell whether what race you are  We could tell what kind of education you have we can tell a lot about you give us  500 of your likes we'll know more about you than your spouse does  Uh, and they were able to do that by correlating kind of it was a kind of imperfect system  correlating, uh  You can likes were scrapable. I think they still are scrapable from facebook  You don't have to have permission to see what people like it's in there. It's right there on their on their profile  So they would they basically get as much of that like data as they could and see if they could find correlations  And this is very different from you or me. I mean one of the things they found out for instance if if you like hello kitty  Uh, what what did they I don't even remember but it said something about you was uh that you were uh, you were you were  Nice person, but not a rule follower something like that  So you could deduce all of these things and they did this again by taking great lumps of data and making correlations and then  Projecting out wiley was fascinated by this thought. This was very interesting started doing some of this  Himself for the obama campaign and then went to work for a british company  run, uh  in a group in the british company ran run by this uh, it was an andrew nicks the  Ceo now ousted of cambridge analytica  They realized that they could do a lot more if they could get more access to the facebook  Data  And this is where the story became very interesting  Nicks, uh ran into uh somebody from the I think was the the martin the cruze campaign the ted cruze campaign  and uh  Decided that it would be great to get into the american market  and um and  Decided that if they could do a little bit better targeting that they might be able to do this kind of targeting  They were already doing in the uk in the american market got the attention of billionaire robert mercer who funded it  Steve bannon who became the chairman  And created cambridge analytica and cambridge analytica did this is the the thing that they did that really has gotten them in trouble  with facebook  Uh is they've found a researcher at cambridge who created a psychological quiz  And they put out on facebook an offer if you take this quiz. It was a real quiz. It was not a game of thrones  You know, which vegetable are you kind of a quiz?  It was a real psychological profile standard kind of profile if you take this quiz  You'll have to download an app and take it offline off facebook  Uh, we'll give you some money. We'll pay you and they got a significant number of people to do that through facebook  So they had their facebook login and they had the quiz they were able to use the data they gained from that quiz  to  It was about a quarter. It's I think 275 000 people 270 000. Yeah to to  Create this what you really need in this a machine learning database in effect making correlations between  What the facebook profile told you about this person what their psychological profile was?  Is  And they also got something which facebook shut down a few years ago  Which is this friends of friends stuff, which I always thought was reprehensible if you take a quiz or give somebody access to your facebook  Account they not only get your information your likes but they get all your friends information all your friends likes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically well leo just to clarify here. That's that's your public information. They don't get anything behind. No, no, no  Private not credit card numbers. It's stuff you're posting they get access to their accounts though. They don't have to be  You don't have to have your own relationship at that time you didn't have to have your own business relationship or or  Really? That was how people thought facebook worked

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I mean, I think everybody thought facebook worked is people can see my page if I allow them to  You know if they friend me and I friend them back then then we are sharing data  But as it turns out if they friend you and you friend them back then anybody who friends them can see your data  Which was at the time that was something facebook stopped a couple of years and by the way, just just real quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I worked with lots of media companies that said goody goody and did that like crazy obama's campaign had a  Game that had a million users and did the same thing  And so it was very common at the time  But it was all part of that kerfuffle that we talked about the show at the time about people not understanding the circles of privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We have been talking about this for years. Yes, and trying to raise people's awareness of this for years  so cambridge analytical  Got all of this data for it turns out once they got the 275  270 000 people to take the quiz they got their friends of friends and that ended up being a 50 million person database

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A very which should have been handed over to criminal jelica. Well, I think but it's not clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It isn't that they shouldn't have access to it. They got legitimate access to it saying it was a research  Oh, and they should never have kept it for too long said no the rules said you couldn't pass that on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To say a commercial entity right and it was passed on and they were told to research or who had ties to russia

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  By the way, uh, yes was actually passing along to a commercial entity illegally  Facebook against against facebook against their rules not illegally but against their rules and then cambridge analytical used it  Apparently quite effectively to target advertising and and and you know wiley was so so they say  Which is there's been a lot of question about as to what and we've got we've seen now the the videos  of its ceo  Admitting to all sorts of chicanery, but again, they were boasting about stuff. They probably didn't do in the past  So we there's no way of knowing if they actually do hire prostitutes to subordinate candidates and things like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's also there's debate among researchers. I was at a annenberg event at penn some weeks ago  Where most of the researchers in the room said that they did not believe for a second that cambridge analytical had any near  Near the skills that they say they have again, that's irrelevant to this discussion insofar as  Things that shouldn't have happened happened, but how much impact it then had is

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Something that could be up for debate a lot of people say hey obama did the same thing  The only reason this is a hot button is because trump used it to win and not not a democrat  Uh fair enough. That's a fair criticism  Facebook said we we it was we understand it's a breach of trust and we expected this is mark zuckerberg's  comment earlier  Um, he said we have a responsibility to protect your data if we can't we don't deserve to serve you  I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again  He's going to be on cnn at 6 pm pacific 9 pm eastern tonight  Uh on the anderson cooper three stay on until then no, we'll be off by then so, uh, uh  Cambridge analytical which was supposed was first of all was not supposed to have that data and then told facebook  They had deleted that data apparently did not delete the data  And until uh, whyly stepped forward we didn't really understand exactly what had happened  But the whistleblower who was you know, one of the principals  Explained the whole process  so  A number of people including brian actin who was one of the founders of whatsapp and was paid 16 billion dollars along with yan kum his co-founder  For the app by facebook said it's time hashtag delete facebook a lot of people that hashtags gotten very  popular  um  I deleted facebook not so much because i've i mean i've everybody knows all that information. I just don't like  It really brought home to me, you know something i've been thinking for a long time, which is  uh  I don't trust them  Now we should mention and i'm sure jeff will mention that uh, you actually work with facebook, uh, uh  And the foundation, uh that they do just to get the full clear disclosure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I raised 14 million dollars from facebook craig newmark the ford foundation app nexus and others to start the news integrity initiative  Um, we run it independently of facebook and I am not paid by never have been paid by any of the platforms  and disclosure, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Uh, the parent company of cambridge analytic has also has been banned as has cambridge analytica  For all of this so there there's there was clearly a violation of facebook's terms  Uh, and and I think mark zuckerberg's taking, uh, some culpabilities taking some responsibility for this saying yeah  We we didn't do a great job. Although  There's also the sense that facebook is as much a victim as the um as the end users that cambridge analytica  lied

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You disagree that's like that's like saying equifax is as much a victim as the end users  I mean, this is a company that's dedicated to collecting data

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  About people well facebook's paying the price they lost 50 billion dollars in stock market value

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Over the last are they really paying the price? I mean, I don't know it depends. I mean, this is a really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Nexus it's kind of a turning point. It could be the end of facebook in some ways, right? What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I i'm not a huge facebook user. I've i've never been but um  I wouldn't be I  We need to have something like facebook  Do we do we yeah, I I do think we do I think we should have  connects people

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean I can have a phone and an email and mail I could connect to it connects people superficial it it makes superficial

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  connections  feel  More accessible so it helps you scale your connections. I would say so that may be the fault

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That may be it's one of its flaws though, by the way, because they're not genuine connections

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I don't know they I think they can be genuine connections. I mean if you use it  Well, you can create communities. You just have to you have to curate them in a way that a lot of people aren't very disciplined at  I mean  Think about think about how sophisticated people are into different types of people. I don't have a lot of close friends  For example, I'm not a huge facebook user because not because of that, but I think those things are correlated and there are lots of people  who  seek others approval and those people tend to  Be on facebook and establish I would say to them meaningful relationships and i'm not going to denigrate that  And I think it's something a lot of people need and want

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  oracle, I remember was suing google over java in the android devices  And they have managed they lost in court  google has now  I mean oracle has now revived it  And google may owe them eight point eight billion dollars  The federal court, uh, us court of appeals for the federal circuit. That's the that's the patent court out of dc, right?  That's the one that really is uh kind of out of sync. I think with the rest of them ruled on tuesday  That google's use of java shortcuts. This was not by the way  That they stole java, right?  This is the api  So shortcuts isn't quite right. It's what's the point of an api? Yeah, but the right but this stupid court

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They're one ignorant judge away from a really disastrous rule. That's a good way of putting it

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We're all one ignorant judge away from disasters

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well api's are the bedrock of the modern like tech economy  so  Having to put yeah, this is really distressing

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The dispute according to bloomberg technology which could have far-reaching implications for the entire software industry  Has divided silicon valley for years between those who develop the code  that makes software  Steps function. I don't know. I think that that's a typo and those who develop software programs  Develop the code that makes software steps fun. I think this is this is a mangled oracle's trying to milk it because I mean as

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  As steve was saying on on security now this week  The number one scenario for developers is their companies forced them to use java, but they'd really love to use python

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is that was from stack overflow. There was a they they actually they actually had that as one of the one of the  Things that they deduced from stack overflow usage. I think that that's true, but this isn't even  Exactly this is they use java  This is that they they use the java api

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But it makes you kind of not trust oracle as much as a developer

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I mean you get you this bloomberg story by the way is so messed up  I'm sorry. I even pulled it up by using the api's programmers don't have to write new code from scratch  No  This guy whoever wrote this doesn't understand an ap what an api is. That's a library. Sorry, susan  I'm gonna have to explain to susan decker what an api is. I'll explain to you all what an api is  What's an api leo stands for application programming interface and it's what allows you  To for instance, i'll give you a good example twit has an api  We decided when we redesigned our website that we would do it in two parts that we would use drupal  Which is a very good content management system, but we'd use something called headless drupal  You never see the drupal drupal sits in the background  And we use it for all of our workflow when we create a new show and so forth and you can  get  Keys to our api and then interact with the database through the api. It's something we want you to do  Because then you can write an application our application was our website the website  Talks to the database through our twit api  And generates a beautiful website. There's also an app my twit there's several apps now  But my twit's one of them that actually pulls from the api and we prefer that because that means when you have an app  That's a twit app  Even though we didn't develop it. You will always have the latest information because you query our database  That's a good thing. You publish the api. It's published. We publish it on apiary  Which is a site for apis so that people can use it and the only reason we make you get a key is so that  Everybody doesn't scrape all our data and kill our bandwidth, but it's  An api is supposed to be open. That's how we communicate so copywriting an api meaning you can't duplicate an api  Is going to have a horrific chilling effect on site as if walmart

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Sued amazon because jeff bezos walked through the front door of a walmart. That's essentially what this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so I I think you guys are being maybe a bit naive or maybe a bit  tech focused here and i'm not i'm not just I totally agree with  all of this, however, I  As I said before apis are becoming the bedrock of  Kind of the economy especially with iot because we're having so many devices and services talk to so many other services  So what's happening is instead of just a tech?  Kind of layer to this we're getting a political and business goals layer to this and so  Oracle's case isn't a technical case. It's a business case and they're saying hey  We don't want you to use our apis to build a competing platform  There are a lot of people who keep their apis private just for that reason  and and so  I would say that we do need some sort of legal framework around apis  But we also need to understand that they are no longer just a bridge between services and I I think  Your definition is wonderful leo, but I just explain it to normal people like hey  It's a bridge that lets my software talk to your software and speak kind of the same language

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But my question is why can't oracle use technical means to prevent google from accessing the api?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, it's not that they were actually it's that they duplicated the api, right?  so in if if if google wants to  Use java oracle says that's fine  But you need to license it because you're making a commercial product and you made 42 billion according to them 42 billion dollars  off of android  So google says oh, well, then we won't use oracle java. We'll write our own code  But in order for it to work with java programs, it has to support the java api  so  This is kind of like what microsoft does with the linux  for windows system or  Wine does wine does this to microsoft to allow so they duplicate the api so that a program  That's sitting on an android machine doesn't know that it's not talking to java. It could be talking to dalvik, which is  Some other, you know java compatible  Uh, and I guess there you could make the case if your oracle well, they should use java and they should license java  But this is there's a long-standing tradition  of companies duplicating api's  The api by itself contains no knowledge  It's not the program. It's like how to connect. It's how you talk to me. It's as if you could be like the copyright

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this will be like the carter phone decision for the api era  think about it that way because they're trying to govern how someone talks to their software and they're saying we have and they have  a business case for wanting this to be and technologists  historically and rightly so or like hey we want this to be as open and  Be as generous so we can all have things work together and talk to each other and we don't have to make our lives miserable

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This isn't this has been going on for six years. Remember judge alsop who taught himself java  He ruled in 2012 that api's are not copyrightable and I think that's the correct uh ruling  because to do so would basically  Tie up  I mean I kind of I do understand oracle's point of view, but but but but we need to have open api's  We just really do and to say you can copyright it  Is not you can block somebody from using java  But you can't block how you interact with a java like program

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think that's inappropriate. It just seems like oracle's the wrong kind of company to be in control of all that

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, that's another issue  But that's but this is a lot of this has to do with personalities, right?  Google's got a lot of money. They made the the circuit court even said google made 42 billion dollars on android  They should give some of it to oracle

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No  Larry ellison already owns in hawaiian island. He doesn't need

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, larry's just fine  If you want I went i'm going to pitch my stuff  I wrote a story on this actually two weeks ago not on the lawsuit  But on the role of api's and how they're expanding from pure tech to  A business tool so if you're excited about api's well, and maybe that's maybe that's it so

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is a weird case by the way because it it it changed  Over time because of various rulings and oracle trying to find ways to keep it alive. So after al sop  Turned it down in 2012  It went back federal district federal circuit in 2014  Reversed al sop al sup found the java api's are copyrightable, but gave google an out saying this is eff  a little more accurate giving  The possibility that google could have a fair use defense, right?  You have a fair use of a copyrighted thing now  That's frankly what all of the subsequent court decisions have been on not whether you could copyright an api that actually was considered settled  What isn't settled is is there a fair use defense against reusing the api?  Google asked the supreme court to review it. The supreme court said no  Uh, the case went to district court for the fair use defense and in 2016 a jury  Unanimously agreed that google's use of java was fair use of the api's was fair use  oracle appealed again and they appealed this time with that washington dc federal circuit court  Which has historically been problematic for tech companies. They've really upheld strong  Intellectual property rights and this is what just happened is they said no no you have no fair use defense because you made 42 billion dollars  On the api and you know on that very narrow  Interpretation I think that that's probably the case  How can you say it's fair use if you used it commercially and you made 42 billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, they didn't make that much money  On the api they I mean how much money did they make on the api itself that would have to be calculated

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  On the other hand would android have been successful as successful if you couldn't use java to develop for it  And use the java you could actually have your own api. That wouldn't have been a hard thing to do google in  Hindsight probably should have done that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, i'm sure they wish they did now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  8.8 billion dollars  Is a significant portion of their other island. That's another island  Here let me play this is the thing that I don't know if this is creepy, but this is very impressive. So this is now  uh another technology that google announced that is going to allow the  Assistant to actually place calls on your behalf. Watch this. This this one is wild

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And is to help you get things done  It turns out a big part of getting things done is making a phone call  You may want to get an oil change schedule  Maybe call a plumber in the middle of the week or even schedule a haircut appointment  You know, we are working hard to help users through those moments  We want to connect users to businesses  in a good way  Businesses actually rely a lot on this but even in the u.s  60 of small businesses don't have an online booking system set up  We think ai can help with this problem  So let's go back to this example, let's say you want to ask google  To make you a haircut appointment on tuesday between 10 and noon  What happens?  Is the google assistant makes the call seamlessly in the background for you  So what you're going to hear  Is the google assistant actually calling a real salon to schedule the appointment for you?  Let's listen now. This this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Wild you'll hear by the way, this sounds like a real assistant  They intentionally have her sticking in umms and and pauses  But the thing that's most impressive to me is not that but how she responds to a real human  And this is like the self-driving car problem  And and sometimes humans steer you wrong  Or say I mean and it seemed to do and of course these are canned demos, but it seemed to do a very good job of  Handling real world situations. Listen to this  This is the assistant  That's a real salon  That's the assistant, um, i'm looking for something on may 3rd, that's the that's that's a computer  This is a human she's up talking too she is she's up talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We have to that is a 115 now, how is the assistant going to deal with that one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have anything between 10 a.m? And uh 12 p.m  Depending on what service she would like what service is she looking for?  Just a woman's haircut for now  Okay, we have a 10 o'clock  10 a.m. Is fine. Okay. What's her first name?  The first name is lisa  Okay, perfect. So I will see lisa at 10 o'clock on may 3rd

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Okay, great. Thanks. Great. Have a great day. Bye. One of the things that scares me about that is that it's clear they're trying to make it  fool  The receptionist

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Around the robocall now. Yeah, I mean I can imagine this technology in the wrong hands is terrifying  Well, it is also I get those all the time. Don't you I mean I get those whether they're trying to fake that they're human  Yeah, and you ask them are you a robot and they have some can't answer and and they're not sorry. Go ahead stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was very excited from a business perspective  Google's talking about using this for calling restaurants to see if they're open for holiday hours, for example  In that if you can imagine the automation of data collection at that kind of scale  That is  Mind-boggling how quickly google could gain an edge

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, and this is really an example to me  I'm kind of lately on a kick saying stop calling it ai  That's a marketing term machine learning I can live with but ai is a marketing term except that this is  This is ai now. This is yeah, this is actually here. Listen to this one. This is a much more challenging

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Call I couldn't have done this phone call

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's a small restaurant which is not easily available to book online  The call actually goes a bit differently than expected. So take a listen  Hi, um, I'd like to reserve a table for wednesday the seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  For seven people okay, so the the human

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  misunderstood

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The assistant he was saying at 7 p.m. She thought he said for seven people  Maybe she's a robot  That would be she did a worse job of understanding him  Than she does he does have understanding or it  Does of understanding her she's actually pretty difficult to understand listen to how this continues  So she's already throwing him throwing it. I gotta say it. It's really tempting to say him. Isn't it it a curve?  Um, it's for four people  four people when  Um wednesday at six p.m  Oh, actually we reserved for like opera like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know  I don't know  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Actually, we reserved for like opera like five people now if you uh are not watching the video and didn't see the caption  What the what the human just said is?  We only allow reservations for more than five people  For so for four people you can come for four people you can come  How long is the wait usually to uh be seated now? That's actually the right response to that which is  I don't need a reservation. Well, how long will I have to wait? That's a very sophisticated I think response  For next wednesday, uh the seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, it's not too busy  You can come for people, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, I got you. Thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is touring test level touring test level this is yeah, this is very impressive  You know google duplex since then has become available for some users of a google assistant  I think I get calls from google google duplex from time to time. They certainly seem like  kind of odd  People with the ums and the yes  We also talked about something that is a story that is still going on and it's going to become bigger and bigger  The chinese social credit system towards the end of the year  Beijing announced it too was going to adapt this social credit system  It's just a matter of time before it's used all over china. That's terrifying watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just put on the on the bottom of the rundown a peep george nema  Who's an old friend of mine who's in in europe went to china and learned about the social credit system. Oh fascinating  Oh, that is good. I can really really scary  What happens in china, of course is is you find is is that the populace finds things that don't get caught  So white supremacists in america now we're talking about pit bulls and killing pit bulls is a secret language for anti white  in the view

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, no, they just say it because the pit bulls are proxies for white people  Words can so he writes here george writes here words cannot describe the way I feel right now. I am shaking  physically  But the chinese government is implementing a system which will assign a social credit rating to every citizen based on government data  Regarding their economic and social status. It works as a mass surveillance tool. It uses big data analysis technology  In addition, it's also meant to rate businesses  Operating in the chinese market if you've seen black mirrors nosedive  This is it. I mean we have seen that's exactly what it sounds like  Um the rating algorithm known only to the government  Uh  President she's plan is based on the stated government principle once untrustworthy  always restricted  that's  Chivalry minorities. We don't let felons vote right minorities and minority opinions will be negatively rated as a result of this program political dissidents journalists  and jaywalkers petty thieves and others  Um the consequences of negative ratings and we knew we've heard some of this include restricted movement career potential access to services  People who this one get this one who associate with people with negative rankings will also be negatively ranked  So there's an incentive to isolate and marginalize minority opinions  There is no appeal process once you're rated. That's it. There's no system to challenge positive or negative ratings  And uh, he ccs you jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yes, this is I mean kevin and I talk about this stuff all the time because we're intrigued by it. What's  What's crazy is the amount of technology that we have deployed that china is using in this process  so  think the surveillance cameras think  Actually, they're they're putting uh  wearables on workers to track their emotions during  Work so they can understand what makes a person productive

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We do have something very similar here in the united states. It's called a fico score

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is not like a fico score. Good luck appealing your fico score  Yes, but that only affects your credit rating which does i'm not saying that's not insignificant  but this affects this can affect like if your kid gets into the right school and  Again not being able to travel your fico score

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's redlining. You know, I mean we never got rid of redlining in this in this country  And there's all sorts of subtle economic redlining I agree we are not anywhere near what china's doing but that is  Absolutely the end game the potential for this kind of stuff and that's why it really is important

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We pay attention like governments more frightening than companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so that's a good question is the I mean we assume that the government's more frightening because they they have these broad  Unrestricted powers but the way our current government's going if you look at like what happened with oh gosh  Is it experience or equifax? I can't remember which one not getting I called them experience for a while, but it's equifax  So not getting in any trouble if you look at how companies are  Are corrupting our government is kind of boiling down to the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, I think that's why I mentioned fico scores because that is not governmental  That is private industry  and while it is nowhere near as nasty as  The social credit system in china it has some of the same attributes  And and I don't I mean it doesn't have to just be government  If it was if it's going to happen in the u.s. It's probably going to happen through

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Private corporations, I would bet well and there are insurance firms who look at like your

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Facebook friends to see if there are employers who look at your facebook friends before they hire you  It's credit risk, too. Yeah  It's all in there  So it's just it's just this is a cautionary tale. This is something we should be very much  This is the end game on stuff like this. You got this is you know  Here's something I might get addicted to larry page's flying car  Made its public debut today kitty hawk  Unwrapped its updated vehicle on wednesday and allowed a cnn reporter to pilot the vehicle  with less than an hour's worth of training the update says it's so easy  That you can learn how to fly this flying car  without  Hardly any training at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to give you the predecessor here very important. Hold on one second  This is this is this is something that may be too old even for you and me. Look at it. Look at it. It's so cute

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's got to be noisy. Can you hear the are you is are you getting my audio car?  They feel like maybe they're not gonna  Maybe they're not going to give us the  Look at that that's gotta be cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is cool though, so then what happens to the wheels so when it lands ten propellers  How does it it's got so it lands vertically?  And then there's a drive. I want to see it drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a car. Is it just landing the water?  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was like a car. It's I think it's it's a drone. No, no, see well, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Kitty hawk. We're excited kitty hawk mysterious flying car startup funded by google co-founder larry page  Unwrapped a huge update on wednesday. It's promising to get people in the air in under an hour  Uh, it's now open for test flights for people in place to place pre-orders  What does it mean in the air in under an hour without training you mean that's how much training you need  Right now they're testing exclusively over water at a facility in las vegas  After just an hour's training the cnn reporter rachel crane was able to fly the machine at a speed of  Now this must be wrong six miles an hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, that can't be right of 10 feet above the water. I can't be right  Or sebastian thruun strikes again  Oh the creator of the google self-driving car. He says it's as easy to use as playing minecraft

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's powered by oh, it's powered by a lithium ion battery which can be used for 20 minutes

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oops, I didn't think at six miles an hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we all need to find some calm. I'm gonna hang up on you now  Uh, oh my gosh you guys  Hey, how do you guys feel about notches? I think I know how google feels about notches

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So why my notches I think you just kind of go blind to them but three notches where are they putting all these notches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was my question. I i'm not sure that we'll see a three knot. Well, we definitely won't on android, uh, because apparently  Uh, only two notches are allowed in android p they've mandated a requirement of only two notches  Only the bottom and top and only one per side so you couldn't so in other words  You couldn't have your two notches both on top  Not sure why you would want to do that, but google has gone to the lengths to make sure that you don't  Because who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know someone might design a phone it's all notches

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking like a almost like a border a border

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Why because we can this is for the notch lover first of all we should say that google has not announced this but there was a rumor  That google was going to work on a censored version of google search. This comes from the intercept  Ryan gallagher  For china leaked documents reveal google's planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in china  That will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights  democracy religion peaceful protest all the things that chinese  government doesn't like  According to the intercept the project code named dragonfly has been underway since the spring of last year  Was accelerated in december when sundar pachai met with a top chinese government official  And there are huge protests at google from google employees who say no  We got out of china  Because we didn't like for a good reason they their human rights record

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we talked about this last week. Oh, it's over. Okay. Never mind. No, no, no  I was gonna say the stories kept going. Yeah. Yeah, the story kept going  So last week it had just broken and you know, jeff and I were talking about you  Jeff as one can imagine was this is evil google should draw a line and stick to it evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I said I was disappointed

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And I think that I said before when it when it comes to apple for instance, uh,  working with the chinese government  Uh that american companies need to stand up and say we're not going to do we're not going to work in authoritative  Authoritarian regimes even if we could make a lot of money there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could argue that they work with  Authoritarian regimes right now in the u.s. But this is not an authoritarian regime

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Come on, you may not like it, but we do this is not comparable to china yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are some practices that are actually, um, but I guess I was gonna say all right, I guess I was waiting for  It's okay here  Right, yeah  Anyway, I was waiting for google employees to weigh in and they have  Predictably, they are unhappy. So I I will see i'm curious what happens  from that perspective if google  Individual googlers end up preventing this or what goes on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is that old argument companies make that well, we have to obey the laws  Of the countries we work in the thing that's different about google if you choose to be in them  Google decided not to do business in china  Because of its human rights record and now they're apparently considering going back. It's of course tempting because there's a lot of money  To be made in china. There's a it's a billion chinese people who are active avid internet users in many cases  I'll make a prediction go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if they do everything in china once which is a lot more now than it would have been when they left  Which is a story up on the rundown that the the the the the the rules have gotten worse and worse  Even if they did everything that google that china wanted they'll fail there because you have to be a chinese company to succeed

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, baidu has said oh, we'll beat them easy. Come on and google baidu is the google of china  google of china  um, so  China already blocks facebook twitter instagram and snapchat. So google would have to block all that. This is from the observer  Anything that's anti-communism  Uh  Party content any political dissidents, of course, that's obvious controversial news content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pornography controversial being defined as things that are critical of government. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  um revelations of business or political scandals  anything harmful to social stability  Pornography gambling and violence  Winnie the pooh is banned in china and that goes back to the fact that  That dissidents compared president shi to a bear  uh  During his visit  To the u.s in 2013 a meme comparing a photo of him in barack obama to an image of pooh and tigger  Went viral in china. She didn't like it winning. The pooh has been banned ever since  Google do you really want to be in a country where an autocratic leader?  Can ban an image because he doesn't like it because he finds it

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Insulting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just the world now  Can I tell you my favorite story of the week what's that the smart replies story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay. So kick that one off because I think I may have missed this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, I put it in the last minute  So smart replies, you know looks at all these responses and and and makes up a response that you should give an email  And i've talked about how I feel guilty using it like the human didn't really send you this reply which says yes  I'll be there. Yeah, no problem, right? All these smart replies are there. Well ai goes off our behavior  So guess what smart reply tried to get people to say often which could by the way, I think improve the whole world  I love you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh  That was nice. You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm down with that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but you can imagine I mean you gotta you gotta email with your boss and you accidentally hit I love you  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's still that signal though, you know, I i'm down with that plant plant that's the google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If maybe google should force us all to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Plant that seed all this hate going around in this world plant that little seed of that  I totally dig that as annoying as it may be to some

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't even give us the opportunity  Just start sneaking that in at the very end of every one of our emails to each other  And suddenly think of the impact that would have if suddenly email ended with I love you  There would be change man

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know with with regards to the smart replies, I do like the fact that  There's one little detail within them and that's the exclamation point  Speaking with a colleague of mine over the years  regarding  corporate communication to people  And I had to train them up  I said, you know, you could say the same thing and put a period on the end versus an exclamation point  And it just makes a world of difference to an end user  You know if you just say thank you period they just thank you any other it jerk  But if you say thank you at an exclamation point, they feel like hey he has personality even though it  You're no different. So I was thinking about that. Yep  Something about that exclamation point really makes a difference and i'm starting to see that more and more  In the smart replies that come up in my messages

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and is that a ref but that's a reflection of how you communicate right smart. I don't know  You don't add a lot of explanation  Exclamation points I have always used tons of exclamation points almost to the point to where I feel like I overuse them  And so i've had to like peel back in the other direction  But i've definitely noticed my smart replies use them and I just kind of assumed it was because I do  No, it's definitely not me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, a friend of mine said that she was dating a guy yaley  Which goes to this and he and he had a rule that said you should use three exclamation points in life  And he'd already used one

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I like you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said I said i'm glad you didn't marry him. Um, so i'm old enough gentlemen. I am old enough  Not only did I use a typewriter not only did I use a manual typewriter?  I was thinking about this the other day. I completely forgot this in in in my day  When I took typing class in sixth grade the way to get an exclamation point was you had to hit a um  Apostrophe then backspace period

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you better really mean to use the exclamation point would yeah you had to do diy exclamation points  Interesting wow  Yeah, huh? How old is that?  We'd be a lot less assertive if it took that much work  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, but see my personality i've always tried to be  you know  black and white binary if you will because I I personally think that that  keeps confusion down when i'm trying to communicate a plan to someone or you know or  Whatever that we have going on because I hate it when I was working in the world of support  Saying something to a user and they just totally go the the opposite direction of what I was expecting or  or or they  Felt like I was going to do a different action at a different time  And so I I trained myself to just be as as robotic as possible  It may sound rude to people but that's how I got  Got stuff done, you know, just just black and white periods commas  perfect capitalization  Every now and then throw an exclamation point if I felt like somebody needed a warm and fuzzy, but most of the time no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man, i'm i'm so i'm so the opposite of that and I realize just ask my family  Yeah, like I so often i'll write an email and then I have to go and in part of my checking the email  Is to make sure I have put in too many exclamation points  Like every every sentence ends with it. I'm like, why am I so excited about every single thing i'm saying right now  To replace them with periods and I have to specifically go in there and do that  I'm I'm just I realize i'm admitting too much right now  I'm being a little too open to you all it's because it's because I love you

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, despite all the leaks all year long  In fact, I think the pixel 3  Phone was the most leaked phone of all time, but there wasn't anything we didn't know about it when it came out  We were still pretty excited about it. Here's our first look at google's latest phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got a pixel 3 xl  There it is. Let's see the notch. You can't even see the notch. Well, yeah, that's because  Oh, that's because it's an iphone. Hang on

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That has a notch too, by the way, there is the notch that's not that big

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's obnoxious

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's awful. It's it's double the height  It brings the status bar almost like double the the height and that's what people are going off about and I I get it  Um, it's not ideal, but you know, I don't think it's terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  799 for a 64 gig version 100 bucks more for a double the memory 128 gig storage  Version for the xl and 100 bucks less in each category for the smaller 799  Seven was it 799? Oh, that's what it was 794 the pixel 3 899 for the excel 999 for the top  I end up spending 999. Of course you get double. I'm yeah, I am not gonna buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, i've been a pixel or a google hardware person forever  That's too much money and I would get the the smaller version because you know tiny hands and pockets and all that nonsense

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But and there's no notch in the smaller version, right kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Correct. It's it's just a small chin and forehead

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So chin and forehead  That's what we that's what we call it forehead like the old pixel 2xl

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  A top and bottom bezel there's a chin what the kids used to say and a and a forehead. No, it's a chin  A forehead. Oh, that's new which which everybody wonders because the new xl has a chin  but no forehead  Instead it's like my first girlfriend lobotomy. So, uh  Um  I'm sorry, kathy that was not a good thing to say you had a little bit of a forehead but uh,  She didn't have a notch  I can i'm pretty sure so, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why i'm doing it for you now? Yeah. Thank you. I was did you see me just open my mouth in horror there?  No, it's a joke  Yeah, so i'm gonna come in a year to kevin and be like yo kevin  Give me a cheap phone or yes give me a good recommendation for because with with android  What is what is google call be now everyone gets android at the same time kind of effort android one  Android one I was going to say android first. Um, that trouble makes that possible trouble trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So yeah, I still would get a google phone. I I don't trust anybody else with why did you order what what what?  I have a note nine in the other room and I I don't trust samson with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what so you said before it was over you ordered it what impressed you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  um  Well, I think the camera and i'm sure kevin will have something to say about that but it's  and so far i've heard from an  And seen from a number of people who were at the event and handled it  That it's everything that last year's was not that the screen this time is very good  That the feel in the hand is very good. I like it that it has wireless charging because  Every other phone I use has wireless charging. That's a real convenience for me  I bought the stand just to try it because it sounded like it had special features. It somehow recognized  Actually, that's another question which is yet unanswered  does it automatically turn on the the screen saver the the daydream, you know photo album and the  And the larger clock if it's not on its pixel stand. Are we going to see an unboxing now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Uh, we could do that. I haven't opened it yet only because I have a wireless charger already  Yeah, um and those special features either are not enabled yet on the review model because there are a few software bits not here yet  Um, or it's smart enough to know hey, this isn't a pixel stand  I'm not going to do the special stuff  But you're right that that went on that stand it kind of turns the phone into a limited mini  Google home hub in a sense because it can show you your photos, right?  It has your routine buttons for you know, the google assistant  And it'll even show your nest camera doorbell or doorbell camera rather if somebody rings the doorbell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's kind of so kevin would you buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know jeff i'm in a different position  at this point because i'm kind of like trying to budget things for the first time in my life and  I I literally just bought two months ago, uh 325 dollar nokia 7 plus  Which  Lasts for two days. It's it's speedy enough for me. The camera is decent enough  So given that i'd probably say no if I had the money to burn  Yeah, I probably would just because the camera features alone had blown me away in the past just 24 hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Does highlight google's problem though if people have enough money, they'll probably buy an iphone  Because people buy android phones tend to be budget consumers and I don't know about that  I think so. I think that's the real problem and if they're not budget consumers, they're probably buying samsung  We know that google only sold 10 million pixel twos  in a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go ahead kevin  Well, i think you're partly right and partly wrong and I say that because the difference is there really isn't  Many cheap iphone options unless you want something that's two or three years old, right?  So if you're going to have ios, you've got to pay, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  If you've got a lot of money you're gonna get you're gonna get an iphone sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sure, well, you know samsung does sell a lot of galaxies  It does it's not their biggest moneymaker in terms of overall volume times, you know  profit  um, so that's why they have the low and mid-range phones that's problem number two for google is if you've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  A small I think there's a smaller number of android people are willing to spend money if you've got but those people are buying samsung's  So problem number two at least at the very best google's dividing the high end of the android market with samsung at the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's their business goal?  Is it is it to be a highly profitable item or is it still to set the bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Sure looked like at the watching the event. It looked like that they think they're a player they want to be a player  And it's not a reference product

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would agree with that. They they must have some  And this probably comes into their cfo who's been there what two at least two years now  They probably have some hard targets on that hardware division now because things have changed ever since ruth porat came on  They want to make serious money out of that hardware division. So so I have my my year old pixel two

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, by the way before I forget do you see what you call it?  Do you still get the always on notification screen thing?  Like this. Yes. Ah, yeah  Yeah, I love that. I do love that. I do love that a lot. Um, so this is a year old phone. It's perfectly good  It's wonderful. Um  Um kevin your advice to me not that i'm rich i'm not but is it worth  Is the camera alone worth upgrading?  Put it that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  From what do you have? What do you have now jeff the pixel two?  You know, I don't have one of those anymore. I have a first gen pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Here's part of the question mark and maybe kevin can help us with this  Google wasn't completely clear about which of the camera features are migrating to the pixel two and which are  Right, both of them are using that same chip the image engine  uh  And it sounded like they now and the announcement that some of these features if not  All of these features are going to be available at least on the pixel two if not other android phones. Yeah, i'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the night thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I suspect the night site is not going to be pushed down and that is just an opinion  I don't have hard information on that. I also believe and i've been trying to research this afternoon  I'm kind of coming up short  If they upgraded that visual core chip in this model  I know they put the titan security chip in here, but obviously has nothing to do with photos  I seem to believe they have updated the visual core chip in which case some things may not come all the way down the line

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is a life hacker article  On how to get some of the features or what features and this is the problem is google wasn't clear in the announcement  But what features will migrate down?  Um, no, I don't want that. Thank you  According to google nights here you go according to google night site will be rolling out to previously released  pixel smartphones in the coming weeks  Okay, duplex. Oh duplex is  Is getting a full release on the pixel 3 devices and will be coming to other pixel phones in november remind us what duplex is  That's that assistant that talks to you  uh, and  adds us and so this is this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they announced was that your imitation of a computer? Uh, no, no, that was just ah  Oh, that was an odd

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The call screening which I think everybody in the room  Kevin enjoyed a lot the idea that the call screening driven by google assistant on phone call screening  Will also be on  Uh all pixel phones. I think they stole that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They stole it from them from themselves with google voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Ah, yes google voice does that but but google voice it's not quite the same because with google voice  You have to have a preset  In the google voice settings where you say hey if they're not on my like as for instance if they're not on my contact list  Screen or if they're an unknown caller screen this one as a call comes in you can press a button that says screen that one  Yeah in real time google voice does not do that. That is awesome  Cool, um, so because i'm getting calls all the time from like apple  And I'd love just press instead of just hang up on them screen it or something  um  playground and improved ar  Uh will launch first in the pixel 3 but roll out to other pixel phones. So all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I might be sticking with I can't wait. We're not there yet  I know and I don't want to get ahead but i'm what i'm most looking forward to is kevin's view of the pixel book  Okay, we'll get there really get there I know we're out there yet, that's that's my if i'm going to spend a thousand bucks  or more

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Uh, where's it gonna go? Let's uh continue on with the phone  Because kevin you said something that I think intrigues everybody listening  You were very excited about the camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, um, so i've been playing with the camera again. It does not have the night sight yet  Um, it did just get the playground feature this morning. So I was having iron man runner on my house  Um a virtual ar type kind of thing  um  the front facing selfie mode, uh  Portrait mode rather in selfie I thought is amazing  Absolutely amazing. I I don't know if we can share a picture that I took but I took one in  Uh, it's on the rundown. I  Try to share it through google photos. Hopefully it is  Shareable or viewable I should say  All right. Where did you you put it in the?  It's uh line 20

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh line 20. Oh self-portrait here it is. I've got it. Yep  Can you see it? I'm not sure so one of the things marquez brownlee, uh did is took a picture of himself in his car  And he said sure isn't softened like the iphone  10s. Yeah, look at that. Whoa  Look at the detail. Wow stubble we can see we can count his stubble now  We're blowing this up a lot, but actually that looks and look at the the bokeh. Yeah  That's cool, uh, this looks good this looks really good  Yeah, i'm very impressed with that the way the iphone's doing it is actually kind of weird it's softening a lot of it  It's over over processing it and a lot of people complained about that  That's really the competition. Of course is a new iphone 10s  The the iphone is now doing what google did last time with a pixel 2 which is taking multiple images  Did you say they don't yet have the best shot feature is that not there or  yes, so they

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have you have to turn the motion on there's a setting in the phone to do that and you can turn the motion on  But it's not yet showing you which is the recommended photos nor is it letting you choose a photo  However, I that picture I just took or just showed was actually at the google  because I went there after lunch to hang with some of my old teammates and  I did see that feature and got to use it. They're dogfooding it right now  So it's probably going to show up like any day on the pixel 3 xl  Um, it it was very very cool in the demo and then I got to use it and it worked really really well  Like we were being goofballs like blinking and sticking our tongues out  You know and it was able still to capture a decent photo. So this was actually my favorite moment in the event

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's worth probably showing it again. This is google explaining why they did top shot. Let me do you hear the audio?  You don't hear the audio

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a great video

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So the lot of pictures  Of just the wrong moment  Guys jump off the cliff, but you don't get it lots of people with terrible faces  She's blown out the candles, but they only get it afterwards. The tie is in the face of the bride  Guys walking through the picture  Everybody has taken these pictures  Where you just miss the shot

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I love this

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So what google lets you do is if so this interesting you have to have live picture turned on is go back  It will make a recommended  Based on they said ai recommended top shot, but you could also choose from other ones and it doesn't store every one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Filling your I guess it's free storage. Anyway, so what does it matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm gonna have to defer to kevin because he's the only one who owns one of mine will come a week from  Tomorrow yours too, probably right? I have an order one. Yes it will. Yeah, just order it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're the devil  He's waiting for that to hear about the pixel book. Yes, let's wait. Let's help check out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Suspense we're you know, we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I did not order the slate. So that's so this will be an interesting  So you said the top shot is not enabled I wonder though, you know on on the iphone  If live photos turned on it actually degrades the quality  A little bit the other images are not as good quality as the one you took  I'm sure google's not doing it that way. They have enough horsepower in this thing in the especially with the image  Especially dedicated image chip that they could have full quality  images  I hope but that's a problem with live photo

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's a combination of uh, and something that google I think is better at than than apple  it's a combination of like a burst mode, you know, uh camera type implementation as well as a um,  processing software side and and ai  to to kind of  Choose the best image for you. So does it take the image so it must

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Start capturing the minute you go to the camera or the minute you raise the phone  Certainly it starts capturing before you press the button because that's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know exactly when it starts to capture it might be always capturing and then just saving the you know  A few seconds before and after I have no idea. I await the privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  police

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is well, it doesn't take it if your camera is not open presumably I think so  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Even the privacy place can't be you wait you just wait every day  Um, did you try did you put childish gambino and you're uh in in with norm? Because that would have been cute  I didn't do that yet  Not yet. Not yet  There's the that's the augmented reality. So again, we saw that this is not actually new we just saw it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they show did they offer a compelling use case yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For augmented reality serious i'm like are we still just  I I actually see it in industrial iot and some other things  But no, I haven't seen anything for it to be on my actual phone. So I was just curious  Someone might come up with something y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, it it looks like how long will you be in seattle before you stop saying y'all how was it wear off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, no, they love it in seattle. Oh, is that it? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, they just think that's so cute  It is cute. Here's an interesting point from the google, uh, keyword blog  Product blog it does notice where you're taking a picture and then suggest an appropriate overlay  Because this is very this is like snapchat light kind of  Yeah, so he's he's doing some gardening and it's suggested  That uh, she put a little green thumb

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so what that said it doesn't know it knows the place  And it kind of knows the activity

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I expect more of this from google because this is the kind of thing google photos is already doing  It's contextual. It you know, it kind of understands what it's what it's seeing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's almost like bringing google lens and google assistant together into your compositions, right? Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But again, you can't judge this stuff by demos by blog posts. You gotta get the phone  I'm gonna wait till you get it. Yeah. Well, uh, I won't have it next week, but i'll have it the week after

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I won't be getting it at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So stacy, which one are you carrying now? I have the pixel two two. Okay. So yes, and it's it's fine  I i'm i'm i might agree. I might be there too. I might stick with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So i'm good with it until I drop it or do something horrible and then  Poof  That's me. Okay. What'd you say kevin? I should get the nokia something something

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The new nokia 7 it's kind of technically called the 7.1, but it's basically what I just bought  Uh upgraded uh, slightly smaller and better screen and unlike mine, which is an international version  Uh, it has the us band support. So  That would work here and it's 350 dollars, but I think your issue is going to be verizon

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh or I don't I don't know if I have verizon pixel will be available pixel three will be available on verizon. I want you to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're gonna get they actually they gave us a verizon sim card with us to test

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Stacey follow the light  I have received am I oh go ahead. Do you stacey anything else you want to say about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was gonna segue us off of old journalism to go new exciting things the newest latest gizmo has arrived

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Okay, just to give you a sense for those of you watching at home if you're listening i'll describe this  This is the google home hub the thing google announced at google.io finally came today  This is a pixel 3 phone also announced at the same time  These are almost exactly the same size  So it was hard to tell in the announcement how big this home hub was it ain't big  It's uh, it's actually a little bit functional a little bit smaller than the pixel seven seven inch  Tab or the nexus seven seven inch tablet that google used to sell they sold that for 127 dollars. This is 149 dollars  No camera. That's a light sensor. It's an ambient light sensor effect. If I cover it up, you'll see at night  The pictures get darker and darker  So it won't keep you up at night  I have to say the excellent camera  This is a nice photo frame  It integrates really well with google photos what I did for this is I picked people you can choose  Uh people that you want to have in your pictures. So I chose my family  And every one of these pictures has somebody sometimes in a tiny tiny  picture  Uh of my family and it's really fun because it goes back  20 years ever since I started taking digital photos  Uh, so it's a really fun photo frame now. I've sent it for every 10 seconds  You can make it every minute every five minutes every hour. You don't have to change it that frequently, but just for  purposes of uh display  And it has also got google assistant and let me turn the microphone on the mic's back on and uh, say, I don't know. Um  Listen to this week in google  Oh, I have to say something first  Pardon me. Hey  Play this week in google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if it'll work. Sure. Here's the latest episode of this week in google mp3 twig 478  When a doorbell rings a roadie gets its wings

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's time for twig this week in google kevin tofel and stacey higgins stop  So the sound is I think pretty good. It's coming out of these uh fabric covered  Speakers on the back, which is pretty good. I'm sad to say I thought oh it'll have a type c connector  It doesn't it has one of those barrel  Plugs proprietary barrel plugs so  And it has and I can't show you because it's plugged in the poorest design for a plug i've ever seen  It's so round and people have already started complaining. It doesn't work very well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a power strip to just be prepared for that. Yeah google did that with the home. Is it the minis? I think  Yeah, it did that. Yeah, I was really disappointed in that please come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So, you know what we're doing with this the default display is a photo  You see it's still showing the twig. It's the default display  Let me turn it down a little bit because it's a little bright for us to see  That you swipe up to get controls from the bottom use the google home app to um  To control it. Oh now I can't see anything  Uh, it's I love the photo uh slideshow and I think that the screen is very good for that  Uh, it's more than more than adequate for the for the slideshow. It also has a  As you can see a clock display it has a variety of digital and analog clocks you can use  But I think everybody's going to use this as a photo frame. No photo. No calling. No video calling you can do audio calling

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can do duo on it though kevin and I discovered that but no but no video video. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Uh, I like this and I think at 149 dollars. This makes a lot of sense  Putting this in the kitchen in the bedroom. No camera, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the bathroom, I don't think it looks good in the kitchen. I'd say bedroom maybe bathroom kitchen  I feel like I would want the larger maybe that jbl you've got there or maybe the lenovo smart display that i've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You have the lenovo this is this just came out. It's a little small

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a little small. I would like the the 10 inch lenovo, which i've got with me is great for watching youtube  You can watch youtube on it. You can't watch netflix yet on the larger ones. Although you are supposed to eventually. Yeah  How much is the lenovo?  The bigger lenovo is 250 the smaller lenovo is 200 the smaller is eight inches the big one is 10 inches

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You like this? I can slide down from the top and see my  Home automation stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, and you can control the lights. I'm very excited. Isn't that nice? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So these are the lights media broadcast  I could view the rooms  Uh, this one's in the shed  Uh  I thought that was funny. Anyway, um, I I think this is actually a very nice device, especially at that price  And I would say i'm gonna I would say i'm gonna get a couple more. I really uh, i'm really pretty happy with it  I really love the photo frame  I just it's for me because this makes more sense if you've stored a lot of photos in google photos  If the face you've been using the face recognition  Um, it really is fun because it goes back in time. Here's a picture from hawaii from like four or five years ago  So and it's just completely random. So I like that it doesn't sound bad. We played some music. It's not it's not horrible  Uh, yeah, it's better than one would expect for something this size  But of course, yeah, i'm sure that jbl will sound better and the lenovo sounds pretty good, too  I would say the lenovo is not hugely better than this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  uh  I think the lenovo sounds better. Of course, i'm not in the same room. So here's henry at the prom

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I definitely like it. I would like it definitely bigger. I've been trying to actually have a computer dedicated  server that just  Plays photos and I like it to be I like them to be big so I can see  Yeah, so well

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  If you want really big of course if you've got a tv that's cast enabled you can always just  Put on tv, right and get 70 inches of photos  Uh, did you get up this morning and watch the samsung developers conference keynote stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did not get up this morning to watch that. However, I did I did I did see the news  um  Are do we want to go into that because I can there's a foldable phone. That's what I was watching  It you know, it looked really cool in the demos  but then someone was tweeting how with the lights on you can clearly see the the the

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The line the line of demarcation the guy who was demonstrating it said this is not what it looks like  This is we've hidden it inside  Okay, this is normal practice with a new phone apple does it too. They hide them inside of kind of industrial generic cases  So you can't see the details, but what he's showing  Is a phone that has a screen on the front looks kind of like a thick normal phone again  We don't know how thick is the case and then dizzy watching that loop and he opens it up and it's got one screen  That has unfolded  Without any perceptible, you know  line down the middle

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah in the in the other video with the lights on you see the line down the middle  um, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yes, uh who they did they demoed it in the dark  Oh, that's a little uh, okay. There was a tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From someone in the tech press who saw it the night before during the rehearsal run through  Ah  But I did not like it so it's possible I will never see it again  Yeah, so I  Was paying attention to some of the smart things stuff because you know iot that's what I thought of you is during during the iot

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Presentation they didn't mention security at all  um, well  They mentioned interoperability that seemed to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a key to yeah, this is this is a different interoperability than uh,  They had pitched so i've been watching samsung do this for  Let's see  CES 2014 maybe it was or 2013 when uh samsung's  Oh, who was it who keynoted and he just was like la la la internet of things hand holding everything's gonna be magic  This was kind of a return to that. Yeah, and  The problem is  They're grafting this vision which is actually still very samsung-centric  onto a platform that was designed for super nerds  And the super nerds hate the platform and the normal people are looking at this and going  What the hell do I want my dishwasher to talk to my television?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And the demo they used had a refrigerator with a screen bigger than this on it. I mean it was huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know I could be doing twig from my my refrigerator cam one day

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm not i'm not a fan

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, so it's kind of a cool vision, but it's not as open as you would think it's not as  It's not as transparent how we're going to get there to normal people you have to do a lot on the back end  And i'm not sure if it's really worth it to people who aren't named samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So that's my quick 22nd take there. It seems like uh, and samsung really pushed bixby as well  Their voice assistant said they're going to spend 22 billion dollars on ai a higher a thousand ai developers  Uh, they they brought the former developer of siri  Who of course when apple acquired siri left apple and started viv which samsung then acquired he's still at samsung and uh,  Really promoted the idea that bixby's going to be in everything and how do we think that's going to work?  I'm not i'm not having a bixby a couple of bixby phones of last year  The note 9 and the s9 with the hardware dedicated hardware button never used it  But that was from a different era. That's when bixby was just wasn't a competitor to amazon zekko or siri  It was just designed to open apps on the phone to do things with apps on the phone  Now it's supposed to be a full-fledged voice assistant  Which they kept saying is smarter than any other voice assistant you've used and it could be with viv

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if they do this right and they create a voice assistant where you're like, uh, hey bixby  Uh, let me let me think of it have my doorbell  Contact me when the postman gets here if I can say something like that. I like that and  That actually works and viv actually makes that very easy to develop on the back end theoretically. That's what they show

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Long time that's what they showed they showed a really nice developer environment. He booked a room on mars  At a hotel that was very expensive  And that was the demo and he did a little bit of magic turned a tape tie into a real tie  Which distracted me but  Uh  It it's all wishing right now from samsung. Uh, but you know what? This is a nascent technology  Amazon has the lead right now google's coming on strong apple would like to be there as well  Microsoft's given up with cortana. They've really said  I don't think we're gonna they actually moved it to the office 365 group this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh that makes that makes sense though because cortana clearly isn't going to be in your home life  So it's only going to be your assistant for business. I'll say for bixby  Here's where bixby with the viv could actually the viv with viv could win or do well  It's with creating those experiences in a way that's very seamless for the user and relatively easy for the developer  Because right now if you want to do amazon  Or google especially google's still a pain to develop for  It's a little bit harder  And with viv the theory is you would tell it  You basically  Use this ai and i'm using that in big quotes here ai  To understand what a user wants to do and automatically pull together the right apis to make that happen  So if that actually does work  That could get them into a lot of places  Just because if I had one samsung thing and I wanted to tie it to other things it's possible that that might work

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So yeah, it's all it's for every one of these companies. It's an ecosystem play  And this is the thing that's a little frustrating and it's one of the things that's held back iot in my opinion  Is everybody's a silo?  So there's always this promise in fact smart things started  Was a kickstarter based on the premise that we're going to be universal. We'll talk to zigbee. We'll talk to z-wave  Is it still that universal stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, it would like to be I mean, yes, it will talk to all those radios. Yes, they have features that  Will tie into other apis if a device has it  The problem is people are not building things that tie into smart things  Instead everyone wants to lock down their own apis and make it like oh  You want to talk to the whirlpool?  Washington i mean samsung says they'll talk to anybody and I actually believe that they would but whirlpool is not going to like  Bust its hump to be like, oh, yeah, let me have my appliances talk to samsung. That's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Make sure they work. It's the historic problem with home automation going back 20 years  Is everybody wants to own it?  Everybody wants a silo and all I see is samsung saying our silo our silo not amazon's not apples  Not not not google's our silo our silo and nobody wants to be  Maybe I feels like nobody no consumer wants to say, okay, i'm just gonna  Buy all apple stuff. It'll all work. Yeah in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well consumers do actually buy all apple stuff just to make it work better. They're the only one craziness. That's the only company samsung know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, are people loyal to samsung and say i'm only going to buy samsung stuff some in some countries, I mean i'm sure some yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet in korea south korea. They're really big there  um  It's not just I mean the one of the problems is we don't have that's what ocf was trying to do  We don't have the equivalent of a hypertext, you know for  The internet of things so we don't have a data schema that everything uses that you can kind of build around  You have to do custom for everything and that was the problem that we all saw back in 2013  Even when samsung was like we'll be open. It'll be amazing  It's that doesn't scale that doesn't scale beyond computing because the real world has so many more  devices and things you have to care about  and  The computing guys are  I don't know if they're willfully blind to this or what but yeah  it it's not  And there still aren't great use cases for some of this stuff like  You know, do I need my refrigerator to talk to my television? I I really don't think so but is stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there an unused standard in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there well, there's the ocf which is  Is  Long and storied and went through some efforts and that's got intel samsung huawei  Lg are all involved and that's basically a data schema for  Over a hundred different devices. So it says basically like i'm a light bulb if you're a light bulb and you use ocf it's going to say  This is how you turn recognize a light bulb. This is how it turns on off goes through  X number of colors dims, etc  You see amazon took that and instead of using something like the data schema from ocf they created a voice related data schema  um with three different things an on off a range and a mode setting so again, that's  That's another way of doing it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They exist there's just a lot of them what would it take i'm asking the two of you  For you  I mean stacy is actually a bad person to ask because you do all of this you try it all you've got lines that won't open  But could if andrew would just say the right words that kind of thing  But so maybe I should ask jeff, but i'll ask you stacy put yourself in a normal person's mindset  What would it take?  For home automation to take off

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought we were there. I thought way back in  2012 and 2013 I thought I saw the creation of those standards it was all join  Um ocf was coming around the pike  And things like smart things that really did want to try to work with everything  You'll agree though. We're not there. We're not we're not so it takes a universal standard. It takes cheaper devices, right?
