Yeah  But in Jeff I was gonna ask you about this. This actually relates a little bit to this. Um, I  Was reading whatever version of the New Yorker I'm on which is way late, but they did a whole thing on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Machine the New Yorker just pile. Yes. That's why you got a good texture, right so you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Won't pile just say how does it they it's a scam  SKM  scam Austin they did a big story on it and  It was a new Norwegian television show for teens made by like the Norwegian  And it looked so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fascinating I is I saw I went to a conference. God I go to so many conferences. Where was it?  I went to a conference where I  Met I was I followed her on stage the creators

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, what's funny we've seen this before this was a lone what was it lonely  Lonely kid 24. What was it? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is this is different because it is very similar, but it is  It is actually scripted. There was even a book

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember the books of the love  Girl, yeah, only girl 15 or 16 only girl  15 lonely girl 15. We saw a lot of attempts to create episodic content  That looked like it was popular. We're the but switch which darn conference was Norwegian

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I think which is so is is she is it just on Facebook? Where is it? No, so this is what's really exciting  So let's give people context. So lonely girl was August or was 2006 to 2008  This pretended to be a vlog back when vlogs were a YouTube diary of a teenager very early YouTube thing  Super early now. This is actually a scripted a television show that is creates  They create little one to eight minute snippets. They post them on Facebook watch  it's part of the Facebook watch program, which is Facebook's TV effort and  They appear in people's timelines like they're like your friends, you know  And these drama is happening at a Austin High School  but then the characters all have Instagram and Twitter profiles and they go back like  years so you can actually like cyber stalk these people and find out like oh they used to be friends, but now they're not and so  It's really and it's it's the film is kind of the script in response to audience like participation  So it's a very new way of consuming is by going to different  It just pops up in your Facebook feed and then it gets better if you take the action as a user and go find  Out information about people right? So if you're curious you go like look up the characters on Instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you'd have to follow scam on Facebook and Instagram  Because you'd get messages in both places

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The New Yorker writes as with all internet products once you establish a connection to scam it's very hard to sever it  Facebook and Instagram send viewers constant reminders to log back in and stay up to date  Happy Taffy just posted a video scam Austin just posted a new episode on Facebook watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, of course notifications right I know where I saw her f8  Yes, cuz oh, yeah, cuz this is all face much. Yeah, you can go right right. So they yeah, so the interviewer I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know I can understand why I created be very interested in this as a as a new way of creating content

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's a different relationship with the people formerly known as the audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But right I wonder it's a lot of work for the audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, but this is dead  This is so the goal of this show was to appeal to teen girls and that's what happened in Norway  Was it a success? Oh, yeah huge success. Oh huge like 98%

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a country where a train traveling for eight hours with a camera on top is also a success  So let's just it's cold there. Let's just make this clear, but we love Norway

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what was the stat that you're about to give us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think was like 98% of the population the teen population had heard of it. Huh? And I mean just ridiculous  I don't know how many watched it or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well get ready because the creator of American Idol Simon Fuller has bought the English language rights

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's what it's already on. It's already

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all it's scam Austin is the version that we're talking about. That's his it's on Simon Fuller doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh-huh. Oh, it is. Oh  Another creator who is you know, I mean he was one of the pioneers of reality based TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is how my daughter watches. This is how my daughter entertains herself  She watches tiny little snippets on YouTube, but then she also has we'll call them characters that she follows and she is 11  Going on 12, but she's  she follows them for their videos on YouTube and then she'll go find them on Instagram and find them other places and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not aimed at anybody older than I mean, it's really at the high school age  Yes, earlier, you know, in fact 17 magazine was never aimed at 17 year olds  It was aimed at 12 year olds who were just figuring out how to be this is this is actually aimed at older students because there's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sexual content and stuff like that not like crazy pornography stuff  But my 12 year old would be a little too old for her maybe too young for her. She's too young for now  Yes, it is too old for her. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, the New Yorker article also mentions lonely girl 15  Of course, I remember big brother the house where roommates are conspiring. That was an early attempt to do this  The treatment I gave NBC when we created the site on MSNBC was that it was a big this was before Big Brother  It was a because this was in 1992  It was a big Victorian where web developers lived loved and fought and they created a website  Which ended up being the TV show at the end of the day, but you could tune in throughout the day on the web  I wish NBC had bought this I'd be a rich man by now  You could tune in different times on the web see what different people were doing who was fighting with whom?  This was 1992 I thought of this you could listen to their playlists  If you had they were listening to music like Kevin Rose, he had a certain style of music  You would want to listen to his music. I  This was we pitched this NBC loved the pitch, but they never made the show unfortunately. Oh, wow  Yeah, I wish I wish they'd gone for it. I somewhere she that's with 95 page treatment. I should find it  but that's what the site it became but they didn't want to do all the  And it was probably too early for the web to do all that stuff  Well the text I just put up the site launched in 94  So the web really wasn't widespread enough by then now is the time though boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but yeah, so something like this now thinking about the IG TV announcement in context with like  reading about that and thinking about how my daughter watches television it feels like  We're I mean we always talk about it undergoing a shift  But that's an interesting way to think about how that shift what the end product might look like I guess so now I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so the interview with the creator in the in the chat  Run down the Norwegian creator. Yeah, you can and she's very kind of Norwegian stern. It's very interesting  But you can fast forward through get some sense of the difference is the version she made was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The version she made was public television. Yeah, so it was yes. It was a healthy, you know, this was it wasn't healthy  Well in the long run it was healthy, right? Well, it was Norwegian  Well, let me read what the new  The New Yorker says true to its roots in public television scam attempts to educate its audience  And its primary theme that is if you keep trying things will come out. All right in the end  For instance in the Norwegian version the girl who is slut shamed for kissing someone else's boyfriend  Faces down her tormentors a young man who attempts to suppress his homosexuality winds up accepting himself  But there is apparently debate about what's gonna happen in scam Austin. So scam Austin has not  Started yet or it's about is started a little bit. No, they've already started. Okay  So it's not too late to follow it though. If you you can totally follow it  Because I want to know how to behave in high school  There's some yeah, there's some question though whether this will  Be as public, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Educational as it was all well all stories are kind of like that. I mean think about it  Like they all always I mean, that's that's the point of a story right the character learns

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's oh and Jeff offered us a clip from Sam scam Austin. We're watching it right now  If anybody be this is the interview that you were talking about Jeff  So apparently there's a sweaty locker room activity with young boys and bottles of water. Oh  Boy, that's this is this is aimed at a teenage girl, right? Oh, and he's the gay kid. I betcha and he's a little  It's Norway my friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, this is a little hot

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, it's quite sexy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I can't handle that the audience is watching. I don't know if we can air this  They're in tidy whiteys, it's oh somebody just threw milk against the wall  This is a met a Norwegian metaphor and oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly what this is and they would appreciate being in the know. Yeah, so this is this is suggestive without actually being pornographic and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so I doubt the American will be like this but who knows  And then did Facebook work with this Norwegian producer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know that fidget Seymour interviewed her on stage and they obviously love that they're doing this  Help in some way. I don't think they paid him for anything. I can be wrong with that  I don't know. Maybe they did. Here's the watch. Here's the creator. This is at media more fossa's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know how many of you and know about the show. So we will  Start from the beginning. Yeah, so scum is drama series that runs scum

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't online come to know a page and it's so it starts

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On this one it starts at a web page not not on Facebook watch. Ah, so Facebook managed to entice them in okay  Well, maybe they were using Facebook as a platform. Yeah, this is boy. We're this in a new era, isn't it? That's very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is it is it's something created for the medium rather than just trying to repurpose

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Old-time TV. Yeah, if you want to follow it in the US you have to go to the Facebook page for scum Austin  Which is SK AM  Norwegian for shame. Oh my god shame game. So if I follow it now, I'm gonna get a  Lot of stuff by the way. Here's a bunch of other shows that are also on Facebook watch  And I feel like you know what?  Twitter is now officially  Old-fashioned it is it's a fashion compared to the cathode ray tube. Yeah, but that was way too fast  I  Cry now loud is only 13 years old. It's a teenager still  Are you want to watch if we can catch up on full episodes of scam Austin? There's been eight weeks already  Oh, wow. Yeah, let's just watch a little bit. I hope we get the locker room. What's the American version mature content?  This video may include profanity  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spoke watch prevent I'm gonna need to perform all the time  12.8 million views of this premiere episode like today. I will get about five to get ready for so that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm gonna tell you 12.8 million views is network size  Programming not yeah network hit but network size and given cable size certainly bigger than most cable  yeah, and  given that  It's  Got legs that you know, it's not like a TV show that airs once  Now I have to point out that that's the first episode next episode 4.3 million  Then 3.8 million then 1.4 million it dipped under a million on week 5 went back to 1.4 on 6  Under a million week 7 and then 1.2 on week 8  So that's a little bit more in line with what I expect for a web series. Yeah, roughly a million  teenagers at that  But the aggregate views might be higher because you've also got the Facebook. I mean the Instagram  Part of it, right? There's more right there's some on Instagram, right? Yes, you can follow the characters on Instagram and see their

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interactions is there any advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't see any I know  This would be a perfect thing for the advertising to be  Not over interstitial ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my hometown you guys but paid you recognize spankies a graffiti there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Started April 24th new drops daily. Oh  That was just a tease. Sorry. So it's daily  Daily, that's a lot of they break it up into they're not half-hour episodes. They're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One minute or not. Let's see what's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see what's going on in week 8  So but what I'm what I was saying is that the ads could be product placement  The product placement probably work really well in this if she's wearing like a sweater. That's really cute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You look great in that makeup

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it start behaving like a human being quit walking around like a cliche

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was Megan  Challenge is gonna be getting good great writing and great storytelling in this right because well, but they're TV people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They they got the people who did the Norwegian one. I  Don't think that's I think the challenge is we don't know the challenge because it's a whole new format

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we got to see how people interact with it. Ultimately though. I gotta say ultimately maybe this is me again being old-fashioned  Story is everything. I mean you could talk and we've seen this before with nonlinear forms of  storytelling that the story the acting all of that has to work I  Still believe it has to work and you have to get great writers  Admittedly, this is even harder because they have to write in a new form that made maybe they're not familiar with  But that you can solve but you're gonna have to get great writers to come to it  You know what? What it's reminding me a little bit of and we were talking about this on  Windows weekly is another new medium is about to take off. We talked about it last week  Esports and the Wall Street Journal had an article today about  Professional stadiums being built Arlington, Texas is starting construction on a  100,000 square foot arena for live video gaming  She's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's gonna be a billion dollars a year  This year they're gonna be close to a billion dollars in making a billion dollars in eSports. It's like  938 million. Yeah, it's a up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  340 something alone has put aside a hundred million dollars for purses for fortnight competition  This looks like it's overwatch if you want to watch the Wall Street Journal video  This is this is an eSports event an overwatch event  Thousands oh no, I'm sorry. That's League of Legends thousands of people show up purses are yes in the millions

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this. Well, how would you build a venue specifically for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the actually that's the good news you build a venue and you could use it for other things because it's really a proscenium  You know, it's a stage with a lot of video I presume all around  Yeah, in fact, well my one of the things I experienced with this what made me think of it is  When I watched the this my whole opinion this completely came around when I watched the fortnight Pro-am last week at the at e3

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Realized yeah, I get it. This is fun  This is fun to watch but you but it's you're gonna have the same exact issues that I saw with scum  Which is it's a new medium and and you're gonna have to get directors who understand how to follow the action was a real  Problem with the fortnight thing things would happen  You know off-screen because somebody there's a hundred players diving in and there's a hundred battles or fifty battles going on and the director  Has to be smart enough to know exactly what to show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more like a perfect use for VR where you can you could maybe check out different maybe yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or or instant replay. I mean, you know and then commentators you need they're gonna need to develop the commentators were actually surprisingly good  But still amateurish, but you're gonna need to develop commentators who can because  Sports is only as good as the commentators could bring it to life, you know and get you engaged

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but they'll get there. Oh, they'll totally get in because I was so I've every year when the f1 race comes to Austin  I get to go because various tech companies are sponsoring various aspects of it  So one year I was in there talking to the guy who does who?  Who's in charge of all the cameras and directing everything and the setup they have there  It's this amazing data center that they actually have to be able to put up in 24 hours and then take down in 48  It's crazy and they put it on like three planes, but  What they've got there?  He said one of the hardest parts of his job was actually learning  Both the camera angles they needed but also understanding the latency of the physical equipment  So he could get to where he needed to be and broadcast it quickly  Which I didn't really appreciate but as a nerdy audience you guys would be like, whoa  So that was just throwing that in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the same sort of thing with the eSports other challenge the eSports events can go on as long as 24 hours  It's like cricket  It's electronic cricket. Here is the burbank people love cricket. Here's the burbank center where they're playing overwatch  People bring signs they cheer  They know who the players are, you know, oh, yeah, these players are big stars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo back to your point about the commentators. I'm not so sure that you know, you're our old fart my standards may also not apply  It's the same thing. Yeah, this is like what I mean, it's like, you know, who would think that PewDiePie would be a big star, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's something different. No. No, I completely agree. It's a new meme medium and new new stars will show up  It's there's some simple I mean yes, I this there's a style thing and I'm not expecting to like to like or understand their style  But you also have to cover the event, you know, you have to you have to be showing the big thing that's happening  There's a few, you know, just purely technical things they have to do  But I know I think we're close. I think we're close. This is interesting watching new medium being born

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's super fun and it'll die in like ten years. That's the crazy part. Yeah something new will replace it  I love this and it's here. It terrifies me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well terrifies me because a podcasting used to be the next big thing  Now it's over

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Double podcasting so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One thing one thing I've already lept. I've already make the leap from radio into pocket. I can't I have done this is it  I've already made what you know human can expect to trans transit two different media

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, what about it? William Shatner is doing something with it. No, is that true? Yeah Bitcoin. I think that doesn't count

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Well, you could argue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's what you would argue. You'd say hey, I'm a creator of some sort of  Video I want to get an audience instead of going to the internet directly like the way you and I have done  we would go to Facebook or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  AT&T or a comcast the beauty is you get as a content creator you get free distribution  Right, but as consumers  It's you have to find it still looks to us similar to the way it used to which is you've got a provider

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you don't if you don't meet any provider if no provider loves you  You're just gonna go out on your own. Don't get it at all. You don't get it at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you need you still need backhaul so you still need the way to get on get your wireless  So why are you to the internet? Yes, you still need a wire  It does solve the last mile problem though, right? It solves the last mile problem, but the problem with rural areas  It's like the last 25 miles

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the copyright holders

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of copyright this this is just just just just wind me up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not the law yet in the European Union

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But though though section 13 just got passed by a key committee

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The committee is passed it on and the members of the European Parliament will have to vote sometime between  December of this year in the first half of 2019, this is article 11 and 13 passed by the jury committee  But the European Parliament has to have a plenary vote

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me say it let me say it this is the light on should correct gone  Nuclear and Europe wide and it requires such things as every  Anyone who takes content in has to have must have pre moderation checks for copyright  number one and number two it is a link tax and enables  Publishers to try to charge the likes of Google. This is why Google News left Spain and now it's gonna go Europe wide  It is an effing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Disaster but more importantly it will kill memes  Yes, it will be cats will be dead because of this you won't be able to post a meat because these automated content  Filtering mechanisms Google uses it on YouTube right now. Don't know the difference in parity, you know legitimate use and  Copyright violation and it's already dead in Germany. Yep. Yep. It's all treated as copyright violation  Although I mean it's on it's unclear if they're what the remediation, you know, what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the appeal process and all that stuff. I was in Tel Aviv just  Yesterday, yeah  And I gave a talk on Monday and I went through the unintended consequences of all the EU regular  Regulations legislation in its courts, you know  And I ended up debating with a major French official and with a major EU official over this stuff  But but it's it's  Basically, you're seeing that some providers. It's just like American publishers are pulling out of Europe  You're gonna see people pull out of Europe. I was talking to somebody today who has a big company. He's going to Latin America  He's going to Asia screw it. He's just not going there because it's not gonna be worth it. The regulation is so  Difficult and once again the effort is to reduce the power of the big platforms  The big platforms will end up with more power because they're the only ones who can afford to deal with this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Er  But it's not too late  Because it hasn't been voted into law yet  And just as we often urge our exhort our American viewers to call their member of Congress  You should call European viewers should call your members of the European Parliament and say explain so they understand why this is a terrible idea

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Israel is considering legislation to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Require pre monitoring of all content put on  France is considering fake news legislation to penalize people for publishing fake news  They think they could control the world  Well, they're making they're making a good-faith effort to fix a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're making they're making a good-faith effort to fix a problem they're just doing it in a really stupid way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is I don't know that we have the data that says the problem is as big as this presumption is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think right now everything's so in flux. It's hard to define how to  We see some things wrong that the outcomes are not what we're after  We don't understand yet what causes those outcomes because this is so new and so fast-moving  So they're just taking a stab at it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's a huge impact I do fault them because they're also  You know the thing I heard about legislators in all across Europe as in the US as in Israel is they all don't know how  The internet work works. They're ignorant as hell about the internet and then one of them, you know yelled back on that point  You know, this is this is awful. You're telling us we have to wait to be patient  no, we have to take charge of this and we have to run the world and this is terrible and  And  The presumptions are terrible like one person I was debating with I was going on about how  Basically was calling all two billion people on Facebook stupid and and and chumps for being there  I said no you got it people are there for a reason  They're doing something they want to do if you don't start from that understanding then try to figure out what's what and you come in  And say I'm gonna stop them all from doing this  That's ridiculous, but it's a it's a terribly paternalistic thing. You're right. It's all well intentions busy. I agree with that  But but the intention and the intelligence are far apart on this stuff and the damage can be huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we need less people in office who are  Powerful and proud and think they know so much. I think one of the challenges we're facing is  We're shifting from a society. That's like you said very paternalistic  To one where people want to have more say and need to have more say because the experience is so much more  customized to so many different people and so we're moving again from mainstream and mass to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something more fragmented. I don't know how it works in the European Parliament  But here in good old America  Members of Congress are not really looking out for the people  For some are I suppose but for the most part  They're they're they're protecting the the company that's what they do. They're protecting companies institutions  And they're in and the institutions and that's what this this law does is it's it's IP law to protect the institutions and the  Copyright holders. Yes, it's brought by  Media companies, right and they don't care what me makers think that's not there. There's not it's only nominally their constituency  I would guess is what I'm saying. They're there. What they're actually  Isn't the institutions isn't it? Yes, you're absolutely right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They will paint it in populist terms though, well, yeah, okay, but let's be realists about it. That's that's that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bail and do  Excuse me for not knowing this I presume that members of the European Parliament are voted in it's a democratic institution  That's true and so just as in the United States they they probably care about votes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ultimately if they want to keep their job, I don't know what the turnout is for EU elections. I think it's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know either  You know, I mean that's what's happening in the United States this turnout is so low now that of course you're gonna  wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  43% much better than the US. Yeah, it is I take it back Europe. I take it back you care

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Still not even a majority of the eligible voters, but it's no but it's somebody's voting, but I don't know  Do you really care?  I mean you still want to serve the institutions even if I think even if you're kind of  Forward-thinking and not cynical and altruistic you think that the institutions are what makes this world work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, so in some cases they are and in some cases the institutions have been denigrated by  People who have an interest against them or nihilistic people right which is kind of what's happening here  But what Jeff is talking about is curbing media platforms and kind of some of the  The spread of the high these company data companies in the internet and what's happened with Google and Facebook and  So that's a little bit different than I guess you could argue

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To a politician well you want to promote innovation you want to promote the next thing you want to do stuff  That's going to create jobs  So you don't you don't want to completely tilt the law in favor of the entrenched

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's silly because you can protect innovation and kill jobs  I mean those are just things that we shout when we're trying we're too lazy to actually look at the yes the  Terms in the legislation so whenever someone says kill innovation. I'm just like I don't care

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, just ignore them and get to the root of the problem. Okay. I mean yes, you're right  If you want to preserve coal miners jobs innovation is not the way around it to do it  It could be actually well could clean coal, but you can train them  Yeah, yeah, but I mean honest. Okay. Yeah, you're right jobs may not be  Jobs is a voter issue not necessarily a politicians issue, but politicians all I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Having having just covered the net neutrality flight for like a decade  I mean killing innovation investing in innovation. These are just common tropes that mean nothing you actually the problem is laws  the words themselves matter and nobody actually wants to dig into the words because it's  excruciatingly dull so  And that's people in the vote like voters don't vote on that either  They don't care about that and it's not wrong for Congress to be like, oh, yeah. Yeah, so I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know what the solution here so so Stacy. Yeah, there was one one of the EU politicians at this event until of you  argued  angrily from stage  First that technology is killing democracy and second that technology created populace

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are contrary points of view aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely and and and wrong and and I and then got really mad that I used the phrase as to you guys moral panic  She's not more panic. It was the definition of it. It was the definition of moral panic where he was blaming all of society's problems on  the platforms  the fall of democracy  Bad behavior Russians populace everything was the fault of the platforms and I it's human behavior and  And government right is there to regulate human behavior when they don't know how to do it they pull this kind of number

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but okay, so we in the United I don't know enough about how it works in the EU, but in the United States  It's a representative democracy. We don't expect voters to know the details of each law the arc, you know arcana  They are there to in theory set the the overall thirty thousand foot  Policy point of view we know what we want to work toward and then you we're hiring people whose job it is is  You know create staff and create laws that that achieve our vision thing, right? So I don't think that that's broken  I think that works. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it's broken because a lot of people we're not actually talking about the laws anymore  We're talking about we're sloganeering. So it's one thing and we don't talk vision thing. That's thirty thousand foot  We don't talk about the trade-offs you have to talk about the trade-offs when you're talking about a  30,000 foot views still and we don't do that in our politics because either our politicians don't think we can handle it  Well, I don't know why we I mean, it's one thing to say issue debates and really more towards sloganeering  I agree with you on that. Yeah, so that's like if we want to figure out a solution to this  We actually have to start framing our issues as hey, I believe this matters  Yeah, I acknowledge that this is gonna hurt the following five constituencies, but I believe it's worth it because of this  That's I mean that's like debating 101 right but we don't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I believe that we should foster technologies that allow us to innovate things like new forms of media  I believe that that may cost people like me a job in the short run  But in the long run it's part of the refreshing and renewing process will that will create new kinds of jobs for another generation  That's is that the kind of thing you're talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, like we're debt neutrality, you know if we're talking about that same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm more interested in what the future of a free and open Internet can bring us then the then the potential risk of  loss of revenue to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comcast Verizon AT&T and sprint or the loss of something like zero rating for yourself, right? That's a hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here. Yeah, so you you know, we're but at least here we have those conversations at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do and some I mean we do we do and I wish we had them in other places because I think it's fine to have  A viewpoint, but I think it's ridiculous for us to all run around just shouting and that's it's not the soul  Everything's wrong with our the soul thing that's wrong with our country, but that's a big  Challenge to an informed debate and that's hurting us badly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's always been though at least as long as there's been mass media. It's always been one of the one of the ways politicians  Manipulate the electorate is with fear, you know yellow journalism  And you know some proportion of the electorate is always gonna fall for that  and you know the debate over the the the  Separate the family separation and the borders really good example of I  Don't I think that it is too  You could say it's sloganeering and there's fear-mongering and there is a lot of that going on  But I think there's also if you cut through all of that two different points of view  That are at odds with one another that are not, you know  I mean I have one that so I don't like the other but but that are that are points of view that you could reasonably hold  One that our borders need to be protected and the laws need to be enforced and the other that I  You know, I personally don't think our borders should be protected  I think there's evidence that migrants actually improve the economy. Those are two different points of view  But we're not arguing that because there's a lot of this emotional one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you could also expand it because there is also a  worldview that right now we are  Experiencing such a radical change from climate from technologies from  Destabilization and governments that migration in mass migration is going to become a real issue  From a lot of the poor exactly the world to the richer parts right exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is why that that's why I don't dismiss the protect our borders argument. I understand that argument  You know, so but we're not fighting over that right now. No, I know that's the problem. Well, some people are I don't  I don't think that's true. I think some people are I think that route you get down to it  That kind of is what the debate is about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but we have I don't think we're acknowledging that at all  I think we're just talking about borders  But we really need to be thinking about is what happens when we make a large portion of the world uninhabitable

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm serious reasons. The problem is though if you make it too complex and everybody gets frozen because it's too much to figure out  I mean, I you can't make you you can you have to dumb it down a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey well, yes, but we have to I think we have to start from that  We have to create categories based on that and we have to circle back around to that. It is complicated  It's horrifyingly complicated. But if we don't understand that we can't actually create realistic

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Democracy or even a republic work if you don't kind of boil it down to some simple  Concepts and say well, here's your choice a or B you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but this see  Trump and the people who are so freaked out about borders right now. Yes, we can talk about being racist  we can talk about all of this but at their core is a very real fear that  This this macro change is going to  Lead our country very disruptive. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think the reason you see nationalism rising is because the nation as an institution is challenged, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so it's Tracy you're right  I mean this is but but it's but it's it's it's at a macro level that it's hard to put into what Leo wants  Which is you know things like short phrases like death panel

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right well it'd be nice to avoid the heavily emotionally charged  Phrases, but I notice the guardian comes emotionally charged when you see Rachel Matt help burst into tears here television  It's hard to say it's not emotionally charged, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very upsetting is it's upsetting. I'm upset was a reveal the Center for Vestal Reporting just put up a report  based on federal court filings of  Children being injected with cocktails of drugs to pacify them  Yeah in these centers the Guardian today published a complete accounting of  34,361 documented deaths of refugees and migrants because of Fortress Europe  Right. Meanwhile, you have Trump is to the AFD in Germany and Brexiteers and so on  Speaking of moral panic. It's not technology in this case  It's turning the other the stranger  Into an enemy who's going to steal your job and steal your home and steal your child and steal your daughter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You stay whatever so but right so Jonathan Haidt talks about this a little bit and what he said  Really though you boy you can boil it down to some fundamental disagreements in worldview and isn't is that reasonable debate those that's reasonable  Debate those we should probably get rid of all of the highly charged rhetoric

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I have to understand the big worldviews  I think like I think it'd be easier if you can recognize  When you're hitting up against an issue where you can change someone's mind in a worldview where they're probably that's like core to who they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He kind of says that that's one of the things he says he says we have this we have this notion that we're reasonable  Creatures that we we act upon reason he says really  reason is a  Little person trying to drive the giant elephant of emotion and what reason often ends up doing is  Justifying the way the elephants going because because emotions gonna take us there its reasons job to say this is why  Rather than to try to steer the dang thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why I argue that there's three in my new definition of journalism to convene communities into civil informed and productive  Conversation and civility comes first what should be happening now?  Journalism's role and Facebook's role should be trying their best to introduce people to these to these  Brown strangers of the border and make us understand their humanity, but I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make them understand. I agree. They should be people. I agree. They should be but it's kind of misunderstanding  How how these businesses are formed even?  ABCCB as an NBC are not  Really formed in the public wheel. They're formed as profit-making businesses

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I don't think profit yes, but every journalist shows the New York Times shows every pro ever every  Media company for the last 200 years has been that's why journalists believe they have standards that right have them rise above the try

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That transcend that yeah  Yeah, yeah  with mixed success  I just I think and I think when you gets to Facebook you really you're asking Facebook a lot of  Facebook you certainly can ask a New York Times reporter to  Understand that but the average Facebook employee doesn't come from that background

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if Facebook says that they write this is my argument that I've made the face Facebook's  Definition of community is too shallow and temporal that it's about conversation and that that's gonna get us in trouble  Just like clickbait does I could make you converse because I can make you angry, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, but we didn't think it would I mean that may be something that's come to light recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you look at groups, right if you look at groups on Facebook where this bad stuff there, right?  But what could groups be on Facebook?  It truly could be and I see this happening in anonymous groups where you see communities truly coming together and doing things

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't it the nature though? It seems to be the nature of the beast that group that all social  Come all Commons  Areas on the internet end up descending into this and they always have over after a period of years no matter what I mean  Going back to even Google Plus now going back to the newsgroups Google Plus is awful  But it's mostly because it's untended. Yeah exactly, but the new I think there are there may be ways to design this  I think I'm really curious about that. Frankly, is it possible to have a social network that doesn't after a period of years  decline into madness

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So did the well as a well the well did yes. Yes, it did

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Never today which didn't giga didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was giga almost social community? No. Well, we had lots of commenters who talked to us all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, but yeah, I think you go didn't last long enough  I think if it had lasted longer it might have YouTube did Twitter did the well did newsgroups did  every every time you have these wonderful  conversations and and and  beautiful areas where people are communicating  Somehow for some reason maybe it's I don't know I was love to know why I think it's openness

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that that openness will complete openness or near complete openness will lead to  Manipulation and bad guys come in and they trash it right you have to invest so ant pruitt

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a feature of society as a whole. Is that true? Yeah. Yeah, if you hang out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean if you get a large enough group together, I mean you get four of your friends together turns into a mob  Well, I was gonna say your four friends are like and then you have a party and then some guy gets really trashed  Yeah, then you're like I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  as a kid in the  60s  participating in war protests  That got out of hand because it's very easy in a mob for a mob to get out of hand  No one person can has the responsibility. It's very much like Twitter or some sort of social  Network, it just it spins out of control and then you do things as part of a mob that you would never do  By yourself ever  Like set cars on fire

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Can you put on an interactive?  Platform such that this is where I told you about spaceship media, right?  No, I told you this one. Oh, oh perfect. So spaceship media is a wonderful  organizations couple journalists in San Francisco formed it and their first  Test was getting 25 after the election getting 25 women who voted for Trump in Alabama  25 who voted for Clinton in San Francisco and the journalist  Interviewed them all got to know them and then they threw them all into a private Facebook group and  For the first, you know day they were talking nicely about their kids and soccer and such and their jobs and their homes and their towns  And then it descended  But but my friend  Then people from the group came to the journalist and said can you help us out over here?  Can we're getting in trouble? Can you look up some stuff for us?  The heavens opened and the angels sang because people said that they wanted an informed conversation  They trusted and desired facts and they trusted the journalist to get it for them  Why because the structure that the journalist had set up was to get them all know them understand them introduce them  Respect them and expect something higher of them and it's continued for a long time.

So the saga is of course it starts last Monday when AT&T Time Warner is approved by a judge  The deal goes through on Friday of last week. It's official  And immediately Comcast which said even admitted we're watching  To see what the court says as soon as the court said oh green lighted it Comcast up its bid to 65 billion over  Disney's fifty four point five billion  Disney has sweetened its offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, this has changed a little bit. So Disney is now offering  seventy one point three billion dollars, but it's half cash half stock. So they changed the proportion  And Disney is pretty determined to get  21st Century Fox and  Me you know, I doubt it has to do with Hulu  Although it would be the case that if Comcast got Fox it would get 60% of Hulu would have majority stake  If Disney gets it, it would only have 30% unless well Disney wants to have some other I don't think they have a majority stake  I think Disney wants the movie studio right more than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah Comcast on Monday after it was announced their stock went down  From it went down  It went down because of their up to bid right?

They uh, they uh are chinese company  They actually were kind of the spin-off is one plus but oppo still makes phones. In fact, they're one of the biggest sellers  In uh in china, they're they're making a phone. So the new metric you should know this  For smartphones is what percentage of the front face is screen?  Up to now 91 has been the highest anybody can get  This one is 93 percent  Because look at this  the the camera  Pops up there's no notch  The camera pops up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Front and back does it turn on instantly? Yeah, there's no delay that that'd be nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say well I can show it to you. This is a verge video. I ordered one  um, they say  That it's so fast because there's no finger print reader  You have to do face recognition that it does the face recognition in half a second  See that's how fast the camera launched. Did you see that it was pretty quick

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the auto you hit to get the camera to launch you have to go to the screen to do that  Is there a new button you swipe up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or there's a camera button oppo's new find x is announced was announced in paris yesterday  It combines it's a 6.4 inch display in a regular size  You know phone because it's 93.8 screen  Uh and that it can do the face recognition by the way 25 megapixel front-facing camera  With 3d scanning system  16 megapixel and 20 megapixel dual rear camera. The other thing is no camera bump because it goes slides right into it  Uh, there's no stupid notch. No notch. No stupid notch  The cameras can open in just half a second  So you swipe up it recognizes you and then it goes away  And here for privacy nuts is another nice feature. The camera's covered when it's not in use  Interesting okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's tough. It is tough though. That's a good point. Someone said it was tough to put a case on that which yeah  Dedicated case person. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, maybe that maybe not good for a case and mechanical parts  right  You're bringing up all the potential problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know, I love things that click i'm not gonna lie. I I love things that pop up  You don't slide it up too. It's a little motor

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, oh, that's another sign of  Another thing that could go wrong  Yeah, it sure is. I you know, I just like seeing innovation in this space because  Everybody else slavishly copies apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so although I think that that screen percentage that's like kind of a silly metric  I I do not want to live in a world where now i'm gonna have to suddenly memorize like  Percentage of your face that is screen. I'm like, oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ask your barber  He'll know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ask them what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, the iphone is eighty  2.9 percent screen i'm telling you it's gonna be the new metric. Let's no let's not make this happen. Yes, it's gonna be the new metric  Uh too late, it's already happened  Um, oh you wrote about this stacy higginbotham  Amazon is putting echoes in hotel rooms  There are already hotels doing this but this is a specially designed echo  For hotels, I think this might be really great  You can I think this is really awesome ask it for room service request housekeeping play music, of course  It's called a word for hospitality  And it will be distributed on an invitation basis to hotels vacation rental spots and other locations  the uh marriott hotels weston hotels st. Regis  Loft and autograph collection hotels starting this summer  There have been hotels like the wind las vegas who've had this before  But they weren't just the regular everyday echo  You can ask where the regular everyday echoes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there was actually a lot happening on the back end to make them work in the hotel room  That's a new person every every time somebody checks in and checks out. Well, no the wind does it a little bit differently  but  For this one, it's like it's kind of like creating a blueprint for the hotel, but there's a bunch of parameters room service

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I love it. You could say echo. Can you get me a ham and cheese on rye and a bottle of pop?  and uh or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I see that bottle of pop it'll come back and say you apparently are over 70 years old

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can say what time does the hotel pool close

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where the fitness center is, you know, what's gonna happen?  It's like it's like a new hotel room, which I do often and you and and okay  What channel is msnbc and they don't give you the list anymore. So you gotta go through everything right love to have that  What'll happen? Well, no what'll happen now is that is that is an ant best?  He'll go in the room and and you've taught her how to use it  But she won't know what the commands are you'll end up with this huge catalog of commands  You might as well pick up the phone. Oh, well, wait, wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't know if you guys have done this  But if you go into amazon today, you can create a blueprint and one of the blueprints for houseguests. So this is a similar  So go to amazon. I think it's dot com slash blueprints or something  So i've actually done this in our house and you basically and yes, you do have to ask  Madam a the questions or have the right syntax, but you actually put in a lot of syntax  when you're  Get your mind out of the gutter, man  so  When you  So like when I did it, I was like, how do I turn on the lights? How do I change the temperature? I tried like  You know, how do I change the thermostat like all of these variations of things that my guest I figured would want to  to know  And this is this is very similar. So you'll probably have a list of a couple commands like  I mean, but you already have that in hotels today. You have those fat books, right that you get and you're like, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just looked up yef

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The new alexa for hospitality will link to your amazon account if you want you'll be able to go in your echo settings  say I want to when i'm going to be staying at that hotel just  Here's my here's my music here's all that stuff  So it would know I could say read to me and it would know my audible book and would read to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is going to be so so that's but that's not there yet. And there's a couple things we should note one  Every time every I think it's at the end of every day possibly every stay it'll reset the they're going to reset  So you don't have your old commands. They go away the hotels don't get the data. They don't get the voice data  Amazon's very particular about that, of course  They will get metrics like how many percentage of people who accessed room service through this device, for example

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The one more way I don't have to talk to people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go  And those so tying it to your personal account. They're not offering that yet  Marriott was the first company to actually tie your netflix account  In your hotel room and that integration actually took  So long I talked to marriott when they did it and the amount of time and effort for like authenticating and the  de-authenticating was  Incredible. So if anyone's going to be able to do this, well, it's going to be marriott, but it is a time-consuming thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Marriott's now gigantic because it also includes starwood  Yeah. Yeah, the merger the purchase  Sigh i'm a marriott person. So i'm fine. I'm a starwood person

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  That's true, too. Yes. That's true. Yes, the con the con man will say I don't take advantage of anybody. I take advantage of their greed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And although I got one not that long ago that was like I know that this is part of a scam  But this is really not a scam. You know, it was like well it was very convincing. It sounded  A lot like my friend. So then I had to go and I was like, that's what makes it crazy even there  Yeah, but a quick facebook check showed me that they were not there. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the uh, I mean  What I really feel for is all those nigerian princes who actually are trying to get money out of the country  Because it's very hard to convince anybody  No, that's they're not there's nobody there is nobody that's not real  That's not real crypto kitties. Here's some schadenfreude. Wait, is this is this a scam?  No, I wouldn't say it's a scam. I think they're very straightforward  Crypto kitties  Which was I kind of regret not playing it now  Uh, it was a virtual, uh kitty  They you would buy kitties they could breed and create new unique kitties which you could then sell and of course speculators jumped on it was based on  Blockchain must be good. It was one of the world's first blockchain games and they raised some money  And recent Horowitz and union square ventures in march gave them 12 million dollars for digital collectibles  Unfortunately, it was a little bubbly  The number of crypto kitties transactions decreased in june by 98 percent  Geez and it's now gone down to virtually zero. Although mr. Crypto kitty  Uh says you can't measure by the number of transactions that happen in a month  Uh, people are people are holding  their crypto kitties and  The you know, the price has gone down. The average price is about five dollars per digital cat  All-time medium high forty one dollars, but we heard about people selling cats for hundreds of thousands of dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you know, the price has gone down to about five dollars  Which reminds me  As i've had conversations about this lately can one of you geniuses explain ico's to me and tokens sure and

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do it stacy could do that really well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was mean um, I can explain what the blockchain is I cannot explain tokens

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, you do the blockchain. I'll do tokens blockchain. I blockchain again. There is I read

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yesterday I read the most pointless article I've ever read in wired magazine. It must have been 50 000 words  About an ico scam that never it just never ended  but I read the whole dang thing if

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Understand the ico and the uh token and the fiat currency  Yes, okay. So that's your assignment. I could you want me to do this stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can you can explain the ico's to it. We can do it together if you want  I'll start with fiat currency then you can do block. Oh, I I could take we'll do fiat then  It has to start with fiat

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so currency based on  Like an actual belief thing of value no versus well, okay  So I I start with we used to be on the gold standard and then wait a minute. We moved to fiat think about gold though

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the value of gold  Does not equal its actual value  The industrial value of gold is far lower than it sells the price it sells for  Even gold is gonna go there. Yeah, no even gold's a fiat currency. Oh, wow. It's okay. Yeah, okay  Because so so currency is a store of value  Right. It's like a battery for value. I mow your lawn  There's two things you could do you could give me a loaf of bread that we've done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GIF of the president yelling at you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or you could give me a token of some kind that says this is the value of that lawn mowing we've pre-agreed that you will  Give me five dollars. That's a piece of paper that says five dollars has abraham lincoln on it  and that we've agreed that's  Roughly equivalent to the amount of energy I put into mowing  And the only thing that's holding that up is fee is faith fiat  Because the faith in the full faith and credit of the united states government

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So fiat currency is otherwise known as a a a liquid currency that that people agree on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a great it's agreed upon value. It has no inherent value  And stacy you're right initially it was pegged to gold  But gold doesn't have the gold doesn't have that value either because the industrial value of the of the metal  the base metal is no is nowhere near what the  The value was was assigned so even that was to some degree  It was a tangible thing. It's like clam shells or cowrie shells, right?  right  Okay, so that's what that's that's and then there's some backed by government some not  There's there's bills dollars bill the deli owner  Uh wants to buy a new deli can't get a bank loan  So he puts out bills dollars that uh worth 80 percent of the value of a sandwich you give me 80  Cents on the dollar for a sandwich. I'll give you a sandwich 20 discount and you give me you buy it  And now I have cash to buy a new deli  Uh people it's actually happened people actually trade it  There's canadian tire. It was a store in canada people were using their canadian tire currency as real currency because as long as you all agree  This is some value. That's a fiat currency  S and h green stamps green stamps perfect example. Yeah  Okay, keep going keep going professors now we get to blockchain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  oh, okay blockchain is a  distributed ledger system, so it's just a  Some  It's just a way to track something  It in computing and the way you track it and the way it works is  Everyone has well you have to get a consensus to agree that this transaction has taken place in stored  And what happens the consensus?  Is usually 51 percent. I think it could be other things. I don't know  um and  To do like to create like in cryptocurrencies to create these things to create  Uh bitcoins, etc  You have something called proof of work and that is computing power  You don't actually that that's not tied to blockchain blockchain is just the distributed  Ledger aspect of it. That was kind of really confusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, that's what you wanted to bitcoin. You need some way when you when we have financial transactions  You need some go leo some way of recording financial transactions a ledger generally in the past  This has all been done in centralized place a bank  If uh, if you you know, you come to me and you buy it  Buy something I put it in my book and now we have a record of it, but it's centralized  so blockchain was created by satoshi nakamoto a  mysterious person or persons  Uh, or initially with bitcoin the idea that you could create something that would be fully decentralized a ledger  That is fully decentralized but contains an agreed upon truth  So you don't have to have a central person a bank or somebody keeping that ledger  By the way ledger could be a database could be anything really that but it's all agreed upon and you know the proof of work is  There's a lot of complicated math about why you do a proof of work and and and so forth  But it could be but so let's say it's done for a currency  Uh like like bitcoin so the ledger keeps track of who has what?  If I buy something for you for you using bitcoin, it's entered into the ledger  the bitcoin miners not only create new coins and there's going to be a limit of 21 million bitcoin, but there's  so to avoid inflation he's tried to figure out how to avoid a lot of the problems that all fiat currencies suffer, but  Among other things  Uh, the miners not only create coins, but they also using their machines doing all this  mathematics  Do the ledger maintain the ledger and one of the problems and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The crypto part of it the the the security part of it as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because what they're doing is factoring primes. So they're doing math hard math and the math gets harder by the way  This is another good thing or an interesting thing that nakamoto did he's made the math harder over time  So because you don't you you want to i'm not sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's only for blockchain though. Sorry. That's for bitcoin. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's other ways of doing this so this is how bitcoin right now. So okay i'm so far so good i'm fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now ico and tokens so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Along comes uh an alternative to bitcoin  called ethereum  Similar blockchain similar idea tries to solve some of the problems, you know bitcoin among other things problems with bitcoin are  Besides its huge volatility, which is a big problem  It it's uh, this transaction time slowed a lot and the cost of transactions have gone up a lot  so uh people are trying to create new kinds of bitcoin bitcoin really is funny because you can't  You can't change bitcoin. You can only fork it  And and you know, you can't you can't say let's fix bitcoin  It's been a real historically a problem with bitcoin  And so there's some real problems built into it and you can only make you could fork it  Create a different kind of bitcoin. So ethereum was a was a different way of doing it to try to solve it  The the the sec has decided by the way that the icos are in fact  Uh real financial transactions. The idea is just like a stock offer  It's just like those franks dollars the deli dollars  Uh, i've decided that I want to raise money for my business  And what i'm going to do is i'm going to issue a ico initial coin offering  And you will give me fiat  Government-backed fiat currency and I will give you this token that has some value in the case of franks deli  It's 80 of a sandwich or it's a sandwich at a 20 discount rather  So, uh, it's a way of raising money  Uh, sometimes it's used so companies like telegram have raised I think almost a billion dollars now  With their bitcoin because they're gonna they'd say that our bitcoin our not bitcoin our currency should be used our ico  But is for a currency that we're going to use  That we're going to use we're going to create a currency you will have those tokens will be translated into that currency  For monetary exchange inside of telegram, right?  Um  So the idea is it's basically a way of raising money and there was some question for a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then how is ongoing value created? Why are you buying that other people think your token is market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't have to be speculative if your token actually can be exchanged for goods and services that people want then you're on your way  To establishing a true fiat currency based on it  So inside telegram if people really think it's real money worthwhile, right then  Yeah, then you can get things the problem with the token in most cases is it's a closed ecosystem  So you have to want things within that closed ecosystem  But for the rest of the world you want to be able to take something out and get dollars because that's how the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To fiat, right? Well, and there's another problem or two or two goods which is what there's another problem with tokens  Which is in many cases?  The people who issue the tokens take the cash take the real money and disappear  Right and you're left holding nothing because if the ico, you know  If that i if those tokens are never turned into anything of value  So last year there were six and a half billion dollars worth of ico's  Um hundreds of millions of dollars sometimes in just a few hours raised

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the sec is kind of dithered around about whether these are securities but eventually decided there were securities  So there may be and there may be going forward some regulation on this  But there's been people have put money into these things and just the people disappeared

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's there's there's one there's a there's a much vaunted  A lot of people who are really really good involved in this called civil which is a journalism platform. Yeah, I met one of the founders

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're wonderful people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've read the the uh white paper three times and when I lose so people they're gonna raise a lot of money  They say through an ico so people are going to give money into their closed ecosystem  My money is sitting there now exchange for these tokens

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right the presumption those tokens are going to let you buy credibility on certain journalists. I'm not kidding

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but how the hell does that doesn't monetize?  So a lot of in a lot of cases you're thinking an ico you should think of it as a donation  And in fact for a while a lot of the people in the ico community said yeah if we call this a donation  We're off the hook the sec said no, that's not true  But that that was their attempt to get around it as saying no, you're not buying anything as a donation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I I I get a token and I give it to leo because we can do investigative journalism  No, you're not gonna do it. I'll give it to stacy  So I give it to stacy. I give you a token that had been worth 100  There's a market it could be worth 110 now or 90 now or whatever and you agree and I  That you're gonna do this wonderful story because i've given you this this money  And i've done good for the world i've done good for the world because stacy does the story of the world gets it  But how was any additional value created such that there's an influx of real money into this beyond some measure of charity to start off with  Well, it just depends how you structure it, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  That's that's the key thing when you're evaluating an ico you have to decide if they're going to be able to  Get real money into their system or build a system where there's value where your token has value to you  For whatever good and service they're going to exchange for it  So there are like electricity icos that have happened where your token gets you electricity  Which then you can say oh well, that's worthwhile because otherwise I would spend actual money on that  So great for electricity for digital services. It's a little less clear  Um for things like journalism, I mean they're eventually asking you to pay for journalism like with real money

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So getting back to the old confidence games  There's a confidence game called an exit scam that is being  played out now in icos where companies  raise  funds and disappear

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's there's nine million dollars i'm not suggesting that's happening in the case of civil at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no according to investipedia nine million dollars is lost each day in cryptocurrency scams. It's very easy to fall into these  bitcoin.com news said 1.36 billion dollars worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen by fraud fraudulent  Icos in the first two months of 2018

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All this comes back to fred and the new norwegian crypto princes  Norwegian i say norwegian i meant nigerian  Well, it is it's a scam just like the nigerian it's a potentially potentially it is a potential scam. Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did we really do all of that just so you could say that sentence one of the reasons it's a great scam

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the reasons is a great scam is because blockchain is basically anonymous  Anonymous so it's not only is it decentralized so there's nobody regulating. It's anonymous  So, you know  You can get away with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's anonymous, but trackable isn't it? It is trackable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is trackable. I remember talking to  Agents at a conference. It was a digital currency conference and these people were the fbi and they were like  This is the best thing that's ever happened to us. I was like, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's anonymous, but uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh  If there's leaks in the system or it's not well designed, it's not fully anonymous you get a number each transaction  Each party to the transaction has a not basically anonymous number if it can't be tied back to you in some other way  Uh, then it's anonymous but cash is anonymous too. I mean it's not cash is totally anonymous, but there's plenty of cash tracking done  Uh wasniac, uh last february the one of the founders of apple  uh  Said he lost  seven bitcoins through fraud  Using a stolen credit. You just lost them through bad memory. I lost them because I couldn't same amount by the way  Because I can't because I can't remember the password. No, they're not lost  The cover story in uh in uh, july's wired is all about this  And it's uh, it's actually it's very long, but it's an interesting read  Um, there's maybe more personal details than I really needed but inside the crypto world's biggest scandal  And it's all about an ico gone terribly terribly wrong, but with the best intentions  This wasn't a case of a con so much as just you know  Good intentions gone wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might after her review next week though. Yeah, so there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff you have a number for us  I do indeed so, um  Uh, slightly political but uh when the stuff down stacy way was occurring on the border  uh a couple  named  Uh charlotte and dave wilner in san francisco saw a picture of a two-year-old reminded them of their own two-year-old daughter  And they started a fundraiser on facebook hoping to raise 1500  Five days later. It's now at uh, what does it say there 13.4 million when I put this link up  Uh this afternoon about uh, 230 and it's now  6 30  So, you know a few hours ago. It was just 10 million. So in the time of the show plus a little bit it's raised  two three million dollars  uh, and it's for the um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw it's to re and reunite parents and children. Well, it's to it's to it's to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To bond out people and to represent them in court  It's the refugee and immigrant center for education and legal services in texas  I saw they did a facebook live show answering all the questions about how they operate what they do  Mark suckerberg is given other people have given  But it's pretty amazing. You can see you know when you when you want to yell about facebook when you want to say  Facebook's awful people can join together and they can do things that matter  Which by the way, let's do another  Well, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jesus but it pointed to a facebook thing right to a facebook thing stacy  Now I I want to point out it says he's raised 13.4 million of 15 million they had they have kept  All the increasing. Yes, because once you hit the the goal then it stops so they keep increasing the goal. So  I mean the sky's the limit on this could keep going

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so by the way, just just note this is a good thing that happens on facebook  Unlike my european friends. It's not a scam on people's lives that people do real good things  Which is why by the way as the headline says  Scream about facebook all you want but the stock is at an all-time high

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy this has to be more money than races has ever received  Oh, it is by far in there by far in their entire

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By far, but but for things like bond funds the the number of cases being brought  The justice like 20 of the justice department cases are immigration cases and the number I can't remember but it was like  you know  Uh tens of thousands of cases last year. It's going to be more than 300 000 cases so far  So the number of cases that will require  A bond and legal help and so on this money will i'm sure be used  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hopefully for its intended purposes  Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so funny because I I saw that you donated and I had my finger on the button and I wait  I probably should learn. I know you wait a minute. I know I should read up on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I read up the washington post did a feature on it. I read up other news on it. So I I did the right thing  Okay, um  Uh through races, uh, the races serve 7 000 family members in attention last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a legit charity. I can actually tell you because I I am familiar with it  I have a friend who volunteers for it as a lawyer. So it is a legit organization

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I let it go for it. Yeah. Yeah, but you know, it's nice actually to have something uh, you can do because I feel like a lot of  A lot of what we do is holler

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know exactly change i'll change my my picture on twitter. Yeah. Yeah  Um speaking of charity one one last number. What the heck? So, uh both square and twitter are about to double their stock value  Making the combined companies worth more than tesla  So they left when jack sat down wow square square and  And are the break of boasting 100 gains this year the firms are now worth more than 62 billion combined says bloomberg surpassing  The market value of tesla they laughed at jack  Laughed no more.

Transcript:  very nice  My uh mine is a little more self-serving  uh  There's an android podcast app in town  And actually, you know, it's not it's it's early days yet and goodness knows  There's a lot of podcast apps. We recommend podcasts among others  But if you use this is basically I think a window into google podcasts  but if you you know, and  You know if you're interested in subscribing pick a podcast that uh that you like and you want to listen to on a regular basis  Maybe something like  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I it syncs to  The google home we actually talked about this on our show
