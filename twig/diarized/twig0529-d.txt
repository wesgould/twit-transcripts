We were off for a couple of days.  I wish I could apologize for PG&E,  but the courts have forbidden me from doing so.  But we are back and I thank our hosts  for putting up with the two-day delay.  Stacey Higginbotham, so nice to see you.  No, that's not Stacey.  Try again.  No, that's not Stacey.  One more time.  That's Stacey Higginbotham.  Okay, now really, honestly, is it freezing in Seattle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm cold.  I've just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, but you really look like Princess Leia.  She looks like she's in the ice planet.  I swear to God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do make Leia earphones.  I imagine they make Leia earphones.  Well, you must have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You must, you must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, if you're not watching, if you're just listening,  just imagine Princess Leia, you pretty much got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's going to save the empire.  No, what?  Who would she save?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Jeff Jarvis, you know, amazingly enough,  looks exactly like Mark Hamill in the later years.  Hey, hey.  BuzzMachine.com.  I should have mentioned Stacey's at staceyoniot.com  and of course, her great podcast with Kevin Toffle.  Jeff is a blogger at buzzmachine.com,  but more importantly, he's the Leonard Tao Professor  of Journalistic Innovation.  Bad audio technician.  Bad, no, when you're working, do it fine.  Karsten, are you having trouble there?  Yeah, I'm just...  Oh, thank goodness nobody watches the video.  Jeff is professor, I'm going to do it again.  Leonard Tao, can I just do the acronym?  T-L-P-J-I-C-N-G-S-J-C-U-N-Y.  The Leonard Tao Professor of Journalistic Innovation.  It's in tight, Jeff.  At the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism  at the City University of New York.  And Pruitt is also with us and is debuting a brand new show  on the network, it won't be this week,  that's one of the casualties, I'm sorry to say,  of the power outage.  It's all good.  We're going to do it today, we're going to do it next week.  Have you announced it yet?  Yes. Yes, sir, we announced it.  Hands-on photography.  Also known as HOP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  HOP, hippity hop.  I'm just trying to get you to promote it  a little more completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My, this is my high level concept, the 30,000 foot.  It's the Bob Ross of photography.  We're going to get him a little curly wig  and it's very calming, it's very soothing.  Ed is calming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, isn't he?  He is, no he does, he calms me all the time.  He's a gentle.  Carsten on the other hand, irritates the hell out of me.  I still like what you said on Twitter though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with the Bob Ross with biceps.  That was the title of Twitter, Bob Ross with biceps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because he's a gentle giant.  He's, if you never saw, and I didn't for a long time,  we only talked to you on Skype.  Right.  You know, he sounds very sweet and he's always,  you know, in fact, on our new Twitter forums,  there's a count of how many times.  Oh yeah, the dad gum count.  So there's one.  Is it the dad gun count?  Dad gum, no, bless your heart.  Bless your heart.  Bless your heart.  And he calls Lisa, Miss Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That should be a sir count.  He's just so sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a gentleman.  Bless your heart is not sweet.  It's not?  Oh, bless your heart's a little put down.  Yeah, bless your heart is not sweet.  It's like we say, oh, bless your heart.  I said it to Mr. Jarvis after his rant on dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's what comes close to irony in the South.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Bless your heart is, oh, aren't you just cute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, she knows.  Aren't you all that slice of bread?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're going to interpret for us, will you, Stacey,  whenever he says something, you tell us,  is that passive aggressive?  Is he throwing shade?  Is he subtweeting?  What's going on here?  Throwing shade.  Irony sign, southern subtweeting.  Southern subtweeting, ladies and gentlemen,  today on This Week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you explain one thing to me?  I know you're probably tired as hell of talking about it.  But how can PG&E not have systems set up  so that they didn't have to do this?  Why is it now that their wires are going to set fires off?  One word, Jeff, corruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So PG&E, as the governor, was quick to say,  because he didn't want anybody to think  the state was turning off the power,  is an investor-owned utility.  It's not run by the state.  It's regulated by the Public Utilities Commission,  but not much.  And you remember two years ago, we had massive fires here.  We were practically smoked out of our building.  They got within six miles of our studio.  I know many friends whose homes were lost,  lives, many lives were lost.  Then a year ago, same thing happened.  The town of Paradise burned to the ground.  85 people lost their lives.  Thousands of homes destroyed.  I think that'd be kind of a wake-up call  to the power company, especially since there was a video  of their transformer exploding  and causing the fire that burned Paradise.  They've been sued and in fact lost billions,  and in January declared bankruptcy because of the lawsuits,  which conveniently meant they had no money  to fix the problem in the first place,  to move lines underground,  to cut brush away from lines,  to do all the things you would wanna do.  So they couldn't.  Now I'm told, I haven't confirmed this,  but I'm told that the state gave them  a hundred million dollars for this,  which they then promptly gave as bonuses  to their directors and executives.  So in other words, they did nothing to prevent this.  So their answer this year, when, by the way,  this is almost exactly the second anniversary  of those fires just north of us.  So it's the same time of year,  it's after a long dry, and you know, Jeff,  you lived in California, a long dry summer.  We don't get rain from April through maybe  next month, November.  So everything's very, very, very dry.  And then around this time of year,  you get high winds and you get low humidity.  So you get a heat, dry winds, low humidity, dry brush.  And their fear is that the wind would blow down a line,  it would spark something, and that would go up like that.  And the problem, the reason people died  in the last two years is because the wind fans those fires  so much that they're like, you know,  when you blow on coals,  and so those fires spread almost instantaneously.  I know people who woke up, smelled smoke,  looked out the window and ran and barely made it.  It was that fast.  So it's terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the system as it stands,  it's if a line goes down,  the disaster could be that much worse and faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So their thinking was,  if we don't have power on those lines,  then they get blown down, there'll be no sparks.  The problem is this is a hard thing to do.  So they were worried because it's red flag fire danger.  And they were expecting high winds, not here.  We had six mile an hour winds and it was very nice.  But up in the hills where I guess there's transmission lines.  Because all, by the way, the funny thing is in the studio,  all this, we're in an office park where there's no brush  and all the wires are underground.  There are no wires.  So it wasn't in the near vicinity,  I guess it's the transmission lines.  Anyway, they cut them.  We were right on the edge.  We could literally have put an extension cord out the door  because across the street, the power was on.  The Roy Rogers down the block, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So next time we should do that,  just get an extension cord.  Just from the cord to Burger King.  Just to Burger King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How big a generator would you need to have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Prohibitively large.  Really, really, really big.  Because we got lights, we got lots of computers.  We couldn't keep it running.  It's just not practicable.  We do have a backup plan.  If this had continued, we would have moved it to my house.  I had power, I'm two miles away.  Oh, I would have liked that.  We would have done the whole show from our house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The old one, the hot tub, it was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it would have been something like that.  And then, but in order to do that,  we would have had to move a bunch of equipment  from the studio, so Russell said it'd take about four hours  to move it and then four hours to move it back.  We were ready to do it.  Had the power been out today, we would have done that.  But what we're gonna do is move more of our workflow  to the cloud, and that will help a little bit  if we have to do this again.  Quality would suffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the enjoyment and joy would increase.  Yes, your rants would sound so much better.  And making fun of you would have been fun.  You could have been barbecuing on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, I could have given you a tour.  You could have, yeah, I would like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, people would have really enjoyed that.  It may yet happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, oh yeah, by the way, we're not out of the woods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We still have time.  It's still October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, thank you for that.  Paris Martino, excellent article on Wired,  why the PG&E blackouts, that's the electric company here,  spared California's big tech HQs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's on Twitter this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we'll be, yeah, we'll be talking with her about that.  There's a couple of reasons.  One, because a lot of these, a lot of big companies  pull their own power, they have their own transmission lines.  But it's also sort of that, like,  they didn't take Petaluma down, the city down, just us.  Like, it also feels like, I don't know,  it felt very selective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it's.  And you also have to be in an area with brush fire,  correct, so like if you don't have a lot of potential brush,  they didn't take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So San Francisco was never at risk because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, I think that's the gist of that story,  is those tech companies are in the middle of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have so much power that they need also  that they have their own.  But Stacey, it may not be whether you're the brush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do have their own lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, what Jeff, where?  Sorry Stacey, it's not so much whether you're,  you as the end user are in the brush,  it's whether the transmission line to you is in the brush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, well, if you're in the brush,  the lines going will go through the brush too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But could the line have been 10 miles away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it is in our case.  There's no brush and our lines are underground.  Okay, yes.  But clearly the transmission lines to us  are up there in the hills.  Right.  Because there was no wind either.  It was, there were none of the conditions that we expected.  By the way, here's from Paris's article,  a map of the outage, that's the blue area.  Here's Tesla's headquarters.  We would be on the inside of the blue area  and the map of our outage.  It was not, I'll tell you, it was only two days.  It felt like a lifetime to me.  It was devastating.  It's never happened before.  That's why we don't have,  I mean, we didn't plan for anything like this.  We never thought this.  You're just so out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got a whole house generator after Sandy.  Yeah, that might be the solution.  Yeah.  And we were 14 days in a Marriott with three rooms.  So it damn near pays for one Sandy.  Right.  It's not cheap.  Yeah.  We've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is, I think maybe the new normal.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Welcome to our cyberpunk future.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of what depressed me is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this doesn't feel like an isolated incident.  I think this is, we're just gonna have to get used to it.  Well, this is infrastructural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And we've had infrastructure weak and nothing's happened.  Yeah.  Yeah, hopefully they can get the infrastructure square.  They don't have any money.  Jeff's power got down.  Little PGSD there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, at one point I just got in bed  and pulled the covers up.  I was like, I don't want to think about this.  Aunt got me out of there though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.  She said, get up.  Power goes off at our house.  We got no toilet.  Yeah, same thing, because we're on a well.  Yeah, same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  All right, that's enough.  Enough of us.  But just kind of, I think people are kind of  wondering what happened.  That's what happened.  And let's hope it doesn't happen again.  And if it does, I was able to stay in communication  using the Jeff's favorite medium, Twitter.  And people were supportive too.  Yeah, people were great on Twitter.  So we tweeted about it.  And we also used, I don't know if you guys know  about our new forums, we used the Twit community  and that was a great place.  So for future reference, twit.community is the website.  And those don't go down because they're not  running out of here.  Nothing of our web presence is running out of the studio.  It's just the production capabilities.  The web presence itself is, they're all on backed up servers  but this is the Twit community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, don't you have the new iPhone?  They showed off all those awesome production capabilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could have done the show on the iPhone.  We were ready to do it using, I think we're gonna use Zoom.  Zoom.  We were ready to do it.  We did a test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a time when we would have been  your backup here at CUNY.  That's right.  What happened to that studio?  We're still there.  You still do it.  Good.  And I note you can hire a new host for one of the podcasts.  Shep Smith is leaving Fox.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just announced.  Wow.  Do you think he was pushed out?  I don't know.  You think AG Barr went to a Rupert Murdoch  and no, that wouldn't happen.  That would be crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, like crazy things aren't happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway, yeah, twit.community, if you sign up,  it's free and it's a good place to get information.  And I put this in the announcements.  And so we were able to keep people up to date  with regular updates here.  So that's another place.  Twitter, or if you're not on Twitter,  you can follow along.  We'll always, this is a great communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh wait, what time does it say we start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was for Windows Weekly yesterday.  I posted that yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always enjoy the proposed start times  at the bottom of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  That was another show.  It wasn't your show.  We were close.  Princess Leia is not happy.  We're only half hour late, Princess Leia.  All right.  I'm all good.  We're gonna get you out of here.  Don't worry.  October 15th, four days hence,  there's gonna be a little Google thing.  I don't know if they will have any surprises.  Not only now do we know everything there  is to know about the phone,  but nine to five Google had a complete,  like a review practically of the new Pixelbook,  which is hysterical.  Like they had it.  They were holding it in their hands.  They might as well have just done a first look.  I don't, do they talk about how they got this?  What is, Jeff, tell me what the rules are  for journalists for this kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are none anymore.  I mean, if you get it from the company  and you sign something that says  we're not gonna release it, that's different.  But I guess if, you know,  but then on the other hand,  you witnessed the great Gawker moment  with the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they got in trouble kind of for that.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I've been-  Gizmodo was the company that got it.  Well, but it was Gawker company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I've been on the receiving end of where  if I purchase something from a company  because I'm a early customer,  I will get my unit before people  who have actual review units go.  That's funny, isn't it?  And this burned me once where people were writing reviews  and I was stuck under embargo still.  And I was pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Was that because they breached their embargo  or because?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Their PR person was just as upset as I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so they did break the embargo then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I guess they said they shipped it out  to, you know, early adopters.  And so then the next time it came around,  I said no to their embargo.  And then I just bought it on my own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't do embargoes and I don't do NDAs.  And that's part of the reason why  I don't wanna be beholden to these guys.  So, and nine to five, Google has,  I mean, look what they've got.  They've got a video of it.  They've got pictures of it.  They're holding it.  That's that weird texture on the back,  kind of a ribbed texture.  It's a temporary logo.  That's not the, eventually that'll be the G logo.  I thought it kind of was nice, but all right.  Well, and that kind of makes this suspicious to me.  Like, well, wait a minute.  It almost looks like the Google Fi thing.  Why is that logo on there?  It does have a keyboard that looks fairly familiar  to people who, the previous Pixelbook,  this is called the Pixelbook Go according to nine to five.  And they even have a video.  This is like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey everyone, this is Stephen Hall with nine to five Google.  And today we have some-  Carson, can you show mom a picture for you?  I'll just cut to the chase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So look, it's kind of little.  When you see in his hands, either this guy has massive hands.  13 inch.  Or it's-  No, he's got a phone in the background.  So yeah.  Oh yeah, it's little.  The hardware right here.  Thanks for watching nine to five Google on YouTube.  Be sure.  Okay, well it was short, but it was good.  So, no, there was more,  but I'm not gonna play the whole thing.  You can go to nine to five Google.  Jeff, is this what you were looking for?  Oh, look, look.  This is a good one.  It says, it says product name.  So this is a manufacturing prototype.  Maybe they didn't want to put the Google logo on it  because they didn't want anybody to know what it was.  See where it says product name on the keyboard,  right above the function keys.  Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It looks like a manufacturer's prototype.  So on Twitter, Jason Falter, a fan of the show said,  I don't think Jeff Jarvis will get his refreshed pixel book  because 16 nine 4K headphone jack,  clamshell that remains upright with no slip bottom.  This will be marketed as the Chromebook to use  for Stadia game playing.  It's all becoming clear now.  What do you think?  Oh, so yeah, let's not forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll probably talk about Stadia on the 15th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll have to.  Go back to the specs.  What was inside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would that be enough to do anything?  Intel Core M3, which is not great,  but it says according to nine to five Google,  again, this is all nine to five Google,  i5 and i7, that's high end.  Eight or 16 gigs of RAM, again, high end.  Up to 256 gigs of storage.  Speakers are on the top front firing,  two megapixel front facing camera,  1080p at 60 frames, who cares?  Titan C chip, that's the secure enclave.  Normal wifi, I guess not wifi six,  normal wifi and Bluetooth.  I don't know what normal means.  13.3 inches, is that a little small for you, Jeff?  Yeah, I think so.  And not unlike the other pixel books,  not three by two, but wide screen.  So that's gaming, that's gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gaming and media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Google's gaming PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two USB-C ports, by the way, if it is for Stadia,  you don't need an i7,  because the processor's not doing anything.  It's not on your machine.  Headphone jack, two colors, just black and not pink.  No fingerprint sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would overwhelm with gamers, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, my pink pixel book.  No fingerprint sensor and no pixel book pen support.  Again, I have to say, who knows the provenance of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not looking like the productivity device, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's making me upset, I think.  I don't know whether I'm supposed to be upset or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, wait, no, there's nothing to be upset about.  Wait till the 15th to be upset, yeah.  Yeah, just wait a few more days.  This could be one of three.  They could have three models they're announcing.  This could be the little one.  You don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could still do something with this  from a productivity standpoint.  It's just you need a larger form factor, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And integrated LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, and LTE.  Well, nobody has that.  So, I mean, virtually nobody has that, so nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, Jeff, but I'm picturing your dream machine right now.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, thank you, Stacey, for dreaming for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe you've said that though in the past,  is you'd like to have that LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have to imagine,  I don't even have to imagine his perfect machine.  Everybody knows it's the Surface Pro, not this one,  the Surface Pro X, the new one,  which has a pen in it, in its little keyboard,  tucked away like a little kangaroo pouch.  Kangaroo cord?  No, it's like a little Joey in a pouch.  Happy kangaroo?  It's...  A Joey.  Sorry, I just wanted to put a...  Joey in the pouch, little Joey in the pouch.  Let me see, it's got an ARM CPU.  It's got LTE.  Here it is.  It's ultra thin, always connected.  Look, don't you imagine yourself using that?  No, actually, I'm glad.  It's three by two.  Is ARM used for Windows now?  Yes, this is a new chip.  It's kind of an interesting chip  that Microsoft announced that is Microsoft designated.  It has the new desktop ARM.  What is that, the CX?  But it also has additional Microsoft-supplied circuitry,  they call it.  Oh, okay.  I think like the H1 or something.  I think this is actually, Jeff,  you should really think about Windows.  How do you feel about Windows, Jeff?  Nuh-uh.  It's got dark mode, I hear you like that a lot.  Ooh, Niagara Falls!  Slowly I turned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So just because it's running Windows,  it wouldn't work for you, essentially?  Because it's got everything else you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  SQ1 processor, all-day battery life, LTE.  Lightweight?  Lightweight, three by two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I can't put it in my lap, that's a problem.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a real problem.  It's not lappable.  Is that 10 or 10X?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the Surface Pro 10X.  10X, okay.  So this was what they announced last week,  and there's a whole bunch of stuff.  You can watch Ant and Micah and their...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are those, are those mice?  Go scroll down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, those are the new, no, no,  these are the new earbuds.  Those are mice, I've seen these before.  Those are mice?  These fold up.  I've never seen those.  Oh, yeah, these are cool, they fold up.  But these are the new earbuds that have,  they look like gauges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those mice are perfect for mere mortals, not for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't like those mice at all.  I have a funky mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Way too small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Funny thing is I used the old Microsoft Intellimouse.  I bought like a dozen of them.  Yikes.  They're great mice, they're wired.  Love them.  I'll stick with this big ol' Logitech.  Oh yeah, Logitech's are pretty good,  but I'm a lefty, see, I can't use those,  because they're contour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a Evoluit?  It's a vertical mouse, so mine's funky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, those are nice.  You have a vertical mouse?  I've used vertical mice a time or two,  and they were nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, I want to take a break,  and then we come back, we're, oh, that's so weird.  It is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's awesome, it's perfectly ergonomic.  It actually feels natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it roll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you move it?  Does it roll?  It's like this.  It's not a track pad, okay.  Oh, I gotta get one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really does feel nice.  You like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it, I've had this mouse,  well, I've had variations of this mouse  for like 10 years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey really is Princess Leia,  she's living in the future.  Or a long time ago in a galaxy far, far, far away.  Here's one.  Wait a minute, you have one?

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the editors have one, and I didn't even know.  So, Charlie, I own a ton of them.  Oh, I know why I don't know.  I'm a lefty.  They make them for lefties.  Do they?  They're nice, they're ergonomic.  Is yours from Anchor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, their Anchor makes them too, mine's Evol.  Wait a minute, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said Anchor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry.  Anchor?  Okay, I have a friend named Anchor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a friend named Yonker,  but I don't call it a Yonker.  Okay.  Anchor.  Anchor.  No, you know what, it's Chinese.  For all we know, it's Anchor.  No idea.  No one knows how it's pronounced.  No idea.  They don't come over and tell us how to say it,  they just assume.  It's probably called Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever I see that name, it's not even how he spells it,  but that's my brain.  Do all the editors use these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it better?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No carpal tunnel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It definitely feels better that way.  I've used these before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who makes yours, Stacey?  Is really natural.  Evoluent.  Evoluent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which I have, it's pricey, but I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course it's pricey.  Oh yeah, vertical mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing but the best for you, Stacey.  Nothing but the best.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had carpal tunnel so bad that I couldn't,  I couldn't squeeze my hands together.  I lost like 80% of strength in my hands, my grip strength.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Says do more with fewer movements.  Yeah.  It's my life.  Because you have only so many movements.  I have limited movements.  All right, I want to take a break.  You don't want to use up your movements.  Because this is a Chinese company  and I want to talk about,  I think the most important tech story of the week.  And I know we're going to get into it on this one.  This will be a little bit of a kind  of a philosophical discussion.  Oh boy, clear your throats folks.  So get ready.  And I'm, no, you know what?  I've been waiting all week to hear what Jeff  and Stacey and Ann have to say about this.  Cause I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So.  It's dark mode, I can tell you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.  I can also tell you how Jeff feels about dark mode.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you,  yes we all can, I believe.  Our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology  and their amazing advanced technology center, the ATC.  They built this,  they started building this 10 years ago.  And thank goodness they did  because all of the testing labs, the magazines and stuff,  they've all gone away.  But Worldwide Technology, over the last 10 years,  has built this amazing test center.  Half a billion dollars worth  of enterprise equipment in there.  There's no other testing and research lab  like it in the world.  Hundreds of OEMs.  And because Worldwide Technology is a partner  for businesses that are installing this,  all the OEMs have stepped forward and said,  yes, here's set up NetApp and Cisco and VMware.  Even the little guys, Tanium, Equinix, Expansor,  it's all in there.  And this is what the engineers at Worldwide Technology use,  to test integration, to kind of simulate your environment  so that they know how it's gonna work  with your environment.  But here's the amazing thing.  You can do it too.  The ATC is an innovator delight.  It's an incubator that offers you on-demand,  you, not just their engineers,  but you, on-demand and schedulable labs,  things like NetApp's Cloud Volumes on tap,  or on tap on Flash,  or NetApp Disaster Recovery as a Service.  So if you're in the market and you wanna integrate this,  you can try it with your setup in the lab,  virtually even 24-7, anywhere in the world.  You don't have to come to St. Louis to do it.  Hundreds of other labs there,  representing the newest advances in Flash storage,  multi-cloud homing, hyper-converged infrastructure,  cloud data management.  It's a way to learn about products before you launch them,  to use their sandbox to test it  before you actually put it in the wild.  It reduces time from concept to implementation  from months to weeks.  If this is incredible, they call it lab as a service,  and it is a dedicated space within the ATC  where you can perform programmatic testing  using this incredible ecosystem WWT has built over the years.  It is, I think, so neat,  and we've been talking about this all summer.  It's finally here.  They've launched the platform.  The ecosystem, the ATC ecosystem,  creates a multiplier effect of knowledge, speed,  and agility anytime, anywhere around the world for you,  for their customers.  You can get access not just to the labs,  to the gear, to tests,  but you can also get articles, case studies.  So many tools to make a difference in today's fast-paced world.  You want to know more about the ATC at World Wide Technology?  You could sign up for access right now  to their new on-demand lab platform.  Go to the website, www.wt.com slash twit.  www.wt.com slash twit.  WWT simplifies the complex.  www.wt.com slash twit.  We thank you so much for going there,  letting them know you heard it here,  and of course we thank World Wide Technology  for their support.  World Wide Technology,  delivering business and technology outcomes around the world.  We're working on a trip to St. Louis.  Would you like to go to St. Louis?  Sure.  I want to go to St. Louis.  I am ready to go there.  We're going to have a trip to visit.  I know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Steak and Shake too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're working on a visit to the ATC.  We'll let you know about that sometime next year.  China.  This topic is China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And...  One, just, I would just like to offer  a traditional Chinese blessing before we start.  May you live in interesting times.  Zizhou Shi, Hong Kong Ming, Hong Ying Jun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't say that.  You're going to get us in trouble.  I heard the word Hong Kong in there.  We're going to get banned all over the world.  Eh, woo woo.  And what does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just something I picked up in my Chinese class  Yeah.  Yeah, very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know you studied Chinese.  Yeah.  I know May Guo is America.  I heard Hong Kong in there.  So I worried about what this content was.  All I know is Ni Hao.  Ni Hao is very good.  Hao Hao, Zhong Hao.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Shi Shi.  Thank you.  That's it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple,  Google,  both pulled apps from the app store,  protest apps after China complained.  These are apps used apparently by Hong Kong protesters.  Apple's memo or Tim Cook's memo or letter  to the Apple employers, employees,  said we did it because it was being used to target police.  That is not the case, according to Apple blogger,  John Gruber, who quotes Maciej Ceglowski.  Maciej, who is a software developer in San Francisco  and created Pinboard and is a really smart guy.  His blog is Idle Words.  He has been in Hong Kong all this time  for the last few months reporting on his experience,  not as a reporter, not as a protester, but as a citizen.  Really very good on the ground reporting  of what's going on in Hong Kong.  And according to Maciej, who was there on the ground,  he said those apps are not used to target police.  They show where police are grouped  to warn people to stay away from there.  Away from police?  Yes.  He says,  Tim Cook's assertion that we had to take it  because we don't wanna have an app in our app store  that endangers police, which of course you wouldn't.  Is really just repeating the propaganda  from the Chinese government.  The NBA, I mean, it goes beyond tech, the NBA,  walking on eggshells with the Chinese government.  Blizzard.  Blizzard.  And by the way, it's hurt both the NBA and Blizzard.  Blizzard particularly, a lot of gamers  have stopped playing World of Warcraft and other games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And note, well, one of the revenge tactics  against Blizzard is to file GDPR complaints  because you have to answer them.  So people are using GDPR as a weapon against Blizzard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they are using May, the Overwatch character  who is Chinese as a symbol for Hong Kong,  Hong Kong's revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you follow Maciej on Twitter,  his Pinboard account, at Pinboard,  he has written a post which talks about Tim Cook's letter  in which Tim says the app was being used maliciously  to target individual officers for violence  and to victimize individuals and property  where no police are present.  He says that is not the case.  That's Chinese government propaganda.  Even John Gruber, who is normally quite an Apple fan,  says, I cannot recall an Apple memo or statement  that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny for a company.  That usually measures, yeah, for Gruber to say this,  that usually measures umpteen times before cutting anything.  It's both sad and startling.  My, by the way, apparently, according to New York Times  today, the Chinese government realizes  perhaps it overstepped and is trying to damp down  attacks on the NBA.  Remember, they blocked NBA games from Chinese television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This could lead, as strange as this sounds,  and I don't know if it's gonna sound like a tech determinist,  I'm not, in a way it could lead to revolution  in the sense that you take away people,  if people don't know what's going on,  suddenly they lost the NBA, they have to ask why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My question is, what does Apple gain or lose  in this scenario for them to have these actions?  They gain 1.4 billion customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They continue to access the Chinese market,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is important to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even Google, which isn't really a presence  in the Chinese market, has also pulled these apps  for its Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That seems odd to me in a way  because they don't have a presence.  I think Apple always stands up as,  we're the virtuous one, they're all bad.  Well, remember that, folks.  But Google doesn't really,  they've already been the virtuous one and left China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, and this is a much broader topic.  And this is, you remember the whole clash  of civilizations thing in terms of East-West, that sort.  I think what's happening is,  I don't even really wanna talk about this  because it's so hard to talk about rationally.  We have different values and beliefs.  And if you read a lot of stuff from Chinese Americans  or even Chinese people who are familiar with America,  there's very much a gap in how we view the world  and what we value and what many of them value.  And not necessarily like, hey, yo,  I love people being injured.  I love the bad things, but they're,  this sounds so stupid.  Not further down the Maslow's hierarchy of needs,  but when they look at government failures,  they're much closer to it and much further away  from kind of the enlightenment ideals that we seem to have.  And if you look at the world from that perspective,  you see why much of the Chinese citizenry  is okay with where they're at.  It's not awesome.  And when things get bad, they rise up  and the government does pay attention eventually.  Is it the best form?  No.  Is it necessarily foreign and anathema  to most people in the West?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say, I love Chinese culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Chinese culture and I think the world of it.  I understand what you're saying,  which is we shouldn't judge them on our cultural biases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These companies have to take a view that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the question.  Does the company, if it's an American company,  if it's the NBA or Apple or Google,  American companies who thrived under American values,  but they want to go into other markets  where those values are not honored in the same way,  what do they do?  They say, we're just gonna honor the laws  of the local society, whatever they are,  or do we believe in American values to the point  where we either stay out of that market or whatever?  We take the consequences of not-  Well, yeah, go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I argue with the premise here?  Because Stacey, I've heard that argument a lot over the years  and I don't buy it for a few reasons.  One, I don't think we have a proper sample.  We have a nation that lives under authoritarian rule,  has for many decades, does not have free flow of information,  is scared of saying what they want,  has a government that employs thousands  and millions of people who do nothing  but censor their speech and put out disinformation.  We have an educational system that's built around that.  I don't think there's any reasonable, reliable way  to say this is what the Chinese people think, number one.  Number two is I think that Hong Kong gives lie to that view,  because even though, yes, it's from different roots  and it has different rules  and there's the British history and all that,  it still is closely associated with China  and they're not taking it, dammit, they're not taking it.  I think Hong Kong is a perfect example of this playing out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this cultural dichotomy, it's not even a dichotomy,  it's a battle that is coming into conflict.  Basically, I'm doing the same reading,  I'm talking to people who are from China,  but again, my sample size is admittedly small  and the places I read are,  I'm not living there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So just to be clear, are you saying we shouldn't judge China  by our own standards, they need to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm saying that it's complicated  and ideally we will do things as tech companies  to avoid absolute moral harm, right?  So do you want to be part of rounding up,  and I cannot say the population name, the Muslim?  Wee-gers. Wee-gers?  Wee-ger.  So do you want to be part of that?  And if you don't, you want to draw a moral line there  and say that we don't want to do business because of that,  I think you actually have to question whether or not  you want to do business here with the Trump administration  and what they're doing with immigrants, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting point.  I think there are one-  You can't pull out of every market, it goes both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, so I think you have to,  I don't think it's as easy as saying  I don't want to work with the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what's happening in the United States  is comparable to what's happening in China.  Here's my concern about this,  and this has to do with this notion of,  and it's the same thing's happening in Europe  where there's a debate over whether European values  can be enforced on the rest of the world.  I worry that China,  because its strong arm tactics seem to work,  is going to be emboldened by this.  I was told a year ago, somebody said,  look, I live in China, you don't understand it.  What you don't understand is China's ambitions in China  are different than its global ambitions.  It needs to keep its population under control,  but its global ambitions are not world domination  in the old traditional communist way.  It's maybe economic domination,  or at least economic parody.  But I don't know if that's the case.  I think maybe it looks like the government under Xi  is more interested in promoting  that old-style communist notion.  They certainly want to enforce their values  on our companies, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the NBA, General Manager of the Houston Rockets  tweets in support of the Hong Kong protesters,  and China is up in arms and says,  we're not going to run any more NBA games on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you call that enforcement of values,  or would you call that enforcement  of authoritarian propaganda?  That's what I'm saying.  That's not values.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they react so strongly because our values  are almost the polar opposite of theirs.  We believe in individual rights.  We're very much almost to a fault,  very individualistic versus a collective.  That's true.  And their entire society is built around the collective.  And a lot of our issues actually right now as a society  stem from us being probably more individualistic  than collective.  Yes.  So when we come in, we're both being arrogant,  and we have this history of that,  not necessarily as Americans, although a little,  but even as people from the West coming over there.  And we're also, and Hong Kong's a special place  because it was the British protectorate for so long.  And that's where this is like a crucible  for exactly what we're talking about,  which is why it's so interesting  and why we're geared to say,  well, heck yeah, we're pro Hong Kong.  That makes sense to us.  These are people like us with values  that are closer to ours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The old saying about Hong Kong, one country, two systems.  This was what the Chinese government said we were gonna do.  We're gonna keep Hong Kong autonomous.  That seems to be breaking down at this point.  So that's where the trouble is.  Look at Taiwan as well.  Yeah.  Well, look at Apple.  Apple pulled a Taiwanese flag  from the emoji keyboard in Hong Kong.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have Chinese students and I find,  and again, very small sample sale.  I have sample sale.  Sample.  Sample size.  Sample size, thank you.  And I have far fewer Chinese students  than most other universities have.  We don't have many here.  But I've witnessed a couple of things.  One, I've seen people,  maybe there's three different models  and I don't know which one is true.  And my only point here is I don't think we can judge truth  out of China because we can't hear people  in their unalloyed speech.  Some people say the system is bad.  Some people say I don't wanna say anything  because I don't know who's watching.  Some people say system is good.  And this is of your Chinese sample that you have.  We have no way to know.  No way whatsoever.  So I don't think we can judge either way  in fairness to your view.  But I certainly am not gonna,  I still think that what we do know  is it's an authoritarian regime  that tries to control people's speech and thought  and treats various minorities terribly.  And that I do think to go back to Leo's original question  is when in doubt, follow your own values.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, what is the responsibility of tech companies?  Here, by the way, let me give you,  so Google did was not quite so clear cut.  Google pulled a game called The Revolution of Our Times.  This is what the game developer's own description says.  Hong Kong was once a prosperous city  protected by rule of law,  but Carrie Lam, who's the current,  I don't know, chief, government chief in Hong Kong,  I can't remember the title she uses,  has single-handedly destroyed everything  by trying to pass a very controversial extradition bill  while ignoring the wishes  of more than two million Hong Kong people.  She has tried to subdue the protest  by deploying tear gas and allowing police brutality,  but the people of Hong Kong have shown the world  their unyielding determination  by swinging their fists against bullets.  She's tried to sway public opinion  by deliberately allowing the enraged protesters  to vent their fury in the legislative council,  but the people of Hong Kong have stayed united.  Now, some might say that's actually a factual description.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was gonna say, is it coming off as defamation or fact?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty accurate, but Google's point is that  it's against the rules in the Play Store  to capitalize on sensitive events.  This is the actual wording,  such as attempting to make money  from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game,  and that's the clause they invoke when they pulled it,  which seems to me actually to be about right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you could argue, is that a political,  like is a protest type thing,  does that fall under the same thing  as like creating a game after Sandy Hook  where you go shoot things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if they didn't charge for it,  would it still come down?  No, because you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if they put up for free?  For free, apparently that would be okay.  The game is free but has in-app purchases.  If they took those out, apparently that,  well, let's see, let's do it,  and let's see what Google's response is.  Because honestly, both Apple and Google  are looking for loopholes.  They're looking for ways to do what their Chinese masters  want them to do,  but make it appear to be according to their rules.  Yes, masters.  What do you mean to say masters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's markets.  They have access to markets,  and they want access to those markets,  and they want money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you why I say masters.  I think it's immoral and unconscionable for a company  that survives and made its way  thanks to the American way of life  to tolerate that kind of behavior  and to count out that kind of behavior  just because you want to make money in that country.  It is not okay.  That's our biggest export.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our biggest export is unbridled.  Unbridled capitalism,  and they are performing it very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You hate America, so maybe you don't like, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are the worst of capitalism.  They are amoral capitalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I honestly think we have higher values than that.  Maybe we don't always live up to them.  Maybe we're not currently living up to them,  but I think that does not mean  we shouldn't attempt to live up to them,  and I think that our value is not make money at all costs.  That is not an American value.  You're saying it is, Stacey.  I think that is an American value.  Look at how we've treated our environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look how we treat poor people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm saying you hate America, so that's what you think.  I think we should have a higher standard.  Maybe we don't live up to it.  I agree with you that many is the time we have failed,  but I think it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But isn't it a bit hypocritical to call them to action  for behaving this way  and being incredibly capitalistic towards China  when we allow the same sort of thing at home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We shouldn't allow it at home either.  The unpopular American way is survival of the fittest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what you're saying is it's okay to make money in China  because that's what we do anyway.  We rape the environment and we take advantage...  I'm just saying there's not a moral...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are moral areas here,  but it's silly to expect a corporate, like a company,  to behave in a moral fashion when profits are at stake.  It's all about profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google pulled out of China  when it was being asked to do things that would cost lives.  They used to not want to be evil,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but we cannot look at Google today  and say that they are still that same company.  Well, that's why I'm criticizing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo sent a man to jail to stay in the company,  in the country, and got roundly condemned for it  as well they should have.  Yahoo.  Yeah, Yahoo.  So I think we've got an axis here.  I think Leo and I are on one.  Ant, have you fully put your...  All right, yeah, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's been staying well away from this.  I don't blame him.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I do agree with Ms. Stacey on a point far as just the...  When you say it that way.  The way that the...  I was only in China for a very short amount of time.  It wasn't Hong Kong,  but one of the things that I took away from my visit  was it seems like the people were seriously patriotic  about where they were.  And I'm not talking about just the haves.  I'm also talking about the have-nots.  I'm walking the streets and just,  you just felt this sense of pride.  I don't care where I was,  but you felt an insane amount of pride  about where these people were  and where they come from and their heritage.  And it blew me away because I don't get that  when I walk the streets here.  I get a lot of people fussing and complaining  about what Google is doing, what Apple is doing,  what the IRS is doing and so on and so forth.  But walking those streets of China,  it was totally different.  There was smiles and it's totally different.  Even though they couldn't check out  what was going on on YouTube  and they couldn't check out Facebook or what have you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but they were just all in.  But when you have people in China and Hong Kong  fighting for their liberties and lives  and you decide it's wrong to tweet in support of them  and you, as the Houston Rockets did,  or the NBA did, and you pull it down, is that okay?  No, it's not okay.  Well, bless your heart.  Well, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's think about something like this.  Not okay.  I'll spend the J-curve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, Carson's saying something important, I guess.  There, China.  What's the J-curve, Mr. Harvard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The J-curve is an economic construct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know it is, but go ahead, tell us what it is.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, when you go-  Oh, bless your heart.  When you go from totalitarianism to democracy,  there's a curve.  It looks like a J.  Basically, you go through a period of horrible instability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, and China has absolutely done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they are trying their best to get out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a slump before you can climb out of the trough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have been, for the past 100 years,  trying to spend their way out of this trough of the J-curve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, have done very well.  I'm not criticizing what China wants to do or whatever,  but I think for an American company,  to listen to the Chinese government's restraint  on its free speech or its way of doing business  is a huge mistake.  Because I think what you get as a result  is an emboldened Chinese government.  And that is about a lot more than climbing out of the J-curve.  I completely understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what Stacey's talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, she's saying we shouldn't judge them with our values.  And then she hates America,  so she's saying our values aren't so good either.  Does not hate America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but I like to say it.  We need a certain amount-  Princess Leia hates America, doesn't she?  We need a certain amount of totalitarianism  to get us through this period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's their rationale, and that may even be true.  But why should we as America support that  by curtailing free speech in America?  Why should it come to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So why shouldn't they be able to support it  if they are an international company?  And we can't argue that-  Because it's greed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's say this.  Let's try this scenario.  If you're a Hong Kong protester,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how do you feel when you hear this country  you're protesting again  with all the military might in the world  amassing tanks across the river from you,  says to the NBA in the United States,  which for whatever you think  is still the beacon of liberty in this world,  and says this massive power says,  you better not say anything bad about us.  Better not say anything in support of those protesters.  And this American institution,  even though basketball was invented in Canada,  this American institution goes,  oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to offend.  Screw those protesters, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have to like it, but I felt-  Well, I'm just saying I don't like it.  Wait, wait, wait, hold on.  When Google let Andy Rubin go  with the $90 million payout after-  I don't like that either.  I didn't like that either.  I didn't like that, but you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he got even more money recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me, Stacey, let me try to answer this question.  Well, I haven't finished the sentence.  What? I wanna know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not something I can personally do anything about.  I understand from a stockholders perspective  why it happened, and the outcry against it  and drawing attention to it is what people can do.  And here-  Well, that's what I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have to say, oh, oh, stock shareholder value.  I'm sorry, Google, I'm sorry, Apple,  I'm sorry, NBA, stockholder value.  You're absolutely right.  I can be upset about it.  This is what our job is.  We're journalists, we're commentators.  It's okay for us to say that's not okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and I agree that it's not okay.  But I also understand that we don't have,  I mean, I understand why Google's doing it.  I'm trying to understand why-  Oh, I do too.  In China, why China's the way it is,  and I don't think that's the function-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand that too.  They're trying to, I think Carson's not wrong.  They're trying to dig their way out of the Jake curve,  which they've been trying to do for 45, no, since 1945.  How many-  I don't want to interrupt Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can I raise my hand?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Two points.  One, Stacey, one answer to the question, I think,  is let's say that the NBA hangs tough, China hangs tough,  suddenly no basketball in China.  That could have an impact.  It's like Western television had an impact  in East Berlin, right?  It could have an impact to the country that,  yes, it's our values, but we believe in those values.  And maybe it's imperialistic to think this way,  but freedom, I believe in freedom.  And if we can help freedom in China,  I would call that a good cause.  That's point one.  Point two is let's take,  China is this mysterious culture we don't understand,  so we shouldn't talk about it this way.  So substitute another culture  that I think is doing heinous things,  like Saudi Arabia chopping up a journalist.  So, you know, if the same arguments were made there,  say, well, but Google's got to make money,  and Apple's got to make money,  and the NBA's got to make money,  and they're going to be in Saudi Arabia.  I would be screaming my head off about those companies  and telling them to saw off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, you should be,  because the Saudi Arabia Sovereign Fund  is a massive investor in many of the unicorns  at Silicon Valley.  Most of the money that's coming out,  that's running Uber and other companies  is from Saudi Arabia.  You bet, yikes.  That's an issue we have a problem with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So are you boycotting those companies, Jeff?  I know you're screaming, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, hey, it's just the mic's loud.  Stop getting excited.  Don't scream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I-  I'm screaming.  Those are the words used.  I said, you know, I would be screaming.  So I'm like, I'm-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see, okay.  I got you, well played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'll put it this, I'll say this.  I was involved recently with somebody  who was looking for money and for a company,  and they were thinking of going to Saudi Arabia,  and I said, please don't.  My opinion mattered, but I stood and said,  I think that's the wrong thing to do.  That's as far as I go.  Now, should those companies be boycotted  because they got money before Khashoggi was murdered?  Well, Saudi Arabia was doing bad things before that.  But now if they took money from Saudi Arabia,  after that, yeah, I'd have a bit of a fit.  But I also heard somebody else-  So you're not into real politics, basically.  I heard somebody else who took money from Saudi Arabia  and justified it saying, I'm using it for my ends.  I've got no strings.  I used it.  Then you go to MIT and Epstein money.  You know, it's, yeah, there's everything in life  that has some kind of moral decision,  which I think is what Leo is saying,  and we can come to different decisions about it.  It just so happens we agree this time.  Which I want in the history books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I struggle with this because I struggle  with the whole world political stuff  because I spend most of my time thinking  about what's happening in my backyard.  And this story with China, it is very serious,  but I can't personally wrap my head around it,  especially when we go outside and see all the homeless  and issues outside and the PG and E.  I mean, we have so many political  and corporate issues right here in our backyard.  And I'm thinking, why not we just clean our backyard  up first before hopping over-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But does that mean we don't, Ant,  does that mean we don't, though, still deal with these?  We can't, that's not a license to say,  well, go ahead and support China.  It's maybe all the more reasons to say  that we have to question ourselves with a return.  Here's my thought on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I've said this before, I'll say it again.  This country was born on some values, some real values.  And I don't think that's mythology, I think that's true.  I agree.  And it's because the people who were in this country  came here from other countries to a flee discrimination.  Now, admittedly, we are also found on slavery,  so there's other issues.  We're not perfect, but I think that the foundational documents  and the foundational ideas of this country  are something to be celebrated.  And as a result, it's become a country people come to  because they believe in that and they wanna live that.  Do we live up to it?  Absolutely not.  We don't.  I still believe in the American dream and opportunity.  If you ever hope to live up to the American dream  and the dream as proposed by our founding documents,  our founding fathers and those ideals,  you gotta keep those firmly in front of you  so you have a pole star to steer towards.  Are we perfect?  Far from it.  We never have been.  And there are many things we need to work on,  but I think we all agree, we should, I hope,  maybe we don't, all agree on the notion of life,  liberty, the pursuit of happiness.  I mean, there are certain things that are foundational,  and until we can all say, yes, that's our goal,  we'll never solve these problems.  And part of the reason we're having trouble  solving problems right now is there seems to be  this real fragmentation of what our hopes and fears are  for this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's because we haven't answered some of that.  We came here, sure, in the pursuit of a specific type  of religious freedom, which was actually intolerant  to Quakers and to other religions, Catholics.  And in the process, we also demonized an entire nation  of people who were already living here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the indigenous people got slaughtered,  and then we brought in people from Africa  to do our dirty work.  So yes, there's all sorts of examples of how it's failed,  but that doesn't mean we're never gonna succeed  unless we have a set of ideals that we're aiming for, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but those ideals never match up  against the practical realities.  No, because we're human.  So do we stop trying?  Well, no, we shouldn't stop trying,  but we also, when Apple pulls this stuff,  or when Google pulls this stuff in response to China,  it makes sense.  I'm not outraged, I'm not surprised.  I'm like, oh, this is what's gonna happen,  because that is the American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes sense to you where I'm sort of indifferent.  I'm indifferent on it when this stuff happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what you're saying, Stacey,  is instead of freedom, equality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, those are not our values.  That's what we say our values are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our values are.  But you're saying, all right, so I give up,  let's make our values be as make as much money as possible.  Let's be a Adam Smith free market,  a capitalist economy.  I don't think that's. I'm not saying that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying we have to recognize that we say this,  but this is what we do.  We are capitalists. Well, yes, we're human beings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when we try to do better,  you say, well, don't bother, because.  We're not trying to do better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're asking China and Apple to do better.  We're not trying to do better.  We're just asking these other companies to do better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's part of doing better,  not supporting autocratic dictators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you know I'm not trying to do better?  I'm trying to do better.  Okay, well, good.  Notice we're talking about this,  even if China pulls our podcasts from.  I mean, I don't know why,  how you would say we're not trying to do this.  I don't exploit our employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That good.  Right, Karsten? Right, Karsten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I might mock them.  Somebody out, Ty Karsten.  Oh, sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should I question?  Hold on, he can't speak yet.  His hands are chained to the oars.  He can't. Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't say anything right now.  I appreciate that.  Okay, yes, that is true.  And I think it's hard to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could fire me at any moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it is an at-will state.  Don't forget it.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's easy to say that we're aspiring to these values.  It's hard to do.  And when those values.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All I'm saying is let's try to live up to them.  Are you saying let's just not even try?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think Google most of the time tries,  but when push comes to shove.  She's saying that they do try.  It gets real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've just given up, Stacey.  Go for this.  You've given up.  Let me ask you, have you given up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not giving up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Being a nihilist is giving up.  It's getting real.  No, that's called nihilism.  So let me try to say it the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that Siva Vadianathan says it.  So I think Siva right now would agree with Stacey.  I love Siva.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If he says it, I agree with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, Siva and I disagree with everything,  but I love him.  Siva, Stacey, the way Siva argues with me  about this exact point,  what he says is Jarvis,  you're expecting too much of a company to be virtuous.  A company is a company.  That's what it is.  That's it.  That's it.  I'm not agreeing.  So is that what you're saying?  Kind of like we're expecting too much of Apple?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.  I want to expect more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've got, yes, these are organizations  that are built upon a profit-seeking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then what is our remedy if we feel like they're,  like Amazon misusing-  Individuals should have communism.  What is that?  So what is our remedy if Amazon mistreats its employees?  What is our remedy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not to buy from Amazon.  There are people who do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right.  Okay.  So you're on a tech network.  It's so difficult.  So, okay, you're on a tech network  where we talk all the time about buying Apple, Google  products.  We don't talk much about the NBA.  We talk about a lot of tech products.  I think this is an appropriate discussion at this point  because I think people who are listening  and me too should decide, for instance,  would you buy the new Essential Phone from Andy Rubin?  No.  You wouldn't, would you?  No, I wouldn't either.  But-  Should we cover it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should, but you should also point out  what Andy's history is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  It's easy for me to say I won't buy it  because it's stupid.  If it were a really great phone,  I admit I did buy the first Essential Phone.  Have you seen this phone?  So did you.  You didn't know everything then.  You didn't know anything then.  I didn't know about the $90 million.  I didn't know what the financing was of the Essential Phone.  And when I found out what it was,  I gave it to the priest for exorcism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think about what you did with Joy Ito from MIT.  I mean, you asked the questions  because we found things out and didn't he not come on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He canceled, and it wasn't my interview.  Had it been my interview,  I would have of course asked him all the hard questions.  But it wasn't my interview.  It was Denise Howell's interview.  So what I did, not wanting to have a heavy hand  on our distinguished journalists,  is said, Denise, I think you have to bring this up,  but it's up to you.  Normally we don't do confrontational interviews.  We're not 60 minutes.  But I think if Joy Ito comes on,  and by the way, this was before the full depth  of his behavior and his resignation.  Yeah, it had just come out.  But I said, Denise, you have to bring this up, I think.  It's up to you.  Had it been me, I would have.  It's, look, I'm by the way,  I'm being intentionally contentious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I know.  I completely understand what you're saying, Stacey.  Yeah.  I like, when you said you hate America, I got that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I overdid it a little bit.  So, but that's why I wanted to bring this here.  Cause I think this is a really difficult problem.  And it's, this week was the week where a bunch of companies  said, okay, China, whatever you say.  But you're right, Stacey,  we can't expect a corporation to be human.  Or can we?  I mean, Tim, here's my problem.  Tim Cook acts like he's got a big heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the thing.  He's selling something.  He has to act like that.  That's his, but I would, so here, let me broaden this  or bring this back to the New York Times reporting  on company or an ICE agents using technology  to actually find people in my neck of the woods.  I don't know if you read that story.  But that's the sort of thing that is close to home,  has incredible ramifications.  And it's very similar in the sense that,  so rather than spend all this time and energy on China,  which we are, you should ask the same thing.  Is it still moral to have tech companies?  Cause there's a lot of pressure right now  for people to quit their jobs.  If they work for a corporation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Haven't we been talking about this practically ad nauseum  on this show?  Am I not the guy who says, destroy Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't been on all the episodes lately.  I've been saying a lot of negatives

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about technology companies lately.  Amazon, Google, Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is specifically their role  in what is a political system that people don't agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, no, we've talked about that.  We've talked about the right of Google's intellectual,  knowledge workers to say, we don't wanna design stuff  for the military.  We've talked about that.  No, I think this is, and by the way,  I came down in agreement that Amazon,  with Jeff Bezos' contention is, we're an American company.  So we think it's appropriate to make technology  for the American military.  I actually support, I thought, yeah, you're right.  I see nothing wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you disagree with him, if he, like,  I also respect the right to disagree, yes.  Right.  But what we're doing here with China is,  they clearly disagree with our values.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's our, the question is,  are they our values or are we changing our values  to make more money in China?  I don't like that when I hear that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And see the cynic amnesis,  that's exactly what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess so.  I mean. Well, Google's left China.  Yeah, Google, I thought.  And you just said a minute ago that Google's stand  on this case for somebody making money out of.  It's not so bad.  Not so bad. It's not so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  How about, so, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought, Leo, when you were gonna go  into contentious territory,  I thought where you were gonna go  was Facebook and political ads.  There's another one.  Because they're in the same place there  where Facebook, on the one hand, says,  we have standards of behavior, community standards,  for all of our users now, except politicians.  Now, there's an argument in favor of free speech,  political speech, we know what's happening.  Facebook's not the arbiter of truth,  and so on and so forth.  I can make all those arguments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I liked Casey Newton's take on this.  Did you read Casey's Facebook?  No.  I'm sorry, Verge article about the Facebook.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I did the Verge one, yes.  Yeah.  He's pointing out,  let me see if I can find it,  that in the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Funny, I don't see bylines sometimes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um,  he, basically what he's saying is  it's the same as broadcast media.  Although a number of people turned down  the Trump campaign's most recent ad.  No, only CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the only thing with the New York Times story.  The New York Times story focused on Facebook  left this ad up.  When Twitter left it up, YouTube left it up,  I was on MSNBC to discuss this,  and before he went on the air,  Steph Rule said, she's talking through to her control room,  saying, we ran this ad.  Yeah, I saw the ad on MSNBC, yeah.  We've got to say that.  And Dylan Byers came on and said,  the weird thing about this story is the New York Times,  because they were focusing on Facebook,  when everybody else ran the ad,  the story here is that CNN is the only place  that took it down, because it attacked CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's what Casey says,  certainly it would be nice if politicians  stuck to the truth in their campaign advertising.  And we do live in a nation that has truth  in advertising laws enforced by the  Federal Trade Commission.  But like Facebook, the FTC also declines to weigh in  on the truth of political advertising.  And in a case earlier this decade,  where a state attempted to mandate truth  in political advertising, the law was struck down  by a federal judge saying, we do not want the government,  in this case, the Ohio Elections Commission,  to decide what is political truth  for fear that the government might persecute  those who criticize it.  In the democracy, voters should decide.  Now, admittedly, government is different than Facebook.  But I think that's an interesting point.  I think what Facebook is saying-  Well, there are plenty of government

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who are trying to mandate,  who are trying to argue that there should be  a government mandate that Facebook should take down  things that are false, in which case, then,  it's not different.  Right, it's an aging government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook's approach to this problem, writes Newton,  has been to make political ads public  so that researchers, journalists, and curious citizens  can investigate the content of those ads themselves  and then have a free debate over the merits  often on the platform.  In fact, I would submit Facebook is better suited to that  than MSNBC or any broadcast network.  There's no like, well, here's more information  about these claims that you can put on an ad  on a broadcast network, but Facebook can.  So, in this case, this is a hard one,  and I think Facebook-  It's a tough one.  It's a tough one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, on the brief segment on MSNBC,  I defended, along with Dylan Byers,  Facebook, in this case, saying we don't want them  to be the Ministry of Truth, it's a bad role,  it's political speech, we want political speech  to limit political speech as a dangerous thing,  and so on and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but if the Nazi party comes on and says-  Well, I saw it, yes.  I mean, there are limits, right,  to what lies you can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, well, here's the other level.  I also, if it had gone on longer,  which it never does on TV, unlike us-  We go on and on and on.  You get the chance to add, I think that Facebook  does have community standards, it does say certain things  are unacceptable from its users and citizens.  It should bring those same standards.  Now, the truth is not the standard,  but bullying, racism, and hate, and things like that,  that they wouldn't allow from a user,  they shouldn't take in an ad, in my view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand why truth wouldn't be a standard.  Because-  Who judges the truth?  Here's my smart-ass boost

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that I finally came up with on the air.  If truth were so easy, we wouldn't need  millions of journalists to go get it.  Truth is not an easy standard.  It sounds easy, but it's not.  And I'm working in the areas of misinformation,  and places like First Draft, which is here at the school,  work on this all the time.  It's very, very difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me ask you this, Jeff,  because somebody in the chat room said something interesting.  How about facts?  There we go.  Can you say what's factual and what's not factual?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facts, it's not as easy either,  because you have what you have happening now.  You can spin facts exactly, you can manipulate facts,  and you have, there are fact checkers,  Facebook employees, they pay for to do this work,  and the right says they're all left-willed.  So, yeah, so for instance,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everybody here might agree that the sky is blue,  but there might be somebody who says the sky is green,  and for them, it actually might be factual.  Factual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's actually a wonderful example  when Greta Thurnberg came over.  One of the things that went around on Twitter  was that she was criticizing people,  the signatories of the UN Treaty on Climate Change,  and people were calling her out  for not calling out the top two polluters,  the US and China,  but neither of those were actually part of that treaty,  which is why she wasn't calling them out,  because she was only calling out those people.  We never agreed to it.  It's a fact that she wasn't calling out  the two big polluters,  but that's the challenge.  I mean, as someone who reports on policy a lot,  there are facts, and there's actually the truth,  and then there's also what something's going to enable  or mean, which all of those can be very different,  and it's your job as a journalist  to understand all of those and to report for people  the actual truth and then what the implications are  of that particular truth, and that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want to get on record thanking you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lies, damn lies, and statistic.  Are you drunk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you drunk, Karsten?  Have you been drinking, Karsten?  No.  Okay, I just want to go on record.  The word is statistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard for him to talk  when you pick the gag out of his mouth.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To be fair, he is wearing a ball gag.  And a joint.  Oh, yeah.  No, I want to thank you all,  because these are very, very hard things.  This makes my head hurt.  Yeah, it makes your hair hurt?  My head hurt.  Oh, okay, because your hair is gone,  and I don't know if it's hurting or not.  I have some pains.  We haven't seen it in a long time.  No, I appreciate all of your willingness,  and I think that's one of the things  that's great about this show is  we can take on some pretty difficult topics.  I don't think we've come to a conclusion.  Like dark mode.  Dark mode's a much easier debate.  It's not good.  It's not a debate.  It's not good, right?  It's not a debate.  It's good, it's not good, I don't know.  I'm telling you, we're going to do a show.  Micah has a name I don't like called Hills to Dion,  but I want to call it the...  Yeah, it's a little dystopian.  Yeah, that's a little creepy.  The smaller the difference, the bigger the battle,  which is like Jif versus Gif, or black dress,  what was it, red dress, green dress, whatever that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Deep dish versus thin crust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  The most minor the difference,  because everybody can have an opinion on Jif versus Jif.  You don't have to have any knowledge.  You just have an opinion.  Yeah, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the hardest, actually the biggest debates  you will ever have are when you believe,  we all fundamentally believe that we are good people  who have a moral center.  And it's when things come up to challenge  the two things you believe, so we're pro-capitalists,  and we believe we have a moral center,  we're going to fight the most over things  where I think we should go capitalist,  and you think we should go moral center, and vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's this show.  That's not that show.  That show's Jif versus Gif.  I just want...  This is a hardcore show.  This is the show.  You just hate me.  Okay?  I understand.  No, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Allegedly.  I spent three hours a week with you.  If I hated you, I would not...  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love you too.  Painstakingly ours.  I appreciate your being.  I'm sincere when I say I really appreciate  all of your willingness.  And our audiences, those who are left.  I appreciate you bringing it together.  Willingness to kind of chew on these.  They're really tough.  Okay, Chad, we're gonna come back.  Yeah, you can come back now.  You can come back.  It's going.  Can we just get along, please?  Please, can we just get along?  Our show today brought to you by Monday.  Not the first day of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quick plug, just because I've been saying  that we need more conservative media responsible,  fact-based journalism, conservative media.  And Jonah Goldberg, who was the editor of the National Review  with whom I disagree, not 95% of the time.  And Steve Hayes, who was the CEO of Weekly Standard,  I believe, created something this week called the dispatch.  And so it's more competition in conservative media.  And I think that's, and I'm a liberal,  as is pretty damn obvious, but I think that's a good thing.  So I just wanted to give them a shout out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go sanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so you're not talking about Davidson County's  news source, the dash dispatch.  The dispatch.com.  Okay, because I kind of, I like it with the dash  because it's like, you know, local news  has always been my favorite, but okay, let's go.  Let's go.  Ah, oh, you have to subscribe.  Is it newsletter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do it for a second, because it's what it's going to say is  you could get the free plan for a while,  or you can be a founder for $1,500.  These conservatives are really greedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you know, I actually read the national review.  I have since the days of William F. Buckley.  I try to.  Not because I support its point of view,  but because I think it's important to read it.  And I think a lot of times it's very intelligent.  It's hard sometimes.  As Buckley was.  And then I try to read reason,  which is a libertarian slant.  And I think quite interesting.  What I love about libertarians is you really never know  which way they're going to go.  It's like, what?  You want to legalize drugs?  Oh, okay.  You just don't know.  You never know.  It's always a surprise to read it.  Of course this is what we think.  Of course.  Anybody with a brain would know.  So I guess, I mean, given Andy Rubin  got a $90 million payout from Google for sexual harassment,  the more I'm learning about it, the worse it's getting.  He, you know, on the other hand, he did.  Played with the Media Lab.  He invented, you know, was co-inventor of Android.  So Google quite reasonably said, well, thanks for Android,  but see ya.  At least they got rid of him.  His new company, Essential, released one phone,  which was a very nice Android phone, but flopped.  He's got a new one that's weird.  This is Project Gem.  And it's long and thin.  What makes you say it's weird?  Well, look at it.  Look at the aspect ratio.  He says.  21 to nine.  A new UI for radically different form factor.  It's just weird.  But so, Stacey, you would say,  ethically, nobody should even consider this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or would she not say that?  Or would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's guess.  I never know with Stacey.  Yeah.  I know she wouldn't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would not buy it if you want to buy it  knowing what you know.  And to be fair, we don't know everything about it.  I just, what I really don't want to do  as a member of the media is portray Andy Rubin  as this amazing god of technology  without acknowledging his flaws as a human being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I thought was very interesting is a great many,  not all, but a great many of the articles  about this phone brought that up.  They had to bring it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did they?  Yeah, you kind of have to.  They had to bring it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they should,  but I wouldn't be surprised  if a lot of tech bloggers wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, let's think about,  and granted, this person did not murder people,  but if you had murdered someone or if you were a CEO,  I mean, even Martha Stewart,  they still mention in profiles of her  that she went to jail for insider trading,  which is, I would argue, much less problematic,  especially in her particular case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I do think that there are things  that should follow you for the rest of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess, I mean, there are allegations.  It's not like he was tried in a court of law  and found guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is true, but I would say that he was probably-  Yet he didn't come back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and fight for a defamation suit either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he took the 90 million, as I would have.  Took the money and ran.  You can say anything you want about me, Ann.  If you write me a check for $90 million,  I'm not gonna dispute it.  Fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think I'm gonna do any interviews with Matt Lauer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God, that story.  Ronan Farrow's book came out and holy cow,  we did not know the depths of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, the investment firm that he was a part of  or founded, I believe it was called Playground.  Andy Rubin, yeah.  Andy Rubin.  They've ousted him as well.  Interesting.  With a nine million dollar parachute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although, weirdly enough, the map on the gem phone  in the tweet is actually going from the playground  to the Palo Alto airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Rich Folks Airport on top of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the private jet airport.  That's not just SFO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  Yeah.  Okay, I got nothing more to say here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the phone, again, somebody's trying  with a 21 to nine aspect ratio,  trying to do something different,  trying to do something innovative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where did you get the 21 to nine?  21 to nine, I love it.  That's what that is.  Wow.  Yeah, look at it, you could just tell.  Who knows?  He's smart.  No, I'm impressed.  He just calculated that in his head.  He's got millimeters in his brain.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, again, I don't fault people  for trying something different.  This phone makes me think of the old iPhone 5  and the selling point of it being grippable  and being able to scroll with one hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is totally grippable.  You can reach your thumb across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't know if that's one of those phones  for everybody.  Yeah.  It's just not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the idea of a smaller phone.  I actually had a cell phone that was like this.  It was kind of weird, a Sanyo phone.  It was long and thin.  I remember those.  But it was just a phone.  It was a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I lost one like that.  It was a silver phone.  I lost it on a 911.  Yeah.  It was really strange.  Wow.  Tall, thin one.  It was elegant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if there's one thing that looks  like XDA developers discovered in the code snippets  of this phone, it uses its voice assistant  to do a lot of the things you would normally be tapping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, which is why you have the slimmer form factor.  You don't need to type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, really, that's kind of what the AirPods and other,  I think Google will talk about new Google Buds on the 15s.  Got it.  That's one of the things, right, is you  don't need a screen even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we need to tap it.  We need that voice control to work too now.  Yeah, we don't need it to be hit or miss at a 70% rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if this is a phone and then you  have a phone in your pocket?  What if this is a sub phone, a sidecar for your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, like that little palm thingy?  What is that thing?  The mini phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, really, that's all the Apple Watch is.  Some people say that about your watch.  That's what the Apple Watch is, is a sidecar for your phone,  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it has other functions.  Would this have another function?  I don't know what it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kudos for trying, but at the same time,  we do know who you are, Mr. Ruben.  Whoa.  He's harsh.  It is who it is.  I didn't say it like that.  I don't think that's harsh.  I didn't say it like that.  I'm just stating a fact.  We know who Andy Ruben is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we see you, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We will cover the Made by Google for 2019 live on this network  on the 15th.  You're going to be here.  Yes, sir.  Brice and Howell.  Night of bush and tail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What time?  7 AM Pacific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Notice, I don't show up for the 7 AM events.  I let you and Micah do the surface event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will you at least have coffee waiting on us?  I will.  Oh, OK, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want bagels and cream cheese.  Whatever you want.  I will get you whatever you want.  Carson's coming with his oars.  Of course.  And we will be streaming it live as Google will as well.  Right.  7 AM on the 15th.  Is that a Wednesday?  What day is that?  It's a Tuesday.  Tuesday, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Tuesday.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to be at an event I can't get out of.  And so I'm going to be sitting there with my laptop open,  looking like I'm taking notes, but probably ordering a machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The beauty of it is it's happening on Tuesday.  And all about Android, we'll be able to cover it at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Twig will be the next day.  So we'll talk a lot of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, I won't be on Twig next week.  Where are you going?  I'm telling me.  Because Monday is Columbus Day.  He's never here.  We have no classes.  So the weird university life, all Monday classes are Wednesday this week.  It's pushed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like all Wednesday podcasts are Friday this week.  Yep.  Imagine that.  Same thing here.  By the way, do they call it Columbus Day or Indigenous Peoples Day?  How politically correct is CUNY?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you exactly how.  In the city of New York,  Italian is still a protected ethnic class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is the national holiday for Italian Americans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you are Italian and hired by the city of New York,  you are counted as minority.  What?  You weren't joking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not joking.  It's a legal thing.  What about being Irish?  Yeah, the Irish should be protected, too.  I think it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No muss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're old school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you're African-American, forget ever trying to get a cab.  Yeah, done.  It's just New York.  That's the way we like it.  How you doing?  You got a problem with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got a problem with that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So glad I'm in a little old Pitaloma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have no power.  We are too.  We're so glad you're here.  XDA Developers is also saying,  I find this intriguing, that Google is now requiring Android contractors  any phone company that is going to use Android 10  and the Google Play Store to include digital well-being and parental controls.  That's just...  Nanny state.  Yeah, I mean, that's interesting.  I mean, you don't have to use digital well-being.  I know, and I turn it off.  But I think it's OK for Google to say, no, that's part of the package.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that's necessary.  I'm more impressed with the fact that they were telling the OEMs  that after January, you need to be running 10.  10, baby.  That's no more 9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that is more important.  You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you're going to get all of the security updates in a timely manner  in all of the features and not have to wait around for half a year  to get the new OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we've been waiting for this forever.  I mean, Google's been gradually pushing people to get better and better at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm really...  Do you think Google is doing this also preemptively to make sure  that the government doesn't make it do something like this?  They could say to...  But, Congressman, look what we've done.  We care.  That's not really what they're in trouble for these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, although I would say starting in January,  the California Senate bill is at 327.  Is that which one it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this the privacy bill?  Stacey, Stacey, we're going to know the number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everyone in the internet...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a matter of fact, it is exactly SB 327.  You're exactly right.  All right, all right.  Ms. Higginbotham?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are some things about privacy and things like not having hard-coded passwords  and having some other elements there.  I don't recall exactly  if that may be a reason for Google to start locking some of this down a little bit more.  But I would look in the next couple of months for companies that are changing  the way they handle security updates and especially new companies,  like launching new features around this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's worth reading this bill because this law, it goes well beyond anything that  anywhere else in the United States and it goes into effect January 1st.  It's been signed into law.  And honestly, since California is such a big part of the US's economy,  it really means it's got to be enforced nationwide, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, I know that my Christmas lights cause cancer thanks to Proposition 65.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.  You know, that's kind of a standing joke.  There, I mean, actually, why don't we have a Prop 65 warning in our building?  We ought to probably.  Everywhere you go.  And of course, the upshot of that is that you ignore it.  Even if there is a real danger, so what?  It says that everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so Senate Bill 327 does require for any devices sold after 20 January 2020  to have device authentication being the minimal bar.  And they all have to have like an immutable root of trust.  They have to have attestation and identity.  So who the hell wrote this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is great.  It has to have a unique password for every device.  There has to be a means of authentication outside a local area network.  This is this is sounds fairly like fairly intelligent.  Fairly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of good here.  It's kind of the lowest stakes, but we're still selling things that are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like so modern smartphones, Jeff, all that I could think of anyway,  are modern phones are encrypted and store in a secure enclave  the unique encryption key unique to each device.  That encryption key is unlocked with some authentication method,  fingerprint, face ID or password and only unlocked on device.  So that's requiring that that be the case.  It's also requiring that the device contain a security feature  that requires a user to generate a new means of authentication.  In other words, a fingerprint password or face ID before access  is granted to the device for the first time.  So there, you know, it's it was only a few years ago  that Apple let you use a phone without having it be locked.  Apple does now require this.  This bill will require it.  All phones will have to be locked.  And we'll have to be locked in an appropriate way.  That's for security, but there's also other stuff.  And this is. Yeah, I mean, if you look at something like this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this means that your thermostat or even your light switch  that you buy that's connected to the internet, it's going to have to have a TPM.  It's connected devices. Yeah, it's everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I'll have to have a secure enclave.  They'll have to have authentication.  This changes IOT.  This is how I know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't think about that.  Wow. 327, Jeff.  Oh, see, I mean, I thought you were talking about what time it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's only three.  Oh, no, no, sorry.  Senate Bill 327.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Connected devices means cameras, doorbells.  There's no authentication.  I guess there is.  Well, so so what's the point of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so so they actually so you have the ability to have a TPM  or some sort of secure enclave.  Everybody calls it something a little bit different on microcontrollers.  Arm put that in about a year and a half or two years ago.  So that's but a lot of companies don't actually implement them.  So they're on there. They just don't use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they will if they want to sell in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you say they're on there, but they don't use it,  is easy as flipping a switch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a software thing.  So you have to when you're programming your device, you have to know how to implement it.  Like, you have to know how to write the code to turn it on, basically,  and design around it properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so 327 is essentially an IoT security bill.  There there is also a privacy bill.  I conflated the two and I apologize.  There is also a very strong privacy bill that will become.  Yes, there is.  This is wow.  This is an IoT privacy bill, basically a security bill.  Someone's forward thinking on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if it's forward.  I mean, it's freaking four years past Marai, but OK, sure.  Sure, it's forward thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I'm sure there are this.  Here's a blog post that calls it Ledges sure.  Ledges Surrady.  Security through Ledges Surrady.  There are going to be people who say, oh, this is lame and blah, blah, blah.  But I think this is a good step.  It sounds smarter.  It's a good start than I would ever expect from a legislature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if we were going to actually try to do this in the US and it takes some of the same  things that the UK is trying to do with their I keep wanting to call it common core,  but that's not what it's called.  They have a common something security initiative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like common core only for security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm thinking of the curriculum standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know what you're talking about.  Yeah. OK. I was like, I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore.  Here in California, we know a lot about common core.  So. Wow.  So, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of you have the most.  Y'all are all like head down, clearly trying to.  We're trying to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've already grok it.  You're way ahead of us.  You already know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As always, what is she saying?  That translate to what now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Individuals cannot sue manufacturers over noncompliance, however.  This is a law that the state will have to implement.  This is a not a doesn't give you a chance to sue.  This is good, though. This is I think this is exactly.  Do you agree, Stacey? This is what IOT needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's lots to like here.  I mean, could it go a little further? Sure.  But everybody, you know, this is does a refrigerator need a password?  Um.  If you want me to connect it to the Internet, yes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and that's what this DevOps blog says.  It's not so much about securing a refrigerator as securing the eco,  the entire ecosystem of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the it's basically like, you know, how if one person has an STD,  then everybody's going to eventually get the STD.  That's what my doctor told me. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to take. What does it do to cost, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To cost? Yeah.  It'll probably raise costs  somewhat in the short term because companies have been pushing out  most of the reputable companies that you buy things from already do this.  They already are implementing this.  So the five dollar outlets, maybe not so much.  So that's kind of where that is.  Does that that's not helping?  I can't tell you it's going to add two dollars to everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's not going to be prohibitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't have to be.  And the more people who implement it, because it's a software and silicon  based thing, the cheaper it's going to get.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to get out of here.  What time, Stacey?  In about 15 minutes.  All right. Well, let me do Zapier and then we can get your thing.  How about that?  We have a lot more to talk about, but I think we've done some good work.  We have trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I can leave and y'all can keep on trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, a quick, quick Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you know what's in the change log, you know, what's important, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dark mode.  You know, let's do another get some more trumpets  and we'll have the twig dark mode moment of the week.  Now you can do dark mode in Google Duo.  You don't have to and get ready for dark mode in maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should have a death march over this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, by the way, it isn't quite there yet, but my maps on other things  have like my car maps always had dark mode.  You don't want a big bright map while you're driving at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I can tell when the sun sets because my car just flips over. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought this is already in place with surprise.  Man, Android auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm sure it is. Yeah.  Google Play Books adds a dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's confusing.  I don't know if I want to read a book in dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, oh, so now we're really so now we find it.  The page books is the line too far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Kindle, you can do a dark mode on.  But I always like I think it's always easier on the eye to have dark black  text on a not bright white.  This is where we began the show last week.  Yeah, is this how we went wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the critically acclaimed show from last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, by the way, I'm going to turn on dark mode on my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, if you haven't seen last week's this week in Google, I wasn't here,  but I there was a hey, Willie episode five twenty eight.  There was a lot. It was it was.  It was a lot of fun.  And thank you very much for hosting that show.  Jason Howell and Ant.  Thank you for being here for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I began with the story.  I did insist we begin with a story that debunks dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's widely agree.  I don't want to get into it again, but I think it's widely agreed  that it's easier on the eyes to have dark.  Tell them what it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like, this is like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was on your side. He was on your dark text on white paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I said, yeah, yeah, I've always said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I listen, man, listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because that's but wait a minute.  That's because paper is reflective.  The light bounces off of it into your eyes.  There's a big difference from that in a transmissive medium,  like a screen where the light is shining from the screen into your eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guys, you guys were re legislating dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, I just want to point out that the fabulous new twit  forums at WWW dot twit dot community give you the choice.  It comes in a delicious, graceful light mode for you, Jeff Jarvis.  But at any point, you can go to the hamburger menu,  choose a dark mode and make Jeff scream in agony.  There's many dark modes.  There's not just one.  There's many dark modes, but there's also, Jeff, to be fair,  many light modes.  You might like Sam's simple theme.  And I invite everybody, including you, Stacey and you, Jeff.  I think, Jeff, you're already there.  He's going to join us at the twit dot community.  These are the hosts who are already in there.  It's not a requirement.  And it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff should have gone in last week to accept the accolades.  Yeah, people love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did not see that this existed.  Oh, yeah. Well, no, I know. I know. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No hard feelings. It's OK.  But we have categories.  Every show has its own category.  Every host. Pardon me.  We have fun there. We have fun there.  Tech talk, feedback and general discussion.  People are talking about their favorite books and movies and plus.  Nice work. All of that.  No one knows.  We've never been able to figure it out why everybody is a blue dot  except for Ant, who's a red dot.  Because I'm not a mere mortal.  I swear to God, Ant, I've gone through every freaking setting in this thing.  It's orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it Clemson? It's not right. It's orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not a mere mortal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Clemson. Oh, maybe that's why.  It just it just knows.  And by the way, here's where you get the bless your heart count.  If you if you want to participate in that, I think it's really fun.  And by the way, I'll just tell you, it's been a huge success.  The numbers I'd have to log in to show you what the numbers are through the roof.  I didn't. I'm actually going to have to pay more for it, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do you want to know my desktop OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's voluntary. We just.  Oh, you're in trouble, Leo. You're in trouble.  Oh, no, I'm just. Big trouble.  You know what? It's not on that list.  You know, it's not there, young man.  Chrome OS is on that list.  It wasn't there last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My desktop OS is Windows Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody covered your rear end.  You could write anything you want.  No, I'm the only admin on this.  You can cover it. You can.  You can ignore it. That's not it's just for fun.  It's all for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if I want you to have my phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to give me your phone number.  You never call me anyway.  I would get your number, though, if you did.  So think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My numbers on the bottom of all my emails.  So yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I even put it on my emails.  So anyway, I'm pretty proud of this.  I think it's a lot of fun.  And I want to give it a little plug.  That's my thing for the week.  Oh, what? Change log women. Sorry.  Squirrel. Sorry. Squirrel.  The Play Store is getting a dark theme.  Google Voice is getting a dark theme.  I'm sensing a theme here.  Oh, a new UI and social sharing in a dark theme.  No, Google Camera was always dark.  And Google Camera, that should tell you something.  There's I'm not talking to you.  That should tell you something.  Google Shopping gets a new redesign, new features, price  tracking options to go from to shop from local stores, style  ideas via Google Lens and dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had tartness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the whole pollution.  Google and Ivanka Trump.  How would you finish that sentence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Walk into a bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Walk into a bar.  Unveil a tech job training program.  And I love Engadget's subhead on this.  It comes as Google is trying to fend off antitrust investigations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here we go. Here we go.  The real story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cozy up to the royal daughter.  That's always a good idea.  Google Home starts letting users transfer streams between speakers and displays.  So you're listening. Nice.  Have you tried this? Yeah.  So you can say, what do you what is the command, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe it's hey, gee.  Move whatever name.  Move the music to the living room speaker.  Move the music to kitchen to office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, cool. Oh, how how lifelike.  That's cool. How human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it depends on what you've named your things, as always.  You're like sometimes I never.  I can't remember. Why did I name it that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. I try to name it with the room kitchen, bedroom.  That makes more sense. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But all the people who like because when I started out, I was like,  you know, Joe's Crab Shack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you're like, move the music to Joe's Crab Shack.  By the way, I love Joe's Crab Shack.  Have you ever been there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have very exciting news on the culinary front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. Right across.  Hold on. It's a Chipotle. I know. But hold on.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right across from my office.  Right across.  Right. It will be opening. Yes.  A brand new. Yes.  Taco Bell. Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can go there for fifth meal, Jeff.  Bless his heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a bless your heart.  Is there a bless your heart? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's on the tweet community. Go on.  Increment. He said Taco Bell.  You know, I remember a time many, many moons ago,  but I remember a time when you could not get a decent taco  anywhere in New York City or burrito.  It was like they had no Mexican food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That has changed now, apparently.  Yeah, but it's weird. Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because Taco Bell is across the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that's Mexican. I don't know what that is.  Anyway, I don't know why they don't have queso there.  I told you that across the street from Petaluma's Taco Bell  is the best Mexican food. It's a taco truck.  It's the best Mexican food in town. El Royce.  Yes. It's been here a week and he already knows.  El Royce. Oh, El Royce is good. So good.  It's good. I've been there a couple of times.  And still, there's a line around the block at Taco Bell.  I don't understand it.  Google's new tool lets you see how polluted these cities really are.  Find out about the current carbon footprint.  It's insights.sustainability.  That's pretty cool. Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, is this what they were doing with Aclima?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You speak a language I do not know, Stacey Higginbott.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aclima was a company they worked with to put sensors  on the back of Google Street View cars.  I bet it is. Oh, right.  Glad you have a good memory.  Yeah. This is one of the big, like my big, not passion projects,  of hopes for IoT is you could actually use this to make the invisible visible  in a way that allows municipalities to charge polluters  and kind of help them cover the costs of some of the pollution.  This is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to see this here, you know, the San Francisco area and L.A.  And.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you can.  So I'm looking at Mountain View, Google's home.  You can see based on that and the weather,  what the rooftop solar potential is, how much emission reduction you could get,  what the transportation emissions are, which, by the way,  is twice as much as you could clean up with solar,  what the building emissions are, which are even more than solar.  So you and then you get climate projections.  21 day increase in hot days projected, three day decrease in wet days projected.  Data is awesome.  Data is cool.  Data.  Well, you call it science.  I call it climate hoax.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just trying to let me slide away.  Just a little bit of trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then finally, and we were talking about this on Windows weekly,  and it's really cool.  Google Grasshopper, which is let me sign in real quickly with Google here.  It is Google's introduction to coding for people who would like to learn  how to code a very easy, simple way to do it, including, by the way, now,  it was started with JavaScript, but now HTML, CSS and other code fundamentals.  So I think this is really, really cool.  It's a fun thing.  You type the code in there.  We're going to draw the French flag with code here.  See, there's the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's a programming interface.  And what's nice is I'm going to I'm going to give this to our kid because  this is a great way to learn with drag and drop and click.  You don't even have to really do any typing.  I've just broken the French flag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then you get that that whole or what happened if I actually go up into  this editor and change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is why basic was so great for those of us who are all inquisitive.  Yeah.  I remember that.  And it was fun because you could type something and something would happen.  Right.  Do you want to do the Gabonese flag?  Oh, we got to finish French flag for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that.  They're forcing you to get the fundamentals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that.  All right.  That's grasshopper.  It's a learn.grasshopper.app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll show that to my kids.  They probably won't care, but I'm still going to show it to them.  Tell them they're going to learn to code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the future.  That's the Google change log.  All right.  I want to give you a quick look at one of our sponsors and then we're going to end  with our picks of the week.  Thank you for being here today.  It's been a fun show.  Our show today brought to you by Zappier.  Zappier, by the way, you know, one of the reasons people want to learn to code is  because they want to use the computer to do the busy work.  Right.  Anytime coders always say this, anytime you do something more than a few times, you  should just write a program to do it.  But it takes longer to learn to code than doing the thing.  So people often don't.  Zappier is awesome.  You don't need to learn anything.  It's a really easy way to automate the stuff you do over and over at work, at  home.  It is fantastic.  Zappier is one of the keys about Zappier is it supports connections to over 1500  apps.  So I, for instance, have a Zap we use for the Twit community.  The Zappier watches my RSS feed when it sees a new show.  It goes to the Twit community, creates a new post and sets it up so that people  can respond to the show.  It does that all automatically.  Once I set it up, I never have to do it again.  Think about it again.  I have another Zappier that Karsten and I use whenever I see a story I want us to  cover on the show.  I just click the star in my news reader.  Zappier, which supports my news reader, automatically gets that star, puts it up  on pinboard, makes a new line in a Google spreadsheet.  It fills in all the information.  It does this all automatically.  All I did was click the star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You and Mike are like wiz when it comes to Zappier.  Oh, it's not hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could do this.  You should try it.  Honestly, it's so much fun.  If you're in sales, you'll love Zappier because it integrates with all the CRM  packages like Salesforce so you can set it up to automatically engage leads,  import new customers, notify your team about opportunities.  See, the whole point of Zappier is you do the stuff you like and let Zappier,  it's like a little robot pal that's running in the background, doing the stuff,  the repetitive boring stuff you don't want to do.  And because Zappier supports multi-step zaps, you can get more done.  You'll write fewer scripts and do more with Zappier.  You want to try it free?  Go to zappier.com slash twig, Z-A-P-I-E-R dot com slash twig.  Connect all the apps you use.  Oh, I mean, gosh, there's such a long list.  They have Philips Hue for all of the IOT.  Oh, for IOT, it's phenomenal.  With Zappier, you can have multiple steps.  You can have the sun goes down, play Frank Sinatra, mix me a martini and open the  garage door because honey pie is about to be home.  And that's what's great about multi-step zaps.  You get more done and you don't need to be a coder.  It's easy.  I'm going to show you, you will love it.  You could build the exact solution you need in minutes without writing code.  You don't have to ask a developer for help.  The best part about Zappier is they know how much time people have saved.  Four and a half million people use Zappier every week, month.  They save on average 40 hours a month using Zappier.  F your email, your Dropbox, whatever it is, 1500 apps.  It's the easiest way to automate your work.  Get more time to do what you want.  Grow your business, have more fun, make a martini for your hubby right now through  November, try Zappier free by going to zappier.com slash twig, Z A P I E R.  Go to zappier.com slash twig, zappier.com slash twig.  You thank them for their support.  And I love, I've been using Zappier for I think 10 years, long, whenever they  started a long time, as soon as I found it, I said, this is it.  I've been paying for the starter account for many, many years.  Stacy Higginbotham has her thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My thing this week is not a tech thing because I went to the smart kitchen  summit this week in Seattle and I found something so nutty.  And you must have been in heaven.  It was actually quite nutty.  It is a company called Orchestra provisions and they believe that people  should be eating more bugs, but they also acknowledge that they think bugs are gross.  Yes.  So what they've done is they've ground up cricket protein and instead of just  doing cricket protein, because if you're cool with crickets, you're probably  already like eating the cricket flour, right?  But what they've done is they've put it into spices and you can start  flavoring in spices are delicious.  You can't, you can't taste the cricket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not the usual slogan and real selling point.  They put that on the jar, right?  You can't taste the cricket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe they call it a gateway bug to eating.  So I just thought I tried the curry powder on some cashews and I tried the  chai spice and I tried the set.  I can never say is a tar, is that tar?  Is that tar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, but let me ask you.  Ask away.  What's the point of the cricket?  I mean, curry would taste like curry with or without cricket, right?  The idea here is to get people introduced to eating bugs and realizing it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do I get more protein?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause I used cricket curry powder.  Yes.  There is a tiny little bit of cricket protein in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yes, but it's not, it's, this is truly a way to.  Let me read this.  This product is made with sustainably farmed crickets that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  rich in iron and protein, includes no added sugar preservatives.  If you're worried about these crickets, but you're worried about preservatives  or sugar, come on, man, this is your diet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's keto friendly is what it sounds like.  It is keto friendly.  What was the carb count on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing, nothing at all.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  So I know what I'm bringing you for lunch next.  Nothing.  It's got a fiber.  Mmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they tasted like a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a  But honestly, Stacey, did they taste any different than regular curry powder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is, that's why this is a really good way to get people who might be  kind of like questioning crickets and eating bugs.  Can I be honest with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one in who's questioning crickets is going to buy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  You're, you're going to like,  Were you going to sneak it into their food?  I would never sneak a food product into someone's food.  You're surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just ate a cricket.  How does that, how's that curry taste?  You like it?  You like it, mom?  Yeah.  It's pretty good, isn't it?  It has some awesome protein in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crickets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well that actually happened to me.  My daughter, Austin's a cricket hub, so she actually gave me cricket cookies.  But speaking of my daughter, I got to go get her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, go get her.  We love you.  I've had cricket flour and it's also good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I judged the Russian river slugfest cook-off.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not eating slugs.  Unless they're barbecued with a nice sauce.  It was disgusting.  Bye.  Stacey, Stacey on IoT, her wonderful show with Kevin Toffle.  Get her newsletter at stacey on iot.com.  She's at Giga Stacey, G-I-G-A Stacey, with an E or without an E?  I can't remember.  E.  On, with an E on the Twitter.  And Pruitt, what you got for us today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I forgot about the thing of the week, but I do have something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you could come up with one like almost instantaneously.  I always forget, by the way.  I'm doing it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I totally forgot about it, but I did come across this this morning.  A patient gets hope with gene editing technology for helping out with sickle cell.  Wow.  And it's talking about the CRISPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So sickle cell is a genetic hereditary genetic disease.  African-Americans suffer often.  Right.  And it causes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's with the red blood cells and it's not able to carry oxygen.  So you can get strokes and you have pain.  It's terrible.  Blood clots and things of that nature.  They can cure that with CRISPR?  Well, it's changing the genetic makeup of the cell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So not only would it fix you, if you then reproduced the kids, would you not pass it down?  Possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  That would be something to find out.  But when I saw that, it got my attention because I have a cousin that has sickle cell.  And I've seen their treatments and their struggles over the years.  And I thought this was fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know.  Pardon?  How was it treated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't, I never got to see her treatments.  I just see her after treatments.  Afterwards.  Got it.  And she was never in a good mood.  And she's young.  So I feel even worse for her because she's young.  But then when I thought more about this story, I know how some people in the world are against  CRISPR and you know, I don't think you should mess around with genetics and things of that nature.  But me, I'm all about, if you're going to help give someone a better quality of life and they  choose it, have at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When we pick one pig to mate with another pig because it's going to have a certain quality,  we're messing with genetics.  Same thing.  Yeah.  It's not any different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same thing.  Yeah.  But that's my pick.  And that's the only issue with CRISPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think somewhat is that it was oversold initially.  And there are consequences to CRISPR that people maybe didn't anticipate.  So, but I mean, that's going to be the case with all science.  That's all research.  All genetic modification.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Where is that?  That article was on NPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's on npr.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patient hopes gene editing can help with pain, sickle cell disease.  Jeff, Jeff, here comes the dump trucks to move in the Taco Bell.  Taco Bell needs...  It's coming.  Mr. Taco Bell's in town.  He's announcing it to the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you doing?  Santa Claus is coming on the fire engine to say Taco Bell's here.  Maybe.  So, yeah, you guys could just slough off and find something.  I've got to do research every week trying to find a number, which is, say,  the last minute panic.  I found something this week I like.  So federal Fed chairman, federal reserve chairman, Jerome Powell,  wants to know what the Internet is worth to people.  The argument is the GDP, the number of numbers, does not include all of this  value in the economy because so much of it is free.  And so he in a talk, he cited MIT's Eric Bernolfson, the economist,  who had done a study finding that the median user would need about $48  to give up Facebook for one month.  Median price of giving up video streaming services like YouTube,  $1,173 per year.  That's a year for giving up search engines.  What do you guess?  What's the median price people would have to be paid to give up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $2,000 a month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going to be a big and I would go 38, 3800 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Karsten Karsten, come on down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The priceless price is very good answer.  17,530 a month or a year.  No, a year.  Oh, I was pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're closer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were.  You get the but you were over.  So, yeah, that's right.  But it was a more limited survey with students in Europe on other  popular platforms.  This is amusing.  One month of Snapchat was valued at 2.17 euros, LinkedIn at 1.52 euros.  WhatsApp was big.  536 people really rely on that.  Yeah.  But Twitter use that.  Yeah.  Zero euros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I rest my case.  I disagree.  I rest.  I would give up Twitter.  Oh, I did.  I would give up Facebook for free.  I see nobody paid you.  Yeah.  Nobody paid me.  Actually, I am still on Twitter because I don't know why, because my  social media team said, what?  I see you on every now and then.  I post every once in a while.  I don't.  It's not my favorite place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you'd rather be in a community.  I get it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And actually that's one thing I like about our community is it's kind of  replaced social media for me.  It's a nice place to hang out.  So this isn't a thing or a pick, but it's a pretty funny story.  And I bet you maybe you're old enough to remember getting a wallet at  Woolworths, Jeff Jarvis, with a fake social security card in it.  It says specimen on it.  It was just, they put it in the wallet to show that you could put stuff in the wallet.  But it turns out, and this is a story from the social security  administration, that this social security number 078051120, it's a dummy  number, has been used by thousands of people over the years.  Not surprised.  It started in 1938 when this card was sold by Woolworths.  It actually was from a company called the E.H.  Ferry Company in Lockport, New York.  In the year 1943, 5,755 people were using this number.  Actually it is a real number.  It's a social security number of Woolworths vice president and treasurer's  secretary, Mrs. Hilda Schrader-Witcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's probably financed a lot of homes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Poor Hilda.  She got a lot of income attributed to her for retirement.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They voided the number and she was given a new number, but it continued to be used  for years and 40,000 people in all have reported it as their social security  number as late as 1977, 12 people were still found to be using the number,  quote, issued by Woolworths.  Mrs.  Witcher recalled coming back from lunch one day to find her fellow workers  teasing her about her newfound fame.  They were singing, here comes the million dollar baby from the five and 10 cent store.  The FBI even showed up at her door to ask about the widespread use of her number.  She said, I don't understand how people could be so stupid.  They started using the number.  They thought it was their own, even though it came in a wallet from Woolworths.  So folks, if you think your social is 07805 1120, it's not.  Nope.  It's a specimen.  I've got to get, I've got a question for you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can use a passport, Jeff, to fly and you have one of those.  I got a passport card.  And that's the thing.  I, the last time I was at the airport, I asked the TSA guy now, I don't  know how authoritative this is.  He seemed kind of bored at the time, but I said, can I use my passport card as a  real ID?  And he said, yes.  You, you, you've heard that too.  I've not heard that.  Yeah.  So that is true.  I have the passport.  So I have a real ID.  I don't need a California real.  Cause you're right.  It's hard to get one.  So passport, next time you redo your license, raise the standards anyway.  But even the passport card, they say not to be used as a passport.  I don't even know what that card is for.  Passport card is not a passport.  No.  But what is it?  It lets you drive.  You can't drive it to Mexico with it.  Not anymore.

Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause it was like 20 bucks.  I thought, well, why not?  Yeah, so did I.  And I thought, I also thought if I lose my passport, it'll be easier to get a  duplicate when I go to the embassy.  With my passport card, right?  Makes sense.  Yeah.  So yeah, that real ID doesn't actually.  It's a racket.  Well, it's not, I don't know if it's a racket, but it doesn't actually take,  uh, take place until when next?  Is it next January?  Is it soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think it's going to be, yeah, it's going to be going to the DMV is going to be  tortured.  There's going to be tons of people.  They're not going to have the right stuff.  Now you in New Jersey, you now have appointments.

So let's say if that didn't I do, do I need more?  Is your name accurate?  Yes.  What more do you need?  Oh, you also present one original copy of your social security numbers.  So try that Woolworth card.  See if that works.  Wow.  So you have to, you have to call this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Put that up again.  What else can you take besides the social security?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

You must also present.  Oh, oh, no, no, no, no.  I'm sorry.  A document that shows your name and full social security numbers.  So a pay stub would work.  Oh, okay.

Transcript:  I just want to say thank you.  We do this show normally we're doing it on Friday and you can see why that's  normally a bad idea.  We do it Wednesday when people are a little less punchy around about  130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.  You can come by and watch it.  YouTube or Twitch or mixer.  Actually the best thing to do, go to our website because we have all the  different ways you can watch, including ways you can listen.  twit.tv slash live.  If you're watching live, go to the chat room.  They're all watching live too.  It's a great place to chat.  IRC dot twit.tv.  For those of you who download the shows and they're all available at  twit.tv slash twig or wherever you get your podcasts or YouTube.  Uh, you can also participate in the conversation at our new forums,  twit.community because they're asynchronous.  And we did that because so many people said, well, I'm not around to watch  a live, so can you give me some way to interact with us?  And we're all in there.  We love it.  Uh, I hope you'll like it too.  Twit.community.  Best thing to do.  The one thing, if you did one thing this week for me, subscribe, open up your  podcast application, search for this week in Google, press the subscribe button.  That way you don't have to think about it.  It'll just be there for you to listen to the minute it's done.  And you won't be confused when we don't come out because of power outage or  whatever.  Thanks everybody.  I really appreciate your patience with us and PG&E and we will see you next time  on this week in Google.  Bye bye.
