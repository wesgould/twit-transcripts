Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right under area area area on a Huffington. Well, you should be on top of area when they're eyes that's trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not going both that way and no but it's it's and you know, if we get the chance to talk about Google Plus  It's an interesting time for you. It's in transition. That's very much. So we lost another we lost another  Citizen Danny Sullivan announced a couple hours ago that he's like, yeah, I'm done with Google Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no ever I you know, I've learned that lesson  I did that with Twitter once and with Facebook once and it's silly to say you're done

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he said I'll post occasionally, but he doesn't like the redesign a lot of people don't know really. Yeah, that's about the readers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I haven't heard what did Scoble say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scoble hasn't been on Google Plus in ages. I don't think let me just say he's he went all in on Facebook. I think yeah  There's a group though, I've never been kissed by Scoble that's good  He's got 7.2 million followers, but that's Scoble that's the scope that's the scope Scoble number. Yes  Two days ago is his last post. He doesn't he's not super active here. Yeah, then three weeks two weeks. Yeah, he's not super active  In fact this the only thing he's posting about looks like is his email newsletter. Yeah, he's a Facebook guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, and one of the things that that I'm gonna be writing up, you know, hey, I just passed 5 million followers post and  one of the things that's interesting is Lady Gaga's coming up on 10 million flowers and that a  Geek like me can get half as many followers as the number one user who's a little bit or yeah  It's it's a testament I think to a certain extent of the fact that it's not a fluffy  Yeah, celebrity driven social network like all the other social networks. So there's that you're also  Not yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be up in a few hours, yeah Kim Kardashian is she post I don't know  I don't know. She out there, you know what Mike also has four collections  Maybe more than that. Yep, but I'm following them all of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's that's great. Yeah, and so it's food and technology and and the Department of dumb  Department of dumb is one of them  I love that one because any stupid thing I find it throw it in there and if you can't stomach stupid things and you know  You don't follow the Department of dumb. Yeah. Yeah, but it's it's a it's a it's in a weird place  I think that it has a future as an alternative to reddit slash Pinterest  Yeah, and does not have a future as an alternative Facebook or Twitter  But that's fine. It's it's a it's a it's in a weird place because right now it's for two kinds of people  It's for people who are really enthusiastic about something  Obscure or not obscure  It's a great place for people who are you know to get together and do the original thing that people used to do on the well  And all you know all the great  Social sites remember that I was a member  I don't remember I have no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People like three-letter handles they were very short handles, but it was kind of exclusive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was there were a lot of great heavy conversations, and there's there's a lot of that in Google Plus, and then  There's this universe of English as a second language. Yeah, that's a little weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Participating well they participate in a strange way as you mentioned last time you were on they say hi  Yeah, or something like that or you know there. I feel like those are maybe budding spammers  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think it's because Google pushes Google Plus  Internationally and then people join it on their phones, and they don't really they haven't really yeah  They don't get the culture. They don't understand yeah exactly, and they're on low bandwidth  Connections maybe and you know this is not for low bandwidth no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm happy if Google Plus finds in a a niche. I'd be very yeah, yeah  All right look what I got  Big box, huh?  And it came from a Googleplex, so I figure either  This is a Christmas gift from Larry Page. You know this actually could be I still haven't gotten my Lego  My Lego from Google Phi, so it's either awfully big. It's either Google by Lego castle  This would be an over. This would be overkill on the box or  Let's see so excited. It's a really fat pixel see it could be it  Oh  Jerk I ordered it the same time as you after me, but I did expedited shipping so did I?  So probably it might have probably appear see in the brick house. No, I think did you have one yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we didn't have one in studio. No, so this is the first one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know a lot of the Google journalists like run a Mario got review units  But you know and gadget the verge  They didn't they weren't crazy about Ron weren't crazy about it  They said there were hesitation there were issues, and I'm wondering sometimes you get pre-production models with the review units  You don't get the production model, so I'm hoping

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That the production model won't be mine's mines out mine's you're gonna get yours during the show I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't believe I got this this fast. I'm excited that it can be used as a fridge magnet  There's so many magnets in it you can just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fridge apparently they're very powerful too, and you know we'll see how long it takes me to get used to the  weird dance you have to do to  Make because I got the the magnetic keyboard you Jason got the portfolio

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I probably got the wrong one, but yeah, yeah, this is the one that does the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Magnetic dance

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the coolest feature the one that I want the feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which everybody would copy on this is the fact that it wirelessly charges the keyboard when it's stuck to the tablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know it's interesting about Apple's pogo pins is they don't even bother charging it just powers the keyboard right and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That that's how the Apple Pencil should charge it should stick to the side and charge wouldn't that be nice be great yeah  easy for me to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shrink wrap there's so exciting about just opening up new boxes. I know it's Christmas came early for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a story I think the New York Times about unboxing as a marketing phenomenon now for all kinds of brands and I'm happy  They laid on that I hate to say I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New thing and the New York Times is on it let's get started

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plug

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get oh, it's a kind of fine print and and one whole column is in French  So let's do that one  Avida security take on some on the chalor  So there's the plug this is type C of course right yeah, yep, yep, and  You want to plug that in John?  I don't know if I'm gonna need it but usually these things come with enough juice that I can  just turn it on people have said that it reminds them a lot of the  Pixel the Chromebook pixel and it's styling let's take a look yes, which was what I like about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love this more if it was in fact a pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm trying to figure it out like you orders your yours a good after you a couple hours after me  Is it the folio keyboard that's part of my package?  That is throwing it off

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The official keyboard and yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was my mistake I'm sorry you can have this no no I'll give this to you. It's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is gonna be here today or tomorrow I can wait all right, so it is kind of pixely  It's squared a little bit with some rounding metal metal back. Yeah, it's that same color. Oh, it's even got the  Camera and it's a type C port on off switch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So don't think that's a light on the oh yes it is no no they gotta have a headphone jack don't they but that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of like the Apple MacBook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very square it does look very pixely yeah, my brain is still broken

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to get the androids running on this this thing well the not the knock really was that Androidus doesn't have the tablet apps  Yeah, and that this would be fine, but it doesn't do what you really wish it would do as a laptop replacement  Which is multi windows right even though that is apparently built into marshmallow. There's code in there  We just they haven't turned it on so I think this is gonna be a machine that next year  We'll start to start to really live up to its yeah potential right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is this for what market is this for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  schmucks like me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google fans right traveling writers  I actually think that's a that's a legitimate right cuz Jeff like you're a huge you're a huge chromebook fan because you travel a bunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right and I watch and I watch movies of my seven inches this stops me from having to carry my seven inch and my chromebook  It'd be a lot lighter  My office I'll still use my big Chromebook, but but when I'm for briefcase my hope is this is my briefcase machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so this is the thing that people said was tricky

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You kind of have to lay it down  Put it put it down. I see there's video of it. There's video it shows you slide tablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to the side  flip tablet over

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I just put it on here to start no, that's not the start. That's to close it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, to do that to do this you slide it to the side  Maybe I did it wrong. Let's do it this way  This is the way the magnets want to go slide tablet decide to oh to break the magnet right right right over  Touch it to the back of the keyboard and then  And by the way multi-angle yep  Which is I think really good that was something it took at Microsoft a while to understand and Apple still doesn't understand it says  Type the pairing code four seven four two seven one  Am I not getting bothered with that?  Yeah, it's an old old Bluetooth habit right, but I didn't but maybe it's not yet  Sorry don't want to use it. It's really on there. I  Mean, I think I must be doing it right. How's the build quality on the way you've seen so far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was it pretty solid

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks good here you be the judge Mike yeah  Yeah, it's top heavy which is the same problem Microsoft had with the Surface Book which is that the top

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Felt heavy it's the build quality is great. It feels very much in the league of a Chromebook pixel  You can you want the keyboard?  What's that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold it by the keyboard just the keyboard. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like turn it upside down since I don't own this I'll just go ahead and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bring myself to do it, but you can't really on there. No, it's a heck of a magnet. It's like whoa

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey  Okay, then thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean it will actually snap to your refrigerator if you put it on the refrigerator

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It will snap to it and and tightly stick there. Let me plug the I don't need to but I'm gonna plug the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Connector in and then don't look okay  Don't look I'm gonna type the password in I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love how the pixel light kind of tells you what's going on how it flashes red when you need battery  It just flashed yellow when you plugged it in it. It's like it's a nice subtle  Haring hasn't happened  Really? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is the keyboard on is that been on off switch?  Wow  Okay, let's let's do it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do it again  Okay  Okay, you slide to break it you put it over here like that  There's no  And then there's like that yeah, you know, I ordered the portfolio and then I cancelled because I think we had decided yesterday  Yeah, you gotta get this keyboard. Yeah. Yeah  Them res enter  Okay, maybe I didn't do that right. I don't know  Let's try this one more time  Pay no attention to the password. I'm about to enter I  Said they know attention to the password. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I was placing an order on the play store, uh-huh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Priorities you guys kind of want that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Jason should be able to leave his workstation version a second and come over and touch it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say having used the iPad now with a keyboard which I didn't for a long time  It's really nice to have a keyboard yes, it makes a big difference. Yeah, I think keyboards are not as good. That's right  And this you know, this is I've seen so many people use their iPad like Harry McCracken you and others who come in with this  You know the Belkin or whatever and this is nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean I'm eager to I'm eager to for you to type on it, you know a paragraph and see how you feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your tablet needs to download an update and restart. Oh  No wonder though if that's the thing that  May be related to the problems people are having with hesitation and other stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know and it's not a good time to come out with a device like this that has hesitation problems or other problems because the  the iPad Pro is so good the  Surface is so good. It's in its fourth generation. You're right. It's totally mature. Yeah, and  And the whole problem of having a keyboard with a tablet is not a hard problem and any Bluetooth keyboard or pretty much work with any tablet  It's just a question of propping up the the tablet while you use the keyboard and that's not a difficult problem to solve  So it's you know that a lot of this is not necessary. It's just kind of cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what upsets me about it what no well no LTE  Yeah, that's a hot Android device. Why the heck can I use cellular connectivity even the Chromebook pixel pulled?  No, I don't know what that really upsets me, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I wonder if they're saying well we figure you all have LTE on your phones now you just  Hotspot your phone. Why should you it? Why should you pay for to be that option?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right me that option because I don't because I have the AT&T unlimited so I have my karma, which is great  It's very nice, but I gotta get find the damn thing get it out turn it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're 90. Yeah, Jeff. They're 95% of the way  They're just you know allow me to just connect the LTE and it's just a perfect experience open it up and use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're just I think they just don't want to deal with the carriers at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now by the way programmers are not gonna like this because there's no tilde key, and there's no bracket key  So to make the key yeah, I know you have to get it through a  Command keyboard yeah, there's probably a command. They just lost the Google employee  Well yeah, I need the tilde key and the bread and the square brackets who's got who's gonna program on an Android device well  I want to you could you know you could I don't there's no reason not and that's that's the I think that's why people  Are upset that you don't have  Split windows and that kind of thing I think people would really like to see these devices be  Full-fledged yes at least as full-fledged as a Chromebook pixel maybe even more so right yeah absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got apps the whole point of Android is flexibility, so why couldn't this have come with Chrome OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I think this is more capable because you have this millions app app store

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chrome knows that's the funny thing the reviews  Complained that they're not tablets mobile the mobile apps aren't good enough and that and that you know in Chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had the best of both worlds. This is like a little laptop as it is and if the OS would give you  The you know I mean I think oh you could make a case that Android is like a desktop OS much more so than  Chrome OS. I mean it's it's got an app. It's got a huge variety of apps  They need to make the apps and I mean Gina you're the expert on this  It's completely possible to make apps that work both on a phone and a tablet yeah  Yeah, but they just maybe there hasn't I don't know there just hasn't been a drive to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's plenty of Android tablets. I mean there's plenty of Android tablets and Google like we're definitely pushes developers to do so  I'm actually I'm doing a Udacity the Udacity nanodegree for Android and tablet layout is in literally like is in this first section  I get that they're pushing it. It's right. You know it's it's actually before before material  So you know just and I think introducing that basic concept of you've got these different screen sizes  And this is how you have to design your layouts for these different screen sizes like in the wireframe phase  I think that's something Google really is trying to you know get developers to do, but  You know I don't know it adds more complexity and some more code and some more layout issues to each app

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's not difficult Florence ion just tweeted. She's watching the reddit AMA and apparently in there  They said Android and the next generation  Will feature tablet optimization  But that's I mean when is that that's a year off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we'll hear about it in a couple of months  It'll seem not so far away say the next version of Android will feature tablet and as in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nutella Nutella should be to tell it's not a shit new get that's a brand. Yeah, they've done it before yeah  No  No caps lock. It's replaced as it is on the Chromebook pixel with a search button  That's how it's done. I hope you can you can just change  I hope you can you can just change I hope well do you want caps lock? I guess you write a lot you might want  Oh, yeah, I want caps lock  I'm sorry, that's that's my impression of Jeff Jarvis, but no you probably do  All right anyway there it is that's a little unboxing of the Chromebook pixel  The key maybe they're one of the reasons the keyboard didn't respond right away says because it does have to get juice  So maybe it hadn't gotten enough juice. It's updating right now. This is a strong magnet  It's much stronger than I anticipated. I mean this is this is almost as if it's a one-piece device now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can turn upside down uses a hoverboard if you have a metal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  skateboard park or you could put your book light inside it and  I like it that the angle is variable. Oh, but you do pry it off if you go too far. That's okay

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty cool. You can go that flat completely flat

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder how that whole hinge thing and the magnets and everything are gonna be in two years three years. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well when you want to just watch it as a tablet. How does the keyboard stone? How does that work?  You take it off. I know that no, but you're supposed to be able to  Put it either use the keyboard as a case or you can kind of hide the keyboard so you can still use it as a couch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, that is a feel how tight that hinges geez  It's gotta be right cuz you're touching it right cheese, right? So then I could could I just do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yep. Yeah, it's kind of a little loosey goosey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a little bit then but the magnets do kind of snap in which is kind of neat  So you could do it like that if you're looking forward to watching a movie on it  I think you lay it flat to use it  So this is the way you do it you go like that and then boom that's actually not hard yeah  All right  Well, they finally came the Chromebook pixel see and maybe the reason it was delayed is  It wasn't ready and it maybe still isn't ready, but they got to get it out. They said they would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is pricey too. I mean, it's it is the thing who's gonna buy this who's gonna shell out that kind of dough 800 bucks  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I spent nine hundred fifty dollars on an iPad Pro and didn't it without the keyboard?  She's I know  stuff's expensive  The pen didn't come out yet though. Did it? Yeah. Yeah, it's out. Oh, did you get it? I got the pen  Yeah, I like the pen and then I was just showing this on Windows Weekly Paul Therot recommended a hundred dollar  PC that you plug into the iPad and now the iPad is a Windows machine  Same price as the pencil. Yeah for the same price you pay for the pencil. You can also have Windows 10  It's a it's only 1024 by 76 now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a small market the people who want to run Windows 10 on their iPad Pro

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but think about it you could be traveling around with an iPad Pro and  It's not much bigger than a smartphone in your pocket and that turns it into a full-fledged Windows computer  I mean, that's you know, there's some reason you might want to do that. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The company's paying for everything that's the reason because the company said you could right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, would that's an interesting question would this be a suitable product for a company computer  If if all you had to do was email and you know on the road and surf and stuff  I maybe it would be the pixel style load it up Android Android at work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The form factor is great for a tray table. Yeah coach class table. Yeah, it's the screen is a little bit forward  so  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm liking it and as everybody in all the reviews said the hardware is great  Superlative we're gonna count. I want you to type  Yeah, you know what this is like a real keyboard it's loose is here you're the writer  Let's let like he's the writer  It's it's not like the Apple very solid flat keys. Mm-hmm. It feels like a real keyboard doesn't it?  Yeah, it's it's nice. You can get used to his different travel. It's different. There's a learning curve

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, it's it's this key travel. There are arrow keys. There's no trackpad. Obviously. Yeah, it's similar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very similar to like an Apple Bluetooth keyboard. It's the same keyboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To like an Apple Bluetooth keyboard, it's the same shape of the keys. Yes flat. I like that flat thing. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, whoo look it's upgrading. Yeah, it's getting the new Android there. Oh  It's done now select a Wi-Fi network connecting. I guess our update is done. So I'll just let it sit here for a while and  This can take a while  Microsoft Microsoft's on its upgrade says don't worry all your files are safe, which makes me worry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you it's like I wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't okay, you could trust us you could trust everything's still there. It's gonna be okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you use another Android device quickly copy your current setup. Yeah, I always want to do that, right?  Just I'll upgrade to put all the I got 64 gigs, you know, you know, by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when I switched to my new phone, the one thing that upsets me is fine  It moves all of the apps over but it doesn't move my settings over. It's not the Google Plus  When do I do something wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I should do that. Let's see it says open this is a new experience open the Google app

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you talking about app settings? Are you talking about system settings Jeff? That's the Google now app settings app settings is a feature  In marshmallow, but developers need to get on board with it. So a you gotta be running marshmallow be the developers have to program  To it, I believe  To say yes these these parts of the app can be backed up say already watch this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, Google  Set up my device  Getting started to set up your device your phone's Bluetooth and your Wi-Fi data will be used next searching for devices  Apparently it's gonna see the pixel see on the list. Hmm, and then I could just I  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Follow the on-screen instructions connecting you forever to find the Google app settings as opposed to the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they say open Google, what do you mean open Google it's always  Life is Google  They actually I think that's superfluous. I think if you just said okay Google set up my device. It would probably do it. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasted a half an hour trying to find that when I got the phone  What are you talking about by the way, by the way, I love this phone it's working very well  But when I when I want to reboot it and turn it on this case the one with the fabric egg  Somehow pushes down the one of the volume buttons just enough  So every time I if I just use the case and hold down the on off button, it wants to go into safe mode

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This crash please back trying again crashed. Yeah nice  Let's try again, I'll just put it right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not the way you're holding it Jeff. The case is actually leaning on the on the volume button  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Guess so just enough and so yeah, so it gets that I guess like it's this frightening horrible thing  This is no command and sorry something went wrong. Your case is holding it wrong. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not encouraging. So twice now something has gone wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is one of those Google experiences that when it works is absolutely right magical and when it doesn't you're like you all lie

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's probably because I have some program incompatible program running. I mean another program crashed too. So don't blame the victim  I'm the victim here. I'm blaming myself. It's okay  Well, while my all my devices are trying to mate  Talk about my mattress  Yes, he's crashed again, but you know, I know how to set what's funny is I  Know how to set up a Google device. I don't really need to do this  It's which is worse having somebody do it the manual way or having an automatic way that fails

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At the end it's the same you're doing it the manual way I'm gonna do it the manual way now, right

Transcript:  they still have the moto maker things just all in China now instead of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think you get them. Maybe you do. Do you get your Google account pre-configured and all that?  That's what Amazon does  Right on your all your Amazon devices come knowing everything there is to know about you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything that you've purchased is like 92. Yeah and your credit card

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Looks for everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now everybody knows why there are 18 fires sent here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know people are comparing this to you know  The iPad Pro and stuff but another comparisons with the Chromebook pixel and think about how easy the out-of-the-box  Experience is with Chromebook pixel Chrome OS is logged in. Yeah, right. It hasn't it right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really does you know, that's a really good point and I fear that worried about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  I fear that they want to emphasize the Android devices and not the Chromebook  But they got a great thing going with the Chromebook. They really I know we're probably gonna talk in this show about Chromebook in  Education which we can do that right now. They're huge  50% yes from from  From four years ago. The percentage was one  And now they've completely taken over that market obvious reasons if you're a school you don't have money  You don't have a lot of resources for managing devices and all that kind of stuff. You're worried about security  The Chromebook pixel handles all of that just out of the box

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked last week about the EFF's lawsuit because of course EFF says with a Chromebook you're logging into your Google account  And they're surprised and Google's storing your the students information. There's some privacy issues  You know, it's great because Matt cuts was on that show from Google. Yeah, and he said that you know  Thank you EFF for pointing this out. We're gonna we'll make you know, I'm sure we're gonna fix this  But it is kind of you think about somebody's got to store it somewhere, right? Well, yeah, it's the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the cloud. It was an attack on the cloud model not on that device  I think that's probably the yeah, and so I it's really nice. It's really again

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We love the EFF, but it was it was it came off as naive because how do you expect it to work?  Right, but you get hard drives for every student, you know that they were passed that this is the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was in fact the whole point of moving to Chromebooks is that  Was it you who pointed out somebody pointed out? That's the point  You can lose your Chromebook right log into the next one. And as you say, there's no setup. It's ready  It's got it's got everything you need  Should I use a pattern a pin or a password?  That's one thing this doesn't have fingerprint wish it did

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but this bigger device I think it'd be reaching behind with the fingerprint and all that  But you're right. I when I use my nexus 7 now, it's weird that I have to use a pattern

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it on the nexus 6. It's just yeah, I do too. It's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even turn it on you just touch it and they're so fast now that it's almost too fast  like yeah, like you accidentally touch it and unlocks everything just I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guess I'll do a pin because I do a pin on  Surface and all of that and on my iPad so I'll use the same pin  This keyboards nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a real keyboard it's it's a real core. Yeah. Yeah, the hardware is very nice it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, let's see a restore from my nexus 7 my note 5 my nexus 6p last used today. Let's do that  All apps 159 apps. Yep, this isn't so bad and then you say yes, I'm in on Google now  And this isn't terrible. You have to log in your account  You know, it's not so different and there's and that'll be restoring for another hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And in terms of the multifunctioning and all that you basically since I'm used to operate only in Chrome  As long as I've got Chrome open on it. I  Figured it'll be okay. The only weird thing is that Chrome handles tabs differently in Android. Yeah  As Chrome and it's a bit of it's irritating and sometimes you can go to a Chrome tab

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it will force a refresh of that tab every time you skip to it instead of just leaving it as an instance in memory

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know my imagination Leo or is that does that logo look like a device with Donald Trump's hair?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, I love that that's how you know, it's marshmallow. It's the marshmallow look

Transcript:  The split navigation buttons down at the bottom that's one thing to notice. Oh, okay. So here's recents and here's home

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually a good idea. I've never seen a tablet do that. So the home is the home in the back or on the left  Lower left corner and as it's in landscape mode and on the lower right corner and landscape mode is the recents button  That's actually reasonable  Do wish it there must be I wonder they  They said in some of the reviews. Yes, there are secret key combinations  Why secret?  Tell me like on the iPad control shift home because of it H goes home  I  Would love to see what the secrets are  Doesn't do it on here. How about all H? Oh  Something happened. What's that? You stumbled on a secret key board. What is it? It's the on-screen keyboard  But there's no without keys ABC

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  What  Alt swaps

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So all pops up the keyboard, okay. Okay. There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whatever you've used last. Yeah still there's some oh, no, it goes to emoji. You're right. That's the default

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something funny though about a hardware keyboard. That's weird key key that pops up an on-screen keyboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You the keyboard  Shortcuts Leo, you found him

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are says pixel that was that the pic well, this is pixel see yes as part of pixel see okay  So general shortcuts  Home is search and enter unless you change search to search enter. Oh, I guess cuz well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Overview is alt and tab search is Google now, which is nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I mean I know but I'm just asking where you under general shortcuts. Oh, there's like a help  There's like a page. Oh, it's a whole page

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's not secret tells you how to get the brackets. I was mistaken  What's the dot-dot-dot button yeah right here, what does that do actually that plus Oh gets you a left bracket plus it also pulls up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The keyboard. Oh, it's like in scientific

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In scientific stuff well then hit oh when you get the bracket so do dot dot dot and then oh where you get the bracket

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  dot-dot-dot-oh  So there's a key dedicated to scientific symbols, but there isn't a key for caps lock

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shut up, I don't know what I'm doing now  Okay, so if I do this and then oh  That's what same time  Yeah bracket yeah, you know that's right  Yeah, and P is the right bracket. Yeah, all right so that and then one is tilde

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No that one does something else and then for the chrome app it uses control as the key

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you use that tilde you got to really want it you have to want it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Well anyway, nobody cares because nobody else has a pixel see but I  Guess we did find a new key. I didn't even notice that but there's that there's a weird kind of dot dot an ellipsis key  Mr.. And that pulls up scientific that pulls up  Stuff that oh you know what that is that stuff. That's not on the keyboard  These are extra things that are not on the keyboard so that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The pixel team went on reddit this morning to answer questions and says right is coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, see I think that's all it really I would say that's all it really needs and then you're just kind of at the mercy of  Developers by it's getting hot is it oh yeah, really yeah, this is that new tegra x1 chip, which is  It's actually what I think it's one of those weird chips. It's got two speeds two cores  Uses day-to-day uses a slower one, but if it needs it'll kick into high gear. It's also a hot plate and a  Meter yeah, this is a good a good palm warmer. Actually. It's all right up on the left side I  Like it, and I think this is I'm gonna use this I think I will use this cool. Yeah  And I'd love to see split screen  so as you were saying the pixel is very popular in schools according to  The Chromebook you mean the Chrome what I say the chrome not the pixel the Chromebook  Yeah, I doubt very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah more than half and this is devastating  Sort of for Apple and really devastating for Microsoft  And it also says the Chrome OS is not going away, right? That's right  It also has to be said though that the performance of the Chromebook in schools is a US phenomenon  Internationally, it's not interesting. Well, it's down in the single digits in some some interest markets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But killing it in the US education market. Well, I think more and more schools want to do a one-to-one program  So they sit down and say oh  By the way, that might be what the pixel see is all about. Hmm. They sit down and they say all right  We want to do a one-to-one program. Do we buy a Mac a Windows?  iPad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chromebook this what this is. Yeah, the old deal tablet versus laptop now you get this is that's what this is  And it's not and nobody's gonna buy that but it's a demonstration project to show manufacturers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody quick make a cheap one of these like that lamp thing. Yeah, this is actually too expensive, isn't it? Yeah. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  But there are Chromebooks 200 bucks right so  That's that's interesting. I think schools do want  I think they very much want tablets in fact, it breaks my heart whether our local school district here is doing a one-to-one program  With iPads. Yeah, and they're just not it's just a waste of money. It's just throwing away money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're absolutely right. They do want tablets, but they shouldn't they should want  Yes a $200 Chromebook write a keyboard and you know as a touchpad on it and all that kind of stuff  That's ideal for students  But essentially what they're doing is they're caving to student demands a generation of kids who grew up on smartphones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not even students parents. I really think parents are what determine this and parents get all excited when they hear all they're giving them iPads  That's so modern right there. And if you go for the future, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So get a load of this on the on the pixel help page  Recovering your pixel C using a USB device is not supported if you're having trouble recovering, please contact us. Oh, no, that's not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that will but that's like an Android phone you can recover an Android phone, right?  I mean you just have to know what you're doing. I would think so

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you order one mr. Jarvis? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, I'm pissed. I'm just like like Jason there. I'm pissed at you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they then maybe they you know, they didn't send me one as a review unit so they felt bad  Yeah, and they said well, let's get Leo's out the door. Go ahead  Would you see that one that says Jason how on that other Jeff Jarvis one put that aside?  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't we go ahead and process that for a good 24 to 36 hours before we change that to shipping  Here's the real thing. Yes, did you pay for the top of the line delivery? Yeah, 22 buck delivery. I just thought of something

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can do Skype on a tablet  Skype is I do the show  Of course yes  Does the problem is I've got to get it  I'm just gonna bring a little router so I can plug in a regular USB headset  Yeah, does that device have any sort of plugged in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ethernet probably not

Transcript:  Bought one of these but I don't know does that work. We don't know. Yeah, it does. This is this is the seat  What works with a Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know if that'll work with the pixel got one hang. Oh, I see

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm better. I don't know. It's a good portion. We will find out  We will find out indeed, but I would find out now if I had mine, but I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alas, so basically what you're saying Jeff is Google has figured out a way for you to not use Google Hangouts  Yes, thank God

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank God

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love how dedicated Jeff is to doing these shows on using Google software or and or devices  Yeah, other way the sound sound last week. I didn't listen to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But when Matt and I had to be in the room without a headset, how was it?  Okay, oh, okay, you were because you were to complain usually you'd complain might have a choice I didn't think oh, okay. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, yeah people other people come the chat room complained. Oh, sorry, it wasn't hard  Wasn't horrible was it Jason? I don't know what the final edit sounds like but I think all things considered last week was one of those shows where

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Such a good show. We'll take it the way we can because there were so many different voices  Thank you for getting Richard Gingras  Richard Gingras was great to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know how he felt about it, but it was a great discussion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't do you think I mean we kind of attacked we were talking about amp, Gina  And and Gingras is of course as head of Google News kind of spearheading this effort  And it was a little challenging I thought it was I'd love to hear you grill him because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So many companies like Google Microsoft others. They're so  They're they're they're optimistic about things that never work and they act like oh, it's just all gonna work  Just fine. It's all gonna be just fine and nobody's gonna no it isn't gonna be just fine  It's gonna be different from what you're saying  100% certain that it's not  100% certain that it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was funny Leo because somebody came to me somebody who's implemented amp sent me email today saying I just watched the show and Leo doesn't understand  Amp no Leo's playing devil's advocate to ask all the questions everybody's asking. Well, what I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What how do I what do you think? Do I not understand that? What is I think you understand that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think I think you're more can see you there were so you're very concerned about you don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I  Want to be like Donald Trump cuz it's life is so easy for him. Yeah  Whatever the hell comes into your mind  No one understands amp no one really no one they're stupid foolish people they made amp they're foolish people you're stupid  And by the way, and by the way, I made a version of app. That's way better. I'm a genius. I  mean, I know I  He's got I would love not to have any F to have zero  Reflective this zero self-insight zero just like confidence without any  qualms at all, I mean  Maybe I think I bet he was like that when he was eight. Yeah. No, no, I think it's extreme. He was an eight, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he has no sense of  Anyone else it's all about him everything's about him and it's just it's just pathologically narcissistic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't know. I think I don't want to I don't want to deprecate him like that. I think it's it's oh I do  Well, I mean, I want to deprecate him, but I don't want to I don't want to I want to give him some credit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well to pull this together  I mean companies are kind of you know, it's their job to act like Trump right like so like Mike was saying  You know companies are just like this is just gonna work. I mean, that's a job, right? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our job to say well, maybe no, right, right. That's our job. You're right. Exactly. They don't have to do our job  We have to do our job. The problem is right  In many cases the press no longer does this job which makes it really bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but the the the issue you were zeroing in on was the perfect issue because  It is it was essentially about how everything depends on Google servers working flawlessly  And by the way, remember when half the internet went down when all the things supported by Amazon web services  When that crash that had a glitch and there was like six hours where half the stuff that we used in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even mind the single point of failure  I just feel like it's kind of a land grab for Google to say or any company say  Especially a for-profit company to say oh, by the way, everything's going through our servers and only

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't get any benefit off it going through their servers, it's not like why not  Because I think they're careful about that as they get smashed  They're giving you free as Richard said a lot of companies pay a fortune for their CDN. So this is free CDN  Yeah, no, that's that's good. The company that should hate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like I feel like my any company that comes along and says but this is free  Yeah, and this is a for-profit company and they say but no I'm giving you a free CDN  You gotta ask yourself why are they giving me a free CDN? What's in it for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because we will use the web exceptionally more when it's faster. Yeah, right  When I give people the amp demo they're amazed sorry, I'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's a Google's interest right for the web to work better, right?  They they want people on the web  But I mean Leo like if that's the case, I mean everybody should be questioning everything that Google's ever made because it's been free forever  You know, I'm totally with you. I'm completely with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see we get okay. So gmail free but  Gmail is not free because Google just loves everybody and wants the web to work better gmail is free so that they can  Scan through it and give you better ads or ads that are they could charge more for their ads  It would be foolish to assume that any for-profit company. I don't think it in this day and age you could say well  No, we just we use I mean I bought this for a long time. Just use the web more. We're happy  It's more than that. That's not enough to say that I think there's always  Gotta be they have there's publicly held they have a responsibility a fiduciary responsibility to stakeholders to make money  Not to give money away not to give away services  they're gonna put advertising on amp and by doing this by the way, they short-circuit this whole issue of  ads and  overactive ad networks and basically it's an advertising blocker that blocks all ads except Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's ads, right? No. No, he dealt with that last week. No, that's not true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said it's not gonna he said other ads could be in there here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true or not. Yeah, it's up to Google's in charge of whether or not that's true in this in this scenario  Theoretically and the other thing is that you can't even quite compare in you know  inbox or Gmail on the one hand with amp on the other because  Inbox and Gmail that's a service you opt into and you you agree to the thing  You don't read and all that stuff and it's a service. It's on the end  It's a you know, but but amp is like how the internet works  So it's a little different to be going proprietary on that stuff because I agree  I mean the reality is that if you look at the history of the internet in the early days  Nobody could make money on the internet  And so all the standards were developed in a spirit of cooperation and so on with a small number of people who are involved  In that stuff and now there are multi hundred billion dollar  corporations who all are trying to make tons and tons of money on the internet and so we can't it's harder to get standards going and  So the standards bodies you kept harping away about how it should go through the standards bodies. Well, that's why  Because the the interests it's a wish you'd been here  You're so much more well Facebook, you know Facebook has their ultra proprietary standard for speeding up the internet  And and and so Google's gonna have an apple does exactly and that's not how it's supposed to work  Companies with billions at stake shouldn't be determining internet standards

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, then the standards process should be better and it's not well  So this is what I said to the publishers if Google didn't do this  We'd be here a year later say pages are all slow and screwed up. Nobody comes to them and they're all installed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know what the market by the way  Freehand the magic freehand of the market the market has a lot to say about that. That's why we have ad blockers  The markets absolutely weighing in saying and and you know, I don't think that's a bad solution  That's what who goes trying to save here trying to prevent that they say whoa  Better than ad blockers will do it  But you know what the market is weighing in the market saying and this is too slow  So we're gonna run ad blockers. We're gonna run script filters. We're not gonna let you do all that crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, who says there has to be a kind of Moore's law for internet bloat  well, if the internet is way too slow, then why are  Companies building web pages that are so slow. You can build them faster. You can build them. You don't have to excel constantly accelerate  The the size of the page that loads it what who says you have to do that, right?  You know, it's got it. It's got a whatever the demand is that people are choosing, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the other thing that bothered me. I mean, yeah, I have a one megabyte  Background on my website, but I do that because it's aesthetic. It's pretty and people's it makes it a better website  I don't like the amped version because it's ugly and yeah, it's fast  But I mean, it's nice that people could vote. I mean, it's nice to say, okay  I want the amp version or the non amp version

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The vast majority of internet users will never know what amp is or even know that it exists

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's Intel inside. Yeah, right. Well, and that's what essentially bothers me is they saying well, don't use the image tag  We'll do our own thing. Don't use JavaScript unless we approve it that bothers me, but that's what I've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've got it. They've got to deal with the governance sooner. I think quickly. Yeah, I think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I know I didn't want to bring this all back up again  but but I did want to report card because maybe I don't understand app and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe maybe the things I brought up weren't well if you want to ask that person to come on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been can explain it is it somebody who would really knows or is it just some yeah, absolutely  Oh, okay. No, it really really really good. All right. Yeah, please explain I get amps blame  Continued momentum for the amp  project  Google's going to send traffic to amp pages in Google's to in Google search in  February  Twitter is gonna experiment with linking to amp content provided by publishers early in 2016  Does that mean they'll link they'll take a link that I put in and automatically amp it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they'll if there's an amp version. They'll go to the amp version. That's what I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if I put in a link to an article, they will replace it with the amp version of ice which thing  Yes, I believe so Pinterest currently testing publisher amp pages in their iOS and Android amps apps  founded the amp pages load four times faster and eight times less data and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's eight times less data. That's interesting. Yeah. Well, that's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Certainly the market has something to say about that. We don't you know, we know it was constrained banner at the mobile  line viber and tango  Which our messaging apps will do what Twitter is gonna do link to amp content  That means I guess again translate you URLs. I'm not sure I'm thrilled about that  Feel like if I put a link in it should go to the page as I linked to the page that somebody says  Well, this is the better one  CMS providers like WordPress  are  Supporting it as well WordPress will support all publishers that wish to enable AMP pages starting in January  in  Analytics comm score chart beat Google Analytics and parsley will have amp support in their tools  that's important because many analytics tools use Java's lose a  Client-side JavaScript and amp would block that right? So if you're gonna use chart beat  It will amp would make it stop working. So you'd have to provide a special amp version of chart beat  Four key areas of the amp project advertising the initial roadmap for ads faster ads ads that can resize support for viewability  Integration with data management providers and sponsored content. Well, it just looks more and more to me like this is the Google version of the Internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's but they're but they're I mean yes, I'm  Trying to carry Google's water here and not know enough about it  But I think this is their answer to the closed internet which is Facebook and this is them trying to make it open  Now you don't have to use maybe  Two questions if Google said okay screw that be in the CDN. We won't catch any content because it makes you nervous  Does that make you more comfortable because you can do that. You don't have to use Google's can. Oh, I know they're third  Potentially the third party I would imagine them be tons of those right? I think more it's about the Google setting the standard

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which job is governance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly what I've said I've said to whatever when we were at these last two Google events where I was I've said that  That you've got to get and and some of this really smart publishers said, you know, we trust you  We're glad you built this is good  but but the thing about governance, which is funny is is  What works in open source? Tell me if I'm wrong here, but what works in an open source project is it's not that oh  I pick you to be in the governance committee. No  What works in open source is you're a big contributor thus you have a role in governance  So we don't know who's contributing yet  So there's a bit of a lag a sick a patient there, but they've got to get people and there's a lot of developers working on  it, but but it can't be Google's hand-picked  Fellow travelers either yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and by the way this I should have said this is Richard  Gingras's post from a couple of days back about and progress they say yeah  Yeah, they say advertising companies that have expressed their intention to support amp include outbrain aol tabula open X double-click adsense  Pubmatic integral ad science moat smart ad sense server crux polar nativo and teds TV  I don't see a ol I don't see if I ads Apple's solution  What about Yahoo?  Yeah, yeah, well what about Yahoo? I mean they aren't they still in that business at least for  Tick tick tick tick tick for another week. What is going on with Yahoo?  It's it's unclear cuz you know we saw that Wall Street Journal article that said you know what the board is gonna meet and  They're gonna fire Marissa, and they're gonna sell everything off, and then we came to the conclusion on twit on Sunday  Well, this is probably a planted post by activist  Yahoo investors who want this to happen because of course they want to get their money out  part of it prompted by the fact that the IRS refused to say whether or not the sale of the  Yahoo Japan and Alibaba assets would be a tax-free  sale  Everybody thought it wouldn't cost them right and then all of a sudden there could be a ten million dollar tax bill  Oh, well, maybe we'll do something else so they start  brooding about going to the Wall Street Journal and placing  Stories saying well, what if we sold the core assets?  But now but it's unclear really what the board's gonna do one thing that's happened Max Levchin is off the board  He was I think a Marissa Meyer  Higher so he she brought him in so former

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Peter Kafka had a great tweet which was old Yahoo plan 2 plus 3 equals 5 new Yahoo plan 3 plus 2 equals 5  But I think the difference is there the board everybody got nervous about the tax implications right spinning off the  Investments so the investments have to be in the core company, which they can rename the core company like, you know, can that it's all made up  This is like alphabet. It's all made up. It's all it is  Spin off one spin off the other it really doesn't matter  And if you're a stockholder you get stock in all the spin-offs, but the but the market  Lost like a billion and a half dollars. Oh Lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think let's talk about this  You know, you're a huge I mean you were a Flickr user  I think you you you had like me a lot of soft spot for Yahoo has Marissa Meyer been good for Yahoo over the last  three years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Following I think that she had a good start there for a while  I mean from and I'm looking this purely from just like a consumer product perspective that they released a couple of interesting  Update, you know new apps in the beginning. There was like a there was a news app  There was a weather app. There were a couple of promising new things Flickr had a few improvements and I thought oh, you know  This is this is great like that, you know, Yahoo's gonna be part of my daily life again, and that didn't that didn't quite happen  I'll be totally honest. I haven't been following. I didn't realize that this was going on  I haven't been following that the store, you know that the board and that you have been busy to code in haven't you?  So I just it's just less interesting to me  That part I'm not sure I'm not sure what's gonna happen  I I think that the hope that we all had when Meyer  Was installed I guess to say was you know that Yahoo is gonna have really relevant consumer products again  And I don't I don't think that that's happened. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think we overestimate the ability of CEOs to affect  already large companies that already have an entrenched culture and  This is kind of like a OL in the sense that you know  She took I thought it was a good move for her because I don't think that if this fails  Which it was always likely to do it. It's really her fault. I don't think it was salvageable  I think she's a very competent person  She she was very much using the Google Playbook on what she was trying to do, but she didn't have Google to work with  She didn't have the world of Google the culture of Google to work with she had what she had  Well, Yahoo has always done is they've always  Since they used to have what people used to use, you know the whole the whole model of having a portal which was you know  a completely defunct and now  completely obsolete  Way to use the Internet. They just acquired things they acquire companies  They've acquired probably hundreds of companies humbler was 1.1 billion dollars  Well that but see that's what she came in and in that culture with those advisors with what they had to work with all  They had left was okay. Let's keep buying companies  And so what is Yahoo?  Nobody can answer this question because it's just a bunch of companies that for some reason are owned by one company  So I just think I mean I I'm on the outside. I'm not on the board  I'm not you know in the executive suite at Yahoo, but it seems to me that it's just over  Close it sell off the pieces and just be done with it. It's the Yahoo cannot be turned into another buying right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let's let's forget, you know Verizon buying the whole thing and putting it with AOL  And this wonderful new graveyard  What are the things that are valuable in Yahoo?  Yahoo finance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The weird thing is that when you in the value in Alibaba is about 35 billion the okay remember the stock market's valuing it  I haven't seen the latest but around 50 billion. Yeah 35 billion for Alibaba  What was it 15 billion for Yahoo Japan the core business?  Six they by the way the cash they have considerable cash  They have considerable cash make that 32.9 billion  So we can't the value the market camp the value that the market is assigning to Yahoo is less less than than the Alibaba  Share staking yet, which to me I don't  So I see a scenario like I don't understand it. We're I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See scenario where the Alibaba steak becomes a financial vehicle and that becomes you know new Yahoo one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then that's silly what Yahoo will be is their stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan  That will be what Yahoo will be and then there'll be the Tumblr company or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a tracking stock. Yeah, and so then if you take if you take Yahoo functions, then what the heck Marissa?  Go ahead, you know, whatever do whatever you want any value you can out of it  That's one way to look at it  Another way to look at it is to cut it up in pieces which you know again, so so what's valuable?  This flickers humbler value. Yeah, it's a lot value tumbler has value. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo finances well the question though is tumblers value equal to what they paid for it or less at this point  Probably not hard to say. Yeah, but there's also somebody raised this in the in the chairman  Maybe Gina, you know from your programmer friends, but there was the thought that  Meyer had kind of alienated the engineering team. They had the good programmers left. She certainly a lot of  High level executives even some she'd brought in left and there were some very expensive departures

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean she had a nearly impossible job  She made some controversial decisions like the work at home decision which not working from home decision  Which I actually think was was reasonably justified. She's a hard-ass in a good way  She's a product person  So which is why I hope that this was this was gonna be about turning Yahoo into a product a product, you know company  There was this mythology around her, you know hand hand drawing the logo, you know  The company even though she's not a designer but like this hands-on your old per sleeve do you think?  To be clear like I'm not I think that I'm still a huge fan. I think she's great  I didn't mean to throw her under the bus by being like this didn't turn into the consumer product company that I thought  It was gonna be I think that the tumbler purchase was was right on I think tumbler. I think tumbler is hugely valuable  It's a vibrant social network of young creative people. I mean  and you know, I flickers is used less but  Yeah, I mean she had she had it, you know a nearly impossible task to turn things around I don't know  You know, I don't know what's what's going to happen. But the really impossible task was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  asshole investors

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really the problem should make it private

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like actually that was one thing we talked about is that perhaps they could raise the money to take it private  About that Marissa I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As long as Marissa's reputation is still good the Silicon Valley, which I think it is  Given that the value of Yahoo  Core is greater than the sum of its parts  Yeah, then what would it take for what would she have to raise to just take that private and be the CEO of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd sell Alibaba the share and then basically what you could do is do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And make it happen like what's gonna happen is Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stay as core Yahoo, they spin off  old Yahoo  And and take that private without any value of the Yahoo Japan or or Alibaba  That's gonna stay that's that's what the investors are saying. We want that that's the only thing it's valuable  So take the in invaluable parts and can Marissa take it private  That's why maybe the board is not throwing her under the bus maybe maybe that's the plan is to say Marissa  Good luck. You can do anything with this  great, and we'll own a piece of what you do and  You know, you'll pay us some some pennies on the on the negative pennies and fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their revenue is not horrific. They they have they've revenue of 1.2 billion last quarter  They had earnings of 76 million last quarter  You know, this is a profitable company. It's not a feeling play. It's a great cash flow play

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's yeah, if you were private equity forget it. I think forget  Verizon buying it I don't get that but if if if if you could if private equity could put up enough money to take  This thing and leverage buyout  Given the negative value. I think she could then  Don't stop and maybe you sell stuff. Oh, yeah, you're right about you're right about about  Tumblr Gina and when I took my daughter's high school class last year when she was there over to see Katie Couric as we're going  The elevator they didn't say oh, we're in Yahoo. They said we're Instagram. Can we see Tumblr?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we see Tumblr, but does that still the case this year? That's the problem. This stuff is very temperate  That's true. I am looking at the the net earnings from a year ago or six point seven billion  This year 76 million this quarter. So so year over year  That's not the revenue was up, but the earnings were down by a factor of ten  I mean that's or more of a hundred. That's a significant  So I can see why this maybe or maybe they're not jerks, but I see what the shareholders are a little nervous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think just intuitively that the concept of  Just buying companies and and and going after the synergies they always talk about in acquisitions is a delusion  Yeah, there are no synergies  Some of these companies some of these properties and I'm looking at the Wikipedia page for  Yahoo own sites and services the list of ones they've closed is much longer by the way than the ones they still have open  One they have open is probably like four or five dozen Yahoo Sports Yahoo Travel Yahoo TV  Yahoo's all those different things some of those are being carried by other companies and  I think that to the greatest extent possible. They got to stand on their own. That's the genius of alphabet  Because what they're doing is they well life sciences now and now called verily  Or whatever these companies have to live and die on their own  Yeah  each of them could turn into a monster and  Some of them could remain tiny and that's what should happen to individual properties that are not connected to other properties and Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right. By the way, some of Google's investments, you know, uber and such. Yeah could could go not could could go Alibaba  But that's it's isolated enough  Value of the core company exactly exactly. Yeah, it's really good point and it doesn't tarnish the reputation etc

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right part of Yahoo's problem is reputation everybody thinks they're old and busted they're a dinosaur and I  Think that an alphabet style model, especially if it wasn't public for the you know, non Alibaba properties would be  Could really work for them. Hmm, and I think I think it's even a possibility given the fact that Marissa is  Really in that Google culture she's you know, she really sees Google as the as the the company culturally  Mm-hmm. So I like I like your plan. All right, let's do it. Let's do it. Let's become hostile investors

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem. Yeah  Even a share of Yahoo comes with pitchforks and torches. Let's take a break. Yeah having fun. Jeff Jarvis is here Mike Elgin  most importantly most importantly  She's a trip Annie is here. Yeah, we're just gonna keep kissing your butt until you come back damn it  There's more coming we have more gifts coming your way right here. I just had the first one. What's that?

Yeah  There's something about making a meal for the people you love it is I I feel like it maybe this is cuz that's how I grew  Up but this I feel like that's one of the best ways to show somebody you love them  and when you make them a meal that is  special and unique and has  wonderful ingredients is helpful, but  incredibly delicious  It's just the nicest thing one of the nicest things you can do for somebody blue apron makes that possible by by get setting you up  This this they're like your wingman, you know, they're setting you up with all the ingredients you need fresh from the farm  They all use local farms fresh meats fishes. They have vegetarian too  so if you're vegetarian dough, there's every diet need can be accommodated and  Then I'm always water so I do these ads and then they give you the recipe card and you can make in less than an hour  You can make an incredible meal  For a loved one for date night for just a special occasion, this is amazing  They have family plans too so you can feed your family and with kid-friendly ingredients and so forth  It's less than ten dollars a meal is very affordable  Each meal about five to seven hundred calories a portion and they're incredible stuff that you probably wouldn't even think of  You know, I I know I find myself on a red  I always make kind of the same five things over and over but imagine spiced pork chops with charred poblano salsa and  sweet potato mash

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I love about blue apron two things I love about it  One of them is the you just mentioned at the ingredients they send you ingredients that like where would you get this?  Yeah, I have no idea what sort of I would have to go find some

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Figure that's funny that you should say because I figure oh Mike Elgin knows what Pharaoh is. He probably cooks with it all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do know what Pharaoh is but sometimes there's a lot of a call those the Mike Elgin ingredients  We're watching the the video here and one of the ingredients was Turkish yogurt, okay Turkish yogurt, what's that?  Well, it's it's you know, Greek yogurt is very thick. It's even thicker than that  Wow, and I actually make I do make Turkish yogurt, but most people I never get it  I had yeah, you can't get it. Yeah good good  But they'll just send it to you stuff from the you know, the you know, I've had the weird unique bok choy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish I could remember the name. It was the best bok choy ever had and it was it's completely unique. Yeah  Things like watermelon radishes. Yeah, I just I  This is part of the fun of it. It opens your eyes to new ways of making things  This is Jason Howell making his lamb shawarma and the recipe shot with glass  Yeah, it was yes. It was yeah  The Google connection in there, of course because he's using both hands  So here's the deal you get two meals free to try this out right now blueapron.com slash twit  blueapron.com slash twit and  You really get a sense of what this is like and I just encourage you to do it and make it a special occasion get  some candles  Some silver some china nice china, maybe a good bottle of wine and make it a blue apron night tonight blueapron.com  Slash tweet you'll have fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks Jason man the final  And then the next picture it wasn't taken because I was taking a bite. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know and it made the glass fall off his head it was so good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I can't stand hearing people chew their food. So the glass that would be a real problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is this step inside your photos with the cardboard camera you can make very neat very cool. Tell me about this very cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so this is just making a  Panorama with with the cardboard app and then you put the cardboard on and you can you can now see that it's instant demonstration of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cart of immersive photography, but it's more than that because it actually processes 3d from the video that you take. Oh neat  So it's creating 3d video with just your camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someday you'll be able to view it without the app but right now you have to do it in the you posted that Star Wars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  3d immersive video clip right or somebody did somebody didn't you I don't think it was my best scobel on Facebook you there are places  Now you can see these YouTube Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but the what's what's brilliant to me about this is of course Google's has had photosphere for a long time  And right people always take photos fears wrong  The right way to take a photo sphere is you hold it you hold the device in one place and you turn it like you rotate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the access. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when you move a foot or so each time you  In this app it's good. Oh because it gives you a slightly different angle which gives you the stereoscopic effect  This is all about a stereoscopic effect the illusion of 3d and depth  Okay, and that's what's great about this and so you want to move it at six inches to a foot each time you take another  Shot because you see the objects that are closer a little bit  You know on this side of it then you in this side and then it creates that illusion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the cardboard camera as opposed to cardboard exactly that for one exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have to take it with the cardboard camera this photo. Yes. Yes  And it goes into your photos and does it sync up to Google Photos and all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, you have to look at it within the app  So you have to use cardboard with this app to view it right now Android only right now  So I think eventually it'll be like that Gina. It'll be something you just go stand up in front of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And turn around and do it. Yeah do it. All right, and it records sound too, which is kind of cool  Does the sound move around? Oh, so the sound is on so it says sound on  So will the sound better stand up? You better stand up to do it. I have to do a full

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rotation all around you well, I'm gonna rotate and share that's gonna be easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you you don't want you don't have to do a full photos for you can do a little brief panorama  Oh, you can okay, you're after the stereoscopic effect more than the panorama

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fones smoothly to the right. It told me to slow down. I was doing it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to rotate on the chairs axis. That's the key, right? The chair is gonna hit the mic in a second

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, yeah step one get a dr. Evil chair

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The back of that thing this is funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Connected to the matrix

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I spilled everything. Oh my god, it's all all the humanity you destroyed the pixel see  He was worth this 3d image geez Louise Leo, we should stop doing that folks don't try this at home pretty much everybody  Sorry, it was I didn't know that was there. This is a fun episode of hands-on demos

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's churning on this now. Yeah, it takes a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's almost done. Here's done. It's a lot of churning going on. It's computing. It's done computing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, now what do I do? I have to put on cardboard to do this put on the cardboard  I mean you don't have to you can tap on it. Yeah, and just go like that go tap the cardboard button

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and then it'll give me the cardboard and then that'll go away in a second. Uh-huh. And there you go. That's oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you look at it in cardboard, you'll see the stereo scope  Well, you may not see much stereo scope because you didn't move off the axis, but well, he did though  He carved a circle in the cardboard because it's funny watching you. It's not good TV to me watching me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's fucking it's like you can't see that's not like that. When you take your earplug out. We'll just make fun of you  you should put on your headphones though with this right because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, you get the audio you get the you could do I think you could you so you can record what?  Yeah, it is neat to have audio in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't really I didn't know that it doesn't really fit. Oh, yeah the old car's harder. Oh crap

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, where's your when I see it this is where's this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is that I'm seeing the interface you're seeing well cuz you got it where's your view man

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a live view. I have a live view of the interface. That's weird. All right, let's do that again  Yeah, so where is this?  There we go. Now it's doing it's right. All right. No, I went back. It's doing you know what? It's the NFC is changing  No, but what is it doing?  Look at it's look what it's seeing it's seeing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got the menu screen of the app in 3d. He he doesn't understand amp  So I don't understand anything. I don't know how I survive. Thank God. I can breathe and you and you run tech shows what what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hell that's the same picture. Oh, I see this is the VR interface  You could tap any of those when that menu comes up and supposedly jump right into it. So if I do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See it using a different viewer switch. Oh, you can do other viewers. Let's see what the other viewers are  We have so you have to you could tap it into the other viewers because I have the gear VR at home

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yeah, all right. Can I post this anywhere? No, you it has to be viewed within the app

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but can he share it with anybody else? Can I just say I can open the gallery, but you must be able to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm. I think right now it's just within the app for you. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think there's something happens when I put it in the cardboard  Because it's looking good out right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what set you set up your cardboard app with a given viewer. You may have set it up with a later viewer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See what I'm saying, I'm seeing the man I'm seeing I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's screwed up  What it is is you're seeing a stereoscopic view of the app interface interface not the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see when I take it out. I see the right. Yeah, wait a minute now. I'm seeing the wrong thing again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's totally bizarre. But this this this app

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a great idea  There's a great idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it also highlights the fact that when we the stuff we call virtual reality is actually lots of things  One of them is virtual reality ones mixed reality ones augmented reality very different from mixed reality  One is immersive video which we've talked about I know Jeff this this is something you've talked about the importance of  Differentiating between immersive video and virtual reality etc. And this is stereoscopic photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only emotion I get is confusion. Like I like what are they trying to tell me like it's a code  I'm like, what do I have to look it up? Like what is the new Oxford English Dictionary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Word of the year is is this yeah this with this is a publicity stunt the what is it? It's not a shrug

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's the crying. It's the crying crying happy tears. Yeah, it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not tears coming out. There's here tears of joy or so. No, it's this  It's hands with things coming shooting out of your head here. I'll find it for you  I

Transcript:  So I'm reading a book now about what what sounds drinking drinking game time. I haven't done this a long time folks  Gutenberg  Damn I have the whiskey ready  Imagine communities and and the argument about how long to print to take over was because Latin was the primary language of printing  until printing started to go into the vernacular and  Latin had been the language of the bilinguals  So to get a big enough market for printing you had to put in Latin  So then when the market spread and people started reading then you could put the books in the vernacular and that's what spread it  And in a way it strikes me that emoji becomes a new kind of bilingual language

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Sorry, that was a weird know what it is. I think you're right. It's it's more expressive  That's I think what you know is selling with Franca  Yeah, it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but there's I mean  There's definitely times when people use certain emoji like within certain communities and it means a thing and like and there are definitely times  I'm like, I just don't know what this means

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you could say the same thing for acronyms. There are acronyms that I look at and I know well that's uh, you know for a  Long time I didn't know what YOLO was and right everybody was using but I wasn't in that kind of crowd

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know, it's preferable though to everybody going to a post  post literate symbol system is if  We all just had the translation services that Google has the Facebook has on by default like right now in Google Plus  You can just hit the translate button and no matter what the language is for the most part Arabic whatever it just translates it in  English I'd love to have the default be just translate everything  Make everything in English and then for the people who speak a prefer another language besides English  They would see it in their language that would be a great way. Why don't we use the amazing amazing translation?  services that now exist  We've solved this problem. That's vexed mankind since the beginning of time and people like that, whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Channel essentially I they missed a bet they could have had that very Murray Christmas on there. Yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's well, yeah when will do this is this is the bit  We always get in if Google will we're a real content company. It would have commissioned  Yeah, something like that. They need to get serious and start doing that right?  Well, or or no, then you'll just scream louder that they're that they're in channel conflict

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I didn't say I would be happy about it, but that's what they  Do  This year on Twitter the traditional post every year from Twitter the big hashtags  Is Google's that guy stuff yet for 20 2015? They changed the name of it  It's not cuz I guys to name more because that's their conference, right? So it's  Hashtag, of course Paris attacks black lives matter marriage equality  There's a lot of recent stuff in here. There's the only thing about  We have the same problem with our year-enders you tend to do this stuff that's recent instead of yes  You remember? Yeah, you remember it. So by the way, tweet TV slash best of you if you remember something from earlier this year  We'd love to love to get your input.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That wasn't that wasn't this year that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  4.4 million tweets seems like ancient history and then Caitlin Jenner joining Twitter  They don't mention the POTUS joining Twitter, but that was another big big event wasn't it looks like YouTube just posted their YouTube rewind

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, all right. Tell you what, let's watch the YouTube rewind, which is there, you know compilation of a bunch of stuff from  It's another trending. Yeah, of course it is  of YouTube stars and videos and memories from 2015 and  Then we'll actually I'll save it. You know what? Well, right as the end of the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one other thing about Twitter that I think is worth mentioning that's fairly recent is that Jeff Bezos started tweeting  Yeah, his first one. Wait, right his role  He's done four now and the last one was he said finally trashed by the real Donald Trump  We'll still reserve him on a seat on the Blue Origin rocket and somebody pointed out that 25% of all his tweets are about Donald Trump

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hashtag send Donald to space next year. Let's have that be on the top list. How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, Hillary  Note that she responded to Trump yesterday on medium. I find fast. Huh? Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The medium juggernaut marches on it does it's become the place Twitter is the place for the off hand response  Yeah mediums become the place for the thoughtful  Full-length response. I guess ev Williams who started both  Probably is thinking we need a long form in a short form

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My my brilliant ex agent Kate Lee is in charge of getting famous people to write there and she does a great job really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Son Jake is working for Hillary really Hampshire, New Hampshire. Yes. Oh, that's good for him  That's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's you know what that's I think the do you think that the candidate who does the best job with social media will be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was thinking about this. So you have Joe Trippi, you know  Howard Dean's campaign manager wrote a book famously saying the revolution will not be televised and and the complaint was you know  It's all commercials and huge amounts of money and blah blah blah blah. The paradox here is that this incredibly rich guy  Trump comes along and he's not spending any money. Yeah, he's made a campaign. He's he yes, he's he's done it off television  yes, he's done it with social media, but he's the evil one and  and  Wait a minute, wait, all right. I don't think it's agreed that he's the evil one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is a candidate some people are like him less than others

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let everyone know that Leo was trying to defend some horrible political tweets and such that will follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The evil one well, well, wait a minute wait a minute  so what there's other people in the running most his most controversial thing is he said when  American citizens who are also Muslims go on vacation. They shouldn't be allowed back in the country. That is evil  You can't deny access to the United States

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was trying to avoid this this is like no, I don't mind dinner. I don't mean that was please uncle Joe don't talk about and by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what Hillary Clinton's piece of medium was it says no Donald Trump  We're not barring Muslims from entering the country  But the point is may is absolutely true that Donald Trump has shaped the discourse by adept use of not  It's not just new media, but mostly mainstream media. Yeah, and and somewhat of social media  He's very adept at Twitter and of language itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean he's he's his style of speaking is it's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Soundbite friendly well in this interesting because of all the candidates if you look at there  What is the analysis they do for grade level of their writing in their speech?  Yeah, something that's it  He created Politico Donald Trump's speech is third grade level. It's by far  The lowest but of course if you're intelligent  And you know that you want to reach the electric electorate I would think that's probably a good way to  Do it yeah, this is the flesh Kincaid grade level  test and for the record  Ben Carson Mike Huckabee Scott Walker eighth grade level John Kasich the next lowest after Trump fifth grade, but Ted Cruz is ninth grade  I see if they have Hillary Clinton here and some of the other candidates. It looks like it's all the Republicans, but hey  You know you want to reach the largest audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but but it's also I think it I think the grade level is a byproduct of the fact that he  He speaks in absolute superlatives  Yeah, everything is either the best or the worst they say short blocky words

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  And he links short blocky words into other short blocky words to create short blocky sentences which he stacks in his short blocky paragraphs  It's but and and by the way, there's a rhythm and a music to Donald Trump's speech  It's actually hard not to watch his speeches right because there's a very musical rhythm to it  There are others who were adept at that like mmm. I don't know some fascists. I could make yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing that's interesting about just is a word nerd and a language geek is it's he he doesn't something that's common in rap  Like Eminem does this a lot where he'll say something  Outrageous, but before you can even process it is on moves on outrageous thing very smart  He always says by the way after he says something that's like wait  What did you just and you you can't react the first thing because you're already trying to process the second thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Listen to this. This is him  Well, this is just this speaks for itself  But he does exactly that technique in this little sound bite from  This was actually in the same speech that he said Muslims should be ban from anything in the internet one. Yeah  I don't know. It's hard to hear

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because of the internet and we have to do says losing a lot of people because of the internet and we have to do something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have I love this. Actually. I'm sorry. I just want to get this so that you can hear it. It's not very loud  Yeah, this is this is somebody on Twitter  The only record apparently that exists of this MSNBC stream is somebody who held their camera kind of at an angle

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because of the internet and we have to do something we have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That really understand what's happening wait a minute we have to see Bill Gates and a lot of other people that understand what's okay  By the way now boom just as you say very adeptly somebody should say freedom of speech and then immediately  Right  Fair I mean I petition the petition. Yeah repetition, but I don't think he's calculated. I frankly think this is how he talks  Yeah, yeah, I don't think this is some sort of he's like some evil genius  Plotting this stuff. This is just how he talks  Close that internet up something close it up and it doesn't matter if you can't call Bill Gates to close the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As there were great there were great treats and say oh Bill Gates tried

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but anyway, I  Don't know what there I didn't want to go down this road, but sorry. That's my fault. No, it's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually with amp couldn't Google close up parts  There you go there you go by the way Mark Zuckerberg did respond to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The complaints about his no no this is this yeah, he did respond to that that's last that's all news  We're talking Muslims here. This is a really nice little post. Yeah, this is about an hour ago on Facebook  I want to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world after the Paris  Attacks and hate this week. I can only imagine the fear Muslims  Feel that they'll be persecuted for the actions of others. There's a very touching article  I think I can't remember I saw it about  Muslim school kids and the questions they now have to face every day in school  Did you plot 9-1-1? Are you part of Al Qaeda?  Are you in Isis as a Jew my parents taught me we must stand up against attacks on all communities  Even if it attack isn't against you today in time attacks on freedom for anyone  Will hurt everyone if you're a Muslim in this community as the leader of Facebook  I want you to know you are always welcome here and we will fight to protect your rights and create a peaceful and safe  environment for you  Having a child he's been he's been spending a lot of time with the max  Yeah, having a picture of him with max. I saw that was that great  It was melting having a child has given us so much hope  But the hate of some can make it easy to succumb to cynicism  We must not lose hope as long as we stand together and see the good in each other  We can build a better place a better world for all people as someone said I don't know who was I saw this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's talking like a like a statesman  Yeah, he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know he has a seat at the table he is invited as as you know our other executives

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but I think there's also a story of the New York Times today about how  How social media is used by by Isis and such and how Twitter can't stay ahead of it today or yesterday  And by the way, not just Donald Trump is saying shut the internet we've got we've got all of them are trying to attack  Not just social media, but also encryption  It's a very scary moment for how the internet ought to work versus how some will use this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To fight the proper internet today our beloved senator from California Diane Feinstein  reintroduced a measure of a proposed bill  that would  Require tech companies including Facebook Twitter and YouTube to alert federal law enforcement about online  Terrorist activity. This is a of course bipartisan bill  Democrat Feinstein and Republican Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina  Insist the bill doesn't mandate the company's monitor customers or take any additional action only that they report potential terrorist activity

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And doesn't that exist isn't that law already in essence if you are witness to a crime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they say it's modeled after an existing law requiring them to report online child pornography and people have pointed out that you know  They are doing that that does happen. Yeah, and quite effectively. I'm a little nervous though about putting  The tech companies in charge of spying on their users. I feel like that is a risky road

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It certainly is and and and you know, let's let's face it  If you were to if I had to bet my own money on who's gonna win the presidency it's probably gonna be Hillary Clinton  But apologies to Jake. Here's a Hillary Clinton statement  You're gonna hear all the usual complaints, you know freedom of speech, etc. Etc. That's kind of like that's foolish stupid foolish people  But if we're truly in a war against terrorism  We're truly looking for ways to shut off their funding shut off the flow of foreign fighters  Then we've got to shut off their means of communicating  No  It's more complicated with some of what they do on encrypted apps and I'm well aware of that and that requires even more  Thinking about how to do it. So she's a little more open-minded about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But still still a scary language

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but but but I think what both of both try what all the candidates are tapping into is the popular notion that  Why are terrorists being allowed to use?  International means of communication to plot terror attacks that that's I think I think this is a huge question for a lot of people  And all this nuance about encryption and like all that kind of stuff is just lost on the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's you know, it's so tempting when horrible things happen to look for kind of superficial solutions to it and  You know, we all want you all want to take action immediately  And of course, that's when you make the biggest mistakes is when you just leap into action and say well, let's fix this  Let's fix this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or this is the problem and if we just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just fix that and I think it's a much deeper problem frankly terrorism and I think if you're going to address it you have to  Dress it its roots, Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so part of the Times article argued that that that Twitter is missing some simple stuff that it goes from you know  ISIS terrorist account one ISIS kick terrorist account ten ISIS terror count fifteen and Jesus they just figured that out or certain photos  In as you know how to analyze Twitter  How hard do you think it would be because because the argument is well we they can't keep up they can't keep up  First how hard is it to find it and second?  Because accounts are killed indeed if I'm going to look for this stuff  How come it's so easy to find it doesn't have taken a while to kind of propagate socially

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you mean for anyone to find yeah, so I want to go in today

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I decide I want to join ISIS because I had a bad day at the office  Right if accounts are being killed killed killed killed killed how do I go to Twitter and suddenly find the latest of 8700  ISIS accounts and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one thing. I think the Times kind of missed yeah ISIS can create a new account, but it doesn't have any followers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well exactly it's what I'm trying to say does it has to propagate socially well, but we also don't know how to what extent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are being contacted privately on Twitter right and and it's invisible you can't search for it  But like you know there's a lot of one-to-one in the recruitment effort you you know they are monitoring Twitter for  People with certain under certain conditions that are feel alienated in certain ways that are certain ages in certain countries  And then they're contacting them and you know if people are already Muslim for example  They can relate to them as a Muslim and start talking to them and sort of lead them down this  path  And you can't find that by searching if it's private

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean look  I you know I think Twitter and these kind of big social networks have created these elaborate  Systems for detecting spam for detecting child pornography for now getting better helping people combat  You know cases of abuse and trolling. I mean I think a lot of the same principles would kind of would come into play  I mean I think that  people have to  Police each other or not police each other, but call out you know you know keep an eye on each other  You know versus putting the the the toll burden on the company itself give give the community the tools it needs to  Help itself and to say this seems a little bit off  You know what what can we what can we do about this the way that you would if you you know met?  You know a child you know a young child a young person in real life  And you thought you know I'm a little bit worried about this kid seems a little lost seems a little distance seems like some you know  Maybe some things aren't going so well  I know it doesn't easily translate to the into you know its social network online, and I'm not saying that it's easy, but  there  You know there is some precedent for this  And you know I think I think that we can you know it's about empowering community to help themselves  And I think you know it is in some way about you know watching for patterns and you know evolving  You know spam constantly evolves too right, but like we pretty much lick that problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is why isn't Twitter doing a better job though of  Finding and suppressing these accounts. I mean the Times point was well  They just incrementing by one surely Twitter could observe and figure this out  They've always tried to change that they don't is it that is it that they the Twitter doesn't want to get in this business I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't I think they're afraid more afraid of erring on the side of of censoring  Content that shouldn't be censored I mean you can imagine  It's a fine line that oftentimes people post things and they're actually being sarcastic or the or or they're they're mocking or the something  And it can be taken by people as being in favor of the thing  They're mocking or being cynical about and so it's that you know languages is is  Can be subtle and sometimes it's difficult to tell whether somebody's just exercising their right to free speech or whether they're  recruiting terrorists for you know or  Whatever I mean it's it's it it seems like an easy thing to do until you try to do it  And then the devil's in the details, right?  In this case literally

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or Krampus  Yes  Krampus Krampus is in the details. That's what I hear anyway. Yes. Let's take a break. I'm so depressed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, when we come back we'll talk about amp again then no that'll cheer me up a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show today brought to you by fresh books, I love fresh books and they get better and better and better  I love what they're doing. We've talked about them before  first started using them more than ten years ago when I was going to Canada one week a month and  Had to invoice them for my time and my travel and my expenses and it was just a pain  It was such a pain. I mean I had first I mean they need they wanted in Canadian dollars  That was like okay, and I gotta figure this out. I got a fire up word. I got a fire up Excel I  Put it off for months and of course if you're a freelancer and you don't bill you don't get paid  So that wasn't a good idea. Amber MacArthur told me about fresh books nice nice Toronto company.

Could you please send a PDF?  I just prefer PDFs. So I'm back to fresh books. Click the PDF button. So we got a perfect PDF  I mean, it's like I didn't love it PDF software. I didn't need mess around with it  It just happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he and then of course if you have expenses you can use the fresh books app to take pictures of the receipts  Get them right into the invoices by the way time and hours if you build by hours  they the app will do that for you and again put it right in there is in the  into the  Invoice they've got some new features, which I really like there's something called deposit  You can get you can get paid up front  So if you cover costs out of pocket, you know and or you've got an ongoing expenses  You can request a deposit in fresh books your client could put money in there for you  Which is automatically dispersed that makes it so much easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like like something with a return see how it feels. Okay, he's made it your own now  Oh, yeah, see us first thing. I mean I but you know, I've installed so many new app  Android devices that I use Nova launcher and I save out my layout and of course, this is a tablet  So it's a little bit different but I know how I want it  So I'm able to get the widgets I want and everything just ready to go  I will do some typing in a second. I there you know, some one of the complaints is that there aren't tablet specific apps  This is Google's  Play news app and I think that they've done it, you know Google at least has kind of made something that works pretty well  Let's see what I think this looks great. This is this is  We've talked about that before let's see about the New York Times if I go into the New York Times, how's that gonna?  Yeah, so there's a lot of white space in the column on the right there  I guess I have to leave room for Zulily. That was the ad had loaded. Yeah, that's all  Well, that's you know, the front page was nice though. I  Think the times does a nice job of that. So that I guess they're a little bit tablet savvy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They use the layup. The time review says it has volume buttons layout and they're easy to reach. Oh  Yeah, there it is, okay, okay, how could you not have a volume button that bothered me no there's yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you time for telling me how to use this  Let's see how a flip board  works  Yeah, I feel like so this is you said you said Gina that this is the layout stuff. That's built into I  should sign into my  Here hide my  Have my screen for just a second Jason if you would  Thanks  I'm gonna log in to I  Like the keyboard. I really like having a keyboard with oops  Oops  With a tablet and I found that with the iPad it's just it's  Better than having to use that on-screen keyboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I have adored my Nexus 7. I still do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks pretty good  Yeah, this is a good I think there's a good replay it's a lot bigger than the next to seven bigger

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He doesn't fit in the pocket anymore  But but as a way to watch movies in the plane and stuff it does look

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean Android, you know has all the support there you there's this concept of fragments where they're basically modules  And you need to find you could be like once you once you surpass this threshold of a screen size then use this layout  And you define you can divide those layouts and just there's you know, XML files. It's not it's really not that difficult  But you know, I think the developers also, you know focus on you know, who's using their stuff, right?  If they're not seeing if a developer's not seeing a whole lot of tablet use  Mostly phone use they're gonna see that Instagram login. Look at that. Look at how stretched that is  That works right, but it looks a little wonky  Like you look at that you go. Hmm. That doesn't that doesn't look like it's gonna work really well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll have an even Google now, which is I mean I should be this should be a three column layout

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that could be that could be three column  I mean you're also your device could be kind of right on the edge of the kind of standard for defining

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what you flip? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, but I presume oh, this is this is a grid. Yeah, this is a  Google Plus  One would expect this to be not a three column. Yeah, but plus has always done that right. It's been responsive  This will be a nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Expands the two yeah, that's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there of course pixel see communities, oh yeah immediately starting up right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody said slack there are a few apps that don't don't know that you're in portrait mode and you have their landscape mode  You have to flip. Oh  That's not good because on this device that's you know, really slack. Oh, well, I think they said slack, but I'll have to I  Think you know this people should adjust to this although it's not the first time tablets have been here is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't know black goes landscape on a six

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina do you have a tip for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know my tip this week is kind of the big  The biggest new feature edition that that good Google's had really this week is which is reminders in  Google Calendar  So I obviously I make a to-do list app. It's pretty pretty low-fi  But I've always been sort of fascinated by how by how Google has really danced around to do  So like they'd never really had their own task app for a while  They had tasks inside of Gmail and then they had keep which has check check boxes and reminders  But isn't really a to-do app. Well, they just added  Reminders which are basically to do's to Google Calendar, which means that you can say, you know, hey  I've got a you know  Call the florist and it'll add this reminder to your agenda to your day  And if you don't get it done, it'll automatically roll that reminder over to your next day  And you can swipe left to mark it as complete  And these reminders are actually the same reminders that you set up in Google keep and they're the same reminders that you can set up  In Google inbox. So these are across all of your kind of your Google apps  it's got that little hand with the with the you know, the finger with the the  String tied around it. So they're calling them reminders. They're basically though. It's a task list  I mean, it's a to-do list and it's got all that kind of nice Google goodness where it knows  You know if you're saying you need to call somebody it'll look it up in your contacts  It'll kind of auto fill the phrases pretty smart  So yeah, that's reminders and that's in the new Google Calendar app or the latest version the Google Calendar app on Android  I believe it's Android only right now  So there it is to do's on your calendar to do's on your calendar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very cool  Mr. Mike Elgin, you got a tip for us or a trick or a toy or a tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a tip. I have a couple of tips. I have three tips  and  We all know that Google Plus was recently redesigned. It was the redesigning was a mixed bag in general  Yeah, they favor brand new users and kind of  Did it in a way that isn't great for a long time hardcore diehard users?  So a lot of the hardcore users are complaining about the redesign  there are three things that really bug me about the redesign and  And I have workarounds for them  So the first thing is that Google used to have by far the best search on any social network not surprising. It's Google and  They still have vastly better search than Facebook  however  I would rank Twitter now as being having much better search than Google Plus after the redesign because  They now don't let you sort by time  You can't reshuffle it so that the most recent post is at the top which makes it useless for certain types of searches  And so they'll show it, you know, the ranking based on relevance and that's the only option  It's a terrible thing  I think they need to fix that and go back to the way it was but the workaround is that you can do the search  And again, this is a kludge on Google search. Oh, so go to Google search use use site  Colon plus dot google.com and then put your search before or after that and you can search for anything  You can even with it, you know, if something's posted  Seconds later it's available on Google search. That's interesting and you can sort by they put that into Google Plus. It's crazy  I don't know. It's so frustrating. Okay, the second thing is and that's a that's kind of an old fact  That's just an idea. We already know how to do site colon searches with that operator. All right, the second thing is  People are complaining that circles have been de-emphasized you launched it here a second ago  And of course you saw a world of communities  so it's all focused on communities and collections communities are  reddit like  Areas where it's all focused around the topic and anyone can post  Collections are based on the person  So each person has their own collections and so you can opt out of certain  Topics that people talk about for example, if you like to follow me about tech  But you don't want to hear my endless see my endless poke pictures of food  You can opt out of my food and drink picks and you just get the tech or whatever  That's what that's what the collections are  It used to be human focused and the content was secondary now  It's content is primary and the humans are secondary people miss circles  So you should be circle based if you miss the circles and you want to bring back the circles  It's very very easy to do and here's how you do it  You go into settings from the left bar click on settings  Then you go into advanced settings down at the bottom near the bottom of the page and under advanced settings  You'll see a thing that says enable circle stream in navigation  Just throw that switch and then look what happens over on the left  You now have circle streams click on that and there are all your circles  Click on those and you are now looking at the stream of those circles just like before so I don't know why they bury this  I understand why they're not emphasizing, but don't bury it  Is there a way to get rid of circles?  Well, if you don't want to follow people you can't I mean you can just you know  You can everybody and you can throw them all in the trash and just have no be following no one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I want people I just don't want the and you can see I've overdone it. I've  Categories up my categories. Yeah  I just like I wish there were some tools you can delete any circle management

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can go into people there on the on the left. Yeah, and you can manage your you know  All the people yeah, and you can circle right and you can delete circles  You can move people around and all that kind of stuff  You can still do the things that you used to be able to do but they've de-emphasized it  I want you to think about in terms of your passion  So if you're into Legos you they want you to be focused on the Lego community and Lego collections and other people's Lego collections  And that's the organizing principle and they don't want to confuse you with too many options  So they're hidden circles kind of right and so anyway, that's that's a way to bring it back  And I recommend everybody do that. It's nice to be able to have friends and family and you know, yeah  In our case twit staff and etc. Right. Okay. Now the third tip is  Going to be less useful for everyone  In in comments now, you can't do good moderation use they used to auto flag people using their algorithm saying  Oh, this person's a spammer or troll whatever so  they would hide it in a certain area where the person who did the post could go and  unflag it and bring them restore it back into the community of  Of comments you can't do that anymore once Google says something is a spammer or a troll that's it  Oh, it's terrible because I you know, the false positives are off the charts, right? I get so many  They should be trying to drive engagement not stifle it and people don't even know that their comment has been  Flagged right nobody can see it except the person who posted it who thinks everybody can see it. It's terrible  So there is no solution to this there's nothing you can do about it other than complain to Google  So I'd like to I'd like to get together a it's all complete  Ma a mob of people with torches and pitchforks to go rush Mountain View and say give us full moderation again  We want to be able to restore or have perfect  Algorithms, which you do not once you have perfect algorithm fine  We don't even until then let us restore people who have made perfectly good content comments

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So those are my two three Google tips and one request I like Google Plus I wanted to succeed  But I don't care if it's a small  Tight group of involved people. That's what I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you know what a public post on Google Plus is a page on the internet  It's like a meeting post doesn't look at that way  Yeah  and I personally like the idea of having comments all in  Order of when they were posted at the bottom rather than the medium process of being able to cherry-pick every little you know  having the comments in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's a thought so I feel like  It would be nice if it looked as good as medium, maybe they need a display an amp version of their display  Well, if you're gonna do amp Google do amp do it on Google Plus where else  Jeff you have a number but before you do that, I know you also want to mention this job posting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it's a big deal for both of us we're as as most of you know by now we're gonna start to finally  We're gonna start the twit  New York outpost at CUNY at my school and we're gonna produce a weekly twitch show on the New York tech sector and the exciting  Life here. I love and I have  money from a grant and I need a producer I need our Jason and  So this person will work full-time from January through May  To get the show going and get the set and do some prototypes of stuff  And then after that become part-time ongoing producer and board up and everything like just like Jason this person will go to  Twit HQ to learn the ways of twit. I have one good application so far, but I need more applications and  So I did a short URL  bit dot do slash twit and why that's  bit.do slash twit and why apply yourself  Tweet it Facebook it pass it on to friends  if you're interested in podcasts and wanted to be in the leading podcast company on earth and  If you are interested in the tech scene, then it's a great gig  And so I wanted to plug that first and I can't wait to be working

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I did yeah company and I know there are a lot of you listening who live in the area in the New York area  Would be I would think be very interesting this and Gina you'll be coming into the studio. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm gonna be right there. I'm so excited about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
