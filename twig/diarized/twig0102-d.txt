Joining us now, actually in the old cottage for one of the  last This Weeks in Google from the old cottage, the lovely  and talented Gina Tripani.  In fact, when she comes back, she's going on a vacation to  China, we will be in a new facility.  So this is her last broadcast from the cottage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'm going to be probably asleep while the show is going  on in China.  But I will be missing you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we'll miss you.  But we've been talking before the show about your trip.  And it's just going to I think it's just wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very excited.  I'm very excited.  I will come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many days?  Two weeks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like 10 days.  10 or 11 days.  Yeah, you got to kind of make it worth the flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's a long flight.  And there is a significant jet lag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I'm sure day one I'm going to be an absolute hot  mess.  A wreck, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Day one, it took me about five days to get back.  Uh oh.  Day one, yeah.  Day one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ambien and red wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There he is, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  Ambien and red wine, he prescribes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Advice from the master.  Or just look at you could just watch  some awesome announcements and that'll put you to sleep.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You, Jeff, are saying that sleeping on the plane  is the key.  I presume you're not recommending Ambien and wine  all the trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that would help too.  It would make the scenery better.  But yeah, no, Ambien and red wine on the plane,  which I know is wrong.  You shouldn't mix the two and all that.  I have a little red wine.  I have an Ambien.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not.  No, I think that's my wife's strategy, as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What the hell?  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Oh, we have to show that.  Who is this?  Who is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm Jeff Jarvis, TV critic for People magazine.  Like many of you, I was disappointed.  No, make that fed up.  No, on third thought, make that enraged with moonlighting.  Reruns, reruns, reruns, nothing but reruns.  I mean, without moonlighting, what was there  to do on Tuesday nights?  Watch the Home Shopping Network?  Start a family?  Read?  Well, the crisis is over.  Moonlighting's back.  Last week at long last, they gave us a fresh episode.  And tonight, they're giving us one that's even fresher.  But there's a catch, a hitch, a cruel trick.  If you didn't watch last week's show,  and you probably didn't bother because you figured  it's just another rerun, then you  won't know what the hell's happening in tonight's show.  But fear not, don't sweat.  I have right here a tape of last week's episode,  and I'll show you all the good parts.  Won't take long.  It all started when David began to say something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that was bothering Matty.  OK, we'll skip that part.  We don't really need the recap.  But by the way, a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I ran out of Grecian formula about a decade ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Between this and page one, I didn't  realize that I was co-hosting with an absolute movie star,  TV star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I'm just going to end by acting correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to use this from now on when you're not here  or you're on phone.  We'll just put that up.  It kind of looks like you.  So great.  No, that's great.  That really is fun.  But I think people don't know about your earlier career  as a television critic.  I was when I was the TV critic at People,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I complained in my column about how moonlighting,  the kids won't know who Sybil Shepherd is,  but Bruce Willis was off the air all the time  because they were being pre-Madonna.  God, I loved that show.  And the producer called me up and said,  thanks for the Valentine.  Why don't you come out?  And it was a great show.  Come out and introduce the next episode.  It was actually quite clever.  It was a lot of fun.  And at the very end of that clip, there's a little gag.  But yeah, I got to go out for the day.  I thought we all had the little gag right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just kidding.  Just kidding.  I'm going to go back, and we're going to see the little gag  because I don't want to miss the little gag.  Come on.  It's YouTube.  So did you post this?  You must have posted this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, somebody else did.  In fact, I actually bought.  Here's the sad part.  Here's the sad egotistical part.  I got excited when Moonlighting went on to DVD.  I bought it at Amazon.  I wanted to see my episode.  On DVD?  No, I was off.  I think it's because they lost track of me,  and they couldn't get me to sign a DVD rights DVD thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever happened to Jeff Jarvis?  Yeah.  Oh, that's kind of sad.  So it was very sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't know who found this where, but something very nice.  So I'll put it up on YouTube.  And people have been laughing at me all day, which is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's great.  Let's watch some more of Jeff Jarvis introducing Moonlighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David decided to do just that and rushed to Maddie's house  at 4 in the morning to share his startling realization with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's after this?  It's after this.  It's all right.  I think it's kind of fun to.  Oh my god, that's Mark Harmon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some would say that's when the show jumped the shark.  It jumped Mark Harmon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It jumped the shark when they hooked up.  The sexual tension is what made that show.  Our Bruce and what's her name going to hook up?  Sybil.  Sybil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to get these DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, have you not seen Moonlighting?  It's great.  I mean, I've heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me make it absolutely clear that my appearance here  on Moonlighting will in no way compromise my integrity  as a television critic.  Sure, it's just a thank you note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good on you.  Good on you.  And you know, as long as you disclose it, it's OK, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, before the internet, you were actually difficult to find.  Is that what the deal was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I find that hard to believe in any case.  Hey, one more person to introduce who is not  a regular on this show but is a regular on the network.  Iaz Akhtar is also in studio with us.  He is, of course, one of the regular hosts on Tech News  Today every weekday afternoon on Twitter Live.  And great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks for having me.  I think about Jeff's clip there.  There's no way to catch up on Moonlighting.  Now you just check Twitter.  Check Google+.  It's kind of interesting to see that.  How would you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As somebody said in Google+, the amazing thing  was this recalls an era where if you missed an episode of something,  you were screwed.  Right.  That's entirely mind bending.  And no Hulu, no On Demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you would have to use a VCR to go back and watch it.  By the way, I'm just curious if the chat room wants to make a guess.  What year that was?  Any guesses on what year that was?  Now don't tell me if you know, but I'm just curious.  Because I bet you they're going to guess much earlier than it was.  No, they're pretty good.  It was 1987.  I just thought people would have thought, gosh,  that must have been a long time ago.  And in fact, it was not.  And really wasn't that all that long ago.  You just look like it was all that.  No, I mean by the VCR, yes, we all looked like porn stars in the late 80s.  If I had video of me, it would have been.  Thank you very much, chat room.  It just sometimes I think it feels like Google Plus better than you,  chat room.  It feels like VCRs and all that seems like so long ago.  And really, 1987 was only what, 23 years ago.  It's not that long ago.  24 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of your generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's because I remember it.  I loved watching that show.  All right, so here we are convened about two hours  after Mark Zuckerberg made his awesome, awesome announcement.  It was pretty obvious when Mark said in Seattle,  at the Seattle Facebook office, the day after Google Plus came out,  we got something awesome to announce next week.  That this was kind of something that they felt they needed to do in response  to Google Plus, you think, Ayes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it seems like Facebook was not in the press as much.  Google Plus was getting all of our love.  The tech people, we love that stuff.  It's like, oh, it's brand new and it's quiet.  It's not like the same noise that's on Facebook or Twitter right now.  And they said something awesome.  Something awesome.  I don't know who it's awesome for.  If you guys didn't catch the news, I believe it's Skype video integration  into Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'll talk about it in a little bit.  But I think that not only was it not awesome,  it wasn't even in any way a direct response to anything that Google's doing.  Because Google Talk, AIM, Yahoo, and MSN Messenger have all had video messaging.  I mean, that's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what you made during the live presentation, Leo,  that it was just catch up.  It's not even catch up with Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's catch up with Google Talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's a big mistake to have oversold it.  It should not have said awesome.  Next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Gina, you agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I do agree.  It didn't feel very innovative.  Although, Hangouts got such great press.  And I think the reason why it did is because it's something cool.  It's group video chat.  That's not enterprise that anybody can use.  It's got this neat kind of design decisions around it,  around moderators and that kind of thing.  The one-to-one video chat just seems like, oh, yeah, every major IAM service  has had this for a while.  I'm saying this, though.  I haven't tried Facebook video chat yet, though.  Well, we can do it right now if anybody wants to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not on it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm on it.  And we tried it right after the broadcast.  Here's the thing that is true.  For the audience that Google Plus is aimed at, this room and everybody  listening, this is like, oh, yeah, sure.  But for the audience that loves Facebook,  I'm not convinced that this isn't something pretty important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's a good addition to Facebook.  No question about that.  It's just not awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's so much easier than even using regular Skype.  So if you have Facebook, you already know about the chat.  The chat's down here in the lower right-hand corner.  You click on it.  And a lot of people will notice immediately there's some redesign here.  And there's even more going to come along with the addition of groups in here.  I don't have that yet.  And then, look, Eileen's calling me.  Well, let me just answer that call from Eileen, our producer.  She picked right up on my request.  Now, this is the beauty of it.  It doesn't feel like Skype.  There I am.  There you are, Gina.  And in a moment, we'll see Eileen.  In fact, it doesn't even really have much control in it.  There's a change of camera and audio there.  Eileen, you don't have a camera, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're also just in the other room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're also listening to TwitLive.  Yeah.  All right.  So this is a pretty lousy demonstration of how great this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that a movable or is that blocking your Facebook experience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a normal.  Now, this is on the Mac.  If you want to go full screen, it uses not a special full screen  command as Skype does, but it uses the regular controls for the window.  The picture quality is excellent.  And look at no controls, no branding.  And I think this is part of what is, in fact, innovative about this,  is that it's I'm going to hang up on you, Eileen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It works better than that.  I'll call somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have to have installed to get this to work.  Do you have to have the Skype client installed?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what happens is you go to chat, and it looks exactly like this.  And you say, oh, let me chat with somebody.  And you look, and there's a little camera.  Start a video call.  The first time you press it, it says, we're  going to need to install some software.  It runs a little bit of Java.  It's in Java, by the way.  Even on the PC, the PC will download a Java loader, an EXE loader.  On the Mac, it's just a jar file.  And it installs fairly quickly.  It's a small little bit of Java.  And then that's it.  Now it's good to go.  So I think it's actually appealing to the people it's  aimed at, who are prime Facebook users.  In other words, your family that's not the geek.  For them, it's going to feel pretty innovative, I think.  They're not aware of Google+.  They're not on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing is you don't have  to find anybody else's contact information.  What's your Skype handle?  You just have the ability to go, here's my Facebook list.  And I'm just going to be able to do a video chat with them.  Instead of going through Skype's not so great search.  I don't know if you guys ever tried that.  But when you try to find somebody with a very common name,  it's very difficult to find them.  Good point.  And if you go through Facebook and you  have all these ways to actually confirm who they are,  it's a lot simpler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it may not be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's awesome to a community.  To a community.  I mean, I think now I see.  I mean, when I think about my in-laws,  on both sides of my family, just absolutely live on Facebook.  And if I said getting a Skype call arranged to see the kids  is like a little bit of a nightmare.  Install this, OK, sign up for an account.  What's your Skype name?  This is just going to be instant.  So I think awesome is relative.  Inside the Facebook community, this is a big deal.  And I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they did make a mistake in adding.  Now it's three things.  The group chats, which is even more ho-hum.  These are things any chat client has had all along.  Group chats, video chat.  What was the third thing?  Just design.  Yeah, redesign so that you could see the group chats.  They probably should have left the group chats off.  Just done the Skype thing.  They did have Tony Coats, who is the new CEO of Skype,  come on stage.  I think the thing that's most interesting to me  as somebody covering tech is the fact  that Skype is about to be owned by Microsoft.  And this puts Facebook squarely in the Microsoft corner.  Microsoft is a minority shareholder.  Bing already integrates Facebook.  And now a Microsoft product, Skype,  is going to be powering video chat and Facebook.  It is an interesting.  Why do you think that Facebook is  so willing to get in bed with Microsoft, of all people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Microsoft can scale.  They've been able to handle all this kind of web stuff before.  And they have decent management, even  though a lot of people call for bombers' resignation  every two minutes.  I mean, you have a very young company like Facebook  that might not know the ropes.  It might make sense to partner with somebody as large  as Microsoft, who could help them and show them, OK, look,  this is the way this could go.  And we have a lot of money.  We know what we're doing.  So maybe you want to listen to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a good thing for Skype,  because Skype gains 750 million potential new customers.  They mentioned that although there's no financial  relationship between Facebook and Skype,  at least that's the implication.  I'm not convinced that's the case.  That's kind of what Mark said without saying it.  Skype is going to have the ability  to upsell Facebook users to premium Skype services.  It's not clear how that's going to happen.  But that's huge for Skype.  The ability to scale, say, things like Skype Out or free  calling, that kind of thing, is huge for Skype.  So I think it's a big win for Microsoft  and a big win for Skype.  It's a good thing.  It's something that as soon as I heard about the Skype  deal with Microsoft, I thought, oh, this is going to happen.  And obviously, this was something in the works.  This is nothing you could have pulled out  of your butt in five days.  No, not at all.  Do you think they rushed the announcement?  Or is this something they kind of plan to do anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there are lots of people in the community  in Silicon Valley who talk and know  what the other guy is doing.  And I think this is all kind of happening at the same time.  And I think that Google just pulled the trigger sooner,  and it was close.  They knew, yeah.  This isn't the first time that Facebook  has had any sort of partnership with Microsoft, right?  Didn't Facebook partner with them with the Docs.com launch?  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  Docs.com is another one.  Advertising, too.  And there's advertising.  And isn't there Facebook involved in Bing?  Facebook's in Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to Bing, you'll get Facebook search results  in there, the social search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I mean, it makes sense that Facebook,  I mean, Facebook-Microsoft partnerships, I think,  make a lot of sense, especially if Facebook  feels threatened by Google.  I mean, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it the axis of not do evil?  Enemy by enemy is my friend thing.  That's what it really is, isn't it?  Because Facebook's clearly terrified of Google.  Microsoft's terrified of Google.  They should join forces and fight Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes?  I think that there were two interesting things to me  in this.  The first was that Zuckerberg, I think,  was trying to position himself as saying,  we have the social graph.  You don't.  Nyan, nyan, nyan.  And we can do just all kinds of things on top of this.  And others can try to catch up to get the social stuff,  but they don't have it.  We do.  The second thing that's interesting  is that he gave a real shout out to developers  and said we're far better off developing with outsiders  than our own, unlike some other companies.  Wink, wink, wink.  Which I think includes most certainly Twitter  and, in part, Google as well.  We don't have an API yet for Plus.  We'll see where that goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's pretty obvious we will for Plus.  And pretty obvious we won't for anything Facebook does, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  Well, yes, but we have a platform.  And you can build Zynga on top of Facebook.  And you can build it on top of the social graph that they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a platform, not an API.  I guess that's a distinction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, yes.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, is that a fair distinction  to make, Gina, a platform?  Yes.  A platform does not an API, vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  I mean, the distinction is you log into Facebook  to play Facebook, to use Facebook apps.  That's not necessarily.  Yeah, but you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the point.  If it's a platform, you're within the platform.  If it's an API, you can stand out here and say,  give us some stuff and I'll integrate it in.  So that's a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a big difference.  I misspoke.  But I still think that's where he's  trying to position himself is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  And I have to say, when Mark implies  we have the social graph and Google doesn't,  I'm not sure I buy into that.  I mean, I think Google has a pretty darn,  they've got a 1 billion user base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I've been trying to think about this.  There isn't one winner to get the social graph.  I mean, yes, Facebook is absolutely dominating.  And yes, Facebook has been thinking about the problems  around social for a lot longer than Google has, seriously.  But what does Gmail have?  200 million users?  I mean, that doesn't come close to the 750 million.  But it's not one winner takes all.  It just isn't.  I mean, if you look at the enthusiasm around Google+,  within our community, and I say within our community,  because it is very much just our community right now,  there's room for lots of different networks, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tried to write this up, and I accidentally  erased the Google+, post, which is just as well,  because I hadn't thought it through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not right in Google+, OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's OK.  It's OK.  It's my fault, I'm stupidity.  But here's what I'm noodling about is identity.  I said on a post last week after our show  that I thought that Facebook was about relationships,  Twitter was about broadcasting, Tumblr is about quoting,  and Google Plus is about sharing.  Now, that's absolutely wrong, because each one  is about all those things.  But in terms of emphasis, that's where I started.  Then I thought about it more, and I  think there's something about identity going on here,  that Facebook, on the one hand, has the best position of all  when it comes to identity, because they do have  real relationships, more real identity.  It's harder to come up with a fake identity there.  The bloodstream tends to reject it more.  And so in that sense, I think we put Facebook ahead.  The irony for Facebook, as we've discussed in the show long ago,  is the problem of a public and the public,  is that I don't necessarily want to use  my Facebook-established identity in the whole world, which  is where it could be most valuable.  And Google comes along now and says, well, no, we've  got a new identity.  But I can still make up.  I can become Eliot Spitzer in a minute.  I can do whatever I want on Google Plus.  Eliot Spitzer now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, I think that there is a,  while it's not as strong as Facebook,  there's a pretty good link between identity and reality  on Facebook, I mean, on Google Plus, isn't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think it'll get even better,  which goes to your old point, Leo,  which is the more that Google ties your profile page  to search, the more you have invested in it,  the more it becomes, as you put it,  the canonical version of you.  And they've just added this other thing, which  we've mentioned in a paragraph, I mean,  in a parenthesis last weekend, that they're now  starting to promote authors.  So I'm part of the beta for that.  Oh, what's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really cool.  If you Google a blog post that I've written or Jeff's written,  in search results, you'll see our Google profile picture  as the author next to the search result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we have that too.  In fact, you have to do a rel link in there.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to turn that on as well.  It's very simple.  They sent me the information.  Google sent me the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does Google actually go ahead and try  to find your verified sites and then pull that content?  Because I know when I was writing on blogs,  I would see my content posted on other sites  that I did not authorize.  Is Google actually filtering all that stuff out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're trying to go to the sites that put in the rel author.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you put the rel equals author attribute  on the link to your canonical page.  And then on your Google profile, you  say, this site is by me and this site is about me.  And so you kind of tell Google, these sites, I own these sites  and these sites are about me.  So it knows those sites.  So your image actually wouldn't show up on a site that's  just sucked your content.  That sounds really helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a blog post here at Yoast.  Yoast.com.  Yustvan Devalka wrote this and explains exactly how to do it.  In fact, Google sent me to this blog post to do it.  So it says, how to add rel-author and so forth.  This is for WordPress specifically.  But if you know what you're doing,  you can easily extrapolate this to any site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now Google is also making all profiles public  as of the end of the month, as of July 31.  So if your profile is private, they'll just shut it down.  What's the point of a private profile anyway?  Well, right.  That's a good question.  And that's what they've kind of come to,  is that the purpose of the profile  is for you to publicly identify yourself.  So if you don't want to publicly identify yourself,  then don't have a profile, which is pretty strong language.  I thought it was really interesting.  Google did a lot of tweaking over the weekend  to privacy controls in the stream on Google+,  which giving people the ability to create these private spaces.  But then they also sort of came out  with this announcement that Google profiles were just  going to be public and that's it.  So it's really interesting stuff going on on both sides.  You know, getting capability with privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wrote a great post about that, Gina.  You wrote a great post about that.  You and I disagree in very minute shades of gray here.  Yeah.  But I think that people are trying to figure this out  in new ways.  I think you're, I'll make a point for you,  but your point that there are now better controls  that you can say to someone,  this is what I'm sharing with this group.  And then if I try to share it in turn,  I'm prevented or I'm reminded that he just isn't in groups.  I'm prevented from sharing it publicly.  And I'm fine with that.  And I get that.  My fear about that is what I've seen happen  many times already is people are just kind of defaulting  to a group and then I can share it less.  And there's no good reason.  You know, Vic Condroza himself shared a video of him  in a Mercedes ad about how the car saved him  from an accident.  It was a public video.  He sent it to one group.  I then couldn't share it with the world  who can see the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's cause he particularly chose a setting  that says not shareable or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he chose to send it to a limited group.  Because of the limited group that he sent it to.  And then I couldn't share it with the whole public.  Oh, that's interesting.  So what's happening is people are just sharing  with one group and now it's shutting me down  from being able to share more broadly the way I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that was a setting.  So that's not a setting.  That's by default.  I can be wrong.  What do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so it used to be like when it first launched,  if you shared with a circle, someone in that circle  could then reshare publicly.  So they've disabled that now.  So if I shared with a circle,  someone in my circle can share to other circles  with a little warning to be thoughtful  because the original author shared a little.  I like that warning.  Yeah, I thought that was good.  The warning was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The warning I'm very cool with.  And that made sense.  That's kind of, and this is what I've been pushing for  after I talked about this last week  after seeing Tim O'Reilly talk about it.  Let's use mores.  Let's use social pressure.  Let's use peer pressure.  Let's not use settings to do this.  So remind people that,  you may not want to share this publicly  because it wasn't originally shared publicly,  but not stop them from doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I really liked Jeff's point, which is that in real life,  if you tell someone something,  they can share it publicly on their own  and you have no control.  You might not even know.  And so Jeff, I think your argument was saying,  why would we disable this ability  to share publicly in software  if this is something that can happen in real life?  Why don't we just create the social,  the context in which people are more thoughtful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't legislate secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But at the same time,  you think about any good Twitter client  doesn't let you retweet a direct message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably why Representative Wiener was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can always get around that stuff.  If somebody's a real jerk  and they want to be able to access your DM and repost it,  or they want to share something,  you can just do a screenshot and put that up.  So I mean, that's what-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the key here is to me is that we're putting,  and you were headed toward this, Leo,  we're putting too much on the technology,  which also means we know what's going to happen here.  Somehow, somebody shared  that they didn't want shared, get shared  beyond where they thought,  and who are they going to blame?  The technology, not the person.  Yes.  And so I think that Google is setting this up in a way  that it's trying to give a false sense of security  that the technology will solve this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in the defense, they have no choice.  After the Buzz fiasco and the FTC oversight  that they now are subject to, they don't have a choice.  They have to do this.  But it's unfortunate that this is culturally  the way we're responding. Yes, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that the two things that happened,  one is that I think on Facebook,  and I think I said this last week,  on Facebook now it's gotten to the point  where if someone asked to be my friend,  and my account's broken, so I actually can't, folks,  but fine, and if I want to go then see them  and see who they are, well, they've locked down always.  They've locked down their account so much  I have no idea who they are.  Some friend you are.  And so this overreaction has turned a sharing service  into a privacy service, which is kind of insane.  What I do love is the reminders.  You're right, that's about mores.  That's about norms.  That says, I'm gonna inform you,  this is how Gina shared this.  Now if you want to screw Gina,  if you think you've got a good reason to,  that's up to you and Gina.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's between you and Gina.  Between you and Gina.  But I can understand why Google feels they have to.  Now somebody in the chat room's saying,  well, wait a minute, didn't you guys  invade against Facebook for having  places check-ins be public?  But that's very different.  Tellings, although maybe not, I don't know,  what would you say, Jeff?  Is that different to say, I know where IaaS is  and I'm gonna check him in here publicly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that is because, granted,  I could do that anyway.  I could just type, hey, I see IaaS.  Absolutely.  Right?  But to systematize that kind of sharing,  I think was a problem for Facebook.  But what I think they, you know,  what they all need to do is just to make sure  you have informed action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because we are now a little bit in Zuck's corner  who has said all along, it's good for you.  Let it all hang out.  Sharing is good.  And maybe he wasn't so far off, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think so too.  Well, I think the other thing is that Zuck contends  that we have one identity, and I agree with him on this,  that though there are shades, when we get in trouble,  if we think the technology can keep and prevent  our beer picture from being seen by the wrong person,  well, the problem with that is we're putting  too much reliance on the technology.  A, B, the other problem is the person  who disapproves of me drinking a beer, they got problems.  We gotta deal with that.  So what I think Google is doing here  is putting this false expectation that  you can silo your whole life.  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, that was Mark Zuckerberg's kind of  roundabout response to Ben Parr of Mashable,  and Ben said, well, what do you think of Google Plus?  He first said a lot of companies are gonna do something  like this, but Facebook has the social graph.  This was that social graph argument.  And we don't have to worry about competitors.  We just have to keep innovating.  But I don't know if it was in response to this question,  but he did talk a lot about that whole issue of  Facebook groups versus Google circles,  and the non-granular kind of sharing that's on Facebook  compared to the inherently granular sharing.  Do you guys use Facebook groups?  Well, I've set them up.  You see, he pointed out that 50% of everybody's  actively using Facebook groups.  I don't know what that means.  I set up groups and I haven't used them since.  Gina, do you use them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't, but I really don't.  I just don't use Facebook that much at all.  I really just do it to check in with my kind of  extended family who uses it.  I just never found my community there, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, right.  I cut you off, this is my habit, Gina.  Do you feel that Google's in the right spot now  with their current settings on sharing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  I think they're in a really good space right now  with the stream.  I think that that was the right decision to make,  the disabling sharing to public.  Although, now you've sort of convinced me that  if you added public to the list of places to share  a limited post with, that it would just pop up  another reminder and say, are you sure  that you want to do this?  Because you can forward an email to anyone you want.  So, there's arguments to be made.  You can't retweet DMs, right?  But you can forward email anywhere,  or you can just talk to someone on the street,  just like you said.  You know, it's interesting about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's another way to post a question.  Is this, do you think that Google Plus is essentially  a sharing service or a communication service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's, I'm still figuring that out.  I think it's...  What's the distinction?  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that a sharing service means that you expect  to share with people and how many and in what circumstances  are things you have to work out and there are systems  to help you with that, whereas a communication service  is email.  I think it's both. Communication service says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's both because I've used it both ways.  I have, by the way, with very little response,  but I have used it to direct, in effect, direct message  to set up a one-to-one, which you can do,  just by saying, okay, I ask, I'm going to add you to this  and I'm going to ask you a question.  And I've done that a couple of times.  And in every case, I did one to Veronica Belmont,  which I then cut and pasted into email  because I never heard from her.  And I did one, I think, to our team,  to the Twit company circle.  And got one or two responses,  but did not stimulate conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem with the Google Plus is that you have,  it's almost like an unfiltered feed.  Even though you have all these circles,  you can, like that message you sent out...  There's no separate channel for it.  It got lost, unless you make a specific circle  for your business or something like that.  So the answer is it's a sharing service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has communication features, but you're right.  It's a sharing service.  And that's why they have Gmail built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can always go there for that directing.  And that's the thing with Google that I've noticed  for the longest time.  Tons of disparate pieces that have never been put together.  And Gmail is with this added bar on the top.  It says, look, this is the one place for you to go.  When you wanna share, go to Plus.  When you wanna talk to somebody directly, we have Gmail.  Even though that chat, chat's in Gmail and it's in Plus.  So there's some elements that are a crossover.  But I think Google Plus is very different  than using something like an email service.  I mean, Facebook tried to do email,  and that doesn't really work.  They have messages, but they have their own email address,  too, that nobody seems to use.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a really important point that you make.  That you, there's no guarantee the person you're sending to  is gonna look at just that feed.  If you DM me or if you email me,  I might not see it, but the expectation is very different.  I think it's a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there's an argument that Hangouts  is definitely about communication  or just more about shared experience than communication.  And I think Google Plus can be used just for communication.  Like I did a post that was, I think, to all my circles,  which I'm following quite a few people,  hundreds of people, and said,  huddle is totally broken for me.  Bunch of strangers starting huddles with me,  blowing up my phone.  I don't know who's who or what's what.  And then privately, and the Google team  has been doing a great job of this,  privately a Google team member sent a message,  would just share, just with me and Leo, actually.  And I noticed, I think, I don't know, Leo,  if you responded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did, I didn't see your response.  Did you respond?  I did.  It took me 12 hours, but I finally responded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he said, can you tell me more  about your experience with huddle?  Like how can we make it better?  And it's interesting,  because I kept trying to find that message again.  Like, oh, did Leo get back?  Did they get their conversation in too?  But it was hard to find.  I mean, it's so hard to find stuff.  It's amazing.  There's no good post search.  I was like, I wanna see things that I've commented on.  And anyway, it's early still.  So you know what was amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you did that original post,  like it's one of those posts,  and you asked for help,  Vic came in and the timestamp is there in two minutes.  Yes, and said we're working on it.  Don't count on that staying that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, can you?  No, we won't.  Well, right, but he said we're working on it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and then he called out the Google developer saying,  hey, and then the Google developer who was working on it,  presumably, came and said, oh yes, we're working on that.  We have a change coming soon.  So the customer service has been great.  Although I did pose a question  to everybody in my Google company circle,  asking them about the percentage of women  field testing the service, and I got crickets.  So there's an instant response on everything.  So and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like a geek conference, yeah.  I found the, let's see if I can find it.  I found my response to the question,  but I can't find the original question.  Oh, wait a minute, I know why this is,  because I responded in a separate post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there actually a search feature built into this?  No.  I'm starting to look around, I'm like,  wait, there isn't a search?  Okay, that's not quite true,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because you can use generalized Google search  if you do site colon plus dot Google dot com,  and then the search, but that's a little hard to do.  It's public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, Google-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's start a list of the things that we want here.  Search.  Search is number one, number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Search and Google, they might be good at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Search and hashtags, which is a specialized form of search  where you click the hashtag,  and that does a search for that term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also want, going to what Gina just said,  why didn't they put the star in here?  The star is all over Google.  Oh, favorite, yeah.  Why can't I favorite thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, plus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus one is kind of,  but plus one doesn't apparently do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I can't go-  You can't go find your plus ones.  Plus one is me approving, star is me saving.  I have no way to save stuff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But plus one doesn't do the same thing  as a plus one on the open web does.  No.  It's true, you're right.  It doesn't really do much,  except do a nice little graphic counter.  As I mentioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just an attaboy and attagirl to the original author.  Yeah, that's exactly.  I imagine that they're gonna start to surface that.  I think we should not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really think we should be careful about,  and I see a lot of this criticizing Google Plus  at this point, since it's obviously so early on.  I mean, it's appropriate to say, what do we want?  I think that's fine.  I think they're obviously very actively collecting  that kind of information.  So I'm not saying don't do that.  But I don't think you can judge,  and it's not even public.  You cannot judge Google Plus  based on what we're seeing today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of these bloggers who are coming together,  and I'll leave them unnamed,  but a few of them come in,  and the first thing is go to the deep end.  Oh, I'm in, and you're not.  That's a big deal.  And then within two days, oh.  I hate it.  They reject it all.  It's all bad.  You killed Kenny.  I mean, it's just as bad,  it's just as bad as me saying  that Wave was gonna change the world.  I'll grant that.  But it's too soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's too soon, and we've now learned this lesson,  because I did the same thing with Buzz.  So we've learned this lesson  that you cannot jump on this bandwagon too quickly.  You gotta wait and see how it plays out.  But I do note one thing,  and I think it's impossible not to note this,  that there is something about Google Plus  to the people who are using it  that is making it incredibly sticky.  They're using it and all complaining about it,  long hours.  The engagement is very high.  I mean, many people have already got more people  in their circles than they have on Buzz,  or even, you know, or Facebook, or anywhere else.  I mean, the engagement's very high.  So there is something, there is some nugget there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there really is.  Leo, you know, it's funny.  I think this is where Google was hoisted on its own petard.  I have people in one of the companies I deal with  where they're all complaining,  and, oh, it's too much work to get in,  or, I don't have any friends there,  so I don't see what it's about, or any of that.  So you think, oh, well, how would you solve that?  Oh, well, gee, let's go to your Gmail  and give you some instant friends.  It'd be the wrong thing to do, but that's the problem.  There is a, we the geeks went to the effort  to make enough friends to make it work for us,  and then it became more addictive.  If you're not like that, you come to it,  and it's crickets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I almost don't wanna say this,  but I think that I like it the way it is,  and please don't invite anybody else or anybody else in.  You like it closed off?  And I think that as soon as you open this up  to the world at large,  it will be no better than anything else.  I think one of the reasons it's, I hate to say this,  one of the reasons it's so engaging  is because it's us talking to each other.  Well, that's why I, when I went in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the Scoble position, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the signal to nose noise issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good, blame Scoble.  Scoble said that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Scoble's speaking out of both sides of his mouth.  Scoble's the first person to say,  I have a thousand people,  and then he says, I have too many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know, he always bugs me when he does that.  He follows everybody, then complains about the noise.  He's like, oh, Robert, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're just shooting yourself in the foot.  So Gina, how many followers do you have now?  Oh, stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina's the highest ranked woman on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, at like number like 13,  which is a sad statement about the number of women  on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only 10% of Google Plus users are female.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, according to socialstatistics.com,  which apparently you have to put your Google Plus ID into  to have them track your stats.  So I can't tell if it's that more men  are interested in their ranking  or truly there are only 10% women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say like to measure.  Size better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Men like to measure, we do know this.  So I don't know what the answer is.  And actually that's what I keep asking Google about.  And they are not sharing numbers about their user base.  And I'm sure that's because we've criticized them  on this show about not having real world users  actually trying, you know, I made this point on Google Plus,  so apologies, those of you who are following me.  But it's like the best people to tell you  whether or not your privacy controls are good  are victims of harassment, stalking, rape.  And those people are mostly women, not entirely,  but mostly women.  So it helps to, and women use social software  actually a lot more than men.  I think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, on Facebook for sure.  On Facebook for sure, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just think it's really important to have lots of women,  testers and people of color.  And I mean, you know-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that there's a fault of Google  that they didn't invite enough women?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tend to not think that  because I think actually Google is in terms on the scale  of Silicon Valley tech companies  are actually pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then also they only seated a number  and then many of the other people on here  were invited by others, right?  Right, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you could have gone to BlogHer and Glam, for example,  and gotten three, 4,000 very active social-  Maybe they should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually think that they should have done that.  Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I absolutely agree with you, Jane, it's absolutely right.  And I found out the same thing,  that I look at my list and the testosterone is stifling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a high level testosterone, for sure.  Oh, fuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the other hand, one thing I'm very glad about,  maybe it's just my weirdness,  because I do the German stuff,  but I'm finding it to be incredibly international for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love it too.  In fact, if I look at incoming,  which by the way, I really like incoming.  I like that too.  I guess that's the equivalent of the Twitter everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that's a little bit different, Leo.  I think incoming is the people who are interested in you,  whom you're not necessarily listening to, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there is no analog to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what's great about it is,  is that when I go to incoming,  I find it really, really interesting.  But of course, noisier.  This is people there who are speaking languages  I don't know, they're interested in things I don't know.  They're interested enough in what I have to say,  that we have a communication.  I find new people there, I can read them,  but I don't have to noise up my own stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's amazing when you get up early in the morning,  it's not now so much,  but when you get up early in the morning,  more than three quarters of this for me is Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what's weird about this?  I mean, they have an API for translate.  You think they could talk to themselves and say,  hey, what language would you like to notice  your incoming streaming?  This is another bug that should be fixed.  I mean, that seems like a pretty simple thing  Google could do, add a translate button.  I would like to see that,  because I'm looking through my incoming right now,  see some Spanish and I speak a little Spanish,  that helps, but you're right.  In the morning, it's the other side of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it though.  I think that that's just really cool.  And it does show that this has reached well beyond the US  and the tech neradi that normally  are part of these kinds of tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's where they did get a diversity,  which goes to Gina's point.  They did see that, I think it was Vic  who said on our show last week,  that they tried to get heavy up in, I think,  23 languages, as I remember.  And so they did see it in other countries,  they should have seeded it across other genders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Other genders.  Well, there's male, female and other.  There are other genders.  I have three children, a boy and a girl and the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I barely looked at incoming because my existing,  the people that I do follow are so prolific  that I can barely keep up with that.  I mean, it's very active.  There's a lot to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the people I follow is a local politician,  I'm not gonna give too much information, a female,  who just recently complained to me in a limited post,  I hope I'm not breaching confidence, I didn't say her name,  but that she was getting a lot of pictures  of genitalia tagged with her name.  So there is some bad stuff going on.  Oh, crap already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that can happen on any service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's- Yeah, but no,  but and I think that this is to Gina's point,  that if you wanna test your systems  and how effective they are and how good the privacy is,  this is, you put more women on there  and you'll see right away what's going on, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think we see that on Facebook, do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm just thinking like,  right now you get a notification that says,  do you approve this tagging?  And I know that you have the approval option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're allowed to tags, this is the problem,  and this is feedback that I do wanna send to Google  and I will as soon as I get off the air.  They need to, right now, anybody,  even if they're not in your circles, can tag you.  So you should be able to say,  I only want, not only I wanna approve tags,  but I only want people to be able to tag me in my circles.  There needs to be more granularity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that seems like it's just another step.  They could do that.  And Facebook, they allowed you to do that, right?  You can say, only my friends can tag you.  So, tag me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Facebook's got machine tagging now, so I don't know.  I don't know, I don't think,  that's another interesting thing.  Although Google has the capability,  I don't think they're doing automated tagging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hopefully they're auto detecting genitalia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be bad if your nose looked like a penis though  and they were turning on the,  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These days my nose looks more like a penis  than my penis does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  Every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It always, it always devolves to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm sorry you have to work with us, Jeanne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It cracks me up, actually.  I love you guys.  We love you guys.  We love you too.  Don't nobody else do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep it clean.  Just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm allowed.  He's in that private circle.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's a good point.  I mean, that's another thing that happens  in social networks.  Stuff is tolerated.  Do your friends who you know,  you tolerate things like that.  Yeah, I've been thinking about creating a circle

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for people who don't misinterpret my bad jokes.  That one, because otherwise if I put it on Twitter,  it's just a nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're right.  Right, is you're right, the irony circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As opposed to the literal net circle.  Oh yeah, that was a whole other group.  We need circles within circles.  The Venn diagrams aren't complicated enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Venn diagrams, super circles, sub circles,  semi circles, ovals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one of my friends was suggesting  that we should have self tagging, self circling.  But that, I don't get that.  Put yourself in a circle.  You could nominate yourself as ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do like it that you cannot tell  what circle somebody has put you in.  It's driving some people crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm really happy about that.  I use private lists.  Oh, now I wanna know.  I use private lists on Twitter a lot.  I have this one private VIP Twitter list,  which is my first column in TweetDeck,  which is the people whose stuff I don't ever wanna miss.  And it would just hurt feelings.  If people found out that I wasn't,  they weren't on my VIP list,  people get their feelings hurt  if they find out that you're not following them  to begin with.  It's speed dial.  But, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, are you on my speed dial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna have a Scoble moment now.  So when they did the demo of the calling today on Facebook,  I looked really quickly as you were showing it, Leo,  and I think I saw my name on the list.  I'm so happy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aw.  So what was there?  You all caught Scobles.  We have to talk about Scobles.  Great.  The ultimate Scoble moment this week was Zuck  SMSing Scoble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because there was some question about whether,  there actually are apparently a few Mark Zuckerberg  accounts on Google+,  but there's one that has 44,000 followers.  And there was some question,  is that really Mark Zuckerberg?  And Scoble was the one who confirmed it was.  In fact, he was on Twitter on Sunday  and he showed me the text message.  And then I did a bad thing.  I scrolled back through it to see what else they talked about.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With just a flick of the thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very, he kind of busted me on it too.  But I, you know, he's, I figure with Robert,  we're all, he's, Robert's an example of this,  which is that I know Robert in a way most people don't,  because I've known him for many years  before he was Robert Scoble.  And you know, he was a chat room mod for me in the nineties.  So I have a very different relationship with him.  I adore the guy, but yeah.  He's taking care of us.  Yeah.  But I, and I know he knows, annoys people.  And, and I, I sometimes I play along with that,  but he's, I think it's sweetheart, really a sweetheart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, he is one of the,  he's a very generous and wonderful guy.  Very generous.  And he also puts up with people making fun of him  because he also is kind of a character of himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He knows he's playing that character.  I think it hurts a little bit though.  I have to say,  depends on how loving it is.  Sometimes I just want to give him a big hug.  And then I look at him and I say, no, let's take,  like that, you know what I'm saying?  Let's take a little bit of a break here.  I as Ektar is here.  He is of course, one of our news team.  I have officially named Tom Merritt news director  so that I as makes you a news minion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Minion. I like that.  Yeah.  Minion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love my business cards.  Tech news today.  You'll catch him in just a little bit  with the latest news.  Actually, how are you going to do that?  I've been prepping this morning.  Oh good. All right.  We're good.  Well, it's nice.  I'm really glad to have you here.  Thanks for joining us.  Coming downstairs and joining us.  Yeah, it was a long trip.  Also with us, Gina Trippani of smarterware.org.  She's also a Gina Trippani on Twitter.  And don't forget, of course,  they're a great application.  I would love to see a Google plus version of this.  That's kind of one of the things that's missing.  Yeah, we need a plugin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Read the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ThinkUpApp.com.  And last but not least,  the man who wears his penis on his face.  Well, it's better than your sleeve.  Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com.  Former television critic.  Actually, I've been, this is another,  I'll tell you another story.  I've been a follower and fan of Jeff Jarvis for many years  since you worked here in the city in San Francisco.  Yo, no, you're kidding.  Oh no, absolutely.  I followed you throughout your entire career  this whole time.  When we were talking about who should be on the show,  you were number one on the list  right after Gina Trippani, who's number zero.  How's that for diplomacy?  Number zero warms my heart.  I've been a big fan of Jeff's for a long time.  And I can't remember how we first corresponded.  Maybe it was through Jake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Might have been.  Jake's been a huge fan for a long time.  So anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny.  People don't remember that whole TV critic  at that episode.  Let's take a break.  We're gonna come back with more on this week in Google.  And just a little bit before we do though,  I'd like to talk to you about the secret  behind exceptional websites.  A great place for people frequently.  This is one of the most frequent comments  or questions I get, particularly on the radio show.  What's a good web host?  And I have to go through a long elaborate explanation.  And really, I should just say, look,  you don't want to just get a web host.  You want to get a web host and the best software possible.  And you want to get them together.  And that's squarespace.com.  If you're a WordPress blogger, as I am,  you're updating, we just got a new update on WordPress.  What is it, 3.2 now?  You have to every few weeks update WordPress.  Squarespace, they update it, but they do it for you.  It's always kept secure.  Version six has been in testing for some time.  And I can tell you is very exciting.  This is the best software, not just for a blog  or for any website.  First of all, they kind of follow the Google data  liberation front model.  You can get your data in and out.  They have seamless importing from the movable type WordPress  type pad and blogger APIs.  They'll copy your posts, copy the images,  make sure all the links work, all the SEO is preserved.  But you can also export.  It goes both ways, so you're never trapped.  In fact, that's good because they have a try it free feature  that gives you a, we did this.  I wonder if this, I wonder if we, on Twitter, we,  what was that, what was it, was it brianisayunicorn.com?  Yeah.  Some variation of that.  Yeah, let's just see.  There's a lot of those out there.  We actually created this and I gave out the password.  Oh, it looks like somebody's modified it again.  But within, nope, within seconds.  There it goes.  This website was crowdsourced with our.  With our people in the chat room,  people watching the live stream,  made this website in Squarespace.  All I, and that's kind of the beauty of this.  A fine use of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you think?  Tim Burgosley is very proud right now  to create this possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what the web was made for.  So let me take you back to squarespace.com.  Actually, where'd it go?  Squarespace.com.  If you click the green button,  you could try it for free for two weeks.  If you decide to buy, do use the offer code TWIG7,  T-W-I-G and the number seven,  because that'll give you 10% off your new site  for the first six months.  So it's a really good deal and a good money saver.  TWIG7, 10% off for the first six months of your account.  Very affordable too.  Remember you're getting hosting and the software  and the pricing starts as low as $10 a month  if you buy for two years.  The longer you subscribe, of course,  the better the choice is.  Lots of nice features, iPhone and iPad app  that really make it great to post  as well as moderate your blog.  Even get your stats, some great stats on here.  Photo galleries, forums, form building  and a whole lot more.  Squarespace, just give it a try, will you?  Just press that green button.  Squarespace.com and if you decide to buy,  use the offer code TWIG7.  Don't forget, 10% off for the first six months  of your account.  The secret behind exceptional websites  and brianisayunicorn.squarespace.com  if you'd like to see.  They did that literally in about a minute.  Actually, there was a little battle  between we had different factions  doing different things with the Squarespace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the chat room is good for doing things like that  during NSFW if you watch that show.  They do that all the time.  They do that, there's like, I'd say 50 sites  get made during the show.  Instant.  Do they use Squarespace?  I guess they do.  They do use Squarespace and there are some phenomenal sites  and a lot of Brian is a unicorn, oddly enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crowdsourcing.  Great article by Jim Fallows.  First of all, as much as I love you, Jeff Jarvis,  I love Jim Fallows.  I think he's one of the most interesting guys writing  very smart writes for the Atlantic these days.  And he actually, I should say he blogs for the Atlantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he's a journalist, journalist, man.  He's the real deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He really is.  I just, his books are fantastic.  So he brought up an interesting point on Tuesday.  Google plus versus Facebook, the trust factor.  And this is something I've been talking about on this show  and thinking about for some time.  Why is it we sort of trust Google in a way  that we sort of don't trust Facebook?  He quotes Christopher Michael Luna,  a divinity student at Harvard,  who wrote an essay about the meaning of trust  and connection in the social media age,  in which he says, and it kind of echoes my own sentiments.  I want to run it by you guys.  I trust Google in a way that surprises me.  I trust them more than any other corporation I can think of.  That he talks about their stand in China.  And then the fact that Facebook's talking about complying  with the Chinese government in order to get  into the Chinese market.  And Microsoft is partnering  with the Chinese search engine, Baidu.  He says, I'd like to see Google win this war  and I know who signed them on here.  I kind of think that leaving Facebook  is one way we could participate.  Now this is a stronger statement than many of us would make,  but it certainly does reflect the feeling a lot of us have  about Facebook versus Google.  He says, Google Plus is already showing us  how it respects the user.  Whereas, because they have the data liberation,  makes downloading everything you've uploaded  a relatively simple task.  Of course you could do that on Facebook too.  But he says, try and take your photos off Flickr,  for example, it's almost impossible.  What do you guys think?  Is something about Google inherently  more trustworthy than Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it because Facebook has that social network movie  that kind of vilifies Mark Zuckerberg a bit,  or are we waiting for like a Google scandal like that?  I don't think it's the movie.  I mean, the other thing about Facebook  is they seem to hide a lot of things,  a lot of settings you're opted in and you find out later,  and people get very, very outraged versus Google.  The one time they did it was Buzz  and everybody got annoyed with that.  So maybe it's just the frequency in which they opt people.  This is, this is, this is, this is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this maybe capsulizes it.  This is Jim Fallows talking.  He says, my view is, according to Jim Fallows,  Google airs and oversteps, as in the Bud case, Buzz case,  and can seem threateningly large,  but in the end it acts as if it has a conscience.  So far the record is that if Facebook,  Facebook stops only when it's caught.  I see you nodding, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, this is, this is why I'm here during the show.  The Google brand has earned the trust of the tech community.  And this, this Harvard student has to be a nerd, right?  It has to be a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a divinity student too.  Yeah.  Well, that's a form of nerdiness.  It's godly nerdiness.  I say that lovingly because my sister's a minister, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The reality is that my in-laws didn't weigh  what brand they trusted more  when they decided to go on Facebook.  Their friends were there and that's what they did.  And, but, but for people who are in the industry  and think about these things and follow Google and see,  you know, and can comprehend the awesome technology  that Google has sort of put out to the world  and what they've done.  And just their whole, Google's whole demeanor  has always been, you know, the do no evil thing hasn't been,  it hasn't been just talk.  It feels like they've really walked the walk  and they appeal to engineers in a very captivating way.  I trust Google as well.  And my boss, Anil, often questions my blind trust of Google.  He was the one that pointed out that the few, you know,  that there were so few women on the service.  And I said, oh, that, that the number must be wrong  because I can't, I can't imagine that's really the case.  You know, so I, I tend to, I tend to trust them  at first, which is probably probably a bad thing.  They're not infallible.  They're not infallible.  Far from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what fellow is saying is that they are,  they make mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do a great thing.  I get that sense that they try to do the right thing.  And everybody I've talked to who are former employees  and current employees have, have all said the same thing  that like the conversations in the meetings are,  is this evil?  Will this hurt users?  And I think that's easy to do when you're making  a boatload of money, which they are.  So, so yeah, I'm, I'm right there, right there with you.  And that's why I'm doing the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I agree.  I think, I think it's well said.  And, you know, one, one issue in Facebook's problem is,  I think Jim and the Divinity students said it very well,  that Facebook does kind of just push the edge  and wait to get the flap back.  But they're also dealing with things that are seen  to be more, more personal.  The mistake, the strategic mistake for Facebook, I argue,  is that they should have started by saying,  we're a place to share,  not we're a place to hide things or to secrete things,  right?  That, that we're a place to share,  or that's not how they're seen.  Whereas Google, I think is very smart  as they're presented as a place,  this is why the profiles think it's smart.  This is a place to share.  Generally, that's what we're here for.  That's what we do is we drive people to things.  I think they are good about, about the don't be evil.  I think the China stuff, especially Jim is a China hand  and he knows this very well, is very important to this.  And I think there's something else going on too,  two sides of this.  On the one hand, we also see that because, as Gina said,  Google gets big, it gets mistrusted.  We see that throughout the EU,  but now the FTC is going after Google.  And I put on the list a New York Times editorial  that basically says, as Matthew Ingram summed it up,  the short summary of it is,  well, we should just investigate them  just because they're big.  And we're seeing that and that's kind of insane.  On the other hand, there's a story going on  in my world right now with Rupert Murdoch  and the phone hacking scandal in the UK.  Oh my God.  That is beyond ugly and evil right now.  And if you want to talk about relative trust,  here's a supposed journalistic organization  that is just absolutely disgusting.  And here's Google that, yes, it's very big,  but as Gina just said, yes,  they try to super serve their customer  and make that their guiding principle.  And yes, I do trust them.  I'm a fan boy too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what I like about Google too  is they don't treat their users like idiots.  They go in and say, you're an adult,  you can understand what it's like  to have different lists of friends  and you don't know what the difference is  between sharing to some people and not others.  You know, I feel like they give consumers  and users choices and control.  Whereas I feel like other companies  kind of just assume the lowest common denominator,  this is the default setting,  this is what everyone should do  because this is what we think that they should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the other thing is that Google's earned  a lot of trust simply by having good search results.  You know, when you look up something,  you're looking for whatever it is you want,  you actually got good results.  And you're like, I like this site.  This has actually given me what I want.  And so you just started going back and back and back.  And even when you would see their services,  other services pop up,  you're more likely to go, you know what,  I know this service isn't fully baked yet,  but I'll give them another chance  because I trust them from their search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I do think that Jim raises the question tacitly,  if not explicitly that I feel better about Google.  I'm maybe not sure why and I'm not sure I should, but I do.  And that certainly reflects my opinion  and maybe it's irrational, maybe it's not.  You know, there's a good, it's also in our rundown,  it's probably too long for me to summarize,  but Yishan Wang has written a Quora answer,  how Google Plus shows that Google  still doesn't understand social,  in which he kind of debunked some Facebook myths like that.  For instance, they keep all your data themselves.  You can, of course, for the last year,  you've been able to export all your Facebook data  in a zip file.  They just, it comes down to a feeling almost, doesn't it?  Not a rational thing, but a feeling, or is it rational?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think it is, I think Gina's right, is culture.  I mean, I won't besmirch them here too,  but I dealt with a certain credit card company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love that post, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And just, you know, I'm not trying to do a Dell.  I'm with my heart condition, I try not to be upset.  I'm dying and they screwed me.  But the culture was amazing.  I went through six employees and when I said, you know,  I'm unhappy and here's why, retain me,  all they were trained to do was to upsell me.  And, you know, Google, the irony of Google is,  if you have a problem with Google,  you can't reach a human being.  You know, oh, if you could only get to phone mail jail,  we can because we're in the position we're in.  We can go on plus and there's Vic Condotra,  for God's sakes, in two minutes saying,  you're right, Gina, I'm right on that.  That's awfully impressive, the presence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, of course, we found out that Bradley Horowitz  was about to get, you know, proposed.  Yeah.  We had him on the show last week and apparently,  shortly thereafter, he flew to Paris and proposed  to his long-time girlfriend and was accepted.  And by the way, I was thrilled to be sharing  in all of that on Google Plus.  That was pretty cool.  He put the picture of the ring and then she was,  was it her name, Irene was posting pictures of Paris  and their food and I felt like we were,  I don't even know, I've met Bradley,  I've hung out with him at food camp,  but I felt like, wow.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is humanizing Googlers.  It really did.  You know the pattern.  It is.  Did you see, in a whole different way,  did you see Marissa's Chalhoum light fixture in her house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, she posted about her light fixture.  Oh.  Now I've got to find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The most incredible, did you see it, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't see it, I'm looking at her profile now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let's look.  She put up photos, 83 photos.  How do you say it, Chaloum?  Chaloum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You must be in her circles because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thuloum, yeah, apparently she is not sharing that with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe I've now just violated the rules here.  But.  I want to see your Thuloui.  You know who I mean, who's the artistic class guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know who you're talking about, I don't know how you.  Such an uncultured bunch.  Put the photos tab in her profile, you can see.  Oh, it's in the photos tab.  Oh, there it is.  There we go.  Her Chahouli install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is, you won't believe it.  It is the most unbelievable thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This reminds me, I feel like I'm at,  what is the hotel in Vegas that has all of this stuff?  This is very Vegas of Marissa, holy cow.  At least they're all the Google colors right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it?  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Persian ceiling mock-up in Seattle.  So she's thinking about getting this, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  If you go through quickly, you will see,  there's the installation.  Oh yeah, they're putting it in.  The truck get caught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, this is very personal, you're right.  There's an Apple store in the background,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and now we know exactly where she lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, this is quite an installation.  I hope they're not geotagged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is phenomenal.  It is just unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And congratulations Marissa,  now you have the Bellagio ceiling in your apartment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Leo, watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  This is quite incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a humanity here.  Googlers are throwing themselves into this.  I talked to Jacob Glick,  who's their privacy person in Canada,  and he said, it's interesting,  you gotta find the right voice,  because you still are corporate,  but they're in here and allowed to be human  and be themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, do you think this is all on purpose?  I mean, like with the campaign,  the Dear Sophie campaign for email.  I mean, is this just this,  hey, we're showing you how to use it by using it ourselves,  or is this what they would normally do on a social network?  I mean, we just never see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's something that puzzles me a little bit.  If you go to socialstatistics.com  and you look at the top ranking Googlers are there,  Larry Page follows zero people.  Sergey Brin follows zero people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that just means they've hidden who they've circled.  Oh, have they hidden their circles?  Yeah, because you can say,  don't make the people in my circle public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the number's invisible, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is why I kinda distrust this side a little bit.  It's not quite reporting the data correctly.  It's not actually zero, it's just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that made me think,  oh, these are phony accounts that they're just using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there were some dead accounts there,  which is the other problem, but they're-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so they've blocked this for privacy reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It lists me as following zero too,  but that's just because I hid who's in my circles  just to see what would happen, and that's what happened.  So it's actually not zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, Tom Anderson's not following anybody either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, the numbers are way out of date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they are out of date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the number on the profile  doesn't match the number on the circles page.  Not that I care, not that I'm scovable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't mind, 11852.  Let me just see you out of curiosity.  I think it doesn't mind.  Yeah, 11852.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine is now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they just follow me closer than they follow you, Jeff.  Is that all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm at 9194.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I probably-  Yours is bigger than Jeff's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, so they've got the right number right now.  Maybe they're updating more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, we're gonna move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, this is terrible, terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have really avoided this.  In fact, I'm thinking maybe I'll set the number to zero now  because I just really...  This was what happened in Twitter,  and I fell for it big time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think Leo, that's the beauty of it.  I rushed in to get enough people in  to make this a real experience,  and now I'm pulled back,  and the people I wanna follow are the ones I want to follow.  But then, Gina, I really recommend  that you go into the incoming  because it's a whole different experience.  Well, as people who are interested in you,  it's worth going in there,  but it doesn't noise up your own stream again.  I do like how they've handled that.  And it's really nice because then I get to see  a wider diversity of people and interests in incoming  without having to devote myself to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, something we should point out,  when Mark Zuckerberg held his awesome announcement  this morning, he said a couple of interesting things.  One, that this is the launching season 2011 for Facebook.  This is just the beginning of a number of announcements  they plan to do in the next few months.  It's very clear Google's in exactly that same boat.  They've already kind of telegraphed  that they're going to change the name  and branding of Picasa and Blogger  to be something a little more generic,  photos.google.com and blogs.google.com.  They've got some very interesting new things,  games and questions in the Google code.  And we're seeing the slide folks  coming out with a ton of interesting things  like prizes, pool party.  This is gonna be a very hot summer for social media.  And you've got two super,  the superpowers of social media here.  Twitter is kind of, I have to say,  really feels like Twitter's getting left in the dust  at this point.  Yes, President Obama had a Twitter press conference  this morning, but it was interestingly enough,  Jack Dorsey, who hosted that for Twitter,  not Ev, not Biz, both of whom have moved on  and they're kind of restarting up Obvious,  the parent corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we also have the FTC investigation into Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but every FTC seems to be  apparently investigating everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting too, I think, though.  It goes to the developer issue there.  Well, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we talked about that last week and you're right.  I mean, I think that there are some negatives  in what they're up to.  Maybe that actually wasn't last week,  it was on Twitter we talked about that.  He also said a couple of interesting things.  He confirmed the 750 million user number,  which we'd heard before from journalists, but that is true.  But this is what I thought he said that to me,  we need to parse a little bit.  He said, the last five to seven years of Facebook,  the metric to watch was user growth.  Kind of analogous to this numbers conversation  we're having here.  He said, for the next five years,  the question to ask is what kind of cool stuff  you're gonna be able to build on the social graph.  In other words, don't expect this kind of growth forever.  Of course you can't, because you run out of people.  You can't, there's only so many people in the world.  But also, it's enough now,  we've reached such a good critical mass,  and I think you'd say the same for Twitter  and certainly for Google,  that now what's really interesting  is what do you build on that social graph?  What innovative things do you do with that information  now that you have it?  He's basically saying this is the thing to watch  from Facebook going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To a lot of people, Facebook is the internet.  There's always been this, not always,  there's been this rumor for a while now  about Project Spartan, the idea that there's gonna be  mobile applications based on Facebook and using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, we saw zero Project Spartan.  There's no iPad, there was no Spotify announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Launching season though, maybe we'll see it eventually.  This is the kind of stuff,  this is what we normally use the internet for.  We use that for web apps, and we use it for regular stuff.  When people wanna stay on Facebook all day,  it makes sense to just try to spin it,  because like you were saying, Leo, they can't keep growing.  It's just not possible unless everybody has two accounts  for a farm bill, which a lot of people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I wanna get this wrapped up here.  Let me see if there's any other big stories  that we need to cover.  The Nortel patents went to Apple, not Google.  I don't know if that's gonna be a big deal  in the long run for Android, it might be.  Apple, RIM, and Microsoft now have those 6,000 patents,  which means Google, which tried to get them,  didn't try very hard, they used,  their last bid was Pi, 3.14159 billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nerds, really, that was their last bid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All three bids were mathematical constants.  No.  Oh yeah, you didn't, oh yeah, let me see if I can find it.  Oh, I missed that.  It's kinda cute.  That could've been your number, Jeff.  Yeah.  There were three numbers.  I have a student.  It's like the Mersenne prime, I can't remember  what they were, do you remember chat room  what the three numbers were that Google bid?  I'm gonna have to find it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a student of mine who has,  who started a startup called Notebooks with a K,  by the way, folks, who has Pi tattooed around his arm.  That's cute, so the first bid was 1.902160 billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their second bid was 2.614972128,  and their third bid was 3.14159.  All three math nerds tell me, no, not Fibonacci,  all three are apparently mathematical constants,  although I'm having a hard time,  apparently journalists aren't smart enough  to know what the mathematical constants are.  Let me see if I can opt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The BBC knows, the Guardian knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Guardian knows, yeah, what does the Guardian say?  I saw that article, but I can't get it to come up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Billion dollars times Pi, and that wasn't the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brunes constant.  Brunes constant.  Okay, and let's see what else there.  And Meisel Mertens.  Meisel Mertens.  Constant.  Reuters called it mystifying.  Google's bids were mystifying.  And it did for us, it was good that Google,  you could look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and their final bid 3.14159,  which was Pi, of course, was just below the,  what was it?  4.5 billion. 4.5 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The consortium, there's six companies that bought it,  and Google's not part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not part of that consortium.  Have you installed the new, you probably saw this  because I accidentally showed my Gmail account,  the new Gmail template, the simplified template?  No, I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did, I did, the preview.  I like it. Preview of the new look.  I like it too, although I went with the dense version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so you get more data in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, to get more data on the screen,  but yeah, I like it very much.  What do you guys think about the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do I go get it?  Just go into themes, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the last theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Settings, themes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, but apparently this is a precursor  to something Google's gonna do globally.  They're gonna change, it's right down here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're doing kind of a global redesign  or visual refresh across all the products.  I believe it's calendar, reader, and Gmail.  They're gonna kind of do this,  they're gonna iterate over time slowly  across the different products.  So we're gonna see this kind of roll out  over the next few months,  and then they're gonna be watching for feedback  and no doubt doing maybe some A-B testing  or that kind of thing.  But yeah, I mean the bar, the Google Plus bar  kind of showed up everywhere.  I think that that's just rolling,  those changes are rolling out  along with kind of a general refresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That Google bar isn't on the YouTube site yet, right?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube's the one place that's not kind of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That seems like the share button  would be perfect right there.  I know.  It's very odd that it's not built right in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's a good point.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's quite a bit of autonomy.  In fact, that's one of the things Vic told us  because I was really lobbying for a pool party.  Pool party is their Instagram.  It's written by the folks.  Remember they bought Slide?  And apparently the Slide folks have a huge,  huge amount of autonomy,  so much so that the pool party program,  which is their kind of Instagram killer,  uses Facebook Connect and not Google Plus at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Vic said,  oh, I just got my invite yesterday.  So apparently you could be senior vice president  at Google and not get an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're not playing favorites.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not playing favorites.  They're not.  Spotify is in the US.  We were thinking maybe that was gonna be part  of the awesome announcement.  Spotify, the European music system,  which has been frankly very popular in Europe  and highly demanded in the US.  Spotify is coming, it says, to the US.  Any track, any time, anywhere, it's free.  But you have to sign up.  And apparently it has nothing to do with Facebook,  even though we'd heard that Facebook  would be involved in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's been coming longer than the Messiah.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mark Zuckerberg says, Spotify is so good.  Demi Moore says, Spotify is genius.  How the hell do they know?  How does Demi know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My theory is that it doesn't really exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a trick.  It's the Germans are playing a trick on us.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Germans getting back for Google Street View.  Yeah, we have Spotify and you don't.  You are so behind at times.  Any other stories?  I'm trying to go through these real quickly.  No, I think you hit them.  Real-time search, gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the one that used Twitter, right?  Yeah, is that just because the Twitter deal is up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the- Twitter deal was over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Real-time search, when you did a search,  you could have real-time results coming in,  streaming in from Twitter.  Begs the question, what the hell?  Why are they using Twitter?  Why aren't they using other things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They try to get Facebook.  They can never get that deal.  Bing, locked up Facebook.  Twitter seemed like the obvious alternative,  but now with Plus-  You think that Plus will take over?  Google has put it up somewhere.  I can't find it on one of their sites,  but it's on one of them.  It says that they are looking to integrate Google Plus  once it comes back.  So real-time will have Plus streaming  once it probably goes live for all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope that's true.  Let us take a break.  We're gonna come back quickly  and get Gina Trippani's Tip of the Week,  Jeff Jarvis's Number of the Week,  and my Tool of the Week.  But first, my friends, a word from the folks at Netflix.  Just a quick word.  Sign up today, 30 days free.  If you don't have Netflix, what the hell, get it.  And now we return with our program.  I mean, really?  Do I need to say anything else?  7.99 a month for unlimited streaming.  It's incredible.  I have to say, though,  I am a Comcast customer in a cul-de-sac.  I watch Netflix every night.  Every night, everything slows down on the internet.  And I think in this cul-de-sac,  every house they're watching Netflix.  We now know that something like 30%  of all primetime traffic is Netflix streaming.  And I think that Comcast,  you need to give me some more bandwidth  because everybody's watching Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just watched Firefly and Serenity  that were the long weekend, like rewatched it.  Summer Cloud, baby.  A great series.  So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Summer Cloud.  It's just great.  So if you don't have it, get it.  And you know what, if you have it,  would you do us a favor?  Because we need that, we desperately need your support.  If you're not gonna buy a brick,  just tell a friend about this free deal,  30 days free of Netflix, Netflix.com.  And just make sure they go to Netflix.com slash twit.  That's all.  You could buy a brick later.  Netflix.com slash twit.  All right.  Now, I don't wanna leave you out, IAAS,  but this is the part of the show  where we do the tool tip and the number.  So if you could think of something  you'd like to throw in there, go ahead.  But let me start with Gina Trapani.  And her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  This was a Google Plus tip that I just found out about.  If you want, you can hide who is in your circles  and who has you in their circles.  Not saying that you should, Jeff,  just saying that you can, just in case.  By default, it's public.  But if you wanna hide it,  and you'll show up on social statistics as having zero,  you just go to your profile and hit edit.  And if you click on the area where it says,  in Gina's circles or have Gina in circles,  you can click there and you can uncheck a box  that says show people in my circles  or show people have added you to your circles.  Only if you want, public is better,  but kind of interesting to know that you can,  if you don't wanna broadcast who you're following,  you can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good idea for those of you who wish to hide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, you cowards, you don't wanna be called.  You cowards.  Actually, I'm gonna turn mine back on again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you proved that it was doable, we saw it.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can set it to anyone on the web  can see who's in your circles  or just your circles can see who's in your circles.  So there's some granularity there too, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't see what circle again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, they can't see the name of the circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just that they're in your circles.  That'll be the first bad leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that would be bad.  That would be bad.  You know what's gonna happen.  You know what's gonna happen.  Oh, I'm in his a-hole circle.  Exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A few choices here.  We have Twitter is now seeking a $7 billion valuation  in its next round.  200 million tweets a day.  Right, but no business model.  And the other number that fascinated me  that everybody knows is Microsoft congratulating Hotmail  for being 15 years old.  God, that's amazing.  It is, and it makes me wonder  what is the useful life of any of these services?  Hotmail still exists, but you don't have to be-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As long as they're relevant.  Relevant.  Yeah. Revalent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're relevant, they're revealing things.  Actually, it is interesting  because we act as if Facebook, Google, Twitter,  they're gonna be around forever.  And it's not the case.  15 years from now, who knows?  MySpace too.  I still get over.  MySpace too.  By the way, Tom Anderson on Google Plus  is now pointing out that MySpace had Skype in 2004  in its chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, and that news about Google Plus being in real time,  Google announced it on Twitter.  Not just now?  No, that's where I found it.  That's where the announcement's from.  So everyone's using each other's services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  15 years from now,  we'll all wonder what this is all about.  Can I plug one more thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  I'm going to be at Google HQ on Monday  doing a privacy talk for Googlers at noon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you're a Googler, we know many listen.  12 noon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, at Twitter?  Are you doing a talk for Googlers?  No, at Google.  Oh, sorry, sorry.  At Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fortunately, I don't have time to come up to Petaluma.  I was gonna say, why don't you come up?  You don't have time.  I wish I could.  I'm going out and I'm hitting that  and then hitting Glam on Tuesday  and then going down to see Bill Gross  at Idea Lab on Wednesday and then back home.  Oh, and the good news of that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that you will be broadcasting on Twig next week  from Idea Lab and I think we're gonna have Bill Gross on,  yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to get him.  I don't know if he's read yet,  but I'm trying to get him, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be wonderful.  Bill Gross is here.  I told him we were all excited.  Fascinating guy who really was the first  to create a startup incubator, I think.  Yep.  Yeah, Idea Lab.  My tool of the week is something I've been,  you know, I'm a big fan of alternative launchers  on the Android phone and you know I'm a big Android user.  I really am.  And I loved it because MG Siegler on Google Plus  was saying, gee, I would send you pictures  if the Android app on the iPhone,  if the Google Plus app on the iPhone would let me,  and I had to say for the first time,  you should get a real phone, MG, that iPhone.  Maybe you ought to think about it.  I wonder how many people are thinking  about Android phones at this point.  Well, one of the nice things you could do  with an Android phone is you could change the launcher,  which really changes the whole way the phone looks.  And we've all tried a lot of different launchers.  I was using Launcher Pro for a while.  I know I'm a little late to the game at this.  Eileen Rivera, who hosts our All About Android show, said,  what, of course you have to use Go Launcher X.  This is the, it's free, which is nice.  In fact, the way they monetize is cool.  They sell themes for $1.99 or so,  and they have a lot of additional plugins.  This is a very attractive, very usable launcher,  and unlike a lot of launchers,  it doesn't seem to cause stability issues.  I just think they've done a very, very nice job.  So that's kind of my favorite launcher these days on Android  and one I think a lot of people would like.  Like a lot of launchers, among other features you get,  now this is Gingerbread, by the way,  hacked Gingerbread on the G2X.  You get a full length bar across the bottom,  but you can also have additional bars across the bottom,  which means you get a lot of functionality built into there.  You see my G plus widget right there on the front page.  This is one of the features I really like.  You can pinch to see all of the homepages,  and it's easy to add homepages  and even rearrange homepages in a very Apple-like fashion.  Just a few of the really nice features of this.  It's absolutely free.  GoLauncherX, GoLauncherEX from the GoLauncher dev team.  That's my tool of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Downloading now.  Yeah, I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to hear what you think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You use a Nexus One or a Nexus S?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A Nexus S right now, yeah.  It's naked, I'm not using a launcher right now.  For a while I was using SlideScreen  and I dabbled with Launcher Pro,  but yeah, I'll check this one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, a lot of times I take the launchers off,  but the Gingerbread launcher, while okay,  is missing a few little things like that  more elaborate taskbar at the bottom there  that I just kind of get attached to.  There are a lot of GoLauncherX widgets too,  which are pretty cool.  All right, I think we're out of time.  I think it's time for tech news today.  Ayaz, don't move.  Well, I gotta move over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, don't let Tom have that seat.  I am working double duty, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Possession is nine-tenths of the law.  You know that, you're a lawyer.  Keep the seat.  Don't move.  All right.  All right, Ayaz Akhtar, thank you for joining us.  Thanks for having me, guys.  On the Twitter, he is at Ayaz, I-Y-A-Z.  That's me.  And are you, you know, he used to do a podcast  called This Old Nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, just relaunched it two weeks ago.  Oh, good.  So it's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay, so where would we find that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That could be at thisoldnerd.com.  Good.  Check it out there, or just follow me on Twitter  because I will tweet about it nonstop,  and then when you're on Plus, it'll be there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  Yeah, you're Plus user now?  Yes. Yes, you are.  We are all Plus users.  Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.  She's also at thinkupapp.com and at Gina Trapani on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I'll see you all in three shows.  Have fun in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Full voyage, or however you say it in Chinese.  Have fun there.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  Peking duck, you gotta have.  Okay.  Boy, there's so much, the food is so good.  If you go to Xi'an, you gotta have dumplings.  They're famous for their dumplings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I cannot, I am going to these.  So is Shanghai, actually.  Your dumplings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, dumplings are great.  Oh, I'm so jealous.  Peking duck, okay, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're gonna have a good time.  All right, I've got a list.  Yep.  But I'm really gonna miss you guys.  In three shows, or three shows from now,  in the new studio.  In the new studio.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say goodbye to the cottage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And everybody out there, buy your brick.  I bought one, you all buy your brick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for the plug.  Bricks.twit.tv.  I tell you, when you come and see the wall of honor there,  all the bricks we've got, we broke a thousand bricks,  so it's gonna be fairly long.  It's so cool to see all those messages and things.  It's just really neat.  And it does help us build this new studio,  which end up costing,  well, I just got a quote for the curtains in my office.  Curtains, $20,000.  No.  What?  We are not gonna do that, don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How?  They're made out of iPhones.  It's hard to expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like, what?  No.  I will hang them myself.  I will make them,  I will do the opposite of Scarlett O'Hara.  I will take a dress and make it into curtains,  and hang them myself.  Who's your designer, Anolda Marcos?  Yeah, pretty much.  That's me.  Marissa.  It's very easy to get very expensive on this stuff.  And we're cutting, believe me, we are being intelligent.  But things happen.  For instance, we were using a Blackmagic router,  40 in, 40 out, which gives us the capability of having,  we have 30 cameras.  And it turns out, once we connected up all the cameras,  and the video, and the Skype, it's not big enough.  So that was $5,000.  We now have to buy a $15,000 router.  So these things add up.  Your bricks make it possible for me to say,  actually more like Lisa, our CEO, to say,  no, you could do that.  No, you could do that.  I don't know how long that's gonna last.  Yeah, you could do that, Leah.  Bricks.  Okay, you could do that.  Bricks.twit.tv.  I promise it won't go to curtains in my office.  Jeff Jarvis is in charge at buzzmachine.com.  That's his great blog.  It's a must read.  His new book, Public Parts, is due out next month,  or September, I guess.  And he's also on the Twitter, at Jeff Jarvis.  And his latest book is What Would Google Do?  That is a great read.  You should read that.  Thanks everybody for being here.  We do this show every Wednesday,  about 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.  That's 2,000 UTC at live.twit.tv,  but you can always catch it after the fact  by going to twit.tv slash twig for this week in Google.  And you can subscribe, get it automatically,  listen every week, just like all the Googlers do.  Thanks for being here.  We'll see you next time on Twig.  Bye bye.
