Yeah, the Google verse  and all of that stuff.  Facebook. I got schooled in  Facebook. We're talking about  it in a second. But first,  ladies and gentlemen, I give  you Jeff Jeffrey Jarvis,  professor of journalism at the  City University of New York.  He's in his office right now on  Times Square. He is the author  of such great books as public  parts. What would Google do?  Gutenberg, the geek blogs at  buzz machine dot com and is the  only one in the United States  we have. Oh, don't put a target  on my back. There is in France.  Well, of course, it's France.  Yeah, but we also we don't  really have that concept here,  but I think you are though. I  don't even know. You know, I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  never really fully understand  what the hell that means. It

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  means, uh, okay, well, let me  first introduce Gina and then  I'll tell you what it means.  Gina Trapani, she's a public

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nerd. Yeah, not an intellectual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm proud of it. No, you're  brilliant. No, you are an  intellectual, but you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a public simpleton. You're

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a public nerd. Okay. Public  geek. She founded Lifehacker.  Okay, that's just, you know,  you could after that retire, but  no, then she went on to do such  great things as think up think  up dot com and who could ever  forget the Google Wave Bible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you can't. I gotta get you.  I really want to erase that part  of your your brain. Do you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a box of them at home? She has

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the Google Wave book has the  right to be forgotten. I did for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  when I set up my standing desk,  I used the box of books that had  never sold or done anything as  my like foot rests. So they  actually did come and come in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  handy in the movie, Page one,  uh, David Carr and Brian's  sheltering company about the New  York Times. You see the copy of  what would Google do, which  David Carr uses only as a as a  wrist rest. Oh, that's so mean.  Yeah, that's like almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  intentional dig. Yeah. I mean,  I'm sure it is. That's what  happens when you're public  intellectual. So public  intellectual goes back. You know,  we've had them in the days of  Dick Cavett when there were  actually places worse. I love  that, Kevin. When there were  places you could go on  mainstream media and just be  smart. Gore Vidal was a public  intellectual. Right. Mailer  Norman Mailer was a public  intellectual. Carson would  interview people like that  sometimes. So the public  intellectual is somebody who  who is a well known persona,  but not because they're in  movies, but because they're a  writer, a thinker. They have big  things to say. And I think you  you count. I cosine. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, no, you're putting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're putting a target on me,  please. Every other way. Is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that the new thing I cosine? Is  that is that a thing? I  cosine. I like it. Plus one plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one. I cosine. So we had

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Robert Scoble on boy. It's  great to have Robert on. I love  having people on Twitter on who  are polarizing Dvorak's polar.  Those are the people who are  really successful. You love them  or hate them, but you but it  gets people going. And Robert  and I had a fairly heated  conversation back and forth for  45 minutes on Facebook. He said  in one year from now, you will  come back to me and say you were  right. Robert, Facebook is  killing it. They are the social  platform. I said, What are you  talking about? It's it's getting  worse by the moment. He says  you're doing it wrong. But I  don't look my position is, well,  you shouldn't have to do  anything. Anyway, we're going to  have Robert come back and do an  hour long special on how to  cultivate your Facebook feed. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that being in the  timeline of life so that a year  from now when he says Facebook  is over. I love Robert. I think  he's wonderful. But the but the  the bipolar nature of his  technology loves. Yeah. And he

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hates. Yeah, I know that. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  agree. The Robert Scoble seal of  approval is does not carry much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  weight tends to lose its glue

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  after a while. But I think he  was making some interesting  points. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  As he often does, chiefly that  if you really care enough to put  the energy into it, you can make  Facebook something you'll enjoy.  So I've been trying to do it. It  ain't easy. Well, of course, the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  big the big fight these days is  about Facebook is that number  one, well, primarily you don't  know to whom you're publishing  same with Google Plus, but it's  left out of the discussion.  Right. Right. And that's the  primary issue. And then the  second complaint is that the  Ferguson's don't bubble up and  Pew has study out today. I  didn't put it on the rundown. A  variant of the echo chamber  argument that people will not  they don't feel right having  harsh political opinions on  Facebook. So right. I don't I  don't walk by neighbor's house  to bar a cup of sugar and say,  by the way, Barack Obama is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  great. And you're wrong. I think  he's awful. As soon as I saw  that study, I thought, oh, this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is just a filter bubble back and  Jeff's going to have something  to say about it. This is Claire  Kane Miller, who, by the way,  gets things wrong more often  than right. She writes for the  New York Times. I've started,  you know, as soon as I saw her  byline, I thought, oh, because I  just I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems to get the summer that  you're going to go back to the  internet. It seems contributing  to the polarization of America.  Oh, yeah. As people surround  themselves with people who think  like them and hesitate to say  anything different. Now, as I  said, it is my response to this  on Twitter was if this is such  an echo chamber, how come all I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  see is arguments? That's a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  point. We've talked about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  before. Chamber. All we'd say is  cosine plus one that right. You  know, I couldn't have said it  better myself. Right. How often  do you see that? You don't  because people are arguing their  faces off on this stupid thing  we call a net. This is this goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  back to the book Eli Pariser  wrote called the Filter Bubble  where he said that what happens  in these networks is you this is  not I don't think this is a poor  thesis that is that you  cultivate your feeds. That's the  whole point of Twitter and  Facebook and everything else  that you cultivate your feeds to  include only people you agree  with. You read your news only to  be, you know, to you watch Fox  News because you agree with them  you watch MSNBC because you  agree with them. It's not just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about agreement or disagreement  it's also about relevance. And  so the short answer to the fact  Eli and I've debated Eli in  public on this. Number one is  that it's a hell of a lot more  filter bubble to have one editor  of the New York Times to select  what you care about. That's a  far worse filter bubble. And  number two I do see lots of  things from all over creation.  I see them on Twitter, I see them  on TV, I see them, I get  bombarded with stuff and to  argue that these services  shouldn't give me higher  relevance is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well and you also make the point  that from time immemorial we have  surrounded ourselves with  friends, loved ones, colleagues  who agree with us. Here in  Northern California we have  pretty much pushed the  Republicans to the sea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The south.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I think that you don't  see people agreeing with one  another as much as you see them  debate but there's a lot of  liking and favoriting. I mean  there's a lot of atta boy atta  girls that go on that are a  little more silent. I think  liking and favoriting is kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what that's about.  Well I don't get much of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Gina. Nobody's atta boy in me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No but I think more to the point  and you do this in life you try  to arrange things in such a way  that you're surrounded by people  who share your world view. Do  you not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah you do. You do. Although  you know it's interesting like  because of Facebook I am  connected to like distant  family members or you know my  wife is connected to co-workers  and you get kind of a glimpse of  their kind of internal life in a  way that you might not with a  distant family member or an  acquaintance right. So like  there's certainly like family  members and co-workers whose  political views or religious  views are so different than my  own and I think in those  circumstances you know there are  certain topics I don't bring up  at the holidays because I see  the monologue you know or the  dialogue going on on Facebook  the rest of the year I don't  engage with it because why I  don't want to make enemy you  know whatever but it does it  but but that was what I thought  of when I read this article  like oh yeah there are times  when I just avoid certain topics  with certain folks because I  just I just know it's only to  get weird and bad right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook is more the  Thanksgiving table Twitter is  more the street corner right and  so they're they're different  contexts for interaction but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  certainly more than you would  get in life normally you get  dissenting points of view yes  more than you would get in the  New York Times or Fox News or  MSNBC you get other points of  view and that's I certainly am  exposed to I'm exposed to both  sides of Israel Gaza for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  instance yeah oh yeah.  Yeah.  You did a study in 2004 which  that you couldn't really  replicate today because  everybody's online but there  was some portion of people who  get their news offline TV and  such some of their news online  those who got their news online  were more exposed to their  opponents arguments than those  who got their you go off at the  top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's true.  I do think it's true I think and  and I and it's I think I'm much  more tolerant of opposing  viewpoints than I used to be to  be honest because of this.  Yeah I don't know you might

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  also to your point I I I I work  magnificent school CUNY is is is  a temple to diversity because it  it represents New York and New  Yorker represents the world and  we value that here tremendously  and so I get different  perspectives from my students  which is really important but I  also my friends online I get  people like Rafa Ali who grew up  he he brought a picture of of of  he and his brothers going to  school in a horse cart back in  India in the day and I just  begged him for more because it  was a it was a glimpse of a  different life and he has a  different perspective on the  world and I have tons of friends  like that online and and I just  value I'm not going to go arguing  with them not going to say well  you have a dumb life because they  don't I'm I'm going to savor  these glimpses into their lives  or friends of mine online who are  from Turkey or from Iraq and and  and that kind of diversity I have  far more of that today than I  ever could have had.  Living in my little summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let's let's throw out both  this New York Times article and  the Puse study and and while

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're at it throw out Scobel  with the bathwater way.  Well but to his credit Robert  John's joking Robert John's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that's that is one place  Facebook particularly is one  place where I see dissenting  points of view because I follow  I follow people because I know  them or because their family  members not because they agree  with me.  Twitter maybe more so I don't  see much I don't think I see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  more kind of I did this and then  I did that.  I see that too but I but I have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  few friends whose political  viewpoints differ greatly from  mine I see a lot of their posts  there.  Google Plus I pretend to pretty  much see people agree with me.  You can also kill those who

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  don't.  Yeah that maybe that maybe is  part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google I mean I but on the other  hand Google Plus really lends  itself to discussions.  So much better I think it really  does.  Well I think that's important

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to us what we're seeing is you  know the the four matters there  was a sorry lights just went off  hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff is is beset from plagued by

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the the flinty parsimony of the  university they the lights will  turn off if Jeff doesn't turn off  your tax dollars at work man.  By the way I like that phrase I  just made that up flinty  parsimony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a flavor of ice cream.  I'm going to I should write that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  down.  I said I'm going to use that  somewhere maybe the title of  this show.  Persimmons.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there was a famous study.  Persimmons.  You must have been watching the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Simpsons the Simpsons marathon.  Persimmons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is what happens when you  play games for 20 hours a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nine.  Things start to amuse you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  At least my brain still works.  I wasn't sure.  Of a sort.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there was a famous famous  study done at the NIH actually  done by the father of my college  girlfriend John Calhoun.  Throwing rats into an  environment.  Remember that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No tell me more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They overcrowded and then what  happened.  That's very fast.  There were chambers and there  were bridges and some rats staked  out to good spot and then they  overcrowded to another spot and  so on and so forth.  There's always been debate about  this about Calhoun's study and  there was I just read yesterday  an excerpt of a lecture about it  now.  I was having thoughts about the  rat study with online.  Because one of the arguments  about the rats was not so much  that they were overcrowded but  that they were overstimulated  with interaction.  And it struck me that the odd  thing is online especially on  Twitter we all act like a bunch  of angry rats.  But the truth is that we have  all the space in the world.  We have unlimited virtual space.  There's no reason we should feel  overcrowded and get grumpy.  Right.  We should just be able to walk  around anything that displeases  us.  We should all be in harmony and  happiness because we can ignore  anything we want.  And why don't we?  I don't have an answer to that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, because I think our minds,  most people's minds, anyway our  minds are interested in  dissenting points of view and  maybe we even like a little bit  of conflict and argument.  I like it.  Not in moderation but I enjoy  the healthy back and forth.  It's hard to find moderation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I think your experience  is so defined by who you follow  as well.  I mean I don't know that I see a  whole lot of debate and partially  that's just my personality.  I don't love conflict.  So I was actually just talking  to my coworkers about two people  I follow who just got into it  like in the middle of the night  and it got weird and mean and it  made me uncomfortable and I was  just bummed out.  And I know that this is kind of  lame on that debate.  A conflict shouldn't bug me so  much but I just don't see that  that often.  So when I do see it, it makes me  sad and I tend to either unfollow  or mute or whatever.  But most of the folks that I  follow are pretty chill.  So I think it really has to do  I mean I think that Jeff in  particular invites debate because  he's a writer and because he  asserts opinions and I think  people want to engage him with  that but I don't know that  everyone uses Twitter kind of  that same way.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact I think I'm the same as  you Gina.  Mommy and daddy are fighting.  No, no, no.  I don't like conflict.  I will go to great lengths to  avoid conflict even if I'm  getting crappy service or I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I enjoy I enjoy debate but once  it gets personal and people  start to call names which happens  so quickly it feels like  particularly on Twitter it gets  bad for me.  Not just Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no.  It's the same everywhere.  That's social media and maybe  that's the flaw is that we're not  getting real conversations.  We're just getting flame wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that goes back to Mike's  point last week about Google plus  is you actually can have  conversations there which  requires control.  So there's this gap between  openness where anything can  happen and control where you can  have civility.  Let's teach our kids to have  respectful debates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well yeah and I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's the answer is not a  technological answer.  The answer is a matter of  societal norms and we're trying  to figure out and get used to  this.  Yeah.  You know there was I'm back into  my techno panic from years past  as I'm doing my research and  there was a right after the  telegraph started there were  novels that were published and  there were a lot of books about  women being seduced by men over  the telegraph.  If only.  One of them was a famous novel  and I love you stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Please kiss me stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I think it was Clive Thompson I  think reviewed one of them  recently and it's pretty amazing  stuff but society you know what  to do.  Well my God you can if you think  about it the telegraph was the  first opportunity to have a live  telegraph with someone right  right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You couldn't have done that  before.  And that freaked people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well think about it.  I mean we don't nobody you never  would have a flame war or  trolling in person face to face  people are more respectful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here it is.  If you want to read next.  Wired love a romance of dots and  dashes by Ella Cheever Thayer if  you want to look it up Chad you

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  can get it.  I got it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a good reads.  Let's see.  Yeah it's 1880.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a romance novel.  This is Clive who reviewed it.  Clive Thompson reviewed it and  said it was actually  surprisingly relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  At collision detection.  Wired love a romance of dots and  dashes by Ella Cheever Thayer.  The old old story in a new new  way.  The old old story in a new way.  MDCC CLXXX 1880.  Miss Natty Rogers telegraph  operator lived as it were in two  worlds.  The one her office dingy and  curtailed as to proportions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  flinty in its parsimony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Persimmons.  He was wondering whether a  gentleman or lady.  Oh yes Quimby remembered and  fidgeted on his chair.  He proved to be a gentleman.  Oh yes exactly you know  responded Quimby looking  anything but elated.  Must be very romantic and  fascinating to talk with someone  so far away.  A mysterious stranger that one  has never seen.  I should get up a nice little  sentimental affair immediately.  I know I should.  Yes telegraphy has its romantic  side.  I would sell if it did not.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Very interesting.  Love in dots and dashes.  That is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what is this?  I'm reading this Claire Kane  Miller and I realize this is on  a new thing that the New York  Times started this spring called  the Upshot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's their answer to Vox and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's the Times but it's like  snappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man we use data here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah and opinion.  Like you don't want me to  recline in my airline seat?  Well you can pay me by Josh  Barrows.  That's right above Claire Kane  Miller's how social media  silences debate and don't get  mad if Burger King gets  Canadian.  This is not your father's New  York Times.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is trying to have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  kind of perspective.  It's a very deep thing.  And they have this is where  they put their interactive  charts and huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Data viz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Data viz.  Wow.  So this is to appeal to the  internet generation or  something?  Yeah.  It's web only.  There's no newspaper version of  this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if they quote some  stuff in the paper or not.  I actually I never looked at  the paper.  I had the faintest idea.  Actually this story is quite

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  interesting.  Uber's secret agent.  So you see what Uber and the  verge gets credit by the way  for a great big scoop.  What Uber's been trying to do  to Lyft.  Now Uber and Lyft are both ride  sharing services.  They're kind of  disintermediating taxi cabs.  They use apps on your  smartphone to order a ride and  you get all sorts of nice  features like you see where  the driver is and so forth.  Lyft is somewhat more down  market.  They have pink mustaches on the  cars and the car can be older.  Uber the car has to be newer.  Uber has Uber X which is a  little more like Lyft.  But apparently because this  market is a zero sum market,  you know, every ride Lyft gets  is a ride Uber won't and vice  versa.  Uber's been resorting to some  pretty dirty tactics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now there's arguments about  this that whether Uber's goal  was to waste money at Lyft or  whether Uber's goal was just to  recruit drivers at Lyft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's the latter.  They have operation slog and the  idea is they've hired a  considerable number of street  operatives who get paid only on  commission, 750 bucks according  to the verge for each new Lyft  driver they seduce over to the  Uber side.  And what these guys get, they  get a burner phone.  They're supposed to move around  in different street corners,  call for a Lyft cab, get in the  cab and start a conversation  with the aim of getting that  driver to become an Uber driver.  How much better it is?  Blah, blah, blah.  The problem is, of course, once  you've done that once, you don't  want somebody else doing the same  thing and you don't want to get  this.  So apparently there's  considerable number of  cancellations that happen when  people realize, oh, I've seen  that.  I've talked to that guy already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so that's where the  cancellations were happening.  I hadn't realized that.  That's the story now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  CNN had reported that Uber  employees had ordered, then  canceled more than 5,000 Lyft  rides.  And this number from Lyft, of  course.  Lyft says Uber is flat out lying  to their customer.  I have to say, even if it's just  recruitment, it's very  aggressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Extremely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unfair to those drivers who get  canceled.  It's really, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and unfair to the rider  who doesn't get a ride because  some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for that matter, in demand  pricing, if the demand seems  artificially high, it raises the  pricing for everybody, doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it?  I think The Verge has done some  very good reporting here.  They've got the documents.  They've talked to slog recruits.  By the way, Uber has responded  by reminding slog recruits that  they have signed an NDA and they  are not to speak to the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's also interesting that  there is obviously Edward  Snowden of the cab world here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a leaker or two.  Yeah.  But these leakers are leaking out  the documents and so forth.  And this is all over the country,  thousands of them.  I think The Verge has got nailed  them.  Even if it's not canceling rides  and I believe that that probably  is just a side effect.  Not that Uber minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just for a second, just for the  sake of argument.  If they were just trying to lose  the business, it's just like  click fraud, right?  I'm going to cost my competitor  money.  Is that illegal?  Under what laws is it illegal?  It's anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that what it would be?  I wonder if there are, I'm sure  that that could be interpreted  as some sort of anti-competitive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fraudulent behavior.  I'll tell you, it makes me not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  want to ride either Uber or Lyft.  Yeah.  But why not Lyft?  I don't know.  I feel like Lyft is also kind of  stirring the pot a little bit  here.  These guys are in heart because  they're the ones who said, hey,  5,000 rides canceled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These guys should be saying our  highest priority is to make sure  that you have a safe ride  accommodated to your destination.  And that's what they should be  concentrating on.  And by concentrating on this  hoo-ha, it makes me wonder about  how much they really care about  customer service and how much  they're just a volume business  like the manufacturer of my  light switch.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Again with the flinty

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  parsimony.  For the most part, ambassadors  work at events on college campuses  and they're like, hey, we're  going to do this.  And that's what Uber does.  Promoting Uber is a cheap and  easy way of getting around town.  That goal to recruit riders,  Uber calls slanging.  But since at least midsummer,  some brand ambassadors in New  York have been turning their  talents against Lyft using Uber  provided iPhones and credit  cards.  The contractors hail rides,  strike up conversations with the  Lyft drivers and attempt to sign  them up before they arrive at  their destination.  In other cities, recruiters  travel with driver kits that  include iPhones and everything  that's in the Uber.  By the way, it's not illegal  that the companies discourage  it for drivers to drive for both  Lyft and Uber, to have both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, haven't these  drivers, I feel really  conflicted about this whole  thing because on one hand, be  ruthlessly competitive, right?  I mean, is it illegal or not?  I mean, I find the whole thing  really kind of distasteful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's illegal to order a pizza  to prank somebody by having a  pizza delivered to their house.  Sure.  It's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you know, the  cancellations are horrible.  But the actual rides where the  Uber folks are paying Lyft to  give them the ride but having  this conversation with them in  the car, that's not, that  doesn't seem, but I find it  distasteful.  But, you know, as a business  owner, it makes me question,  you know, what are my lines?  You know, Uber's very  aggressively trying to recruit  drivers.  I mean, the first question that  came to my mind is these  drivers are aware that Uber  exists, right?  Like, they've clearly, you know,  tried Lyft.  I mean, it's interesting to me.  I mean, you know, it sounds like  Uber feels like they're giving  these, the Lyft drivers  something, you know, the harder  sell or something that, you  know, they didn't know before.  I don't know.  I have always felt kind of  wary of Uber.  Part of it is that they're  getting built into all these  different apps, including  Google Maps.  It feels like there's this,  like, classes thing going on,  you know, the Uber helicopters  to the Hamptons.  I just feel so, I don't know.  I don't know how, it seems  sketchy to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that's a brand  issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, now that it's out, it's a  black mark against Uber for  sure.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And yet everyone seems to think  that they're the best way to get  a ride.  And you hear, you know, the  Uberization of everything.  Uber is this, like, model for  what startups should be or,  like, certain kinds of new  innovation should be, and that  also makes me nervous.  This is the, there might be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  little undercurrent, seedy  undercurrent of startups where  there's such drive to succeed  and turn and to grow and to  appeal to the investors and  make sure they're happy.  And maybe you would cross the  line a little bit because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, growth hacking and stupid  backhanded tricks, right, to  pump up page views or get users  or whatever.  I mean, this is, yeah, this is  part of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's what we operate by the  wrong metrics.  You know, what you measure.  I don't know if we talked about  it last week or not.  Isn't Uber beloved because

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they're, they're modern, they're  cool, they're not, they're above  this, they wouldn't do that.  They're the good guys.  Right.  They're empowering you to get a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  cheap ride.  They're empowering the driver to  make a living doing this.  They could be so above it.  And they should be.  But this is where the metrics  come in.  But who's judging their success?  It's not writers and drivers at  all.  It's investors.  Yeah.  They deliver kittens, they  deliver ice cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's this high end feeling.  It feels like a premium service.  You know, like you're getting  treated like a boss.  You know, like you're getting  treated like a rich and famous  person.  By the way, when you get an Uber

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  car, do you sit in the front or  the back?  Oh, the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why would you sit in the front?  I sit in the front.  What are you, a commie?  It's like you got that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the Lyft I would sit in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  front.  The Uber is like Australian.  In the Uber I'm in back, baby.  Really?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why?  Because of the brand difference?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Like Lyft feels like you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  getting it from a friend.  So there's a Lincoln, Lincoln  Continental and a Toyota Celica.  With Lyft I'm getting the front  seat because it's a Lyft from my  buddy.  With Uber that's a driver and I'm  in a black car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, UberX, UberX I'm talking.  I don't do UberX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know what that is.  Oh, I see it.  I don't do, I've only done Uber a  few times.  We don't have Uber or Lyft in  Petaluma.  We have a taxi cab company.  Well, it's very nice.  It's a very nice taxi cab company.  And actually that, you know, I'm  starting to like the taxi model.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used Uber once in San Francisco.  I didn't even use it.  Ron from All About Android called  me an Uber or tapped me an Uber  to get back after doing All About  Android in studio.  I don't know.  Here in Brooklyn I call 7th  Avenue Car Service.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Local business.  Interesting.  So you don't use Uber either?  Because you have Uber.  You could do it.  Yeah.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's just old habits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh.  I never use a cab.  I've been in a cab in five years  in a year.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to take a break.  When we come back, you guys can  pick.  I see a lot of stories.  Nothing just wows me, but you  guys can pick the stories you'd  like to talk about.  Of course we've got the Google  change log coming up.  And I get we could talk about  Amazon.  If Amazon is on getting Twitch  stealing it away from Google,  apparently in a bidding war,  that might be of interest too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're still in the  sun.  It's not some doldrums quite,  but I think...  Oh, this is the slow time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because in a week we're going to  have new iPhone, maybe even new  iWatch is the rumor.  We're going to have a new Moto X.  I'm excited about that.  I've got a conundrum.  I've had this phone for a whole  month.  I don't know what I'm going to  do next.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have a conundrum because I've  liked the OnePlus actually.  But I've loved the Moto X and I  can't wait to see what they do.  And I want the 360 because it's  round even if it's a flat tire  round.  LG says we've figured it out.  We don't have to have a flat  tire on our round.  Yeah, I can't wait for that now.  That makes me mad because I  bought a square LG though.  I mean it's like come on guys.  There's a balancing act between  coming out too soon and too  late.  And then of course the new  iPhone which looks very  appealing especially and I think  that now the rumors are  congealing that a round X is  round the idea that there will  be not only a 4.7 inch but a 5.5  inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One plus one size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like it.  Big is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How old, I mean how big is the  current iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Four inches.  And that's up from 3.5 two years  ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My iPhone friends see my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and they're just like what is  that?  Is it a tabletop?  Like they're just huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The world is now divided between  the smallies and the biggies.  But it feels so normal to me  now.  Yes, you get used to big and  nobody anymore jokes about oh  is that a side of beef you're  talking into.  It doesn't happen anymore except  for among the iPhone crew.  The one thing is Gina you were  right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The front jeans pocket doesn't  work.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't work anymore.  It's true.  But I've always kept my phone in

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  my breast pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so nerdy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like a pocket square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  It's very stylish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's very Don Draper.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Sorry, Leo.  I wish it were.  You need a white one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wish I were Don Draper.  God, you don't know how much I  wish I were Don Draper.  At least I have a great mattress.  Have you?  If Don Draper had a mattress he  would have a Casper.  I am not kidding.  I can't let me tell you.  I spent a lot of time buying  mattresses.  I don't know why.  But in the last couple of years  I bought several mattresses.  I got one that was too firm and  then I got one that was too  soft and now I've got one that  was just right.  And the problem is you go in the  mattress store and you lie in  the mattress with the EBEI'd  person looking at you and you  can't really tell.  Are you supposed to curl up?  You can't tell.  You just lie there looking at  the ceiling and go I guess I'll  take that one.  And I think in my head I think  firm.  But then I got soft but then I  don't like it.  The too soft is anyway Casper is  great.  One of the reasons Casper is  great is because first of all  they're very affordable, very  well made, very nice mattresses  and you have 100 days to return  it.  So you have more than three  months to see whether you like  it.  You're going to get a great  night's sleep.  Show the video.  We got my Casper.  First of all this is hysterical.  Shipping is free.  It comes in a box.  This is a queen size mattress  that's a small like a college  refrigerator size.  So you open the box.  By the way I didn't do it right.  They said open the box where you  want your mattress to be.  I open it in the foyer.  But that's okay.  And then it comes with a little  opener.  It's got Tyvek sleeve.  You open it up and then it goes  and it plumps.  And now you've got a really  comfortable mattress using just  the right combination.  Watch this.  This is a premium latex and  memory phone.  So it's just what I want which  is soft on top with a firm  underneath.  I don't know.  I can't describe it.  It's great.  Long lasting comfort and support.  Very affordable.  You buy them online completely  risk free because you have free  delivery and painless returns  within a hundred day period.  Night night.  I'm going to go to the next

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  question.  What's the best way to get a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  good night's sleep?  Casper people have a great sense  of humor.  They sent me a book in my Casper  box.  There's Lisa.  She loves it too.  They sent me Litten Strakey's  eminent Victorians in the box  which definitely put you out.  Thank you Terry for that.  But it's really cool.  Statistically they say lying on  a bed in a showroom has no  correlation to whether it's the  right bed for you and I will  vouch for that.  I've done it.  These are made in America.  They're really comfy.  They do a great job.  They even give you a little  good night book that tells you  how to live with your Casper.  You can put it right on the  floor.  I like this so much I got one  for Henry for his dorm.  Not dorm but his house, his  college house.  And that's how he's going to do  it right on the floor but we  can also put it on a box spring  or a slide door.  It's a really good bed base.  It's well made.  Really nice.  Very comfortable.  No springs.  If you've never slept on a foam  mattress you'll say where's the  lumps?  They're perfect.  But don't think it's like just  a piece of foam.  It really isn't.  It's really nice.  It's really nice.  And this cover can be unzipped  and washed.  I am very happy they have a  very nice team there.  So I just want you to try Casper  mattresses.  You'll find them at Casper  sleep, C-A-S-P-E-R, sleep.com  slash twig.  And save 50 bucks by the way  when you use the offer code  twig, T-W-I-G.  $500 for a twin, 9.50 for a  king.  Now compare that to the prices  in the mattress store plus 100  days.  Plus you don't have to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  through all that mishegas.  I'm trying to say is that  mattress like that mattress?  No, I know.  It's so...  It's a whole industry that's  made up trying to fool you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Petaluma, it must, Pet, it's a  very high profit industry.  Petaluma has like eight mattress  stores.  And literally they're twice as  expensive as the Casper.  These are really nice.  I'm very happy.  People, when I showed a picture  of the Casper on Twitter, a lot  of people said I've been  thinking about it but I just,  I don't want, I want to, do you  like it?  And I said yes, I do very much.  You should try it.  And of course 100 days to return  it if you don't like it.  By the way, for every mattress  that you purchase through this  show, Casper's going to donate  $50 to Child's Play which is  really nice.  They're a very nice charity that  helps sick kids.  And I'm going to give you a  little bit of a discount that  helps sick kids.  Nice.  Yeah, I like that.  Casper, they're not, you know  what, they're really nice people.  Caspersleep.com slash twig.  So you'll save 50 bucks and 50  bucks goes to Child's Play.  I'm shopping for one.  I know that if you get it and  you don't like it, I'm never  going to hear the end of it.  So.  Oh no.  No, I know you, Jeff.  And you will like it.  I'm not kidding.  More than my light switch.  I'm telling you, it's not like  no flinty parsimony.  No flinty mattresses for me.  No.  So let's do the, why don't we  play the trumpets and do the  change log?  Yeah.  How about that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Transcript:  Tripati.  We've got a few things today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're on IOS, Google has  released updates to the Docs and  Sheets app.  This update lets you open, edit  and save Microsoft Office  documents.  They've also released Google  slides for IOS.  Yes.  Yeah.  Big new feature here in Sheets  and Docs is you can add Microsoft  Office documents natively.  So you can open anything created  in Office and then you can also  save those files in their  original Office formats.  You can create and edit Google  slides on IOS now with the new  slides app.  So yeah, get those before the  new iPhone comes out.  Hangouts got a refresh in Gmail  which adds this new contacts  tab.  There's a little tab.  It's not a text label.  It's just a little kind of  androgynous person icon.  You tap on that icon and it  sorts your contacts by whether  or not they're online.  So it puts your online contacts  at the top and you can also pin  certain contacts at the top as  well.  So it makes it easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want Hangouts to get better.  I feel like it's so close.  It's just so heavyweight.  I don't know what's wrong but I  really want to use Hangouts.  I really want to like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Android Hangouts app just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  drives me nuts because I can't  tell whether I'm sending a  Hangout message or an SMS.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I use most of my phone calls.  Most of my phone calls are with  Hangouts though even at home  because I can wear my headset  and I sit in front of the  computer.  It's just easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff, I think there might be a  setting in Hangouts that lets  you either set different colors  or separate SMS and Hangouts.  I'll look at that.  I'll look at that.  Typical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jarvis just complains.  Gina solves.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  But of course that's not the  fault because Google wants just  all your messages to be  seamlessly together kind of a  lot eye message.  But yeah Hangouts is still a  little bit clunky in that area.  There's a new, there's a big  update to a very old app.  Do you guys remember Google  News and Weather for Android?  It came out forever ago.  Oh yeah.  It's a very old app.  It's a very old app.  It's a very old app.  It's a very old app.  It's a very old app.  It's a very old app.  Oh yeah.  Hasn't gotten any love for a  really long time and boom.  Version 2.0 just dropped,  adding material design.  It's got the card layout akin  to what you see in Google now.  There's support for local news  and weather for multiple  locations, a new, resizable  home screen widget.  It's for Android 4.0 and higher  and it's rolling out gradually.  I mean we covered this last  night on All About Android and  it's not just Google now.  The difference between news and  weather and Google now is that  news and weather is actually  kind of a full featured news app  with different sections, technology  sports where you get sort of in  a more conventional, typical  newspaper whereas now recommends  news based on the things that  you search for.  How many news apps does Google  need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I stopped installing this one  and installed Currents then they  kind of let that one go and put  newsstand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Newsstand, which is kind of okay.  It's not rolled out to me yet.  I think it's maybe not my news  junkie but I think it's a bit of  a waste.  They have tremendous power with  Google News and they're not  really using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to download news and  weather again.  I haven't installed it on them.  I don't have it yet.  Oh, I don't see it on the app.  So it's not everywhere yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems to be rolling out  gradually so you might not see  it on your phone or tablet right  away.  I really like Circa for when I  just want to browse news.  The Guardian app is also great  but Google News and Weather,  Material Design.  Maybe it's just an example of  what Material Design should look  like.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of Android, the Google  Search app for Android updated  with navigation cards that look  like the ones in Google Maps.  So if you search for destination  or directions between two  locations and just the Google  Search app, you'll get these  navigation cards that display a  map that outlines the trip with  the approximate travel time,  distance, suggested and  alternative routes, desired  mode of transportation, and  step-by-step directions.  That's all just in the Google  Search results without having to  launch maps.  Of course you can just tap on  the card to launch maps if you  want to do that.  And finally, Google Plus users  can now import their videos into  their YouTube account.  So you've auto-uploaded videos  to Google Plus or you want to  back them up to YouTube, you  want to publish them on YouTube.  You can go in YouTube, go to the  Uploads page and click on the  Import button and then you've got  a chooser.  You can choose any of your Google  Plus videos.  And bring them on into YouTube  and then you can publish them on  YouTube if you want.  Yeah.  Yeah, so that's kind of a nice  benefit of having Google Plus and  YouTube kind of merged.  And that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, import video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Import video, yeah.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have a lot of video, all of it  trivial and dumb because it's  camera phone video.  Yep.  But maybe I should put it on  YouTube.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Really?  I haven't tried it myself.  I want to see if you the master  can make this happen.  Okay, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  That's why everything's  responding now.  Stop it.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bop it.  Go.  I hate it when that happens.  I'm British.  What are you going to do now?  All right.  Oh, dear.  Let's close that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.  How can we get there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it in the okay Google that you  have to be British?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After you say okay Google, ask a  question in your normal  California accent and then ask  the next question in a British  accent and according to this,  unless I was being fooled by  this video, it answers back to  you in a different voice.  That doesn't seem right.

TechCrunch said that Google  blinked.  That the...  That Google somehow didn't bid  enough or this is...  And TechCrunch was the one who  reported that Google had  acquired them.  The price is the same.  A billion dollars.  Actually the deal Amazon says  was 970 million in cash.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the rest was in retainer  fees to people in the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Forbes says the reason is  they backed off because of  antitrust fears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Rightly so.  Rightly so.  Although, well, I don't know.  That may not be fair.  I think there's enough  competition in that space.  But why would Amazon...  What space is it?  I mean, I see the...  Well, the space of watching  people play video games.  I know.  Antitrust.  First of all, that's not...  That makes no sense.  I've never seen a company yet  drop a bid for fear of  antitrust.  And Google itself, when it  bought Motorola, I mean,  companies don't act in fear of  antitrust.  They act and then if they get  turned down, they don't do it.  But T-Mobile and Sprint,  Comcast and Time Warner, I  don't think companies act that  way.  That doesn't sound right.  I mean, really.  XM and Sirius.  These are all things that you  would have thought in the face  of it.  There's no way they're going to  get those through.  And I think you can make a  strong case that Twitch is just  one of many streaming services.  That's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you think that's a face  saving rumor because they lost  the deal?  Yeah, I think they lost the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  deal.  And it could be that the Twitch  folks wanted more money or it  could be they didn't want to  work for Google.  You know, remember, then  they're just a small part of a  bigger operation called YouTube  at Amazon.  They're probably the run of the  place.  In fact, I was wondering why  Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, Amazon's clearly moving  towards creating content.  They do shows now.  In fact, my suspicion is that  they would like to get the  hashettes of the world out of  the publishing business and just  publish direct.  You know, why not control the  content?  But they don't really have a  platform where they don't have a  live streaming platform at all.  And so I'm not sure what the...  I'm not sure what the overall...  It made so much sense to tie it  to YouTube where really watching  people game is a big part of  YouTube.  A billion dollars is a lot for  Amazon.  They only have about $5 billion  in cash.  Yeah.  That's a lot of money.  They say they're not going to  move Twitch to Seattle, that  they're going to leave them in  San Francisco, that they're going  to pretty much...  You have much to move.  It's like, yeah, it's not that  many employees.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still don't get it.  I know I'm an old fart.  I know it.  I know it.  This discussion makes me feel  older than any other discussion  we had.  I know it.  I know it.  I get older than any other

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  discussion we have.  Just don't get Twitch.  You know, it's funny.  I get Twitch much more than I  get YouTube.  I don't get YouTube, but I do  understand Twitch.  Twitch, I get that.  Of course, remember, this is the  guy who spent nine hours last  night playing Diablo 3.  Yeah.  But I would rather play than  watch somebody play.  But there are a lot of reasons  why you'd watch somebody play.  In fact, I often do see Twitch  videos before I buy a game  because I want to see what the  game looks like.  I get that.  The biggest thing I think that's  happening, and Chad's probably  a better guy to ask about than  this, on this than me, is the  game play.  It's funny, but the biggest  thing I think is happening is  it's not really about the  game play.  The most successful ones are  humorists.  They're funny.  And the game play is just an  excuse.  It's just a stage on which they  can perform.  Is that right, Chad, do you  think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely.  None of these people are  experts at the game.  Well, some are, but few.  Very few.  You're not talking Thresh here.  I would say, yeah, maybe two or  three out of 100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some of them, the ones I see  Michael watching, it's not even  about the game play.  He's not learning game play.  It's a humor.  Absolutely.  It's like red versus blue.  It's like machinima.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was not worth the trouble,  but the joke I wanted to do was  I wanted to go make one on me  playing solitaire.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And there's people that are so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  entertaining that they can do  that.  That's exactly right.  That they play Kim Kardashian's  Hollywood iPad game, and it's  hilarious every moment of it.  If you're funny, you're funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of comedic material  there.  But yes, if you're a personality,  they're just using the game as a  thing to rip off.  That's what I think.  It's a stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they're talking about the  game and they're making fun of  the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they make the people do  stupid things.  Well, if you think about it, I  mean, the biggest game currently  on Twitch right now is League of  Legends.  That is not a funny game.  There's nothing built into that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  game to make it funny or  entertaining.  Well, you know what?  Let's really drive Jeff Batty.  He's on TV right now.  What do you say?  Who's the best League of Legends?  I mean, that's the biggest game  right now.  Right now, yeah.  26,000 people right now.  And ladies and gentlemen, you may  hear some profanity here because  most of this stuff is fairly  profane.  Is that life?  Oh, first let's have pancakes.  And this, by the way, is where  the money comes from.  It may just be Amazon may just  see it as an ad platform.  They don't have.  And there you go.  Come on.  By the way, there's no skip  button on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's a 30-second pre-roll  that you can't skip.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what's really bad?  They started the game and then  they went to the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  They let you know that you can  watch the stream after this ad  is done.  Pancakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  Here we go.  Let's listen and watch.  This is 26,000 people.  More people are watching this  right now than are watching us.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So he's got some rap music.  Is that that's not part of the  game.  Nope.  So this guy's not even saying  funny things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I'm not sure if this is  perhaps a tournament and he's  not saying anything because  he's actually playing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's truly trying to play.  This is Nightblue3 playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't worried the TP  just because like I'm not  getting much out of it.  I mean, I would say the same,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you know, not getting much out  of that TP.  So he sounds like he's 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably is.  AD is actually really strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is a guy who's actually  playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just going to continue  farming at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And people are watching this  because they're learning about  League of Legends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Like he's saying he's also  saying game specific like AD is  an AD carry which is a specific  type.  He's farming so he's trying to  get the minions to get more  gold so he can level up his  character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why would you do this chat  instead of just play the game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lots of people who are watching  this can't afford the same type  of perks he has.  So you're watching a high level  player.  Right.  And also he's very skilled.  And I mean, that's why you  watch sports.  Like why wouldn't you just go  out and play sports?  So League of Legends may not be

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a good example.  That is very true.  It's hard to parse everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  into Twitch into one stream and  on top of that one 30 second  stream.  Right.  I mean.  Let's watch Rabbit Bong play.  Rabbit Bong.  Hooray.  So she's playing.  She's cute.  Sure.  Does that help?  Yes.  She also has a face cam which is  known to.  That draws more people.  Draw a lot more people.  There's a chat room here by the  way on the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.  She's streaming that.  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a bleed.  And she's wearing a low cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have experience too.  Jumper.  You're level 14.  You're right, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm too old too.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You've also gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like into the deep end and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you're expecting to watch 30  seconds worth and understand  what's going on.  I'm flat on it.  I'm not expecting to watch 30  seconds worth and understand the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  whole community.  I mean it's not going to happen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's like the argument about

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Christianity.  I am in too deep.  Well I'm just looking for  something.  Let's look at some of the most  popular channels.  Here's.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I'm the weird one here.  I'm not criticizing.  I know.  You want to know.  You want to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't get it.  Minecraft might be more  appropriate, right, Chad?  Because that's.  That's.  Do you see more humor in  Minecraft?  There can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But also streams are more.  I mean humor is very good.  You know that's always going to  happen.  Right.  But streams you have so much  time to fill.  That's a lot of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dead time.  Yes.  And some of the viewership of  this is just on in the  background or are people  actually like watching it glued

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to it.  Most of it's in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Reddit says the funniest  Twitch user is Wishand.  W-S-H-A-N-D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You ever hear of him, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's going to be live right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  But can't you watch.  Yeah, you can.  It doesn't have to be  streaming.  Let's search for Wishand.  Wishand.  Wishand dice.  No sleep is always good for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  some late night laughs says  Reddit.  Yeah.  OK.  Well we got.  L-I-R-I-K.  OK.  Well you haven't made me laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now there.  OK.  But there is a guy.  Get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Be entertaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is a guy on Twitch who  streams the Oregon Trail.  Now that's got to be.  Nobody's trying to get better  at the Oregon Trail unless he's  in fourth grade.  One of my favorites is man

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  versus game.  I like that.  Who plays.  He's like going through  basically like every game from  his childhood from basically  any time and he has to beat it  and then he moves on to the  next game.  Yeah.  And.  I like that idea.  Another one of my favorites is  Sevadis who does Minecraft stuff.  The thing is is that like you  were mentioning people and I'm  just like I don't know.  You don't know these people.  Because I know the people that  I like.  You know the YouTube people.  Or do you watch Twitch?  I watch Twitch.  I stream on Twitch once a week.  This guy.  You do.  What do you stream?  Minecraft?  Yeah.  Minecraft.  I've been doing the Sims 3 a  lot.  Yeah.  Modded Minecraft is normally  what I do.  And yeah.  From 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a three hour stream.  So you're playing it anyway.  You're streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure.  Well, yeah.  I mean there's definitely a very  different atmosphere when you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  streaming.  Here's Monotone Tim playing  Rollercoaster 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You probably just click into  this highlight.  Yeah.  So he'll have 15 minutes or so  of prep time so that people can  tell he's live and then they'll  join the chat room.  So he's probably playing  something.  No this is the video.  This is the video.  Yeah.  VOD.  It's a video on demand of what  happened in the past.  So you'll probably want to skip  ahead.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's because it's saying hold

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There.  Here we go.  Even, you know, elementary  school teachers and whatnot.  Nope.  They had to know.  Like no.  I am the world's most gifted

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  fourth grader.  Yeah.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not a Twitch.  This is terrible.  This is like old people try to  understand this newfangled  gaming streaming thing.  It is.  I feel terrible for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I just want to say this.  It's making me feel old and out  of it.  I'm not making fun of people  doing it.  I just feel like I'm old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  One more.  This is from Go Marie in our  chat room.  He says this video, if you  watch this, this is why Twitch  is worth $1 billion.  Day 7.  Day 7.  Fish versus fish in  Street Fighter.  Oh, but first an ad about  something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels like watching the  director's commentary of a  movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not even that good because it's  not a movie you know or a  director you care about.  So it's not that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a random viewer's  commentary on a movie.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The way you're setting it up  though is basically setting up  to fail.  I mean, you don't go in and  expecting to watch the movie.  You're setting it up to fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know.  30 seconds worth of it.  I'll take half a billion for  Twitch and I think it's twice  as valuable.  All right.  Here we go.  Fish versus fish.  Playing Street Fighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know Twitch plays Pokemon.  Oh.  So these are actual fish.  Those are fish playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Shoot.  This is pretty funny.  So these are, this is a fish  tank in the upper left-hand  corner and on the fish tank  they have created a grid for  the different moves forward,  backwards.  And then strikes.  And so basically what you're  seeing on the right is the  actual Street Fighters fighting  according to random fish  swimming around.  And of course not much is  happening because the fish  aren't really very aggressive.  Oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh.  He actually won.  You win.  But how long can you watch this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's funny for.  No, it's good.  I got it.  It's funny.  That's good.  And I'm done because I don't  think it's going to be any  different for the next four  hours.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to do a video of Gamer

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kids watching Twig.  Yeah.  They would really, what are

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  they talking about?  Oh, they're so stupid.  Then what?  Then what happens?  When are they going to be  funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they going to be a joke?  Are they going to be a  entertainment?  I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just messing around.  I've wasted 37 years of my life  trying to learn how to do  broadcasting.  And these kids, these kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  today.  They don't know professionals  when they see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, there you go.  I think it makes sense if  Amazon could add, I mean they  can monetize it.  It's just a strange business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what's interesting in  the story is that it's kind of  the coincidence of story  sitting.  But I've long felt that the  real fight here is not Google  versus Facebook or Google  versus Microsoft.  It's Google versus Amazon.  Yeah.  And we see that.  That's interesting.  Wow.  And so we see this week, so  fine, so Google lost, Amazon  got it.  We certainly have seen that  happen with other companies  where they say, oh, ha, ha,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  ha, gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fine.  We also see Amazon losing  Amazon entering the ad business  and trying to get more serious  about that, which may, you're  right, Leo, indicate something  about this.  It's all about the ads.  It is.  Content and ads.  An audience and ads.  And then Google bought Zink a  pretty high end, a very high end  special effects in the cloud  company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that makes sense.  They need to buy more of this  stuff for Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  And they're going to move, well  not just Chromebooks, too.  It's also their movie.  It's now served on the Amazon  cloud.  Oh.  Not on, yeah.  I'm just going to get a broom.  We got a big broom and move it  over there.  It's because I moved over so I  didn't get the sunlight coming  but never mind.  It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Zinks, if stuff has been used  in Looper and Star Trek into

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  darkness.  Yeah.  And so imagine if you could take  that kind of functionality and  bring it down to cloud-based  stuff for you or me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's pretty powerful.  It ran on Amazon web services  that obviously will be running on  Google services.  So it could just merely be that  Google wants a proof of concept.  See, you can do this on our  cloud but I bet you it has to  do with Chromebooks and the  ability to do more with Chrome  OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the more they move high end  activities to the cloud.  Well, that's one of the main  reasons you buy a computer is to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  edit video.  Can't do that on a Chromebook.  Or can you?  Can you?  Wouldn't that be something?  All right.  Your turn, Gina.  What story do you like on all  this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cyanogen joining up with Google,  Amazon and HTC folks to build  something unnamed from mobile.  I probably should have put it on  the rundown because they don't  know anything.  They're building something really  cool.  But we don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  We can talk.  We can do the diaspora story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  That's interesting.  That's kind of, yeah.  Well, diaspora is, oh, so just a  little recap.  That was the first Kickstarter  project I ever donated to.  They were formed a few years  ago.  It was a bunch of college kids  who said we can do a better  Facebook and it will be, and  this is the key, distributed.  Yeah, it's going to be a  federated system where everybody  can run a node.  Anybody who wants to can run a  node and they're all federated  together.  They did in fact do it, I guess.  I mean, that's surprise number  one.  I thought it was long gone.  But apparently it does exist and  is being used by terrorists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, this goes back to our  conversation we had last week  where Twitter was removing links  to the ISIS video, the beheading  video because they have that  sort of centralized control, but  they're not going to join  diaspora because it's a federated  network.  ISIS said, okay, well, we're just  going to distribute this video  here.  And there isn't one central  controlling body that can remove  all the links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, if you go to join  diaspora, the first thing they  say is you can't join here.  You have to find a pod or set up  your own pod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, a pod.  Not a node, right, a pod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if you have a pod or you  join another pod, then they will  federate.  And these are all the diaspora  hosted pods.  There's actually pretty goodly  lists.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there was this great  conversation on Twitter, and I  wish I could find it, but it was  between like Dave Moran and Chris  Messina and a few other people  talking about like the dream of  the federated network and the  federated protocol, you know, and  how email is really the only  federated network that we have.  What is federated?  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Meaning that there's no central,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, one body that owns it  and controls it, right?  That like, so with email,  everybody sets up their own  separate email system.  So you can have an email server  or maybe someone provides it for  you like Google or Microsoft or  Yahoo or whatever, but they can  all talk to one another.  We all receive messages basically  the same way using a standard  protocol, and it's not controlled.  You know, once an email is sent,  it's not like, you know, any one  person can delete the email from  everywhere.  It's just, it's a network of  nodes that send messages to and  from one another.  They can all understand one  another.  And it works, right?  Unlike Twitter or Facebook where  you can just send a message to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  one person, one company, and  whatever.  This was Evan Prodromo's goal  with StatusNet.  Yes.  In fact, we ran a StatusNet  server.  It was a Twitter, a federated  Twitter.  We ran the Twitt Army for a  while.  And you could post something on  Twitt Army that would then go  to Status.net and other places  and...  Yep.  So I think it's a great idea  because it's decentralized.  Anyway, the problem with  Diaspora is it's open source so  it's not going to be the bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  guys, whoever that might be.  Right.  I mean, that's a feature or a  bug, depending on how you look

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  at it.  It's like saying, hey, Linus  Torvalds, there's terrorists  using Linux.  You've got to stop them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't stop it.  Right.  Nothing you can do about it.  But it goes back to the  discussion we had last week is  it does openness necessarily  breed bad behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  Right.  Some of it will be bad, some of  it will be good.  Humans are humans.  Until we perfect humanity, we're  not going to be able to say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But in other systems in society  we manage to deal with norms.  So I don't go on the street and  start yelling at somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's what makes somebody  a terrorist is they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But terrorists couldn't disrupt  normal everyday life.  That's what they do.  Real life, the way they can  online.  Yeah, they do.  That's their whole point.  I'm not agreeing with what I'm  saying, but I'm trying to say is  there a step change here that  says that it's absolutely  uncontrollable or will we  develop norms and mechanisms to  affect bad behavior more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but norms only work to the  point that somebody's willing to  obey them.  And people who like terrorists  who have a strong mission to  the point they're willing to  violate norms, norms aren't going  to protect against terrorists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I go on the streets of New  York and I start screaming and I  would never do this, for sake of  example, a racist word, I would  get shouted down, stared down,  attacked, accused.  People would stand up for right  behavior against me for doing  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless you were holding a gun  and you did it.  True.  Then norms wouldn't help.  Then you would have to have the  police come and get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fine.  So come down from a level of  terrorists.  I wasn't saying that openness  breeds terrorism.  I said it breeds bad behavior.  So and I'm asking the question.  I'm not answering the question.  I'm asking the question whether  that is a necessary condition.  Because on the street, we have  the open street and I have free  speech in this country.  I can say anything I want, but if  I went out there spewing this and  as long as I didn't need my meds  and I was just a hateful person,  people would yell at me and  scream at me.  Well, they do that on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  too, but it doesn't stop you.  It doesn't stop you.  I mean, they...  If you're a troll or a bad person  in comments or whatever, people  will yell back at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because what we said, no.  What we say is don't feed the  troll, ignore the troll, block  the troll, let the troll keep on  doing whatever the troll wants to  do.  So what would the metaphor and  times square be?  We would all just walk around  this person screaming the horrid  word.  I don't think that's what  happened in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's what actually  happens.  No, not in New York.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  I was walking across 44th Street  today, some bozo is all unhappy,  he can't turn right.  Light turns, he still tries to  come to the intersection.  I stand right in front of his  ass.  I pointed him, I pointed at the  traffic light like a whole New  Yorker that I am and say, tough  because he was violating the law.  By God, I stood up for that and  he was getting in the way of...  You're lucky to get run over.  Well, that's true, Jeff.  But, you know, I had my norm  moment right there.  I think the world is the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and the open, closed, whatever,  if you have gathering places for  people, whether virtual or real,  you're going to have bad  behavior.  The problem is that the norms  have to be backed up by more  than just goodwill because  goodwill isn't going to stop  somebody who is actively  negative, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, you can have criminals  in either case.  Yeah.  What I'm trying to ask is...  Kind of that middle ground guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  who is not a criminal but just  wants to act out.  Bad behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it breed bad behavior?  So let's do...  Okay, so people walk around in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  New York City naked.  Nobody stops them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or just insulting people out of  nowhere.  There's lots of people who do  that, right?  No, you're a fat.  You're really...  Yeah, you're really ugly.  You're fat, right?  That wouldn't happen unless  there were meds needed in New  York City.  But it happens all over, all  the time.  And there isn't that much  shunning.  Because there's no friction.  Yeah, you're right.  And our response...  Right, there's no friction.  Our response is...  There's no consequences.  There's no consequences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, because you can't enforce  the friction.  It's a big difference if you  say to me I'm fat on Times  Square and I yell back at you,  I'm right there.  It doesn't matter if I yell at  you on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So ergo does openness  digitally mean that we are  stuck with bad behavior?  We're stuck with one of two  extremes.  Either you're open and you have  bad behavior or you're  controlled, whether it's by  Facebook's control or Mike  Elgin's control on Google Plus.  And that's the only way you're  going to have good behavior.  Is that what we're stuck with?  I hope not.  I pray not.  Because I like openness.  I don't know.  I feel like the world is filled

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  with bad behavior, Jeff.  I mean, you're not going to  be able to do that all the time.  And if you wish you can watch  television news every night and  get your stress level elevated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because that's because  television news over amplifies  isolated situations.  So does Twitter.  I'm not so sure it's over  amplified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's amplifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, it is.  Any broadcast medium is an  amplifier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay, that's fine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you're saying this is  why we can't have nice things.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is the title of a book  coming out, right?  I think.  Yeah, it just came out.  Yeah.  Which I think is pretty much the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  same premise.  And I think we can have nice  things.  People are people.  They're going to be assholes.  They always will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We deal with it better in real  life.  And so my question is will we  come up with ways to deal with  it better digitally or is that  impossible?  Is that a logical possibility?  No, I'm sure we will.  But there's no way we can

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  eliminate it.  There will be bad behavior.  It's the distancing.  It's the separation.  It's the distancing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the lack of face-to-face.  My wife is at her scariest when  we're in the car.  That's right.  When she gets upset.  That's right.  Road rage.  Things come out of her mouth.  I had never.  That's right.  She scares me.  At 17 years we've been married.  She scares me just in the car.  And she'll say it.  This is the place where I'm a  complete fahol.  Because it's safe for her.  Because it's safe for her.  And no one ever hears what she's  saying.  The windows are up.  I mean, I say to her, why don't  you, you know, when we're sitting  next to the other car, why don't  you roll down your car and say  that to them?  No, I just got to get this out.  And it's like that on Twitter and  online.  There's no consequence.  Yeah, but you know, there may be

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  people, in fact, I guess there  probably are, who think one of us  might be a horrible person online  and would like to shut us down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  So, I mean, I think that's

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I just saw it two seconds  ago.  Somebody did a ridiculous screed  against me.  I'm not going to give them the  attention.  And I don't know where somebody  in the organization I respect, I  think has brains, just somebody  who says, oh, boy, isn't that  fun?  Who knows better?  It's stupid.  But that's the kind of, our norm  right now is to incur, not just  to not create fiction, it's to  grease the skids.  Right.  Fight, fight, fight.  Yeah, exactly.  So why does digital, I mean,  what I'm hoping is, I hope the  answer is, it was the same with  the telegraph, damn it, people  had sex fantasies with dots and  dashes.  And then we figured it out and  got used to it and figured out  our norms.  And same with cameras and same  with everything else.  My hope is it will be the same  with online.  I believe it will be.  What I'm reaching for is  assurance that there's a path  to stability even with openness.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you know, there's always going  to be people who call in the  swathes.  You know, swath squad on  somebody, right?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It's not going to go away.  We'll never have complete harmony.  We'll never have complete  firmness of life.  That's the nature of life.  I want it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Life is full of irritants.  If you don't want that, you  should get a vat for yourself and  a feed tube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I often think about  this from the tech perspective  of, you know, if email is the one  true open social network, anybody  can send me a message if they  have my email address, however,  and they can say whatever they  want, however they want.  But I have an email client that  helps me control that experience.  I have spam filters and other  filters that I've set up and  other whatever scanning.  But still stuff gets through.  Still stuff gets through, sure.  But I, and that was the point  that I was going to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And no norms are protecting you.  That's just open.  Well, but the whole lot is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  really good point, Gina, because  I hardly ever get the kinds of  insults in email that I do get on  Twitter.  Okay, now there's an obvious  reason for that.  Because on Twitter, I'm showing  off for people.  Twitter's public.  But I got an email just last week  after the show last week, somebody  saying to me in the first line of  the email, I think you're a dick.  And I did the email back and I  said, why would you think that I  would read past that?  And I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, see, why do you even  respond?  I said save your keystrokes and  bile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my response to that is to  delete key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what you're saying.  Yeah, but that's, then you  created no friction to bad  behavior.  Yeah, but I don't know.  Well, then how do we ever get  good behavior if you don't create  friction to bad behavior?  I can pretty much guarantee you  that responding to the guy does

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  not help the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've had cases where I've called  people on their behavior and  they apologize.  Yeah, I've said that too.  Because what I'm trying to do,  I'm trying to argue is, listen,  if the person is a true dick,  then there's no curing them.  If they need their meds, that's  what their doctors do.  But if what I'm saying is, if  otherwise nice and intelligent  people are acting like dicks  online and are encouraged to do  so and there's no friction  against that, in fact, there's  greasing of their behavior in  that case.  Right, there's a positive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  feedback loop.  There's actually a positive  feedback loop, right?  We do get rewarded, especially  in the performative sort of  sphere where snark and quips and  criticism actually kind of gets  you more attention or adequate  people are.  I guess it's true that the nature

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  of Twitter promotes that kind of  thing.  That's probably true.  And all I'm trying to ask is, is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that necessary?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is that the end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there no hope other than  Twitter deciding that it has to  improve things before it brands  and it starts killing stuff,  which I'm not arguing for.  We've all called for Twitter to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  have better tools.  Yeah.  Not just tools to mute, but tools  to block, ban.  Right, which is Gina's suggestion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for this is trying to create a  level of friction.  Right.  Or put it a different way.  Gina's trying to suggest a way to  disconnect the circuit of the  feedback loop or some people if  they get less attention, if they  know they get less attention,  maybe they'll do it less.  In the real world, I will

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  confront some people.  In the digital world, I will  confront somebody.  But in the digital world, I will  not.  I just delete it.  It's easy enough to delete it.  I don't have a lot of evidence  that there's anything to do.  By the way, I don't always do  that.  That's my policy.  I often get, you know, steam  comes in my ears and I respond.  It's almost always a mistake.  Oh, yeah.  So I know what the, for me, I'm  not saying for anybody else, but  for me the right thing to do is  hit the delete key or the block

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  key.  And I'm like, as a society, we're  building a society online and as  a result of that, are we building  a better society?  And I wish we would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like it.  Yeah.  You're right.  But meanwhile, diaspora, there's  nothing you can do.  If terrorists want to use it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're stuck.  Well, in their case, they're  going to the proprietors and  notifying them and asking them  to take it down because there is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a diaspora brand.  So what you could do is just  start your own pod, the ISIS pod.  It could well.  And run a server.  And then, you know, you could  try to shut people down.  But that's part of the problem,  by the way, is it's whack-a-mole.  It's very hard on the Internet to  shut down speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  And ISIS is the ultimate troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, talk about troll.  Yeah.  Because there is no civility  there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the point.  Right.  So societal norms are not an  issue there.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that rests out on the, we  can't rule everything by the edge  case.  That's the problem with techno  panic.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's lots of middle ground  where you could have some effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So I guess my use case here is  people who would never do this  otherwise, who are decent, smart,  civilized people, who either say  something snarky or to me just as  bad, well, I don't do that myself,  but they yell fight, fight, and  they encourage and think it's  funny.  So they don't think of the  feelings or impact on another  human being.  How do we appeal to that human  nature of those people?  Just channel the Dalai Lama,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  whatever he would do.  What about that?  I mean, really, seriously, instead  of yelling back at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're asking how to encourage  thoughtfulness given a tool  that's built to be instantaneous  off the cuff the first thing they  think about.  That's what's so interesting.  It's like a pain to mind.  Right.  I mean, there's a conflict  between building a super usable  easy product, especially with  Twitter, 140 characters directly  from SMS, whatever, and asking  smart people to think before  they react to something.  It's tough.  I mean, part of what we're doing  at ThinkUp is trying to get  people to think about the results  of the experiment.  It's a tough problem.  I mean, mindfulness and  thoughtfulness isn't really an  easy sell, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you're doing it in such a  gentle, nice way.  I didn't even think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're actually in a positive  feedback loop.  But we're sitting next to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  somebody who's really doing,  who's actually doing something  about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, I mean, I hope so.  If we can make it a fun enough  consumer, what we're trying to  do is sort of package the  broccoli in a Snickers bar.  I don't know how you want to  put that, but I want to make it  kind of a fun, delightful  experience, but the core of it  is to think about what's going  on here and what you're, you  know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that really what the purpose  of ThinkUp was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Making your time online more  meaningful.  We all spend this time online.  We all spend our attention in  certain ways, right?  And are they making our lives  better?  Are they making other people's  lives better?  Are we using these platforms the  best way that we can?  And it's absolutely from the  very beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what are the insights?  Give us kind of the story behind  on some of the insights that  you offer and how you think that  that is a...  I know it is, but I want to hear  your rationale, your logical  steps on when you chose what  insights to create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we can look at my ThinkUp  if you want.  I got it up here.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  I mean, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you look at mine, I would say  how often I use the upward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But so you reward me for certain  tweets.  You say this was...  This got a lot of retweets and  favorites.  That means it's good.  I want to do more of that  behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we definitely...  So first, this is extremely  difficult to quantify.  Yes.  It's extremely difficult to  quantify thoughtfulness and  meaningfulness, right?  Because that's such a subjective  thing.  But yeah, part of what we do with  ThinkUp is let you know how are  people reacting to this?  Are they liking it?  Are they amplifying it?  Are they replying to it?  Where were you a year ago?  So even when it's a bad...  Even when it doesn't mean bad,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you're saying, hey, Jarvis,  a lot of people retweeted that.  Are you sure you like that?  Yeah, yeah.  And that's part of the challenge,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right?  Because if you mentioned...  Oh, dear.  You know, you got me...  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in that case, you retweeted  someone and you got their message  out to a bunch more people  because you've got a bigger  audience than that person you  retweeted.  Thanks a friggin' lot, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no.  You see what happened there.  Yeah.  He followed me.  I don't have any control over  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't even look.  I saw it go by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  He followed me.  What can I do?  I'm lovable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So it says that I replied to  Henry Blodgett 10 times last  week saying that we had a real  conversation, and that's a good  thing.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And again, this is a really hard  problem and just even kind of  wording our headlines and  commentary about whatever  happened.  The point is to sort of bring a  kind of thoughtfulness to it.  What do people react to?  You know, who's following you,  that kind of thing.  Because I've...  For the last week, I've...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, as I said last week  and last week, I wasn't going  off Twitter, but I've really  tried to pull back, and I've  been doing the Dr. Strangelove  thing on certain conversations.  I might have a smart-ass line,  I might have something to say,  and I just say, nope, I can't do  it.  You know, I got a lot of replies  to what I said.  As a laptop user, as a laptop  using 6'4-inch freaking flyer, I  sit in trap solidarity with  victims of seatback recliners.  So you know what I have to say  about that topic, and it caused  discussion.  The discussion, there were a few  trollish comments, but most all  it was an honest interchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, that's one way to  foster the kind of behavior you  want online is to reward the  good behavior.  Not merely to punish the bad  behavior, but have a wonderful  conversation.  And people look at that and go,  oh, look, if you don't just snark  at them, you can actually have a  good conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Facebook gets crap for trying  to have a pleasant environment.  They might do it clumsily, they  might do it badly, but it is  truly a social environment, a  Thanksgiving table.  That's what they're trying to be.  That's why the Pew study was off,  I think.  And you can say it's too  controlled, mom never lets us  really talk, she always gets mad  if we start to argue about  anything, we can't talk politics  at home, it's no fun here.  You can say all that stuff and  it can be perfectly legitimate  complaint against Facebook.  But that's what Facebook is.  It's not an open platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This tweet got 22 replies.  Wow.  This is a big Casper mattress,  900 bucks, Packers blanket, 50  bucks, Fort made from Casper  matrix box, priceless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a great one.  That made me really happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Credit to that to Lisa, that's  her joke, but that's her son in  the Casper box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love Ozzie's huge looks.  He's going, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a good conversation.  This show is full of them and  I'm full of it.  So thank you.  Let's take a break.  We're going to get to your picks.  What do you think of tent, by  the way?  Is there anything interesting  there?  Have you seen that, Gina?  No, what's tent?  Tent.io.  This is more of the, I think  this is more of the stuff Kevin  Marks was talking about, which  is getting your data localized.  And this is kind of what you  were talking about, federating  communication, a protocol for  personal data and communications  so you could federate your  social media, federate your  blog post, things like that.  I think there's, you know,  there may be a technological  solution we could find somewhere  out there.  Yeah, but the user experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is, can you run Mongo  DB on your PHP 5.4 Apache stack?  Just get up on EC2 instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No sense.  And then just open a few modules  and then just update a bit, and  then you're good to go.  Just SSH into the server and  start it up and you'll be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wish the world were full of  people who knew how to do that.  That would be a good world.  It'd be a different world.  Well, it'd be different.  But I like those people.  That's how I got into this, you  know, is that I really, I just  like geeks and I feel  comfortable with geeks and I  want to talk about SSH and  LAMP stacks.  What else I want to talk about  this?  Look at this.  Look at this little box.  This little box could change  your world.  This can mean that your printer,  no matter what, even a USB  printer that's not on the  network, suddenly is not only a  network printer but a Google  Cloud Print compatible network  printer.  You could print to your, you  know, five-year-old USB printer  that never even heard the word,  you know, Wi-Fi from any  Android phone, tablet, Chrome  Book, a Kindle Fire.  This is the Lantronics.  This is the Lantronics Xprint  server.  And what it does, it will take  any printer, almost any printer,  about 4,000 top-brand printers  and turn it into a network  printer that is compatible with  Google for Cloud Print and  Android printing.  It's very easy, too.  There's no software to install  anywhere.  There's no upgrade.  You just take it out of the box,  plug it in, and you're printing.  There is a web interface if you  want to do advanced  configuration, but I can almost  promise you, you won't need to.  One Xprint server can support  multiple printers and virtually  unlimited Android devices.  It's $149.95.  They also make an AirPrint  version, but this is the Cloud  Print version.  And it supports up to 10 network  printers and eight USB printers  all at the same time.  It's got one USB port, but you  just could put a hub on there  and you can just plug eight  printers into it.  You want to know more?  Xprintserver.com slash twit.  And if you use the offer code  twit, you'll get free shipping  on your order.  The folks at Lantronics have been  selling a lot of these because  it's such a great idea.  And if you compare it with other  print servers, it's a very  affordable price.  And the idea that it gives you  Google Cloud Print, I don't know  if you've ever used Google Cloud  Print, but it means I can print  to my printer at home anywhere I  am if I can get online.  It is awesome.  Xprintserver.com slash twit.  And the offer code is twit from  Lantronics, the Xprint server.  Really cool stuff.  Let me add something to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me add something to that,  if I may, because I have my cloud  life and I use Google Cloud  Print and I bought a new printer  because I wanted other  functionality like scanning to my  Google Docs.  3640x and 3640.  But it goes to sleep.  And so even for a certified  Google Cloud Print printer, I  need the Lantronics because it  will wake it up when I'm off  somewhere a week not printing.  Oh, that's interesting.  Even with the Cloud Printer, it  is helpful.  Lantronics is helpful because it  is always awake for me on my  network at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's awesome.  And having a network printer is  so nice because it means you  don't have to put it next to the  computer.  You can put it in a closet or  somewhere.  Right.  Yeah.  Before we get to the tip, tool  and pick of the week, did you  see this recode is now saying  we're going to do native  advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My tweet was et tu, recode.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does this mean that they're  struggling or does it just what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  does it mean?  No, it probably means that  advertisers are saying why don't  you play along?  Why don't you do this too?  God, you know, of course  advertisers are saying this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  From the day we started doing, I  started doing whatever I do,  people have come along and said  hey, would you mind if we did a  show about our product?  And I've always said no.  What are you, crazy?  We do ads.  You want to buy an ad, you can  buy an ad.  But I'm not going to do content  that looks like it's editorial  but it's advertisements,  advertorial.  That's what they used to call  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure that the two of them  will make sure it's labeled well  and all that.  It is.  Here's the large, I don't know  if we talked about this, I guess  we talked about big world issues  last week but Ethan Zuckerman,  who's a brilliant guy at MIT  Media Lab and one of the  founders of, oh crap, old  company, I'm sorry, home page  maker company.  It will occur to me in a minute.  Next site?  No, no, no, you are earlier than  that.  Oh, tripod.  Tripod, thank you very much.  Who needs memory when you have  Google and Leo?  And a chat room.  So Ethan wrote a piece in the  Atlantic two weeks ago, I think  it was, saying that accepting  advertising on the web was the  web's original sin.  And usually it's said that the  original sin of the web was  giving away content for free.  So here was a sin matching a sin.  And I disagreed with Ethan  respectfully because he's  brilliant and it's a really smart  piece and I wrote a blog post in  response.  But here's the nub of my view of  this is we haven't begun to  innovate with advertising at all.  The only innovations we've seen  so far are basically computerizing  the processes we already have of  buying mass advertising message  opportunities and creating  pop-ups, which by the way, Ethan  is responsible for the web  pop-up.  Oh yeah, he wrote that article.  Yeah.  And he's sorry.  And so it's going to sound odd  coming from a journalism prof,  but we need to innovate in  advertising.  We need to find truly new ways  for companies to market and hope  that by the way media is part of  that new method.  And advertising agencies aren't  going to do it because they sell  the old stuff and advertisers  aren't going to do it.  And media companies haven't been  doing it.  But we have to rethink  advertising because if it does  not work and if it collapses and  dies, then media goes with it and  we need its support.  So I was sad.  That's why I was sad to see  Recode jump on the bandwagon.  And I'm not blaming them for it.  I bet the advertisers forced them  to and said we've got an RFP here  and we want you to run these  things.  And they probably had a staff  meeting and said let's figure  out how to do it as best we can.  But it's an old advertorial  stupid let's fool the reader  model and we've got to go move  the brand.  And where are the innovators in  advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't see them yet.  So here's what Recode does.  Normally there's a black banner  on the content but sponsor content  will have a blue banner that says  sponsor content.  And what Walt Mossberg says in his  article about this is hey, don't  ignore those.  Those are going to be great  articles full of good material.  It's just written by a sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just not one of our

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  journalists.  Yeah.  And they're also saying we're not  going to try to trick you.  We're going to make it very clear  that it's sponsored content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to have our

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  journalists write them which  some places.  Both things are very important.  But your point about Forbes and  you never know whether you're  going to reshare a link that you  see from Forbes on Twitter  because you never know if it's  real journalism or sponsored  content.  That's going to be true on  Recode unless they've got some  way of indicating on Twitter.  And so it devalues their links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a link if you link to  something on Twitter and you say  I saw this on Forbes, Twitter is  going to truncate.  Even if you put a clue in the  URL as the New York Times does,  it says paidpost.nwhitem.com.  Well, I guess truncated.  It's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  If I ever...  I will shut this place down if we  ever have...  Can't survive without doing that.  That's not ever going to happen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Gina Trapani, you must have a tip  for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  This was for fellow Chromecast  lovers such as myself.  I still have been living in New  York eight months now.  I still haven't unpacked any  other.  There's just the Chromecast  plugged into my TV at this  point.  I'm just too lazy or something.  Two new apps on Android and IOS  added Chromecast support.  Watch ABC, which surprised me.  I mean, does the official ABC  app really want you to watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They do now.  They didn't use to.  They used to not like...  They used to go out of their way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to block it.  Yeah.  So when Google TV came out and  was like, hey, watch your web  browser on TV.  They...  Like the abc.com would detect  are you on Google TV and block  the content.  It would say not supporting  your device.  Well, now we've seen them come  total 180.  Now you can cast bachelors in  paradise right directly to your  Chromecast.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not going to let you skim  by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, we find out about your TV  tastes every week and it becomes  shocking.  She's kind of...  We don't get deeper into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am proud of my diversity.  Kardashians, MMA, B,  Bachelor.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Listen.  What is your worst, worst TV  confession?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the Bachelor, the  Bachelor franchise is definitely  the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or the day she watched all of the  Kardashian.  Yes.  The Kardashians I'll actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  defend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She binge watched the  Kardashians.  That's as bad as...  Watching five minutes is bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We found out when Steve Ballman  left Microsoft he binge watched  100 episodes of The Good Wife in  two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Good Wife is a great show.  I know but two weeks?  100 episodes?  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  I don't feel so bad about playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Diablo for nine hours last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen, once the baby goes to  sleep I get to do whatever I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if it's the Bachelor in  Paradise, that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You earned it, baby.  What is your...  Is this something you watch with  your wife?  Not to bring her into this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  scenario.  She's so hard.  She gives me so hard.  Interesting.  Oh, yes.  She can't even...  I have to sort of do it around  her schedule.  Right now there's very little TV  on.  She and I are watching Orphan  Black together.  But when I get the TV alone or  the tablet or the phone...  You're sneaking it, aren't you?  Yeah, I'm sneaking the  Kardashians with that.  She actually questions being in  my presence during that though.  Wow.  She's not very judgy but she  is.  In this case she makes an

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  exception.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's justified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's justified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So thank you.  What was the tip?  I forgot.  Oh, Chromecast.  You said another one.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NPR 1.  Oh, I love NPR 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Much better suited to public

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  intellectuals.  NPR 1 also now has Chromecast  support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the Bachelor or NPR?  What's your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Bachelor or NPR?  It's the whole spectrum, guys.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think one of the most  important moments in the history  of TV's Switch to Digital was  when ABC, it was ABC again,  decided to stream Vette  Desperate Housewives the  morning after.  And that was saying to every  single affiliate, ah, the heck  with you, every band firm's  stuff.  Yeah.  And we got to go with this new  thing.  Sorry, I know we're screwing you  but...  Yeah.  And so TV networks are highly  pragmatic and that's why I think  that's really interesting to  point that out, Gina, that ABC  wasn't playing along before and  the fact that they are now says  a lot about over the top.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, let me just say the  experience isn't great.  You still have to sign in with  your cable provider.  Of course.  You still have to go through  the ads, which I'm actually  fine with the ads, but you know  it's not your Netflix or your  Hulu even, but it's something,  right?  So there you go.  It's baby steps.  Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff, do you have a number for...  Yeah, it was kind of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  quiet week, but the one I came  up with was that Google's mobile  search revenue last year was  $8 billion and you know the rest  of media all say that you can't  make any money on mobile, but  somehow Google does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  $8 billion compared to how much  they make on the rest of it.  I think it's like, what was it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $30 billion last year?  Okay, so it's like a third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a good chunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then they figured out how to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  make it work.  It has to be.  It has to.  I mean, otherwise, mobile is  where everybody's going.  Yeah.  Desktop advertising doesn't

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So both Facebook and Google  seem to have licked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  We have it in the media.  I still hear media companies  say, oh, what to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My tool is a tool you all know,  but it's dropped its price  considerably.  We thought it might when we  heard that Google was dropping  the cost of Google Drive and  Microsoft dropping the cost of  Microsoft OneDrive and Flickr  offering a terabyte of storage  for free.  Dropbox, which of course is  solely in the business of  storage, is now a terabyte for  its $10 a month.  It used to be 100 megabytes.  In fact, when I saw what  Google Drive was also a  comparable price, when I saw  they did that, I thought that  kills Dropbox.  Well, they're hanging in there.  But as Paul Therotte pointed  out today on Windows Weekly,  it's tough for Dropbox because  that's their business for  Google.  Google and Microsoft is just a  sideline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, you know, Leo, I was  thinking about this.  I wonder how many people hit,  what was it, 100 megs before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, nobody needs all that  storage.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure that there, you  know, what's the incremental  bit of those who did the upsell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not 100 megs, by the way.  100 gigs, I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, 100 gigs.  No, I said 100 megs too.  100 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how many people are they  losing who were doing the,  what's the opposite of an upsell,  an up buy?  Above the 100 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe people weren't moving  over because after all, Dropbox  is tied into things like to do  text and other apps on your  phone in ways that these other  solutions aren't.  But new buyers are going to be  less likely to go to Dropbox  when they've already got a  terabyte from Google Drive or  somebody like that.  I think the falling price of  hard drives is part of the  engine of this.  What's a hard drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely.  I wouldn't know myself.  Shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's because you have  hard drives in the sky.  Your stuff's still on hard  drives, Jeff.  I do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All kinds of hard drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you heard about Whiskey  Tango Foxtrot?  The book?  The book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just ordered it on Audible.  I can't wait.  Is it good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just listened to it on Audible  and the performance is great.  The book is, you're going to  love it.  I can't wait.  But one of the little just  sci-fi, it's not very sci-fi-ish  but one little sci-fi tricks is  that the computers in it are  organic.  Which really starts to make you  think of interesting ways that  we presume that there is these  hard elements making things.  And it's just kind of throw,  it's a throw away.  I'm not spoiling anything.  It's a techno thriller, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This looks amazing.  I'm reading the Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  listing here.  This sounds great.  It's very good.  And it's somewhat, even though

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's somewhat dystopian about  publicness and privacy and data  and all that kind of stuff, I  enjoy the hell out of it.  It's wonderfully written.  It's just word choices and  little turns of phrase that are  just delightful through the  body.  I can't wait.  I'm so excited.  You know, is what it is.  The characters are good and the  writing and the performance and  the audio book is excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the hero is named Leo, so I  got to like that.  There you go.  He's a, whatever it is.  He's a blacker hero.  An unhinged trustafarian.  What's a trustafarian?  Trust fund.  Oh, trustafarian.  I get it.  He's a flinty trustafarian.  He's a flinty trustafarian.  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot by David

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Schaeffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw the New York Times  article, a review, which said  it's probably the book of the  summer, so I immediately got it  on Audible and it's probably my  next Audible book.  And that was not an Audible ad  nor was it native advertising.  Somebody said, Leo, you're  probably the best book in the  world.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  Somebody said, Leo, you do  native advertising every time  you do an Audible ad because  you have book picks.  That's not, that's different.  That's an ad in which content  has been inserted, not content  in which an ad has been  inserted.  It's exactly the opposite of  native advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, in some fairness,  radio host red spots are in a  sense what native advertising  wants to be because they want  to be in the voice.  Right.  But a good radio pro like you  changes your voice.  Now it's time to talk about it.  Yeah, you know it's an ad.  And you're saying it outright  and you're giving every possible  signal that you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm trying not to make it, yeah.  But I do have to do the ads  because there's no one else to  do them for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and the only issue  is, is anyone confused?  No one.  If you sat down and quizzed  anyone who watches the show or  listens to the show, even  listens without the visual cues  that you have on the screen, I  don't think you would have anyone  who would be confused about  whether or not this is turned  into this week in Metricist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And one of the things we do is  we make sure that people like  Jeff and Gina, the co-hosts who  are on all of our shows are  never asked to read ads.  The ads are read by staff  and advertisers.  And I actually violate the rule

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  when I toss in and say something  about the Prince of Europe.  Well, I'm not going to stop  you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's not my rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I ain't going to stop you, but  we never would ever require you  or ask you to.  Furthermore, we often ask our  hosts whether they'd be okay  with that ad.  We actually, I say often because  I realize that we never asked  you if you have a problem with  Casper mattresses, but I don't  think you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're the one who has a  problem with sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do.  I did.  2.30 a.m.  You stay up, because you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  dreading going home to your  pillow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I have such an  uncomfortable buckwheat pillow  waiting for me.  No, I was using the buckwheat  pillow during my nine-hour  marathon.  I don't want to know what you  were doing with it.  No, I'm kind of with you.  In fact, when we first started  doing ads on this network, a lot  of people outside the U.S. who  were not used to that kind of  host-read ad were kind of upset  because hosts in, for instance,  the U.K. never read ads.  Also, because most of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stations there are government  run, and so they don't have ads  at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have it.  But in fact, frankly, I, but  it's because there was no one  else, I had to read the ad.  And none of our advertisers have  radio ads or TV ads.  So I just had to read the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would so not work on this  network to throw on a 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like it would be  more of an interruption than  what we do, even though it would  be quicker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can see it being an interruption.  Do you ever get requests to use  an advertiser's 30s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd be glad to if they asked me  to.  Yeah, well, it makes sense.  Nobody's ever asked because of  course they far prefer the  native advertising.  Yeah.  Now I'm feeling guilty.  I just want to be able to pay

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  the rent, eat dinner, and go

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  shopping.  I just want to live.  Play little video games.  Play video games.  Hey, it's $60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are expensive video games.  I've got to pay your Comcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  bill.  I just paid two, not one, but  two college tuitions.  Ooh.  That's fun.  I got that ready for next year  year.  That's fun.  That's going to go on for three  years.  I'm going to be able to pay the  rent, eat dinner, and go  shopping.  I'm going to be able to pay the

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  rent, eat dinner, and go  shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going to go on for three  more years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You thought it was going to be  syncopated, didn't you?  Yeah, it should have been  syncopated, but Abby took time  off and now I'm screwed.  They're actually now the same  year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're both softwares.  And the cost goes up, too.  That's the other good thing.  What?  I'm looking at the prices.  There was some school that Jake  looked at some time ago where,  and I forget which one it was,  but if you got accepted, they  froze the tuition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would have been cool.  Four years and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That school is now out of  business, ladies and gentlemen.  Jeff Jarvis is a professor at a

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  school that teaches people how

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to be good citizens.  The City University of New York.  His office is there on Times  Square, and we are really glad  to have him as part of the show,  the last public intellectual.  No, don't say that.  I make no such claim ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He writes books, ladies and  gentlemen.  Ever.  I'm not a book writer.  I'm a book writer.  I'm a book writer.  I'm the most famous gentleman  ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm the shmuckest schlub.  He blogs.  He meets with presidents, world  leaders.  He goes to the World Economic  Forum in Davos.  What more could you ask for?  Gina Trapani and I are public  geeks.  I'm proud to be a public geek.  You are a public geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're amazing, Leo.  You're on CIA.  I have to sit in front of my  webcam a couple hours a week,  but you're just out there all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the time.  You know what?  The best part about my job is I  get to talk with people like  you, and so it's not hard.  It's fun.  It's like sitting down.  I arranged my life so that I  would get to sit down and talk  to really great people about  really interesting stuff for  hours a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have a good chat.  Wow.  How did that happen?  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're pretty lucky.  Yeah, we are.  Gina Trapani is, of course, at  Think Up, and you must go and  get your free trial available  now at ThinkUp.com.  It's free.  It's free.  It's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes you a better tweeter.  Yeah.  A better Facebooker.  We're doing our job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does, sure.  I had no idea that that was  kind of the thinking, but  you're absolutely right.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get it fully now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I mean, it's the disconnect  between what analytics are and  what they should do, and we're  definitely struggling with it.  I mean, we're trying our best  and we're just at the beginning  stages, but yeah, that's the  idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But of course, it's a Neil  Dash and Gina Trapani.  Of course it's going to be like

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why didn't I see this?  I mean, I'm excited to go with  the world and improve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course they are.  Would you get a Neil on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  show sometime?  He would love, yes, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He tweeted about that this week  that people were saying, Neil,  you should be able to do more  shows, and he mentioned Twig and  how we'd like to disagree with  him, which I'm going to disagree  with you on that, Neil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We don't like to disagree with  you.  So stop that.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Chad, make a note.  Next week, let's see if we can  get a Neil on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I would love to have him  on.  You know, I never, I didn't  really push for it because,  you know, he's my business  partner and I didn't want to  have him on.  I've known Neil for ages, as I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  think most people in the  business have.  I met him first when he was  working for...  Six Apart.  Six Apart.  And I was a big, I used Vox,  their kind of consumer version,  but I also used the, in fact,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm ready.  I have one question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that?  You get home after 23 hours  straight of game playing.  What does Lisa say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She was fast asleep.  We haven't spoken since then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did she say today?  You got home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You did what?  I didn't get home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was at home.  I was in my office playing.  I was home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go upstairs.  The next day she says, where  were you?  No, she knows what I was doing.  Does she laugh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, she came in about 9 o'clock.  She said, about 9 o'clock she  said, so are you going to play  this all evening?  I said, yeah.  I said, do you want to watch  something we can watch?  She said, no, that's fine.  I just wanted to check in.  What did you do?  You watched, we have like 18  TVs.  It's not like.  No, no, but does she think

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  you're nuts?  Do you think I'm nuts?  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.  I think we'll love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's love.  She loves me and she knows.  And I don't do this all the  time.  I'm not like a hardcore gamer.  Once in a while, maybe like  once a year, once every two  years, there's a really good  game.  It turns out this game I played  all the way through on the PC.  But I really like it on the  console.  The last one was Bioshock  Infinite.  It's only once in a while.  Most games I know, I get them  and I don't like them that  much and I play a little like  Watch Dogs.  I thought it was going to be  great.  But every once in a while, I  don't know if it has to do with  my life situation or the game.  I think it's more the game.  I just get into a game and I  play it all the way to the end  and then that's done.  And my thumbs stop working.  And I'm done and I don't play  anymore until next time.  I should stream it on Twitch.  You should.  Oh, you'd be pleased.  That's what I thought you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to say you did.  I was just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's built into the Xbox One.  I could.  You should have.  Jesus, Leo.  Okay, I'll do that tonight.  I'll do that tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next time.  Oh, you still got some more in  yet?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm not done yet.  I just created Diablo.  Diablo just took over.  There's a big twist in this  game and the big twist just  happened.  And now I'm going to play.  And I'm going to try to be funny  while I'm playing.  Do voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watch.  Gina, I think we just unemployed  ourselves.  Yeah, I was going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I kick myself every moment  because we did this a little bit  when the last one I really liked.  Skyrim.  Skyrim came out.  I love Skyrim.  And we broadcast it live and it  was so much fun.  Brian Brush would inspire me  because he does the same thing.  And if I had just known this was  going to be the next big thing,  I would have fired you all and  just done that.  And hired a couple of gamers with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some personality.  Yeah.  What was I thinking?  We're good looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Talking about intellectual stuff.  Nobody wants that.  I think that was the most

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  oxymoronic thing you've ever  said, Gina.  That was a triple oxymoron.  Gamers with personalities were  good looking.  Oh, man.  Shots fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not good.  And he wonders why people are  mean to him on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I feel left out, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should be, I'm sad.  Actually, you know what happens  at 11 p.m. tonight?  Bioshock comes out, the original
