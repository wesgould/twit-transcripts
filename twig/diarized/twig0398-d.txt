Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a picture from his feed that you want to see of a Coke flight, capital C, from his  Facebook feed.  Is he poolside?  What I need to know is...  No, no, no.  He's at a Coke restaurant.  Oh, okay.  Look him up on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  We'll work on that, Jeff Jarvis.  I'm ruining your intros.  No, do...  I'm ruining your intros.  You never ruin intros, man.  It's great to do a show with you.  Well, maybe you do, but I don't consider it ruining.  I consider it just awesome that I'm doing another show with you.  Jeff Jarvis, buzzmachine.com, professor at the CUNY School of Journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know him.  I'm glad to be out with you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Thank you so much.  It's great to be back.  Also, Kevin Marks from KevinMarks.com.  It's great to be on with you again.  I think we did a show together right when Android N was launching last year.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  We did it with Nougat.  Well, yeah, it wasn't N anymore.  It was Nougat.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's great to...  And now it's on...  Oh, what percentage of fun is now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where is it now?  I mean, it's definitely single digits.  It's probably lower single digits is my guess.  Let's see here.  Android distribution numbers.  I'm guessing somewhere sub 5% is my pulling it out of thin air.  And Nougat is the grand total.  Oh, man.  Woohoo.  2.8% Nougat.  This is an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure those are in this house, so that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you all on Nougat?  I mean, I assume, Jeff, you have the pixel, right?  So you're on Nougat.  Yes, I'm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm always open.  I have a pixel now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you do.  So you are in Nougat house.  How do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very nice.  Well, I've still got the Nexus 6, which is also on Nougat.  And Rosie just got an Ultra LG Ultra.  Which is also a Nougat.  So we're well supplied with Nougat machines now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're part of the 2.8%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2.8%, we're in the...  With the anomaly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Man, that is rough.  I don't think this is ever going to be a problem that's going to be solved in the Android world.  It probably won't.  I mean, how do you solve this?  I don't think you do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they've sort of half solved it with sending updates by other means.  But yeah, it's kind of a shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  I mean, yeah.  I mean, because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.  We're two months away from M or something, aren't we?  Maybe there's an IO coming shortly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  So, oh, we got the information on the developer preview for O.  I'm assuming you guys talked all about that last week.  Actually, we did.  Oh, not M.  We're going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you guys dive into that last week?  Not really, no.  I have not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we didn't.  I haven't looked at it, actually.  What's new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's a number of things here.  Let me pull it up.  I just assume so.  Because I think Android O was announced last Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure it didn't come out until Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it Thursday?  See, full disclosure, I was out on vacation last week.  I was in Canada.  Ah.  So I had no mobile network.  Things are slower there.  They were for me.  Because without mobile connectivity, I was able to enjoy life without a phone for the  most part, except for the camera.  I got to tell you, it was really, really nice.  But I found out about Android O two days after it actually hit.  So I was kind of completely in the dark.  If you command, if we didn't talk about it, hey, it's here.  We're talking about it right now.  So just a little bit of insight into what to expect, at least with the developer preview.  There's going to be some improvements to notifications.  For the most part, there's notification groups.  So you can take all of your news notifications, for example, from different news apps that  you have installed, put them into their own channel.  I think they're calling it notification channels.  So that you can group them together and manage them as a group instead of individually, with  the whole idea being that you're kind of cleaning up your notifications so it's not filled with  a bunch of information.  You kind of collapse it down into kind of categories that you determine.  That could be handy, I suppose.  There's also kind of like time management around notifications.  So you can snooze things to later if I wanted to manage my notifications the same way that  I manage Google inbox emails, for example.  So like you get an inbox email and within the app, you can either swipe it one way to  delay it or archive it or whatever.  It's kind of making notifications a little bit more like that.  As part of inbox?  Not as part of inbox.  No, I'm just using inbox as an example.  Just fitting inbox into right.  Yeah, I mean, this is literally taking your notifications and applying kind of like being  able to snooze a notification later.  Because personally, I use my notifications as a to-do list many times, which means I  always have these notifications hanging out up there because I don't want to swipe them  away because I want to do that a little bit later.  And if I swipe it away, I might forget because I know myself far too well and I will forget.  So this is like this is a feature that I'm super, you know, very much so looking forward to.  Better kind of built in auto fill for things like password managers.  So if you use LastPass, one password, you know, a bunch of different password managers  right now, there's good, there's OK integration into Android where it's kind of hacking into  the accessibility features to allow for, you know, drawing over the top of other apps to  insert your passwords into the places that they need to go.  But in essence, it's kind of a hacky way to do it.  And I'm amazed that we were able to do it up until now.  Well, with Android, oh, they're going to kind of build that into the OS in an official way so  that it can be done securely and it won't be kind of a hack job the way it is kind of right now.  Let's see here.  What else?  Lock screen shortcuts.  So you know, on the see, I don't know.  Well, yeah, I don't think I'm showing anything off.  But you know, on the down in the corners, you have those little shortcuts.  You can assign those to whatever you want.  So instead of it being a camera shortcut on your lock screen, you could assign it to any app or a  bunch of actions, that sort of stuff.  Let's see here.  What else?  Background management of apps, which I think is actually probably a really good thing for  battery, something that iOS does really well, right?  Like Android is really good for for allowing you to multitask and everything because the OS is  very wide open as far as allowing apps and developers to have access to the full phone, even  when it's not in the foreground and everything like that.  Well, what happens?  You know, some apps go rogue and they kind of take over the process in the background.  And in turn, your battery performance takes a hit.  Performance of the device takes a hit.  Whereas on iOS, it's really kind of like more or less it's a single, you know, there's a single  app in focus and everything else in the background is really limited.  And that ends up improving the performance of your device.  And it sounds like with Android, we're going to get a little bit more of that.  It's going to go deeper in controlling what's going on in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  I mean, I had that problem when I'm in the UK at the moment.  And before I got a local SIM, I was on the T-Mobile roaming thing, which is throttled to 2G.  And that was a great way for my background apps to just sit there and spin and then die and crash.  So my phone would just sit there and lock up for random amounts of time.  So that was that was definitely educational.  Why would we need that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, always, always looking for better battery performance with Android.  And it seems like the last two or three major versions, they've really kind of they continue to roll out improvements that are hopefully extending our battery.  I think a lot of the Doze improvements from N and Marshmallow and Nougat have really helped.  I mean, they've helped tremendously as far as I can tell.  So managing the background stuff is even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was so strange that as Kevin said, when I am abroad and it's roaming, that hurts.  Yeah.  And then if I if I really ways on, I'm dead.  If you leave ways on. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's just turning and that's probably yeah, that's probably using up a lot of resources in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then every once in a while there'll be a day where suddenly I look at it and it's 11 percent and I don't know.  And it just says Android system running.  I don't know why it does.  It's very rare, but it does happen occasionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The weird thing I found was that when I got my so I got my own new Pixel XL.  So my old Nexus 6, I just left on the on the side and it kept running for five days because I wasn't touching it.  So clearly it's still is mostly the screen that is and me interacting with it choose things up, not just background stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, it was lonely.  It's not even just screen. Right.  If it's just sitting on a counter, Android is smart enough to to realize that it's not moving around.  So it's not in a pocket.  So it doesn't need to be kind of ready to do anything.  And so it really kind of limits things down.  And yeah, that's just one of the ways where does has really and you know, those battering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was really impressed that it lasted that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, totally. I've seen that with tablets, too.  It used to be because I don't hardly ever use tablets anymore, but I'll charge it up and then I'll forget about it.  I'll set it down and I'll go back to it a week, two weeks later sometimes.  And I mean, it used to be that it didn't matter what you did.  That tablet, even though it was just sitting there, wasn't going to last more than a couple of days.  It just it just wasn't smart enough to maneuver that.  And now they can last many days before.  But but I will add not nearly as long as the iPad that I have had at the house that one time I charged it fully, used it, set it down, completely forgot about it for almost a month.  Back to it. Totally still on.  Totally add battery power.  It's like, wow, that's that's awesome.  I mean, you could literally forget about it for a month and it's still powered up.  Just crazy. Well, it's like kindles.  Yeah. Yeah.  So, you know, we're getting there.  You know, a number of API changes, of course, for developers that make them happy.  Picture in picture mode.  I mean, all in all, like, I'm still really deciding.  I don't know.  Based on what I've told you, and there's some, you know, kind of like UI enhancements with settings pain and stuff like that, but really no truly like, oh, my God, I got to have that thing right there.  This is the reason to have Android.  Oh, that that you could put on a commercial and someone would be like, that's a cool new thing.  I have to have that new version.  Anything I mean, anything that I've even read out that that jumps out at you and strikes you like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  You think they're hiding stuff back until until I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They usually do to some degree.  I mean, we've we definitely learned more about Nougat or Android N at the time at IO than we did in the developer preview that they unleashed like a couple of months prior.  They got a hold on to some secrets, right?  They can't let it all and also things that aren't working as well right now.  Like it's a developer preview.  This is literally earlier access than they normally do to just get developers kind of get their minds going as far as how they're going to build their apps.  Are you using it?  All that. I'm not yet.  Actually, like I said, I was out on vacation last week.  I only got back Monday evening and I have and I've been super slammed this week, so I haven't had a chance to install it.  I don't know if I'm going to put it on the pixel.  I have the pixel see in the other room that I think I'm going to install it on first to just like play around with it.  Maybe once it's more stable than all than all live with it on the pixel on the Google Pixel phone.  But and that's where you really start to see a lot of those little changes and everything kind of firsthand.  You know, it's one thing to read about the features is another thing to like live with it.  And and in a couple of days, you quickly realize the things that are cool about it and maybe the things that need to be fixed before the next developer preview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, the weird thing I saw the preview for N last year and I didn't realize about half of it like the rapid app switching and that stuff.  I had no idea it was there because it was so subtle.  Right.  There's long press and double clicks on the app switch icon was like I wouldn't I didn't know I was able to do that.  And then once you discover that you're like game over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is like the best feature in the world.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a useful feature.  But you still remember it's there.  And that's the yeah.  And I suspect, you know, for most users, they won't realize it's there either.  It's one of those like it's it's it's so well integrated.  It's too hidden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's Android.  Oh, we did not.  Thank you.  Thank you for that.  Well, yeah, no, I just kind of assumed like I didn't even throw it in here.  I assumed it would be in there, but maybe it came out a day later and I completely missed it.  Oh, we were probably blathering about philosophy or something.  Well, today we'll stick pretty close to Google.  I think for the most part, we've got some things outside of that.  The big announcement and I was on hand here this morning on set along with Ron Richards from All About Android.  And we were covering Samsung's big news.  Samsung unveiled their next flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy S8 or rather the S8 family, because now there are two different sizes of the S8.  There's the S8, which is a five point eight inch display.  And then the S8 plus, which is a six point two inch display and not just a display, infinity.  That's kind of subtle.  Yeah, subtle.  But I have I have to imagine like everybody that I've been reading has says the six point two inch is sizable.  Like it's a beast.  But they say infinity display because there are no bezels on the side.  It wraps around all their devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when we were shopping for new phones, I originally got Rosie the Galaxy S7 and she said, I don't like this.  This is no improvement over the previous galaxies.  I need something bigger.  So I got the ultra instead.  So clearly that would have worked as a thing if it was actually available and not just being pre-announced for three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's interesting that they're I mean, they're going all in on the wraparound display.  I mean, the whole device.  I'm still unsure about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't get that one because that was like I don't want extra touch things on the side that's going to annoy Rosie when she tries to use it.  You know, I fly a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have to hand your phone to somebody to put it on the thing, to read it.  And they are so careful not to touch a surface so it doesn't go off.  And now the edge is there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  And I mean, the edge initially had, you know, it had like extra functionality built into it.  It was like it was like Samsung.  Is that gone?  When well, when Samsung first started rolling out the edge, they were really trying to justify why it existed.  And so they built in.  Well, you can have a second.  It's like a side display and it's a shortcut bar.  I don't think that I'm guessing that that's probably not gone.  I'm guessing that there's a little bit of that built into this, but that's really not the focus.  They didn't mention that a single time during the presentation today.  It was all about, isn't this a beautiful device?  We've removed the bezels on the side by wrapping the display around the edges.  We've taken the front button that you're used to seeing.  I mean, it's iconic for Samsung's Galaxy brand.  And they've removed that, although actually they haven't entirely removed it.  The button is a physical button that resides underneath the display.  So when you're looking at the display, you don't see the button, the home button on the front.  But it's there.  So you have to know and it's pressure sensitive, kind of like Apple's 3D Touch.  So you pressure, it's pressure sensitive.  You push down hard there and that will act as the home button.  So a little bit of learning, I guess, as a user that that exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be trying hard to hold on to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  Right.  Well, maybe I mean, man, it's just been the way it has been for them.  It's probably just, you know, they consider it to be an iconic feature of their devices and, you know,  a signature of their brand and don't let go of it.  Don't let go of your your signature, you know.  They did move the fingerprint reader to the back and it's actually right next to the camera.  Google wins one.  Yeah.  Well, so OK, so the on the pixel, you've got the fingerprint reader kind of dead center on the phone with a camera all the way up there.  On the S8, the fingerprint reader is right next to the camera.  You can see it. So you put your finger on the lens.  So yeah, that's my guess.  I mean, maybe you learn not to do that eventually, but it really seems like it'd be pretty easy to to just throw your finger on the camera all the time.  I guess we'll see how that works.  They say it's the highest screen to body ratio than ever before with the display.  What else? HDR, high dynamic range, basically for the for the display.  So I'm sure the display looks super sharp.  I mean, ultimately, you know, you can look at that and you can see they really went for a very different design language with this versus the previous two Samsung Galaxy devices.  I think it looks really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does look nice. Having looked at the seven and the seven edge last week and gone, there's nothing very exciting about these.  That does look much more compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What else? I'm trying to think about what's really important here.  You know, they really talked up the security aspects of things like they mentioned, of course, at the very top.  I expected them to do this.  They really wanted to make sure that everybody knew, you know, that they take security of users seriously and that they put all of their phones through top notch security protection and scanning.  And it's just this whole inspection process that they dive into.  They mentioned little to nothing about battery throughout the entire event, as far as I can tell.  I'm not even sure the word battery came out at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You saw the story in the rundown about the store.  So a Samsung store burst into flames.  What?  Quick before the announcement.  They just can't win.  You've got to be kidding me.  They're like, battery is a bad word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fire is a bad word.  Let's just talk about our inspection process.  I mean, seriously, I'm sure I'm sure it was in there.  But if it was in there, I missed them saying the word battery.  Even once, you know, because I don't even think I mean, maybe they you know what?  It probably came up with like battery performance or battery life.  But even that, I have a hard time remembering that they said anything like that.  But yeah, the S8 is the smaller version, seven hundred fifty dollars.  The S8 plus is the larger version, eight hundred fifty dollars.  So for an extra hundred bucks, you get the larger screen real estate and might be a little too large for your pocket.  So be prepared.  Preorder starts tomorrow.  If you preorder tomorrow, you get a free one of their new gear, VR's.  They've done that in the past where if you preorder for the seven, I think they'd give you the gear VR along with it.  And they've redesigned the gear VR to have a motion controller now that looks a lot like or at least in some ways looks like the Oculus touch.  It has the big kind of flat touch surface that's round.  I think mobile VR seems to be going in this direction.  So they announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I see in here the phone can be desktop little pod.  You can put your phone in.  Yeah.  That announced as a real product or as a concept?  No, it's a real product.  So that is it's a it's a dock that they call the Samsung Dex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And as you can see in the photo right here, right, like it's a desktop, it's a desktop.  It's a desktop dock that you just set the phone into.  It has connectivity for a keyboard, for a mouse.  It has I don't know if it has Ethernet actually.  Now that I think about it.  But basically you drop your phone.  It probably doesn't actually because it's all coming from your phone.  You drop your phone in there.  And if you have a monitor plugged into it, it then turns your phone into a desktop environment.  And you know, you can use your keyboard and your mouse and operate your phone through the desktop environment.  They have a partnership with with Microsoft to make Microsoft's suite of apps more compatible and work better in that environment with resizable windows and all that the stuff you would expect out of a desktop class OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like it does have Ethernet.  Does it have Ethernet?  And then the back.  On the gadget picture.  So if you look at the link there.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a picture of the back.  So it's not just fully wireless.  Okay.  Yeah, that is interesting.  So I mean, it's fascinating to me.  There are a lot of people starting like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gets you to the point that you don't need a computer.  Your phone is your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess my question is, but who's doing this?  I mean, I realize it's the future potentially that why do we have this desktop?  But I don't know.  Like, I just don't see myself.  I don't see myself going.  I'm going to from now on, I'm going to use my phone as my computer at home.  I'm going to get a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, plug it into this thing.  And now my phone is my computer.  Like, I respect that this is a direction like we've seen this before.  Motorola did it with the A-Trix, I believe it was called.  And, you know, it keeps happening and they keep trying for it.  But I don't know.  I feel like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's where it makes sense to me.  Yeah.  Is in the enterprise.  In a company like an ad agency that hotel you and have you move around desks, you never know where you're going to be.  Now to an extent, you know, Google Drive solves that problem.  I can use any computer anywhere and Chrome OS solves that problem.  But if I want my own stuff, my local storage and some apps and other things, then, you know,  it's a way that I can move from desk to desk and city to city and always have or hotel to hotel even potentially.  You always have.  But what is it running?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it running like a Chrome OS like thing?  So it's running on Android, but they've tweaked it to behave better.  Yeah, I mean, Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, all I travel with anymore is my Pixel C.  OK.  OK, so I'm I'm using Android with Docs with Chrome and Drive and that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're living in this world, a very similar world to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But does it feel Chrome OS?  Does it feel under I haven't played with that enough to understand it's because it's Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically Chrome.  OK, yeah.  Well, don't forget.  Don't forget.  I'm living la vida Google as I do.  I'm on.  I've been on Chrome OS for two and a half years.  So my window to the world is Chrome period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Chrome OS is good.  Yeah, I know.  I like it.  I get irritated.  Now I use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.  Well, the pixel is now on my.  You go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still using the Chromebook Pixel that I got at Google I.O.  three and a half years ago, wherever it was, nearly four years ago.  So am I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm on right now.  Oh, I love this little guy.  Yeah, no, I love this machine, although I am running into slowdowns and stuff on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, there is this we're at this with this weird sort of plateau in Moore's law now, whether that's what's happening.  You know, when I bought you know, I've been refreshing my hardware.  I bought a new Mac and it's like I have no reason to buy this year's Mac.  I can buy last year's Mac and have ports I actually want to use rather than buy this year's Mac and have to buy a bunch of new cables.  And there's no there's no sort of obvious improvement in performance in the new Mac over the last year's model.  And there's the same with it using the Chrome the Chromebook Pixel that's three and a half years old does not feel like using a terrible slow machine.  So there's this sort of strange thing that's happened to computing performance.  It used to be that a three year old device would be would feel far too slow to use.  But we've hit the threshold of acceptable performance.  But also we've hit this sort of knee in Moore's law where we can't you know, we're not throwing more CPU speed at things anymore.  What we're throwing is more execution units.  And so what matters is how much stuff you're doing in parallel as opposed to does this year's model feel that much faster than last year's model.  And it was literally to the max that lots of people saw no reason to buy the new Mac Pro MacBook Pro.  And I'm getting the same feeling with this stuff.  And that's going to be a problem for them as they try and sell the phones as well.  There's I you know, the screen technology has got a bit better, but there's not much else they can point to here and say this is better than the previous one.  Yep. That's where we are with all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're waiting, you know, waiting for our new Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But last year was like, well, it's going to be VR and you're going to stuck your phone to your face and everything will be wonderful.  And it's like, yeah, but no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zuckerberg thinks, you know, five, ten years from now, that might actually be the case.  And who knows? He may be right.  But it's hard to say at this point.  Yeah. So well, now, Jeff, you're so you're using the Pixel C, you say, right?  That's that's I mean, that's Android desktop, right?  That's not Chrome. It is Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's Android. But I'm using a Chrome browser all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you mean. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do use apps, too. Right.  But actually, I find because here's the thing.  It's interesting because the apps are not rewritten to be able to handle larger sizes like United Airlines.  I'm just as well off going to the website than going to the app on the currency.  It's a very good app. And I use it on my phone.  But the web version is just as good.  It's frustrating when I can't get the large web version of some things through the browser.  That's a problem. So it's not perfect. Right.  But I do know with pleasure and anticipation.  I've never really been in Samsung, but Samsung now has a new competitor to the Pixel C.  They announced as well.  There's a rundown on the out on the on the rundown.  There's a rundown of them on the rundown against each other.  And it has one feature I'm dying for, which is LTE built in as an option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You've been you you request this every time there's an any time there's an iteration to the Pixel.  Right. And that's one thing that the initial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. To the computer. Yeah. Or to the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, yeah. You don't find tethering good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. It's always special with me.  I'm always special because I have an AT&T grandfathered unlimited.  And I just on that principle, I refuse to give it up.  You can't tether that account.  But even if even if I could have any pull the phone out, turn on the tether, wait for it to connect.  I my old days with my Pixel seven and I mean, I would you call them then?  Not Pixel. What do they call it then?  What the before?  Nexus. Nexus.  Nexus. So we forget by Nexus seven had LTE and it was just always on.  It was it was really easy and good.  Yeah. And my original Chromebook had LTE.  I love that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Give me an option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that was that was my annoyance here.  So I've got I've got good broadband in the UK here.  It's very immediate. But when it drops out, they don't drop it properly.  They put up a they serve a web page from the Wi-Fi hub saying we're having trouble with your connection.  And they man in the middle all your Web connections with that so that my phone,  which would quite happily switch over to Ford for G and I wouldn't notice suddenly behaves really weirdly  because all the Web connections have turned into spurious Web pages from the local Wi-Fi router, which is really annoying.  That is super annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let let the smart devices be smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop overthinking this router.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. So you were talking about the Galaxy Tab S3.  Jeff, we actually Florence Ion on last night's all about Android kind of dove into that in detail.  She's been playing around with it.  She says it's really nice.  The S Pen is is an awesome touch.  Yeah, it really kind of seems like the maybe the next step for the Google Pixel C fan that wants something a little bit newer,  a little bit, you know, I don't know, kind of in the same kind of premium ballpark.  Apparently, it's pretty nice. I don't know.  I haven't seen it in person and I'll see it next week.  I just I commend you for living your life on the Pixel C because I man I had tried to have that.  I have the keyboard attachment for it.  I think it's probably the kind of thing you just have to devote yourself to do.  And then eventually here's the key.  No, here's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do not live my life on it.  OK, when I travel, I got it.  I will live up to a week on it.  And it works.  The worst time is trying to get home.  I'm trying to get home.  Twig.  And there are you know, there are a few frustrations.  But generally, for what I want to do, not, you know, losing two pounds in my briefcase is heavy.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a big trade off there.  Real quick on the end of kind of the wrapping up what else Samsung had, they have a Google Wi Fi clone or kind of router base  similar to Google Wi Fi called Samsung Connect Home.  It's your Wi Fi router, smart Wi Fi router that you can control from an app.  It also has smart things and IOT smarts baked into it.  So it can be your IOT hub for gosh, I think it was Bixby.  No, sorry. Sorry. Not Bixby.  That's something else.  Zigbee and Z-Wave.  Bixby is Samsung's proprietary digital assistant, by the way, which they now have.  That was another announcement.  But anyway, so there's a there's because Samsung loves to do that.  Right. You've got these things that you're already using.  We've got ours now, too. You should use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the other reason to not buy Samsung devices.  Like now I have 20 copies of all the apps that I already have and I've got to try and turn those off and I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's what Samsung did with this is in the S8, they have a dedicated button on the side of the phone to summon Bixby,  which I have to imagine they had to do because otherwise people might not remember to ever use it.  If there's a dedicated button, they'd be more inclined to remember that that button goes to Bixby.  But you have to ask yourself, like, why use this versus, you know, assistant or any other number of digital assistants that are that are on these devices by default,  thanks to their agreement with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you think you think the assistance will become free of their platforms that even on an Android device, I'll be able to use Siri.  Is that going to be their business benefit at any point or is it so tied as just an extra benefit?  There's no business model for it. So you've got to tie it to the hardware.  It's a really good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Siri is a weird one. I can't see Apple doing that.  I couldn't see that either.  Alexa, you can run on Android, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can on certain Android devices.  And as you see here, Cortana is available, of course.  Microsoft makes Cortana. So I mean, in some ways they are available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can use Cortana on on on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you could. Yep.  Just install that app.  And it's a little different from from Windows 10 mobile in the sense that, you know, on Windows 10 mobile Cortana has more access to the underlying layers of the phone  in the same way that on Google, you know, on Android devices, Assistant, especially on the Pixel.  As one example, Assistant has more hooks, I think, on the underlying operations of an Android device than maybe a third party one would have because it's Google.  But yeah, you can install Cortana and they even have brought it as you see here to the lock screen.  So you can summon it from there, removing kind of an element, kind of a step to get there.  So, yeah, I couldn't see Siri doing that, though, or Apple doing that with Siri.  But I mean, Bixby at Samsung's offering actually is related to Siri in the sense that it was it was partially the result of what is it?  Viv Samsung acquired Viv back last year and Viv was created by some of the people who created Siri.  So it's very incestuous. It's all it's all coming together as far as that's concerned.  And then New Gear VR. I already mentioned that New Gear 360 spherical camera.  They updated that for full 4K. I guess the previous version was like 90 percent 4K.  Apparently now it's full 4K. They also redesigned it.  So they took away the kind of tripod legs and they moved the battery down in that base.  So it allows for the spherical. I'm not sure how much I like that.  I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm just a creature of habit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the sphere was neat because it could go on any tripod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. That's one of my fears.  My complaint is that you could you could unscrew that sphere and put it on anything, put it on the top of your your snowboarding helmet, for example, or whatever.  Yeah. And a little bit more flexible.  Standard metal. A bit more locked down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the on that? There's a there's a window on the on the handle.  You know what that is? That's probably like the picture of it.  I'm pointing to it. What does that do? Down at the bottom, the round thing in the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, on the gear 360 on the first version, there was a display.  I believe there's a display on the top and that's just your digital.  Yes, there was. So that's just the display.  Yeah, that's my guess. Anyways, I haven't seen that in operation, but I'm guessing that's probably where they moved that.  That would make sense. And it supports live broadcast.  So which, by the way, Facebook unleashed fully today the ability to live stream 360 degree video content.  This is going to tie into that also into live streaming to YouTube, to the Samsung Gear VR.  So you're going to be able to use this to live stream in real time.  360 degree video, which is pretty neat.  So, you know, when you get your front seat at the Bruce Springsteen concert or wherever you go on, you know, bring your 360 and everyone else can see it, too.  You probably shouldn't do that. It's probably against the rules.  But anyways, we're probably going to get those a device or two in house to kind of spend some time with and review on the show.  I'm sure Leo's get one. I have to imagine Leo's going to get one and you're going to see it here in a few weeks.  Yeah, nice looking device. I like it.  Oh, and real quick, before we get to our sponsor read, I should just also mention that Samsung is going to be refurbishing Note 7.  So they're going to be reissuing the Note 7 stock that they had claimed from all of the battery explosions.  So they're going to re-release it to certain markets as a refurbished device or rental devices.  It's not coming to the US, though, but they're instead of just throwing this all in the ground, a la Atari, they're going to put it to some use again and give it new life, which I think is the right move.  So good stuff. All things Samsung.  Let's take a quick break and thank the sponsor of today's episode of This Week in Google.  That's Nature Box. This is probably the part where a lot of you are going to get super hungry because I've got a nature box right here full of delicious snacks that I'm not going to eat right now because I want to be able to actually read and talk.  But I'm tempted because a peanut butter graham jam sounds pretty delicious right about now.  What do you do when you want to snack? But all you find is junk food everywhere you look.  You rely on your self-control to resist the temptation.  Don't go there. You eat the junk food, though, anyways, and that probably doesn't feel very good.  Well, now you can start snacking healthy with Nature Box. Nature Box makes snacks that actually taste great and are better for you.  They're created with high quality ingredients that are free from artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners so you can feel great about snacking.  I have actually had the peanut butter graham jams. Those are delicious.  There's also in this box in particular blueberry almond quinoa bites.  Over time, I've realized they must have someone who enjoys the position of naming all of their snacks in ways that make you salivate.  Nutty power clusters, zesty nacho curls. I don't know. They do a good job naming their snacks, and they're as delicious as their names imply.  Nature Box recently made their service even better. Now you can order as much as you want, as often as you want.  No minimum purchase is required and you can cancel anytime.  So it's super simple. You just go to naturebox.com.

That's naturebox.com slash twit for 50% off your first order.  And we thank Nature Box for their support of this week in Google.  So let's see here. We got some googly news starting with a bunch of messaging related moves tied in with G Suite.  It's like Google is taking their messaging ship apart piece by piece and repurposing pieces and different apps. It's not confusing at all.  Google Talk apparently is dead as of June 26th. It's going to be end of life.  That's the chat that you're used to seeing in Gmail if you're still using Gmail and not Inbox. And they're going to be replacing it with Hangouts.  Hangouts. I think this was kind of expected at some point that they would get rid of Google Talk. Its days were numbered.  Is it still going to be a sidebar or are we going to have to go to another tab?  I think it's going to be a Hangouts window as far as I can tell. Kind of similar to what you're seeing with Google Talk.  But yeah, actually that's a good question because in Inbox it is a sidebar. It kind of occupies the side of the screen instead of being that little pop out window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now I think that's an issue. But yeah, it was very convenient to have it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I would agree. Also Hangouts on Android is going to kill SMS functionality. That's happening on May 22nd. I'm hearing screams in the studio.  Yeah, I don't know. How do you guys feel about this? Have you moved on from SMS inside Hangouts? I'm still kind of locked into that world and I realize I need to jump ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I forget what I'm using now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm using Google Messenger now. I'm tempted to switch to...  Messages you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Android Messages or whatever they're calling it this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was good Messenger for a while and then they realized that that just meant people would download the Facebook one instead because Facebook made that one do SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know I should probably switch over to Android Messages. I just can't keep it all straight. It's so confusing.  This is what we do for a living and I can't keep it all straight. How is anybody else going to keep it all straight? It's so confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was grumbling about Samsung making a spare copy of every app but Google has made five of these damn things and it's really annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Particularly going from the US to the UK and it's like, okay, I would like to actually bridge all these things into one place.  Google Voice used to kind of do that but I'm still not quite sure if it's going to ever work.  I'm not sure when they shake all the pieces and then steal the cards out again whether I'll be able to bridge Google Voice from my old US account to my UK phone number.  Signal, which I thought was great, is tied to your voice ID, which is really stupid. WhatsApp kind of has a way to do it but then it gets really grumpy when you do do it.  And I think one of the Google things is it Allo or Duo? Allo I think is tied to phone numbers as well.  And it's like, why are you making me buy a SIM from another company to generate an ID? How is that a better answer than using an online ID?  How do we get trapped in this place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you imagine? How do they end up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They ended up there because, well, the other thing that Google has very badly wrong is that they base ID on email.  And that's baked so deeply into the Google ID system that they can't fix it.  And they've had four goes at replacing it and it's never really stuck.  So basically when you sign up for Google account you have to have an email.  And I think a product manager decided Google got frustrated with this because they work in markets where they don't have an email.  And they won't go for the process to sign up for them.  And so that's how we ended up with Allo where they're doing it on phone numbers again because they're trying to sell it to India and markets that are SIM based.  And that was the sort of the insight that WhatsApp had.  It was like, oh, people don't have email addresses. They have phone numbers.  Let's bootstrap everything off the phone number system, which kind of works.  But it, you know, I need the infrastructure where my phone has two SIMs, which doesn't happen in Western phones.  So I'm stuck with keeping my old phone sort of half alive so that I can get the US SMS is on that one and the UK SMS is on this one.  And actually I'd rather bridge it properly. And this is like it's just a deep identity failure.  And OK, now I'm going to have to know you got me my Google identity run.  But the other thing that's really frustrating about identity and this is a very Jeff complaint, which is that I've used Google to register domains because it used to be really easy.  You used to use Google dot com slash a and you could register domains and it was part of Google Apps for your domain because make domains there and then you could make a site or an app engine thing or or create domains.  And they would also renew and they'd use your credit card.  Everything would be fine.  So I have a I have a domain habit.  I buy domains and sort of forget about them.  And suddenly G suites is insisting that you log in to the Gmail account that belongs to that domain to renew it.  And I've got a bunch of domains that don't have accounts because I just made domains and then I have I have apps on them or I have static pages or I have something on them.  But now I can't renew them.  G Suite just completely fails to renew them.  No.  So I've you know and half of it in some ways this is this is a good thing in that it's half of them are stupid domains that I bought 10 years ago and have done anything sensible with.  But there are a couple of them that come up with you and I was like I don't actually I cannot get through your process to renew this Google because you're expecting to log in with an email from that domain that I never created.  And when I try and do that I just get a series of 400 hours and it fails.  So I think these are the ones that they outsource the registration to go daddy or you know more somebody.  So I'm going to have to go and get on the phone with go daddy and you know and try and get them to re root the domain for me.  But it's yeah it's this sort of it's the root cause is this strange focus on email that is at the heart of Google's identity system which they've been sort of trying to fix for at least 10 years and never quite managed to do so.  And the phone number thing is a symptom of that as well.  It's like oh we've done it we're doing identity through phone numbers.  But we can't once we've decided that's what we're doing that means you can't actually move between countries in any reliable way at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hearing you detail that just gave me gave me a nightmarish.  I don't know I just started remembering the time I was on this we can Google and locked myself out of my own account because of the voice.  That was the best maybe the best show ever.  I mean and it's kind of the same thing right.  Like I need the thing to do the thing but I can't get the thing because I need the thing.  Right.  Yeah that's a nightmare.  I mean and you said you said it right there you said you know the Google's been has taken 10 years to try and get it right and just not quite there.  And man isn't that indicative of things coming from Google I feel like and I hate to say that because I'm such a huge fan but I mean you know that identity messaging.  I mean it's this this like constant struggle and confusion around like what why is this such a challenge.  And yet it's so important.  Just when it is hard you know I'm not saying it's an easy problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand.  It's like we should be able to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe I get too much credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's I mean I think it's partly because Google is in some ways that every structure be a bit chaotic so that they encourage people to make new products to try and not start innovation by imposing a strategy tax on people.  Whereas you know Facebook had to buy another company to do that.  And then then they learned that oh you can log into Facebook with a phone number or an email and we'll create an identity bridge between them.  Whereas for Google they went down a rabbit hole with with Google Plus and I suspect my feeling is that Google Plus now is like IE was in Microsoft for about five years when nobody wanted to touch it because it had such a sort of toxic waste sign hanging around its neck.  And so we're stuck with these like you know they're gradually unpicking it they're pulling pieces off bit by bit and they're trying to make sense of it.  But it's a structural problem they have that they're trying to resolve.  Yeah.  And in the meantime with with I'm sitting here going OK so I have to pay an American phone company and a British phone company to keep these things going.  Even though you have you have a soft telco wrapped inside Google Voice which has been sitting there sort of mostly working for 10 years now.  Yet somehow I the ability to migrate phone numbers into it and went away at some point probably because the guys who founded it left and Google doesn't have cell phones anymore or something.  But it's one of these it's one of these sort of these this identity problem is a hard problem and there are ways to fix it by by thinking carefully about it.  But in practice you end up defaulting to something and Google defaults to email and then WhatsApp defaults to phone numbers.  And neither of those are ideal.  And there's that there are ways to abstract this better but they haven't they haven't solved it yet.  And it frustrates me all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you would say that WhatsApp suffers from the same I mean it's the same technological issue but WhatsApp suffers from the same problem that that alo suffers from.  But WhatsApp is not having a problem you know in this in the world of messaging.  They are reigning supreme as far as that's concerned.  Why is it working for WhatsApp and it's not working for alo.  Well I don't use WhatsApp much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what's WhatsApp bootstrapped itself on phone numbers and spent the time in countries where you can have multiple SIMs.  So it worked out a way to bridge it.  Got it. Whereas the Google stuff I think is this very American nobody ever changes a SIM worldview.  And so they're sort of stuck in that corner.  Whereas WhatsApp you know WhatsApp I was able to migrate to this to this phone with WhatsApp and it was a bit cumbersome partly because the encryption stuff.  So you basically have to send an SMS to your old phone and have that working and then type the number in from that one on this phone and then it will wake itself up and download and encrypt your personal things.  And you've got your message archive and then I think it's bridging the chats.  I'm not you know I think it's using my old phone number on this on this new phone for my WhatsApp connections.  It seems to be. But the signal completely failed to do that.  Signal was like no you've just got to tell your friends you're a new phone number.  It's like that's not actually helpful when I have you know 18 years worth of phone contacts in the old thing.  And I don't actually want to send a giant SMS to all of them saying hi I've changed my phone number.  Please contact me this way. The point of using signal was supposed to be I've switched to a very secure thing that's this end to end.  And suddenly it's like oh no but I've got to.  And you know the rationale is well it's like we're trying to make this easy for people to use SMS.  It's like yeah but you could actually make it easy in these other ways too.  But just a little bit of abstraction.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah and you're talking about removing peeling things back out of Google Plus that continues Google removed location sharing from Google Plus.  And this was a feature that I've used actually quite a bit.  My wife and I actually use it because you know with a family and my wife working in San Francisco and me being up here and commute and all that kind of stuff.  It's really good to know like if somebody's on route or where they're at or whatever.  So we know when we get back up because let me tell you when you're you know when you've got a family backup is definitely appreciated.  And so removing it from Google Plus was a big bummer.  Well it turns out it's being folded into maps.  You may remember latitude of days you know gone by.  It's basically latitude ish features coming back into maps.  I just got the update this morning that allows me to send to grant either temporary or permanent location sharing of where I'm at with a select contact and then inside the maps app they can track that from there.  Honestly this is a feature that always belonged in maps.  It was strange that it ended up in Google Plus but there we go.  I mean that's you know well you know I still remember dodgeball so that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's but no but latitude made sense.  But latitude made sense made sense in maps and it worked in maps and then they put it in plus because everything was being put in plus social feature blah blah blah.  Except that there was some actually quite nice features of this which was you could put widgets on the desktop to show you where your family was which is which is actually really useful.  And I don't know if I can do that with a maps version yet.  But also I've got to like because they didn't transition this well all those widgets died.  The Google location thing died.  I've now got to go and talk to my family say OK let me walk you through the six step process of sharing your location with me again.  And you know it's like the transition has not been handled well especially killing it killing the old version before the new version was available.  But I agree you know I agree with the basic premise.  It did belong in maps it makes a lot of sense being in maps.  But the you know do they have the navigate to this person thing back because that was the other great thing about latitude when it was in maps you could see where your friends were and say take me take me to where Jeff is.  And if Jeff moves then the nav would update to to to help you chase Jeff around which was which is really useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a really good question.  I don't know all I've done yet is share my location with my wife and she has not shared with me yet.  I need to show her how to do that tonight then I'll be able to find out if you can actually do that.  That was very useful because then it's like I know where you're at.  Let's meet up. You don't need to tell me.  I already know and yes go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's about you.  And it is that and the thing is it was also very weird because I had my latitude group was was grandfathered into my plus group or something.  So I had like Leo's location and random Google execs location and you know things like that because people who signed up for latitude at the same time as me and shared locations I forgot they were doing it.  And then Google Plus picked that up and the thing the press was still there.  So that was a bit weird.  So I love the street names around you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got my napkins.  I love I love Britain.  Oh they're so great.  One Street's just called the Avenue.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Certainly hubris.  It's the Avenue in this village.  There's a lot of Dale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like this.  So that's it.  So yeah there's a little tiny Kevin on my map now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I just I just I just sent you it because I put your email so I don't know if you will say oh send it back to Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  And now you can navigate to Kevin.  Of course you'll have to you know get on a plane and.  Where is that right now anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says Jeff Jarvis is sharing with you sir.  Oh Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I gotta be like that huh.  Come around I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know the problem is that you get app fatigue you know you get feature fatigue.  That's true.  There's just things I don't even bother to learn.  And mind you again I live la vie de Google.  I am I am Google boy.  I use it all but there's some things I just don't bother with.  Yeah.  Well this is a feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The challenge of this feature is that is if you're not careful it ends up being the Harry Potter marauders map where it's like oh I'm tracking all these people over the globe and watching them walk down the street.  So that what they have done with this that's different is they've said oh we can you can put a time limit on it.  So you can say OK I want to share this with Jason for the next two hours because I'm heading up to the studio or something and that doesn't grandfather you into to be able to track me for the rest of my life which is the problem they have with latitude.  It's like well obviously everybody wants to know where everyone is all the time.  So it is a bit smarter.  But you know I haven't spent enough time with it yet because I've got to like you've got to have a side channel conversation with people saying please turn on this thing so I can track you on your phone is like I'm not being weird here.  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's the hard sell is like you know having that conversation as far as why that needs to happen or why that should happen why it's a good idea and especially actually in this day and age of being very critical and suspicious of sharing anything about what you're doing on a daily basis using services.  That's an even more tough sell to say hey why don't you just share with me all the time or whatever.  At least they have the expiration option on there so you can just be like for the next two hours this might be important to you.  So here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's the difference between that and the new Facebook person tracking thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Similar except I think the new so the new yeah that that's also in the rundown.  Facebook's Messenger sharing which Messenger more and more is becoming not only a messaging app but also just Facebook's realizing that it's used to for people to connect with each other in physical space and so they're tying in these options like hey you want to go get a drink you know that built in with a filter whatever.  This is kind of along those lines and it allows you to temporarily share your live location with either a single contact on Messenger or a group chat on Messenger and I think I think they're very similar.  I think one of the differences is that in the Facebook Messenger aspect I don't think there's a permanent option and there is with the Google where you can just share all the time what you're doing location wise.  So I think that's a little different between the two.  What else I know we should probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think a big story this week is that a bunch of within the last week and a half a bunch of advertisers starting with the Guardian the BBC the UK government Havas the big.  Carson we talked about this last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We didn't right.  Did we.  Carson saying that yes we did.  Okay I know that there was I know that there was but there but there was the initial and then there was there's been more initial and so that so that we did talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did it the other Google came back and said that's what we did talk about that last week sorry that they would they would enable people so now Google is trying to go to the next step and trying to enable more opportunities for people to.  Restrict their advertising.  I had an event a private Chatham House rule you know so partially private event at CUNY last Thursday with top advertising agencies top ad networks top recirculation engines top advertisers plus media people and so on.  About 20 people to discuss this and when we came around to kind of there's a lot of effort to we keep on playing whack-a-mole with the bad stuff.  And what we probably need is more signals of quality and more safety and convincing the advertisers that they should be there that it's kind of an insurance for them.  It may cost a little more because there's a bit of scarcity here but there's a lot of movement in our in my world around trying to get quality around advertising now and get away from the junk and Google stuck there just stuck there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean the big challenge is far as far as YouTube you know content is concerned is the difference between.  Well I don't know I guess I guess it's just the algorithmic selection of this content I mean there's obviously more work that Google needs to do as far as understanding the content in the videos in order to know whether anyone would want their ads displayed on this and I mean there's there's a lot of there's a lot of bad content on YouTube.  I mean what is it 400 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so like that's what you end up doing and there's a danger to this which end up doing I think is you favor known brands that brand can be.  Can be.  Twig twit but it's a brand and it has a reputation and it protects that reputation and you say OK I can trust that then you have a wait list.  Which is only a little bit of their blacklist but I also think that there's other signals of of either either quality or danger you know this this person has only started posting in the last two hours.  I don't think you want your ad there yet right.  Patterns of virality other things that you can point to with some measure of quality so it's an interesting issue that's coming across all of advertising and content now and where programmatic advertising completely commoditized media.  The data point about you looking at those boots that follow you around that in every ad you see is more important than buying an ad in an editorial environment that's appropriate to buying boots.  And so we became commodity who cares where my ad is as long as they want boots I will put the ad there and so I think that's going to change a bit so maybe good for brands like twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I mean you know twig twig does that right it does sell the ads directly so it is it.  Yeah but that was I read a great rant about this somewhere which is which I can't find now of course which was someone saying well actually what happened was.  The historically advertising was a relationship between a brand and a publisher and it was brokered by ad buyers and that was the model you had and they would decide where they would buy it and they would set because there was a finite number of each and somebody could sit in the middle and decide.  Oh clearly you should be buying advertising in the Daily Mail you should be buying in the Observer and you should be buying in the New York Times and so on.  And that was just mediated by like layers and layers of random algorithms running in different places so that nobody knows what's going on anymore.  And at this point the media companies are complaining about this and you know in the UK here the Daily Mail is saying Google is terrible law and then at the same time they're calling Google in front of parliament and saying why are you promoting putting ads next to the media?  Why are you putting government ads next to extremist videos?  And Google is like hmm and we're trying to work this out but it's hard and we can't actually identify extremist videos but obviously if you tell us examples we'll stop from doing that.  So it's this sort of weird, it's an example of Yaron Lanier's thing.  He said this in 2002 I think is that the Turing test was passed at the point where we decided to do stupid things to improve our credit ratings to replicate the algorithm that was running there.  So the thing where you take out a loan and then pay it back so that your credit rating would improve, at that point we had given up and given the computers more credit than they deserve for doing something in that.  And the advertising industry is like 20 layers of that to the point now where nobody can tell you where the ads are running and what's happening because there are so many layers of random algorithms in between you and the other that's not there.  And the fascinating thing, not to bring up AMP too much again because I know we've covered that a lot of times, is how AMP is being used as a crude instrument to try and reform that industry in parallel in that way.  I made a bookmark this week so that if I click it, it'll take me from the web page to the AMP version of the web page.  And I do this on the desktop, I can figure it out on mobile by typing, but the reason I did this was mainly because the AMP versions are usually easier to read and do not have 16 layers of dancing nonsense on top of themselves.  So if I'm reading something from the mainstream media, the Google search takes a lot of giving the AMP version initially but not on the desktop, but I have a little button I can click on the desktop and I can give the AMP version instead and it's like the old Reability button, except that it's being served by them.  And the good thing is AMP is actually training them that, oh, we can do this a different way, we don't have to inject 20 companies worth of JavaScript into your thing.  The LA Times was downloading 14 gigabytes of stuff per day if you left their window open.  That couldn't be in your number of the week, Jeff.  So the interesting thing for me was having made this thing, I find that I'm pressing it more and more in the same way that in Safari you press the readability button or there's a way of saying just get this thing out of my face.  And because the AMP stuff loads fast, this is often quicker than finding the take this thing off my face button on the screen.  So,  it's another market for the crisis of advertising that we're all still trying to solve.  Meanwhile, many of the advertisers that were hit by this on YouTube are, of course, still advertising on Google search because it's working over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Things are working over there. They've got that figured out. It's probably much easier to analyze text than it is video.  Google is working on analyzing video.  Didn't they mention, gosh, it was like three weeks, a month ago, about advancements that they have in their AI that's able to watch full video scenes or longer clips or whatever and tell you exactly what's happening on every screen and when a scene change happens and just all sorts of things.  So,  they're getting there. Maybe that technology gets applied to YouTube and it ends up being a little bit easier for them to understand what they're actually seeing.  Seems to be the way that it's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the challenge is working out what's really going on.  It's like the Facebook image descriptions and they'll say two people were standing in front of a sign and it's like, OK, yes, but the reason I care about that photograph is my son's and the sign is not relevant.  And Facebook actually has that information but is not using it in that AI, sir, possibly because it's too creepy.  Google has Google has enough material in YouTube to train lots of facial recognition things.  They probably can figure out who's the actors in the scene already automatically.  I'd be surprised if they hadn't built that already.  They're probably being quiet about it because of the scariness implications.  Sure. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break and we'll get back to more news.  We've got a lot in there. Probably not going to get to a lot of it, but we'll do our very best.  That's what we do here.  But let's take a break and thank the sponsor of today's episode.  That is Segment. Segment is a data hub platform that makes it simple to collect, unify and act on your customer data across all of your websites, mobile apps and cloud platforms.  There are hundreds of different tools for digging into your data.  You know, Google Analytics, Optimizely, Mixpanel.  All of these tools can be useful for different teams to figure out how your users are engaging with your business.  Unfortunately, many of these tools require you to write custom code in order to gather the data and to set up your integrations.  Also, they may only cover only portions of your data and not all of it.  So, you know, there is a platform that enables writing integration code only once.  A single API, a tool for unifying your data and performing analytics on any platform from from Marketo to Mailchimp.  And Segment is that platform.  It's used by some of the world's best companies like Atlassian, Intuit, New Relic, and Reuters.  You can choose from hundreds of partner integrations, including the most popular apps for advertising, analytics, A-B testing, attribution.  And that's just from the A section of Segment's diverse partner catalog.  With Segment, a developer can quickly integrate a new analytics tool for the data driven account manager,  another for the App Happy Marketer and even another for the data scientist who needs the flexibility of a unified data warehouse.  Segment lets you dig deeper as well.  You can bring your data from any source.  You can import historical data.  You can customize what ends up in your data warehouse of choice.  And Segment is the customer data platform that both developers and analysts love because of its elegant API and extensive partner ecosystem.  You're going to spend time using your analytics data and actually acting on it and not wasting time struggling with custom integrations and all that.  Thanks to Segment, your CEO will love your quickly deployed integrations with tools like Zendesk, Intercom, and AppNexus.  Over 8,000 of the world's best companies use Segment to drive growth and revenue.  And now, Twit listeners can try the Segment team plan free for three months.  It's free for three months when you sign up at segment.com slash Twit.  Go to segment.com slash Twit to sign up for yourself and check it out.  And we thank Segment for their support of This Week in Google and the Twit network.  All right, Jeff.  So we've got a block here to talk about anything that I don't know.  What floats your boat?  What in this stuff?  Because there's so much stuff in here and I don't want to waste time with stuff that is kind of like,  when there's really important interesting stuff going on right now, what do you think we need to talk about?  Uh oh, uh oh.  Do you want to talk about some of the security stuff?  I mean, you know, web browser history.  We should talk about Congress.  Yeah, I think we probably should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the UK government too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, right.  Yeah.  Start here.  So, I mean, it's not news to anybody.  We're not going to report news here.  Everybody knows that Congress voted to enable your privacy to still be sold by your ISPs and phone companies.  And who was it?  So I just posted this.  Somebody put up a, The Verge put up a list of every member of the 265 members of Congress who sold you out to ISPs and how much it cost to buy them.  All of their, I'll put this up on the rundown now.  So it's a shame.  That's where we are, you know.  That's where we are.  There's very little protection for us as consumers anymore.  And the thing I don't know is this.  Somebody said on TV yesterday that you can still tell your ISP and your phone company not to do this.  You have to go to the effort to do that.  Does anyone know what it takes to do that?  And can somebody make that into a nice easy feature that we can all just go and write automated letters demanding that they not share our stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was one of my big questions.  I mean, should be reiterated because I feel like a lot of the reporting and stuff that's happening around this is not, it's not as easy to read it and understand that like no rules have been in place yet.  This is how it's been.  This rule that the FCC put into place said that by the end of 2017, they would no longer be able to do this.  They still can.  And so I haven't seen any information, you know, if it's if the rule was to force ISPs to be up front as far as what data they are collecting and how they want to use that and allow you to choose either way.  Well, now without that rule, I mean, is there still any chance?  Do you still have any control over it?  Like, is it the kind of thing that you could step in and and say, actually, don't include me in that?  Or are you just kind of included in part of this because you are a customer and you have no choice?  I haven't seen anything that that says that that you do that you have that ability, but I would love to see it.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the challenge because it's you know, the shorthand is like they're showing your browser history.  But actually, what it is, is they're showing your DNS lookup.  And so the work around is to not use their DNS if you can.  But that is not always straightforward.  And setting that up is not something you can easily explain to people.  So it is one of the is one of these these is this sort of nasty thing where the the ISPs, the telcos have this Google Facebook envy where they want to do the kind of data mining stuff that Google and Facebook do.  But actually, they're not any good at this.  If they were any good at data mining, they wouldn't spam you with we sign up for our service when you've already got their service stuff or they wouldn't.  You know, when you type in a URL, it doesn't exist.  So if you have a page that is full of the worst ads in the world.  So actually, they're terrible at this.  But they would love they would love to have the story that we can do this in kind of a tracking nonsense that Google and Facebook can do.  So there's there's a sort of skunk works inside every telco that's trying to do this kind of thing.  And that most of them got in trouble for this kind of thing in the in the past because it does violate the net.  The net is running the separation of powers rules exist in different countries and the Trump administration's Trump administration sort of reflects the thing is saying, well, we should just we should just corporations do things as corporations know what they're doing and governments don't.  And that's that that's that they're reversing the sort of more sensible rules that were in place.  But the the the real answer is, well, we had to do encrypt connections and use non non non default DNS and not be able to be man in the middle in annoying ways.  But that's hard when you when that's that that's the company you're buying the connection from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Now, Jeff, did you put this in the chat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, popular mechanics, mechanics, which is really does great stuff, by the way, is not often seen.  Does have procedures and links for where you can opt out.  So, for instance, if you go to Verizon, nice, there is a place where you can go do this.  And so I think that what I would like to see probably is you've got to sign into your account and they make it as hard as possible.  Of course, the sign in.  But I wish that there were a legal there's no legal requirement or anything, but I wish there were a way that you could send them a letter and then say, I put you on notice.  I don't opt in. Don't do it and start taking them to court.  I think the ACLU is suing them already.  No, because there's a new huge First Amendment initiative at Columbia University backed by like twenty five million dollars per night foundation.  And they are filing suit around this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure there'll be more to if it makes you feel any better.  There's a guy named Adam McKellen, McKelleny, who created a GoFundMe page to purchase the browser history of those who voted for the bill for the recusal of the bill, as well as those who supported the recusal within the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I can you can you really buy it with the I.I. I don't know.  It's a really great question.  You can. Yeah, I mean, it's fun, but I don't want to see make money with something you can't do.  This is $23,000. Wow.  I don't think you can really do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. This shot up super quick because before the show when I was prepping, I think it was somewhere like the goal.  I think it's 10,000. I think it was at 7000 before the show.  Now it's at $93,788. Yeah, I mean, that's it.  That's a big, big question.  If you end, I was kind of reading through some of the comments on this GoFundMe page.  There's a lot of support, but there's a lot of people like, OK, well, what's you know, what happens with this money, you know, and kind of urging him to get in touch with the EFF so things can be done a little bit more.  I know a little bit more coordinated instead of random guy sets up GoFundMe page because it's a hot button topic.  You know, certainly wouldn't want that.  But anyways, that exists. And yeah, and I'm really happy that you found that, Jeff, the Popular Mechanics thing.  So, you know, I suppose the sky isn't totally falling that you can actually log into your ISP and have some sort of controls.  But it still doesn't feel very good.  But no one's going to do it. Well, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to make it difficult. It's fine print.  And, you know, in the old days, we got protected by government doing things like do not call this.  There should be, you know, there's talk about do not track, obviously, as an option in browsers.  But now your ISP just knows too much.  It knows it all. And you use incognito mode. Doesn't matter.  The ISP knows where you're going. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Incognito mode just makes it so that your browser on your computer shows little to no tracks.  But I mean, it's still passing through your ISP. And that's the point.  Encryption is another way that you can at least, you know, approach this run encrypted.  That doesn't affect your browser history, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't affect.  You still go into a site and the ISP knows where you're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it depends. It depends to be an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can use Google and then Google will know what you're doing.  So that's the other tradeoff.  And you can use the VPN, but then they can go to the VPN and see what's going on there.  Go to the beginning or the end point of VPN.  It depends. It depends who your adversary is here.  But yeah, the ISP becoming an adversary is kind of bad because they do have control of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And I'm sorry, Kevin, you're breaking up.  So we heard part of that, but I think we heard what we needed to on that point.  Yeah. Now it's actually a little bit worse.  It's a little bit.  Oh, it's Skype and it just got worse.  I didn't just Skype and I thought it was going to be better.  Yeah. Work on that in the back, on the back end.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another weird story that I forgot to put up.  Oh, sorry.  Did you see the blackest paint story?  No, I did not.  This is a fun one. So it's on the, it'll be there on the run down in just one second.  There it is.  Bottom of the rundown. Blackest paint, blackest black paint ever.  I saw it happening and I thought, oh, this is going to be a, this is somebody just fooling with us.  This is a, this is, I mean, within 12 hours I'm going to see this as a hoax, but apparently not.  It's a paint that's been around for a while.  And now it's a spray paint, Vantablack.  It traps, the spray paint traps 99.8% of ultraviolet visible infrared light.  And so there's pictures, which won't work on the, on the audio. Sorry folks.  But it looks like somebody just did a Photoshop of the photo.  It totally does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would, I would guess that this was here.  Wow, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that great? Then below there's a picture of a statue.  It's pretty impressive, isn't it?  It's a very small statue, one of which is painted.  And so it's useful.  There's, there's industrial uses for this.  If you, if you're making a telescope lens and you want to eliminate the reflection of light, you know, you need to do things like this.  But I just, I don't know why, but I found that, you know, it's like invisible man stuff.  You absorb light.  You're your own black hole.  Well, I wear black every day, so I just want to make clothes out of this stuff.  You can't see me.  Yep.  No one's going to see me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something about this that's so black.  It's like how much more black could this be?  And the answer is none.  None more black.  Spinal tap reference there for those of you who have never seen that movie, go see it.  But I mean, this is honestly, there is no story that is better for that quote than this story.  That is so weird.  That is so crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a little science moment here.  I like this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that.  Now I want that for my house.  I want to black out wall just because I could.  Oh, boy.  Let's see here.  What else we can wrap up with like one more thing before we go to go to a break and then do our picks and tips and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Andy Rubin's new phone.  Oh, yes.  Right.  A little bit.  You, Dr. Android, should tell us about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, so Andy Rubin, you know, he's he's working a lot of things post Google.  He's been in AI.  He's been in robotics, all this kind of stuff.  Well, now we're starting to hear about his next kind of stealthy startup thing called essential, I believe is what it's called.  And he tweeted out he tweeted out a couple of days ago a close up shot of a phone in a hand.  Don't know if it's Andy's hand.  Don't know if those designer jeans are Andy's jeans.  But we do have a hunch that that phone in his hand is probably part of his next project.  He says, I'm really excited about how this is shaping up, eager to get it in more people's hands.  And from what you can see, you know, talk about the year of no bezel.  This this thing has like I mean, pretty much no bezel.  It's not entirely eliminated, nor should it be really.  But it's pretty minimal what we're seeing here.  And I'm very curious to see what he's working.  He's the father of Android.  So I will always be curious to see what he's working on because I spend so much time obsessing over Android.  So that's why. But I don't know.  It looks interesting.  The rumors say that we might actually hear something by this summer about an actual product.  It's supposedly going to be a, you know, as they all want to be a competitor to the iPhone,  kind of a premium smartphone might have some 3D touch features.  I think I read somewhere that also that it would have some sort of a way to plug in hardware components into it  with like a proprietary connecting system of some sort.  So you can plug in like a spherical 360 camera or, you know, I don't know, maybe the modularity boat has said a ship has sailed at this point.  And this is a little late to the game if that's what this is touting.  But we don't really know much beyond that.  It's all kind of rumor in this little tiny corner Twitter shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But and Eric did say that it's going to be Android.  Yes. Any rumors for will run Android, which is which is good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, see, and I missed the Eric quote.  I just assumed because it was Andy was going to be running Android.  But that's that's good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I assume too. But but you know, who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. No. Hey, that's that's a good piece of additional information.  So I'm excited to see anything that he's working on if he if he created Android.  Hey, he's good in my book. He's a smart guy.  Oh, anything else?  I'm just looking over here real quick to see if we missed anything obvious.  And I think we might be good.  I think we may be pretty good. Yeah.  All right. How about you guys, Mr. Host, prepare yourselves for the tips, the numbers, the picks, the stuff, whatever they happen to be, depending on who we're talking to.  Before we get to that, let's thank the sponsor of today's episode.  This is yet another time during today's show where you will get very hungry because this episode is brought to you by Blue Apron, the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the country.  I love Blue Apron. We got our box yesterday and I think we have like a catfish sandwich as part of the box.  And I can't remember the other the other item, but we're going to be making one tonight.  That's for sure. Blue Apron's mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone.  Blue Apron delivers seasonal recipes along with fresh, high quality ingredients to make delicious home cooked meals.  And every meal comes with it's like a whole kit that you get in the Blue Apron box when it arrives on your step.  You get a step by step, easy to follow recipe card.  You get pre-portioned ingredients to match that recipe card that can all be prepared in 40 minutes or less.  And I've made a lot of these meals. They are solidly under 40 minutes,  which is great when you don't want to spend all night cooking in the kitchen.  If you happen to spend a lot of money, a lot of time at restaurants or high end grocery chains,  well, you're going to get something that spends where you're spending under $10 per person for a delicious meal with Blue Apron.  Not all ingredients are created equal, of course.  So it's important to know where your food comes from.  And Blue Apron sets the highest quality standards for their community of over 150 local farms, fisheries, and ranchers across the US.  And by shipping the exact amount of every ingredient that's required for a recipe, Blue Apron is reducing food waste.  You use it all. It all goes into the pot, so to speak.  Their freshness guarantee promises that every ingredient in your delivery arrives ready to cook or they'll make it right.  Blue Apron delivers to 99% of the continental US.  There's no weekly commitment, so you only get deliveries when you want them.  And you can customize your recipes every week based on your dietary preferences.  Choose from a variety of new recipes every week, or you can just kind of fly,  let Blue Apron's culinary team surprise you and see what they come up with.  And that's always a nice way to go because you end up with recipes that you may not have picked,  but that are equally delicious and you end up falling in love with them.  Recipes are not repeated within a year, so you'll never get bored.  So for example, a few meals, spinach and fresh mozzarella pizza with olives, bell peppers, and ricotta salata.  I'd eat that. Sweet and sour salmon with bok choy, carrot and ginger fried rice. I'd eat that.  Parmesan crusted chicken with creamy fettuccine and roasted broccoli. I'd devour that.  And baby broccoli and fontina paninis with hard boiled egg and arugula salad.  I would eat that too. This would be an amazing box.

Blue Apron is a better way to cook.  All right. Now that we're all hungry, let's get into the tasty morsels that are our picks of the week.  I don't know why I said that. Kevin, what do you got? What's some of your stuff that you've got today?

Transcript:  So I wanted to mention 100 Days of IndieWeb, which is the project that Aaron Parecki started.  And he's getting close to day 100 now. So he's got 100 posts where each day he's done something new and interesting for IndieWeb.  And I've been doing this for eight days, so I'm long way behind Aaron.  So each day he sits down and thinks about something he can prevent that improves the IndieWeb in some way.  And there's a bunch of really interesting tools and stuff in here.  So I want to call out a couple of things from this.  One of the most recent ones is a thing called Own Your Swarm,  which is a way to take your four square check ins and send them to your own site.  And you basically sign into your own site with Micropub. You sign into four square.  And then when you check in on four square, it posts it to your site.  So I think this connects to the location thing we were talking about earlier,  where the value of this is four squares actually does quite a good job of making it easy for you to check in your places and comment on them and mark them up.  And having that on your own site is an IndieWeb value and a useful thing to have as well.  So that's one example. Another example is the one I mentioned earlier,  which is the Give Me the AMP version of this bookmark that I made as part of my 100 Days of IndieWeb,  which basically adds to your browser thing.  And then when you're on a new site that's feeling slow, you click the AMP this link and suddenly the site becomes the clean, readable mobile version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice stuff. Yeah, I was wondering if you were going to keep the AMP bookmark lit for yourself, to be honest.  So it's nice to see that you can share it with everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a useful thing to have. There's a corresponding one that someone else made that switches from the AMP version to the canonical version if you want to get back to the original link as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice. Good stuff. And, you know, man, four square is just not a service that I hear of.  It's not a service that I've ever really used with any frequency, but we have not one but two four square mentions here at the end of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do. Funny, funny. This is Kismet, Kevin. So there was a piece of an entrepreneur magazine that came across my Nuzzle feed, which I found fascinating.  You know what, because we think four square, you know, four square. I saw somebody say on Twitter, Facebook the other day, four square is dead. What's next? Four square is nowhere. Well, no, not at all.  And I'm delighted because Dennis Crowley is one of the nicest entrepreneurs alive. He's a great, great guy.  And so it's a wonderful entrepreneurial story of the pivot where Dennis didn't know the value he had, that all of this check in data creates tremendous forecasting data for retail, for hedge funds, for anybody.  So the lead starts off that the CEO who Dennis replaced himself and went on to do strategic things in the company, he brought in a day to day CEO, was on CNBC and predicted that Chipotle comparable sales would fall 29 percent in the first quarter.  This is in the spring of 2016. He said, you know, how could you know that? How could you know that? And in fact, it did indeed fall 29.7 percent the year earlier.  That's because of foot traffic going into and out of and check ins of Chipotle.  And so, you know, it's a great story of Dennis having brought in Stephen Rosenblatt just to help the company. Rosenblatt came from, I think it was Apple, where everything was hidden.  And he said, they opened up the whole company to me. I saw everything you can see. It was amazing.  And then when I realized the value they had, they're sitting on it. He says, you got to sell this data.  And some of the people who were using the API said, yeah, we've been waiting for this day. We couldn't believe you're giving away for free.  Okay, we'll pay. And they made money that way. They had to change the culture of the company around not just making the consumer product, but starting to make the data.  And so now it's headed toward here's the number finally, 100 million dollars revenue and finally profitability.  And it's great to see a good guy like Dennis and his brother Jay win.  And it's great to see a company that is a great lesson for my entrepreneurial students about how you don't always know the value you have.  And I long when I wrote what will Google do, I argued that that AOL was Facebook before Mark Zuckerberg was shaving.  They just didn't know it. They didn't know what they had. And that's often the case. You don't know what your true value is, what your true company is.  So that was my four square number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, and then, you know, I mentioned earlier on, we were talking about dodgeball and latitude. So that that was Dennis too.  So way back when Dennis invented dodgeball, when he was IPT, I think, which was you were checking via SMS.  This was 2005, maybe. Yeah, I think it was around there.  Four, but some were around then. Long, long, long time ago.  But you were checking the places via SMS. You would say, I'm at this place. And then it would SMS your friends and say, Kevin's at this place.  And they built out this model of that. And then they got bought by Google and went there and tried to get Google to understand this concept.  But the challenge they had was that it only really works in dense cities.  You know, it's quite hard to do this stuff here in a rural area because there's nobody else around and you can't bootstrap it.  But they bootstrapped it in San Francisco, New York, and it was working well there.  And there were and we need to make this work everywhere. And they're like, you need a density of users you don't have yet.  And there was a lot of banging their heads against the wall.  And eventually, Dennis left and started Foursquare, which was reinventing this for the mobile world.  And they built an iPhone app and they still had a very lean web version that worked on every other phone in the world.  There was an M.Foursquare.com that was around for a long time. It made it very easy to check into places.  And then Dennis has sort of held on to this vision of it's a really powerful thing to keep track of this information for yourself and work out what that is.  So they've always had a searchable history. They've had a good API story for people.  They still have the best API for I'm at this place, you know, here's my phone.  Tell me where I am in a human readable form.  Their API for that is better than Google's or Facebook's still.  And it is free to developers up to a certain usage tracking thing.  So there's a lot of smart knowledge in the company.  And as you say, the challenge with all these things is how do we work out who is going to pay us money to support this?  Once we have this, once we've concentrated on building this, how do we support this?  And the foot traffic stuff, I thought, you know, that's encouraging.  That's encouraging. It's kind of weird, but because it's aggregated data, it's a reasonable thing to sell.  Saying, oh, the phone knows which shops you're going to is a bit freaky, but they provide utility for you with that.  And they applied the game thing with Swarm that I was saying we can pull back into your own site.  But the aggregate data is a useful and fascinating thing that doesn't make sense to you as an individual.  It makes a lot of sense to the companies who want to know about that aggregate data.  So I agree with Jeff. It's an interesting play.  It has and it has that sort of weird.  The thing I say about the geolocation stuff is it's the Harry Potter problem.  It's like what you want as a user is the Weasley clock, not the Marauders map.  You want to know that your family is safe and they're at home or at work or in mortal peril or whatever.  Whereas you don't want to have somebody who's able to see everyone in the world and where they're moving and what they're doing.  And Dennis has been very good at sort of walking the line between those two and making something useful here.  And I do like that we're able to build stuff around the API to pull this back to our own sites and keep that data personal as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fascinating stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The API is still free for small sites and small use. So you can still play with it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other data they have that's actually fascinating is they have a database of every small business in America and mostly around the world as well.  And I was always fascinated that they didn't do more with that.  If I was a sales rep who had to target a certain kind of business, Foursquare would give me those locations and tell me where they are and tell me who's rated them highly and lowly.  And they're very, very good at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have anything on Foursquare. Sorry. My tip has nothing to do with Foursquare.  It would be really great for the Whorpix section.  Swarm? You'll at least have Swarm.  I failed you guys.  If Swarm were a paid app and then ended up being Google Play's new free app of the week, maybe it would tie in.  But that doesn't even work.  I don't know if you knew this or not, but Google Play now has a new section, free app of the week.  It remains to be seen how awesome the apps are that end up in there.  I have not played Adventure Time, Card Wars, normally $2.99, now free for the week.  I think it turns around on Thursdays.  So you'll get a new, there will be a new free app of the week inserted every Thursday through the Play Store.  But hey, a way to kind of shine a light on some paid apps and save yourself some money.  I think at least right now developers, like Google's reaching out to developers to set up these deals, to feature them here.  And I don't think that developers are reimbursed for any of the installs in the way that I believe Amazon does with developers that are featured for free through their service.  I don't get that on the Google side yet, but I think they're kind of playing around with this.  They've done this, man, they did this like a year ago with educational apps or something.  I want to say there was like a Daniel Tiger thing that was normally a paid app and they featured it for free and they tried a couple of other things around that time.  So it seems like they're playing around with that again and possibly going to spend more time focused on featuring paid apps for free.  So I want to save a few bucks. There you go.  Check it out every week and see what they have in store for you there.  And who knows, maybe maybe Foursquare will end up there or a Foursquare related app that you would normally have to pay for.  But that, as they say, is that I think we've done good, you guys.  Thank you for for hopping on and talking Samsung and Google and privacy and all.  All in Foursquare. Really appreciate it.  Jeff Jarvis, of course, BuzzMachine.com, professor at the CUNY School of Journalism.  What are you working on these days? What do you want to tell people about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'll have something soon.  Oh, OK. I'm intrigued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's too bad we don't have that now, but I understand. I understand.  Maybe next week. I don't know. You're going to have to tune in to find out.  Shoot. That's right. It won't be on next week.  Oh, that's right. You're going to be out next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm on my way to Perugia for the International Journalism Festival.  Nice. Have a good time there.  I have lots of Cacio e Pepe. Just pasta, cheese and pepper.  Oh, that sounds good. I'm a little too in Perugia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds fantastic. Have a wonderful time.  I'm sure next week's show is in good hands and then you'll be back the following week.  Maybe you can pull the veil off of the secret then. We'll have to find out.  Also, Kevin Marks, of course, KevinMarks.com.  Really great doing another show with you, Kevin. Thanks for hopping on today.  Tell people what you want them to know about what you're working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to mention IndieWeb.org, which is the thing that I've been working for a while.  It is this movement to get people back to having stuff on their own sites again.  There's a continuous chat, a lot of code being built.  The 100th IndieWeb is part of that.  And also regular meetings in lots of cities around the world.  So go to IndieWeb.org and have a look at that.  See if it inspires you to build your own website and connect things to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fantastic. Check that out.  Again, Kevin, thank you. This is a lot of fun. Really appreciate it.  Well, I'm here. I work here at Twit. I'm on a lot of shows.  In fact, I'm going to do Tech News Today next.  So catch me on Tech News Today. That's where you can find me.  twit.tv slash TNT as well as all about Android here.  And find me on Twitter. I'm at Jason Howell.  Leo's back next week. So you'll have him sitting at the helm of this show then.  So expect him then.  Twig, of course, records every Wednesday at 1.30 p.m. Pacific, 4.30 p.m. Eastern.  And I believe right now it's about, what is it?  Oh, I have the wrong UTC time.  I don't think it's 20.30 UTC, but you probably know better than I do.  Join live at Twit. What is it? Help me. If you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was 21.30 UTC, I think.  Okay, so I was an hour off.  That was when we started.  Yeah, 21.30.  We did just change this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. It's very confusing.  But 21.30 is the new number.  Currently 11.18 p.m.  All right, which means that Kevin's going to get to sleep sometime soon.  You can join live, of course, if you want to catch it live.  twit.tv slash live. You can find the show on demand at twit.tv slash twig.  Just go there. All of our episodes. You can subscribe to our episodes.  Catch up on back episodes. Start with episode one.  Whatever floats your boat. It's all there.  twit.tv slash twig.  And I think that's all she wrote.  So we'll see you guys next week on This Week in Google.  Bye, you guys.
