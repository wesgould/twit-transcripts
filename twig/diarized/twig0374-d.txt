There is some Google in here,  but there's also Facebook, Twitter, and media and everything else. Jeff Jarvis' wide-ranging  intellect is part of the reason for that. Good to see you. Actually, when we start discussing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  obscure, you can look it up on Google. And that's why we call it this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we Googled the answers. He's at buzzmachine.com, writes many great books, teaches journalism to  those lucky kids at the City University of New York at the Tau. What is it? The Tau School?  Tau Night Center. Rockport Journalism.  Thank you for being here again, Jeff, because you were here on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was so delighted. Yeah, so as I'm sitting down in my family pizza, email comes in from Lisa,  help, we need guests. And so I said, yes, I'll be there in 10 minutes.  We had slurped the wine. Thank you.  And eat the pizza. No, I'm always honored to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had Ben Thompson in Taipei scheduled, and as you know, because the time difference is early  morning for him, and he just overslept. He slept through it.  Oh, is that what it was? Yeah, that's all. So he just like, Ben.  He felt bad, and we've rebooked him for next week, I think. But Kevin Marx is also here. He's in our  time zone down there in Silicon Valley. Good to see you, the champion of the open web, the indie  web, as he calls it. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And love it. I was thinking we could bring the Google  Assistant into the conversation and have it listening and suggest things as we speak about  them. If only it were that smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Lisa and I have a mutual joke. Every time,  now I've been using an iPhone since the iPhone 7 came out, and I try to use Siri. And every time  I use it and every time she uses it, and it comes back with a nonsensical answer, which is almost  every time either I or she will say, you have an unusual, what is it we say? I find your faith in  Siri distressing. Also with us, Danny Sullivan, the king at Search Engine Land. Always a pleasure  to have Danny. He's been watching Google since Google was just a little baby learning to walk.  Little tiny baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes I would give it a little poke and watch it fall over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you're so cute, Google.  Danny would change Google's diapers. He knows how he knows Google's poop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the stuff that comes out. Horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now Google is a behemoth. Bigger and bigger all the time. Last week, I guess  you probably talked about it on Wednesday. Google had its event, the October 4th event,  announcing all sorts of new products. Some wag said a copy of the iPhone, a copy of the Roku,  a copy of the Amazon Echo, and a copy of the Gear VR.  Oh, and a copy of the Eero.  Very funny.  I think it's funny. It is in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of true, but kind of not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, Google will add its own Google juice to it, which could be tasteful or tasteless,  depending. Or thoroughly disgusting, depending on your imagination.  But I do think it's interesting that Google looks like it's copying Apple a little bit.  A little bit of Apple envy has snuck in, in the sense that Google wants an ecosystem just like  those boys down the road in Cupertino. In fact, the weird thing... Well, I'll say one more thing  and let you talk, Danny. The really interesting thing is for the first time ever, Google has put  features in the Pixel, its phone, that are not available to other Android users, particularly  Google Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's not that they want an ecosystem suddenly. They've wanted an ecosystem  for a very long time. I think it's just that they're getting serious about the hardware,  almost in the same way we see Microsoft getting serious about hardware. I mean,  Microsoft pretty much didn't do hardware for the longest time, didn't make its own laptops,  do all that sort of stuff. And now we have Surface stuff and everything, because the old model was  you built the software and you partnered with other people and Google built Android on the  back of partnering up with other people. And to me, in a lot of ways, this was sort of like taking  the gloves off. Like, well, I mean, you guys can keep doing Android phones and everything if you  want and build your other devices, but we're going to build our own stuff. So, you know,  we're going to do everything from our own high-end phone to the Google Home voice assistant.  The interesting thing to me is going to be whether or not people actually buy it,  because to date they really haven't been that successful with selling the devices themselves.  And not that they don't sell them, but they just don't sell them in the numbers that people go,  ah-ha, Google's the number one, number two hardware seller. You know, it tends to be Samsung. So  will they actually sell these phones? And I've been watching the commercials, goodness knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're spending on the commercials. What was it? It was like 2 million,  what was a huge amount of money in the last 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they're dumping the money. But I'm like, I'm struggling to understand like what that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  commercial is telling me. Like those are the worst. Can I just say those are the worst commercials?  It's the ones with the frame and it's like, I'm trying to figure out what is that box? I can't see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what's behind it. It's terrible. My wife watched and I asked her, she goes, oh, that's clever. Oh,  they're taking the search box and they're turning it into, I don't know. That's what I thought too.  And I'm like, does that make you want to buy the phone? She goes, well, I mean, I guess maybe it  makes me think Google's more on the phone. Maybe. But, and I'm watching and I'm like,  I don't even know what you're getting. Whereas when they were running those ads for Google photos,  where the person's taking the picture and it stalls, it's like, oh, oh, out of room. You're like,  oh, that's a problem. I know I need to get that. Yeah, that was a good ad. That was direct.  So for me, the current crop of ads are just not expressing any reason at all why I think,  I agree with you. You know what? I shouldn't get the pixel. What would have been a good ad is if  you know, they were saying, get the pixel, it won't blow up in your face.  That would be very powerful. Our phones don't blow up.  What a feature. Now, now, you can tie explosive technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think there's a risk that Google might, I don't know, I see,  Microsoft's done this. Apple's never had to do this, but Google might hurt the OEMs by saying,  no, but we're going to make a phone that has capabilities. Yours cannot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't think they care about people's health.  Hold on, hold on, hold on. That's the thing. It's not really true either. It's been confirmed  more since. On Twitter, I asked whether I should buy the phone because the main selling point is it  has AI, it has assistant, but there's nothing in the hardware that makes that required. And one of  the stories, the rundown says, well, here's how you can put on assistant on any Nougat phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you root it, that doesn't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's not because there's a capability in the phone.  There's no physical hardware. That was your question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not like the Motorola thing, then. So the Motorola phones had the extra chip that was  listening all the time that let you do it at Google more easily. It's not bad.  It's not something like that. It's just that they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bought something different. But that's even more, but that is an even more aggressive thing. That  means they're actually keeping something out of the Android code base for competitive reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wouldn't be Android anyway. It would be in the other piece, right? It would be in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Google services. But even if you buy Google services for your handset, as Samsung, LG,  HTC and others do, you don't get it. We're not keeping it out. We're just doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a very limited launch at the moment until now. And it'll come to other providers and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure it will make it to... By the way, the ad spend, I understated it. In the last  two days, Google spent $3.2 million on those really bad ads for the Pixel and the Pixel XL.  That's actually not a lot in a tip. I don't think I've seen them.  That's one Super Bowl ad. They're not good.  You know what? You're not watching the baseball playhouse.  I don't watch TV anyways. You have to watch the baseball clips.  I'm not a real man. We've known that for a while, ever since the operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let's say you've been in this state where they're only running right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm kidding. Yeah. I love you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I need them to sink that money into some more native advertising and movies until I see a TV  show where on Agents of Shield, they're suddenly using all Pixel devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look how well that worked for a Windows phone. For a while, every TV show had a Windows phone in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now they don't know. I'd be working for Surface though. The hard thing with Windows  phones is like, why do you want to buy the Windows phone? What do you get around? But  with Surface, oh my goodness, I keep flashing back to Under the Dome when I'd never seen so  many Surface devices. I know. It's funny.  We just popped this thing up here. I just saw somebody, another show the other day,  I think it was Blackish where she was using her thing. The best thing was when she got done,  she flipped it down and then left the kickstand sticking up or whatever.  She was going to use it. It was like, how do I shut this to  indicate I'm done? It's not a laptop, so I don't quite know what to do. But we've got to close the  seat. I know, flip it down. But what about the kickstand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know ultimately why those product placements backfire is because they stand out like a sore  thumb because you never see anybody actually using those devices. So it's like, what are they using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Scandal, we had the Microsoft devices and I thought that was just, they're in this parallel  universe where we have Republican President and Microsoft won the phone wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It cracks me up. That's weird. What is that phone? It's so strange.  I can't imagine a product placement on Seinfeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was there? I don't think there was. Wait a minute, Serials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had a Mac. He had a Mac. He had an old Mac. One of those little.  She never used.  SC30 or something.  Yeah. And then of course, a brand named Serials. Lots of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that bike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think at that point, Apple wasn't paying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a bike in the back. Never used.  Apple never pays. That's Apple's, well, at least that's what they say.  Apple says, oh no, we don't have to pay. All we have to do is provide product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I have a group that spends time providing that product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Sorry, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they have a group that works with them to make it easier to film. So when I was there,  there was a chunk of work to actually make the screens right at the right framework for film  and things like that. So there was some, it's much easier now with those EDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call that playback and every TV show now has somebody who does that because designs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  screens and does the playback because Jerry, Jerry used Mac. I'm betting that the George had windows  and, and surprisingly, surprisingly Kramer new Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right. I want the Cosmo distro.  Yeah. All right. Let's talk about the note seven. This is sad. Today, the Wall Street Journal said  Samsung is discontinuing the note seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's done. Why do I have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got one and turned it in, of course, because I never got a replacement. And the real problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is there have been, why'd you want the notes having over the edge anyway? I have the edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But why would you want to know? Because it has a stylus and a bigger screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is it that much bigger of a screen? Yeah. Noticeably bigger. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it was advanced technology. And I think we're learning what New York Times had a very good  article, speculative somewhat saying even Samsung doesn't know why these phones are bursting into  flame. And obviously that's true. Otherwise their replacement wouldn't have also burst  into flame. There've been six cases in the US alone. The great, the great quote in there,  like it's so advanced we don't. The last line of the article scroll down to the bottom Karsten,  the last line of the article is the phone was, we rushed out a phone so sophisticated, even we don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know how it works. Which is what the people who do AI say. So I suspect that there's AI in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  deciding to show us. Here's the quote, Samsung seems to have packed it with so much innovation,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it became uncontrollable. Oh, that's gonna, that's gonna feed techno panic everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, this, you know, this happens every now and then Apple had a laptop exploding problem a  few years back, didn't they remember that? Didn't happen. No, Dell did. Dell Dell had

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  exploding batteries. I've never heard of Apple's having it. There was one way the batteries would  swell up inside. Only there was some way we could quickly check battery. Sorry, I was under the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  table or I would have responded. Yes. Apple did. Oh, yes. Yes. Apple did the swelling batteries. I  had one. Sony has done a recall. Dell has done a recall. Apple has had phones even burst into  flame, although it's been so rare that it hasn't had to issue a recall. It's a fundamentally  dangerous technology lithium ion. It is. But I feel so bad for, well, on the one hand, I feel bad  for Samsung, but on the other hand, if they didn't really understand what was going on in the inside  the battery, they obviously rushed it to get it out before the Apple iPhone 7, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I wonder if there's some kind of a software, you know, one of the nice things about the Samsung  is how quickly they'll charge with those fast chargers or whatever. And I don't know the degree  that that depends on the software that's monitoring how quickly you're throwing it in there, whatever.  But it was interesting to find out it wasn't just the battery. Like that was like, oh,  it's just wrong battery. We use a different battery manufacturer. And actually it looks  like it's something much more than that. So which makes me nervous for every other phone out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because it's some way the direction of, you know, somebody has a patent on something here that got

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  misused. You kind of want them to know what went wrong. I'm sure all these phones be perfectly fine,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  never kill us. But that's the thing is, you know, they did ship a lot of them and a small number of  court fires. So the challenge is working out, you know, testing them to find that case. I get the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  impression though, from the way that Samsung's doing this recall, including sending out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  special boxes to, you know, and the box says contains potentially explosive lithium ion battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not to be put on an airplane. And you have it has gloves in there. Now, maybe that's an  overabundance of caution, but it might all, but it certainly indicates that, you know, for a while,  they had an IMEI. They send you gloves. For a while they had an IMEI search where you could look  up the IEMI number and say if your phone was okay or not. They abandoned that. They realized they,  for a while, they thought the Chinese batteries weren't the problem. They abandoned that. And  they've now not only recalled every single Note 7, told everybody who has a Note 7, turn it off,  do not turn it on. And they're not going to make them anymore, which tells me they're still

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  baffled. They don't know what happened. That's scary. How can I turn it off if I haven't received

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my important protective gloves? They should say something like go outside, put on security theater

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and throw some gloves in there. That'll make it sound like we're really doing a good job.  Maybe, or maybe they really are. Look, if it's so dangerous to pick up your phone and put it into  the box that they have to send you gloves, then you can't even touch the phone in any way,  shape or form. Like you shouldn't have it in your house at all. Like you can't even touch it to turn  it off. I don't know. Unplug it with a pole or something, you know. They don't need the gloves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what's going on, kitty cat. I don't know what's going on.  It's a cat's trend and dial, hang on. Yeah. If your Skype suddenly disappears.  I feel bad for Samsung, but it's clear the Note 7 brand is dead. Maybe even the Note brand is dead.  Maybe even the Galaxy brand is dead. I mean, it's not going to impact Samsung because that's  mobile business, 5% of their business. Although I just saw that it's 2% of Korean exports. Korean  exports are Samsung phones. I've seen people say that this is going to kill the Samsung brand.  It's a bigger brand than that, but it's certainly not going to help the phone brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the Galaxy phone is a good phone. There are a lot of people that are using them  that are enjoying them. Yes. And so it's like I don't know that people are going to suddenly go,  well, I'm never going to buy my Galaxy again. If you've been using it, it's been working fine  and you never got the Note. And the number of people using Note is relatively small. So  you know, I don't know that this kills them. It certainly is a terrible black eye for them though.  Like, you know, this is not what you want to do when you're trying to expand against Apple.  But fortunately, Apple released a really kick ass new phone with a lot of great features that are so  different from the previous phones that we had that. Hey, it has the number one feature everybody's  looking for. It doesn't burst into flame. Well, that's it. That's what you. I agree with you, Leo.  A phone that does not kill you is so much better than the one that does. So much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We shouldn't mock this. I mean, at least half a dozen people have been sent to the hospital.  This is with burns and smoke inhalation. And apparently the gloves I'm being told now at  Gardner in our chat room are for people who are sensitive to these ceramic fiber paper  that this fireproof box is made of. Oh, okay. Okay. I can go with that. Because gloves aren't  going to protect you from flame and explosion. It's hard not to make a joke about this. And yet  there this is not a joking matter for Samsung. This is life or death for Samsung.  So much money. Well, and Google has to be thinking, well, we timed that pixel release perfectly.  The thing that is really true is that there's nothing like the Note 7 on the market. This was  a phone that really was differentiated by the stylus. The fact that it had a 5.7 inch screen  and in a body that was smaller than the five and a half inch screen of an iPhone.  They the it was a beautiful phone. It worked really well. I loved the Note 7. I think it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  absolutely the best. How long did you use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I don't know, like two weeks. When the first issues started happening, the initial thinking  was, oh, this is only the phones with the Korean battery. And mine had even though I got it from  T-Mobile had been made in China. And even the T-Mobile guy said, oh, you probably are right,  because it's made in China. So I wasn't in a hurry. But you know what, as more and more cases  happened, I thought, I'm not going to take a chance. And I got my money back. I didn't ask  for an exchange. I got my money back, partly because I was leaving the country. It wouldn't  have made it. Did it ever feel hot? Never. But the other reason this is a cause for concern,  we talked a little bit about this with Steve yesterday on Security Now. He's kind of a  polymath and expert on everything. And he was talking about lithium ion batteries. And  part of the reason this was of great concern to me is that many of these phones were not being  charged when they burst into flame. But what Steve said, which was interesting, is that doesn't  mean it wasn't the charging that was doing it. He said it's very possible that the charging itself  began a process, perhaps short circuited something that would then later result in  combustion, you know, hours later. But it was concerning for me that these phones were bursting  in flame, not when they were plugged in, but just when they were sitting in a pocket. That's really  not good. So just in case you are living under a rock, if you have a Note 7, Samsung is strongly  urging everybody, they will completely reimburse you. They will, you know, send you your money back.  They will send you a box. Best thing to do is bring it to the retailer, but if you bought it  online, they'll send you a box. They'll give you a credit, I had something like a $25 credit,  and turn it off immediately. Just turn it off right now and don't mess with it. And they've decided  not to make any more. Samsung has already cut $2.3 billion from its profit projections, which  wipe out the profits, the entire profits of the mobile business for that quarter.  Some analysts say the cost ultimately could go not only to $4 to $5 billion, but even more. In  fact, Samsung's share price has lost $21 billion. So we have to wonder, does that mean, is like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  will we get a Note ever in the future? I think not. That is a damaged brand. Or do you bring back the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do you call it the Galaxy Edge S? You call it Incombustible 9. You call it something completely  different. It's not related. And I think this is going to be a tough one for Samsung to come  back from. It's not like there aren't lots of other choices, just none of them with a stylus.  And the last phone that allows you to remove the battery, the LG G4, I'm sorry, G5,  is probably going to be a premium product. You can actually take the battery out.  All right, let's take a break. Actually, Samsung was in the Supreme Court on Tuesday,  arguing its case, it's against Apple. I guess what they're really debating is whether that half,  almost half a billion dollar judgment should, was too much. But it's over the design patent,  over the ability to make a phone that looks like an Apple phone. And Samsung already lost that case,  but the question is, should they have to pay so much money for it? I mean, tragically, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the courtroom case was disrupted because someone screamed, look out, it's got a note in his hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got a note seven. There was a great tweet this morning. I think it was Charles Arthur,  British journalist. I think it was his. It's just a quote. And I leave to my son,  a million pounds in currency locked in the vault with my Samsung note seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man. You know, you're in trouble when people are making jokes like that about your product.  Our show today brought to you by I love this luggage with a battery in it.  But actually, it's a great idea. This is this is a carry on from away away luggage. It's made with  a premium German polycarbonate. So it's very light, but very tough. This is a great carry on.  They also have a medium and large all of them less than $300. But what I love about this is  look under the handle. By the way, these are these are the kind of luggage I always get nowadays,  the four wheel, they roll in any direction. That's the only way to go when I see people kind of  walking down the the airport Carter with their luggage tilted because they only have two wheels,  I feel sorry for them. This is luggage, you just you just kind of push it with your finger and it  rolls along wherever you're going. But look under the handle here. This is awesome. There's a USB,  there's two USB ports. And you've got a 10,000 milliamp hour battery in this. Awesome. It's  TSA approved combination lock. It's built right in. He has inside a removable washable laundry  bag to keep dirty clothes separate from clean and a lifetime warranty and what a risk free 100 day  trial period. I love I love sitting in the airport with my phone plugged into my carry on.  Because I if I need a little juice, it's got it. And the thing is, this such lightweight luggage,  it is does not is not feel heavier in any respect than my what I was used to use as a carry on.  This is just great. Let me unlock it here. It's got the TSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Open it up, Leo. So we had one of the founders of away on.  dot zero dot NYC. And they really they reengineered as they go to the stuff inside,  they really thought through how to canter close down. Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's very to me, the inside of carry ons is just as important as the outside.  And they've got all the little features I like, including this zip expandable bag,  because that's where I put all the wires, right? All the chargers and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most people put their underwear there, but you put the wires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what that's for? I don't know.  I figure I always figured for electronics. They also have and this is also this is the  compartment where you put your underwear where it has the zip. It's hard for me to show this.  I guess we don't have the over the shoulder shot today. But this is awesome. Anyway, away luggage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're a New York City startup. Yeah, I think it was I think one of the  founders was Warby Parker. Oh, yeah, you're right. That's right. That's right. That's right.  And so they really bring that kind of experience of looking for something that needs disruption.

I had a bag,  bag room. Yeah. I have a bag room now. I do. Yeah. That's interesting. Pens, watches, bags.  I don't know what it is. There's something. I really need to come up. We need to bond.  We should, we should do a bag thing. My wife just hates my bags, hates that I have them.  Well, you know, I'm of the Johnny Jett persuasion where if you can not check bags,  you're better off. Oh, amen. And of course they have bags that you, you, you can check,  but this is a carry on with all the features you want, including the longest you've ever gone.  I'm just on the carry on Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that means that you can put more in there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm all,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  all about the air squeezy thing. And I use little tiny, you know, when you, when you, when you,  when I luckily left to fly business class and you get the giveaway thing and has that little tiny  toothpaste thing, you'd be surprised how many days you get out of one of those. So you don't need to  carry tons of liquids. A little dab will do you on a lot of these things and never carry shampoo  because the hotel, all that kind of stuff. Great advice. Great advice.

Transcript:  a regular on the radio show is also, you know, like you, he's like, how, how far can I walk? Can I go  without? All right.  This just in.  Yeah. Okay. A little behind the scenes thing here. I apparently in spinning that four wheeled  spinner luggage around, which I like, what I neglected to note was that I had a cup of tea  sitting right there. The floor. Well, the floor will absorb it.  It's my clothes. The computer's fine. Oh, mostly it's my pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you're a pro though. You kept going. Oh, hey, you didn't take a beat. Oh no, no, not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I stopped for nothing. No, actually kind of excited. I mean, this is a, this is a,  this bag is awesome. So it is, it is. They are great. I, you know, if you like to try, here they come.  Who's got the mop? All right, we got it. It's all that's no, that's good. It's fine.  I only spilled one cup.  I'm more sad about the tea than anything else. All right. Yeah. Let's, let's talk about Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What from one side to another?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's not. Is it an unreasonable for me to blame?  Is it? No. Why?  I guess you're right. I just, is it unreasonable for me to blame Marissa Meyer for this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, she is the CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For two years, they knew that the entire password user database was hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For two? I thought they didn't know for, I thought they didn't know for some amount of that time.  I thought it happened two years ago, but then they didn't know. Is that they knew for two years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now that's a good question. I'm quoting Steve Gibson yesterday.  Let me see if I can find the story.  They certainly knew for longer than they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought there were two shocking things. One, how long they didn't know.  And then two, how long they knew and didn't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, to be fair, it was the don't ask, don't tell policy.  They were not aware that if you didn't ask them whether or not you thought your password had been  somehow vulnerably hacked, they felt they shouldn't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know how, okay. How long did Yahoo know? Does anybody know about the hack?  That's only half of the story though.  Because then the government came to them. Now, again, in their defense,  they had fought government orders before and lost.  And once that FISA court says it's okay, it's pretty hard to convince another court to say no, no.  However, they not only did not fight it, they complied in an egregious fashion,  completely bypassing Alex Stamos, who is now at Facebook, interestingly enough,  and his entire security team to put what was effectively a root kit.  We had initially heard that, oh no, we just modified the anti-spam filter to look for the  signature the government was looking for. No, no, it was a root kit. And in fact,  when Stamos and the security team saw it, they thought they'd been hacked.  And then the guys on the other side said, oh, no, that was us.  So let me see here. Yahoo, this is Fortune.  Yahoo is under fire over cyber hack timeline. On Friday, Yahoo face pointed questions about  exactly when it knew about the cyber attack that exposed the email credentials of half a billion  users. The largest hackable, bigger than MySpace, bigger than Ashley Madison, half a billion users.  It has not provided a clear detailed timeline yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But as soon as the deal with Verizon is complete, and they're done with the audit, they'll be happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to release that. And Verizon, by the way, has already asked for a billion dollars off, but  I think it could be possible it could scotch the whole deal. I'm sure this is enough cause  yeah, to see enough cause for them to get out of the deal without any penalty. Yahoo CEO,  Verizon CEO says they're evaluating whether the Yahoo hack had quote material impact and quote,  this is in the Wall Street Journal. Rich, Rich Blumenthal, a Democratic Senator from Connecticut  says as law enforcement and regulators examine this incident, they should investigate whether  Yahoo may have concealed its knowledge of this breach in order to artificially bolster its  valuation and its pending acquisition. The Financial Times, which is reliable,  said last week that Marissa Meyer knew of the breach in July.  So maybe they didn't know for two years, but she knew many months before it was revealed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I say, Leah, one of the reactions that came off of this and Snowden, I think was one of the  people who said it as well is like, delete your account and good luck trying to do that by the  way. No, I, you know, you can delete your account. I just wouldn't recommend you do that. I would go  in, I would delete your emails. I would take out all the stuff you need to have. I would empty your  trash and clear it all, but you also have to remember that Yahoo recycles emails. Yes. So  when you delete your account, if it was, you know, whatever Leo Laporte at Yahoo.com. Good guess.  That's exactly what it is. Right. So you delete that and then in a, you delete it. And in a few  years, potentially someone else comes over and gets that name. And if you've left that link with  all your accounts now, Yahoo, and I guess Facebook does the same. They, you can look it up when this  was getting more closely examined in like 2014, they apparently have systems that are designed to  see like, Oh, I'm getting an email, but we've never seen this before. Let's not send it. Cause  that was probably for the old person or whatever. But, you know, at this point, do you really want  to trust Yahoo's algorithms and Yahoo's got all this safety for you? I think you'd be much safer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to just hibernate the account. Yeah, you're right. And Danny, years ago, Yahoo just killed my email

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  address. Oh yeah. They announced that they were do that. If you, if it was left fallow for any

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  irritated the hell out of it, they'd get recycled and I had nothing to do with it. Cause say it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo mail, but, but not notified nothing. So you need to check in once in a while. What I did is I  changed my password and turned on two factor, which you can do. And that should be sufficient  to protect you. The thing that's really scary is yes, the passwords were hashed. We don't know how  well or whether they were salted, but the secret questions were in the clear and secret questions  are, you know, it's huge vulnerability. It's a, first of all, I hate secret questions. Yes.  And people use the same secret question, the same secret question answer all the time. So that is  it. Yeah. What's your favorite? What, what, what, you know, what streets did you grow up on? What  was the name of your first pet? Yeah. I recommend if, if, if companies insist on secret questions,  a screw them. Cause that's the worst security flaw ever. And B don't use real answers, use  passwords in effect, random, you never remember them. No, and put them in your last pass, your  password manager, put the question and answer question answer. You have to do that otherwise.  Well, I'll give you an example. So starting with El Capitan, Apple has allowed two factor on  Apple accounts. Damn straight. I'm going to use that. So I, I get home and I'm going to turn on  two factor and it said, okay, what street did you grow up on? Okay. I put what I think was right.  Who was your best friend in high school? When did I set these up? I don't remember this. I couldn't  figure it out. Couldn't figure it out. Finally, I had to call Apple and said, you have to reset  these. I don't know what the answers are. And they then verified my identity in several, frankly,  not very good ways, but, and to their satisfaction and cleared the questions. So then I log in again  and say, okay, good. Now I want to put on two factor authentication and says, sorry, you can't  your account's been significantly changed. You have to wait. And the first it said three days,  then it said 30 days. Now I understand the delay because if a hacker gets in your system,  they're going to change things like that. So you can't recover it, but 30 days.  I, I, this is offensive. Now I have no secret questions, no two factor,  and I can't do anything about it for 30 days. What if I'd been hacked?  Stop secret questions. Stop the insanity. And, and frankly, I have to think Yahoo knew before  they revealed it. There's lots of evidence, no, no smoking gun, but the head of security who  had left said, we think they knew he ran it. A guy named Jeremiah Grossman, who was head of security.  He's currently had a security strategy at InfoSec, but he ran security for Yahoo until 2001. He said,  I also don't think that the claim that the attacker was state sponsored makes any sense  because state sponsored hackers don't usually go then to sell the data on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unless they're trying to make it seem like they're not a state-sponsored hacker,  and that's designed to throw you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo did not encrypt the security questions. Some are readable in plain text.  Just hope you didn't use the same security questions and answers somewhere else.  That's depressing. So bad. Yahoo really has gone from one of the pioneers of the internet to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it passed that stage long, long, long ago. Did it? Did it? Yeah. All right. Yeah.  Yeah. I don't think, I think I agree with Danny. There's not too much cause for wistfulness here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not anymore. And what makes me sad though, is I had some respect for Marissa Meyer. Now I'm  starting to think, maybe she really did not do a good job there. All right. Danny looks like he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  getting ready to put on fighting gloves. I can't even see myself. What are you wearing? It's my PBS

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  USB key thing. Oh, it's a wrist. It's a bracelet. USB key. Yeah. I got it like it. You got it from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  PBS. Kids got it. You wear it. Don't accept USB keys from strangers. Don't you know anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, it's PBS. How could that be bad? Look, it's fine. It's got a little smiley kiss. It's PBS

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  kids. There's nothing wrong with that. Do not plug that in any machines. So while we're talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about security, can I bring up something? Yes. It's all good. It's okay. Go ahead. So the,  the WikiLeaks latest Podesta hackers, there's a few links up. There's Zeynep Tufeski,  Glenn Greenwald, Nick Confessori from the New York Times. There's been some interesting discussion  online about journalistic standards with these kinds of leaks. And, you know, the general  journalistic view is, hey, if it's out there, it's all fair game. It's journalism, Sony hack,  Podesta hack, whatever. Let's go mining. Let's go find stories. That's what we do.  But things have changed from the time that that kind of ethic arose. One, a hell of a lot more  is stored in ways that can be stolen. Two, a lot more is stolen at scale. Three, there are national  agents like North Korea and Russia doing the stealing. And so the question I have for you all  is, does journalism have a culpability here for creating a demand? Let me explain that real quick.  So if you're Reuters or the Associated Press, and there's a really dangerous war zone,  they decide not to buy any freelance material whatsoever because they don't want to create a  demand that would send freelance journalists into danger. They recognize the creation of demand as a  responsibility. So in this case, every time media crams onto this stuff. So for example, Epicurious,  the food site, used part of the Podesta hack or not hack, not the word, the Podesta theft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Don't tell me. How could Epicurious...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tips on good risotto.  From Podesta's emails.  Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure who it was from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, by the way, the irony of all this. And I agree with you. This is a larger conversation  we should have. But the results of these leaks are the tamest things I've ever heard of. Hacked  emails. Here's the intercept. Show Hillary Clinton repeatedly praised Walmart.  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What else?  Well, it probably was in a speech for Walmart, I would guess, but I'll have to read that for  the smoking gun. Behind closed doors, Hillary Clinton sympathized with Goldman Sachs over reform.  Okay. That's a bad one. I thought Glenn Greenwald wrote an interesting article,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which we'll talk about. Goldman Sachs was the gold standard of the finance industry for many,  many, many, many years. It only became besmirched fairly recently in history.  So it creates this kind of demand. And Zena Tufesky, who's brilliant, absolutely amazing,  also points out that this causes a problem for people who are dissidents with even greater fear  that there's a market for hacking and theft and exposure, and that innocent people are going to  be brought into this more and more and more. That's a good question. And then just let me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ask you as a professor of journalism about the journalistic ethics. Is there an ethical  behavior when it comes to using material gained illegally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The standard has always been as long as you did not participate in that legal activity to get it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fair game. So when Gizmodo gets an iPhone that was, let's say, stolen, that's okay. If they pay for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the iPhone... If they took part in that... In a way, that makes you an accessory, right? You're  paying for it. If they caused it, if they caused the theft to happen, if they motivated it... So  after the fact... That creates a demand too, but yeah, it's a little bit different. So the first  standard is, because otherwise Pentagon Papers was illegal, Snowden was illegal. Leaks are always,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or not always, but often illegal. They're often illegal. So we can't have that standard that if

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's illegal. So what Zena proposes is a standard that says that there's national concern about  this, that it's truly a scoop. It's a scandal. Is there a scandal line? So in the case of the  Sony hack, which is another great example, there were all kinds of things that were juicy and  fascinating, but that we really didn't have a right to know. There wasn't any... That was also,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we believe, state-sponsored by... It's nice to talk about you're going to do that, but it's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  laughable. I mean, I'm on meme-a-random like every day, if not every hour, which is like the  political version of tech meme. And there are publications on there that I've never heard of  that, but are known in certain circles, both left-wing and right-wing, and they're going to  publish whatever they want. So then the New York Times could decide, well, we're not going to  publish this because it was in this thing or whatever, but that doesn't mean someone else  isn't going to pick it up. And ultimately it will turn into a news story if it turns  out that it's a big enough thing. So if... Okay, so two things about that then.  Like, hey, I have risotto recipe and they hate risotto and they're going to publish it.  Maybe nobody really cares. It doesn't pick any legs, but if it does pick up some legs, then that  becomes an issue. Yeah, well, there's two things there.  I just don't know that you get to put all that stuff back into the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know that you get to put... You don't. You don't. But so two things. One is  there's a Trumpian argument there. Well, if everybody else is doing it, then what stops  me from doing it? Right? If everybody else has locker room talk, then I'll have locker room talk  too. That's a seventh grade kind of argument, I think, that doesn't hold water. And second,  that yes, obscure sites can publish it, but the New York Times unquestionably brings a lot more  attention to it. CNN brings a lot more attention to it. They do have a responsibility to that line.  So that's where we go to Zaynab's standard. If it's a scandal, and one can argue it's a scandal,  for example, American government spying on its own citizens without real permission is a scandal.  And so that deserves to rise up. So the question is, should responsible news organizations hold  themselves to a responsible definition before they choose to join in the revelations that were stolen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say you now, Mr. Sullivan. I think the definition should be you cover things that you  think have a substantial public interest in being covered. Okay, good. Which does not mean  risotto recipes. No, I mean, what do I care about a risotto recipe? But I mean,  on the other hand, with Epicurious, it's like, if I were Epicurious, I'm like, see, there's a risotto  recipe. It's kind of funny. Oh, it is kind of funny. And it's not that sensitive. It's not like  I'm revealing his nude photo doing risotto or whatever, right? Well, there should be a standard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of a public's, the public interest. I mean, I'm sure that that standard, that's part of the standard,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right? Yeah, the public's need a right to know. No, it's no, the view kind of is that if it's  interest is very broadly defined, would somebody be interested in? No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that wouldn't. No, that's not what I mean by public interest. That's the standards being used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's too bad. Should the public know this? Yeah, I think that's the higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, see, I would hold it to a higher standard that it has to be something that like the Pentagon  papers that the public has a need to know or a right to know because I don't which I don't think  risotto recipes count. But I think I think Hillary any any entanglements that Hillary  Clinton has with political donors absolutely satisfy that standard. Then but then there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the additional no if well, just just throw it out here. If you have the Russian government  enabling tax, that's what I'm about to that's what I'm about to throw in the other. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what I'm about to throw in. Then there's the additional calculus that you have to make.  Is this a foreign government trying to impact our election? But I don't I don't think that  that's the responsibility, let's say of the intercept to make that decision. I don't think  I think the provenance that you're saying they should they should consider the provenance of the  information, not the legality, but the provenance of the information where who got it and what their  intent was. That's what I'm asking. I don't think they should consider that. I think they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  need to look at the information. If you go back to Epicurious, the reason that they are running that  article had nothing to do with a public interest thing. It had everything to do with SEO and can I  get a lot of course, the headline is WikiLeaks October Surprise. So someone's someone's and then  it's colon you can't rush risotto. So there's someone going, Hey, there's a lot of people  interested in WikiLeaks in this October Surprise, probably trending on Google. How can we tap into  it? Let's go ahead and do this. Right. And it's and it's cute and it's clever that they found it  or whatever. And they've come up with it or whatever. But you know, all that all that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  designed to do. Yeah, that's fine. I don't I think that that's Yeah. But I think there is this larger  question of whether, let's say the intercept or the Washington Post should consider not merely  the legality, we've we've settled that they don't that's that that's not an issue. The provenance,  who got it and and then the intent, why the intent of the and I think they do not need to if the if  they can verify that the material is real, that would be important because there's some concern  that maybe the Russian they did not I don't think so but there's some concern the Russians might have  modified this. Yes. And apparently they did not. WikiLeaks, by the way, says no, that's one of the  things we very want to be very clear about. I'm not exactly trusted in Assange. Assange apparently  has an agenda too. But okay. But I don't think that the intercept of the Washington Post should  consider the agenda or the provenance of material. They don't have to consider the legality of it.  They're being they're being manipulated. So what if the information is what matters?  Not the other. No, but doesn't matter. The information is what matters.  And if they look if somebody handed you something incriminating about a presidential candidate,  if you're not going to consider whether, you know, NBC or the Washington Post had a secret agenda  revealing the Billy Bush, Donald Trump tape, you're going to consider the content of the tape,  and it's important for the American people for your readership. That's what's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're going to I think you're also going to look at things overall. If you have somebody  who decides every single day they're going to do a press conference, and there really is nothing  new in that press conference, other than, hey, every time I do a press conference, you guys will  come cover it. At some point, if you're a news organization, you might just say, you know what,  it doesn't matter what the content of the individual press conference is,  we think we're being played. So we're just not going to cover the press conferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, if you define Chuck Schumer, the Senator of New York, every Saturday or every Sunday, he  holds a press conference, and dutifully the TV stations come out. Well, I would say, I would say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  here's the here's the standard is, is the information of interest of import to our audience.  If it is, then if it's every Saturday, it's every Saturday. But the standard it has to rise to is,  this has to be important. I don't think you should. Here's one of the reasons I think you  should consider intent. It's so hard to measure intent. That that is a really difficult thing to  know. That's that's, you know, why we have a criminal justice system and advocacy and juries,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because intent is very difficult to determine. I measure intent all the time as a journalist.  I get press releases that are sent to me where you can tell they're just sending you out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  press release. Yeah, but if there were information there that was of interest and important. No,  no, that's but that's what I'm saying is all you should read all you should need to do is say,  is there information that my audience should or needs or know to know, not once necessarily,  but needs to know. And it doesn't matter then how it came to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but there's I hesitate to use this word because it's misused all the time of balance.  And I don't mean balance in terms of false balance. But there is a point at which all the leaks  are aimed to destroy one side and we end up playing along with that. And in the end,  is there an informed public becomes a standard too. And the public is hyper informed about that  guy's bad stuff, but not at all informed about that guy's bad stuff, which we also know is there,  but we can't get a hold of because the Russians didn't leak it. The North Koreans didn't leak it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then we're doing an imbalance job. And you should redouble your efforts to find that other stuff.  Fine. Easy to say. Well, wait a minute. You're saying that if there's a smoking gun in those  documents, if Hillary Clinton said, thank you for your hundred thousand dollars, I'm going to make  sure that your interests are protected by me and the White House. That would be and you wouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  release that. That is very, very hot. No, if the standard is that high of true scandal. Yes,  that is passed. It's this layer below this is, well, that would be of interest. Yes,  they should know that. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Well, admittedly, those are judgment calls at that  point scandal and risotto. Yeah, somewhere between scandal and risotto. Yeah, but I think the line

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  should be the line should be judged by its import, not by its provenance or the intent of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  provider. That's my only point. I just, I just think it can be a factor. Well, admittedly, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what you do and what you do is you do a sidebar that says, by the way, this material came  to us, we believe and the federal government believes from the Russians who, according to this,  this and this have an interest in the election going in a particular way. They just played us  like a violin. And well, you should say that as a sidebar, but it doesn't mean you should sit on  the material. I think the more I think you got to trust the public and you got to give, you cannot  sit on material information. You cannot, regardless of its source. You know, I'm, we're doing a reverse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo here. I believe this one, this one I'm serious about. Usually it's the opposite role playing here.  All right. I'm trying to press this question and see where are these things. What do you think?  Have I made my case? Yeah, no, no, no, you have, but it's still troubling because we in media can  cause demand that Putin can know how he can play us and anybody who cooperates can play us. And  we play to a script and we, we end up being their pawns. I mean, to some degree, but to some degree,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you already like, you can go to any number of sites. Even our own side will say, there's got a,  got a tip. Let us know. I've read articles on leaks and they're like, if you have secret emails,  send them on to us. You have, you have journalistic organizations ask and this isn't even new.  You find some source to leak you some things. Anytime you get these people in Washington that  are like an unnamed source who we cannot name because they weren't able to disclose this,  i.e. they weren't supposed to talk about it at all. That's, that's the nature of, of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's a source that's called a deep throat. So, you know, I, I, you know, I, I get what you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  saying. I still think the public interest thing is the thing you look at, but you weigh all these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  factors. It's not a perfect world. I agree. The other factor that occurs today that's different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  from 10, 20 years ago is to state the obvious to for our audience, there's huge amounts more  data that is now stored and stealable and stolen than was ever possible before.  We didn't have 50, you know, 10 years of emails stored before. Yeah. No technology changes  everything. Absolutely. And so the vulnerable part of what Zainab's point is, I think that the  vulnerability of more and more people, people who wouldn't have been vulnerable for now, anyone who  has their email on Yahoo could be vulnerable to things being exposed about them. And if that person  is doing something that, that if they are a person at risk for some reason, then they are now at a  multiple of risk versus you or me or other privileged people. No, and to answer your original

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  question, I think you, it, one must be very careful not to incent a dangerous behavior. And I think  the tech tie in on this has to do with the discovery of exploits and flaws in software.  You've got to be very careful on Apple, for instance, been very careful not to pay  until recently bounties for exploits because they didn't want to encourage people to find exploits.  Right. They wanted, they, they, they wanted to minimize that risk, but once there was already  this marketplace for exploits, Apple saw, Apple had to participate. And in fact, the dollar amount  now to be paid for exploits has gone up to $2 million in some cases. They're that valuable. If  you have a zero day that can unencrypt an iPhone worth $2 million and there has the moral hazard  there is now you really are getting a lot of people going out and looking for these flaws.  I think on the, on the one hand, that's not a bad thing since they do, if they do exist,  we want to root them out. The bad thing is that they often don't get given to Apple. They're  given to some state actor to use against dissidents and that's terrifying. Good article,  by the way, and a good article, by the way, and then we'll move on because this is, but what did  you think of Glenn Greenwald's article in the democratic echo chamber? Inconvenient truths are  cast as Putin plots. He's actually being very critical. Yeah, this is, but this is a very

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  complicated story because this is also where Kurt, Kurt, I can wall it's all about. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I felt like those two were just having a little fight back and forth. And I didn't want to read

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it, but I read it and because I thought it was my duty to read it and understand Glenn's point.  And I think Glenn does have a point. Did you also read that can walled piece

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in response? Yes, of course. Well, actually no, it was, I think I actually wrote the first,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the first one. Yes, I did read. That's in fact why I read. I didn't want to read Glenn's piece  because I liked Kurt's piece so much. I like Kurt's vision of the world. First piece had such a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  confusing headline on it. Like I'm like, what, what? It's like, he says, he says, he says,  I am not Sidney Blumenthal. What? Yeah. All I needed was a thing saying, hey, they're saying  soon Sidney Blumenthal says this, but he didn't say it. They're just quoting my story. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's saying the Russian news agency Sputnik, I know, but then it misinterpreted one of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  WikiLeaks emails. They got a heads up and all this other speculation that comes in. And it seemed  like Glenn was coming and saying, well, all this other, and it's like, can we get back to the main  point that was undisputable? You, someone quoted something that was not from Sidney Blumenthal  that got stated as if it was, let's just clear that up. That's all we need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Glenn was concerned, I think about the veracity of WikiLeaks being challenged. And in fact,  Eichenwalde wasn't directly doing that. So it got, that got all, Danny, you're right. It got all then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mixed up. He's clearly not, he's clearly not happy with a lot of the suggestions that this wasn't  like, I think everybody's fairly certain. And I think, I guess Clinton at one point said, yes,  these were real emails, but it was this whole, let's play it up as if we don't confirm it.  Then we don't have to acknowledge if they were that or whatever, because you clearly have this  bad blood now between WikiLeaks and the Clinton campaign. Oh, what about-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's not new. I mean, Assange said months ago, I hate Hillary Clinton and I want to do  everything I can to defeat her. So that's, that's nothing new at all. He sees her as a hawk and a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  warmonger. And, and- But there are also sort of modified versions of the emails going around as  well. Are there? I'm not sure, I'm not sure any press byline has done them, but there's definitely  variations on a theme being circulated that Snopes is flacking up continuously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, yeah, exactly. Thank God for Snopes and Pulitzer fact and all these other fact-checking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  organizations. Yeah, but I mean, you might, that you may be seeing what's emerging. The next thing  is like the anti-leak. It's like, if you have a leak and then you get the polluted data out there,  either deliberately polluted or whatnot, then people don't even know what to believe anymore.  And then suddenly the whole idea that we have a leak, you can't even know if you want to trust it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we're really seeing- I don't know whether this is tech news or not,  but breaking news is that the CEO of Wells Fargo is resigning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good. Rightly so. Of course, he was castigated by, who was it that yelled at him in the college?  Elizabeth Warren. Yeah, I thought so. Elizabeth Warren.  God lover. Said, how dare you? He was of course, the CEO at Wells Fargo when they incented or  somehow encouraged their employees to basically steal from their customers by creating fake  accounts without their knowledge, things like that. Good. He should, he should. We got to start  seeing some of these guys take the fall for this really reprehensible behavior. So few of these.  Good. Stumpf. You might say he's been stumped. He's been stumped. Let's take a break.  Do you want to talk about some other tech stories? I'm sure there are some.  Oh, I know what I want to talk about. Twitter. Oh, that. Great, great article about what's going  to happen to Twitter, I thought. I'll tell you when we come back. How about that? Stay tuned.  I want to tease. He's just teasing you. I hope it survives.  I hope it survives. Really? I hope it dies a miserable death.  So we can talk about that too. We had that discussion two weeks ago.  Oh, I have it every week it seems. No, I, you know what, I, I, I've maybe modified my status,  standing on Twitter, but just because it's so fun to read Twitter during this election campaign,  it's, it's full of information, but you don't need an account to do that, right? You could  read it. And I think maybe that's the best way to consume Twitter. If you haven't made an account,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't. Well, it's, well, we'll get back to that because that's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it? You can't just read the timeline. Oh yeah. Cause you need to choose who you're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  follow. Don't you? And that's part of their failure, which is why they probably need to  just make it so you can consume the news, which might be part of why we're getting the new explorer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tab breaking news. We can come back. Stand by for news. Hello Americans. Time to talk to you.  About news. So many of you I know, listen to our shows to learn about products, how technology can  help you get your job done. Here's one you really got to check out. You've, I'm sure you've heard  about Basecamp. Everybody knows about Basecamp. I love Basecamp. I am a huge fan of Basecamp.  Going back to Jason Fried and David Hannah Meyer Hansen. David wrote Ruby on Rails to create  Basecamp. The company was originally 37 signals. They renamed themselves to Basecamp. Basecamp is  the best way to get teams on the same page, to have people working together, communicating together.  And they've just done the third iteration, Basecamp 3, taken everything they've learned from,  it must be almost a decade now of Basecamp and put it in the new version that's great. Basecamp,  what is it? All right. It's a private secure space online where teams can stay organized.  They can discuss everything they need to get a project done. It's so much better than email or  chat or messaging because you've got all the tools in one spot, message boards, file storage, to do's,  chats, schedules, automatic check-ins. It's all in there. It's perfect for internal collaboration.  But you know what's great about Basecamp? You can also invite clients in and control what they can  see. So you still have your private space, but clients can see what they need to see on an ongoing  project, something you're working on for them, which is really great. Over a hundred thousand  companies use it, but I think a million companies should use it. That's my goal right now is to get  you and your company to use it at basecamp.com slash twit. And it says to sign up for a free  trial, but can I tell you, there are no per user fees. They don't charge you by the seat. You can  add as many people as you need inside and out of the company without worrying about licenses and  seats. Anybody who needs to use it can use it and you don't pay a penny more. And you're going to  love their straightforward, all-inclusive pricing. Look at this, $29 a month. That's it.  For internal teams, if you want to use it with clients, $79 a month. That's it.  No matter how many users. That's it. So I'm not talking a big expenditure here. And you can try  it without even paying that just to see. Last week, 8,757 companies got started with Basecamp 3.  Let's make it 8,758. This is going to really change the way you face the workday.  You can set up your own work notification schedule. So notifications. This is, this is,  I was talking to Jason Fried. I love him. I don't know if you've read his books,  rework and so forth, but he really thinks about how work gets done. And we were talking about  how the problem is now work is 24 seven. I said, I don't want something. He said, no, you know what?  You set your work hours in Basecamp and you can say, I'm not working. Don't bug me till I get,  go to work. So you're back in control of your projects. Makes your workplace calmer,  more productive for everyone. I love it. You're going to love it too.  Basecamp.com slash twit. Make sure you go there so that they know you heard it here  and you could try it for free. Basecamp.com slash twit. It solves so many problems. You know,  this was the problem we had when you start out and you're small, it's easy. You got 10 employees,  five employees. Everybody can talk to everybody else. And then there's a point, I think for us,  it was around 20 employees where it doesn't, you, you suddenly things start to spin out of control.  You don't know who's doing what and you need a way to kind of bring it all back in. And Basecamp  is such a good solution. Basecamp.com slash twit. It'll solve, it'll take the pain out of it for you.  So Twitter, Disney's not going to buy it. Google's not going to buy it. Apple's not going to buy it.  Increasingly doesn't look like Salesforce is going to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you should buy it for the brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I could afford it and actually if the stock price keeps going down, maybe I will.  Who is going to buy it? I read a great article today by a finance guy.  And his conclusion was the reason no big company can buy it is because of the evil thing they're  going to have to do the minute they get it, which is to fire, to recover half a billion dollars in  year in expenses, fire a lot of people. So it's going to be a hedge fund guy. It's going to be,  or an investment group that can, doesn't have a name that can be tarnished because the firm  because the first thing you're going to have to do. So Twitter makes 2 billion revenue,  but is losing money. You have to cut the fat so that Twitter can make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's easy to do. You don't have to worry about getting up your name tarnished. First of  all, you're going to cut all your salespeople because if Google bought them, you have an existing  sales team. So you're going to lose a lot of your salespeople. This happened with Microsoft when they  did the whole Yahoo deal one way or the other, like salespeople went and no one's going to  cry over the salespeople, which is terrible because salespeople keep us all in business.  So I would be sad, but I don't know who they think are going to get, give them a black eye. Plus  companies lay people off all the time and it doesn't collapse. It's like that really, if Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  said we had to lay off 75% of our floors. You don't want to be Disney that bought Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and then fired 10,000 employees. How could Disney have ever had Twitter given the brand damage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. That's another reason. It just doesn't make it. That never made the slightest sense.  Google makes sense because Google could really use all the data and the signals and that  information. Facebook makes sense. Maybe Facebook. Facebook's probably got everything that's on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter, right? There's an art. No, I put up something on the rundown that argues that Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  has complimentary data. Is Google definitely out of the running? They say they don't want it,  but who knows, right? So no one wants Twitter right now, right? We'll see how low the price

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  can go now. Well, I think they don't want it at that price. That's kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, as the stock team keeps taking a hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the Salesforce one, I argued that that could make some sense for Salesforce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but all the shareholders are emailing Mark Benioff saying, over our dead body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't make any sense. I don't even understand why. I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Explain how it makes sense, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It makes sense in that it's a very good channel for companies to talk to their customers.  And that's the piece. That's the thing that Salesforce already does with it. And they've  got some connections there. So it's also a great source of, as you say, advertising and  marketing materials and things like that as well. So there is some correlations with Salesforce's  business there, but I'm not sure it's enough for them to spend that much money because they  don't actually have that much money. They would have to do some kind of rights issue to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Hempton writing for Bronte Capital, a brontecapital.blogspot.com says,  here's who should buy Twitter, a Wall Street bastard. Some Wall Street bastard armed with  a lot of debt. That bastard will fire a lot of people. And that's who needs to buy it  because they can do what needs to be done, which is the really hard stuff of cutting costs.  Revenue is two and a half billion dollars a year. It could easily run on a quarter of a billion in  costs. That's what he says. And I think he's probably right. He says, if you can't make this  have a 40% operating margin, then you're inadequately brutal. So expect it to be bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by a Wall Street bastard. Yeah, I totally don't buy into this idea that some big company can't  buy them because they would have to make heartless layoffs. It's no, it's the brand.  Companies do this all the time. They lay people off all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they would be, he says, insufficiently brutal. They'd be, they'd lay off as few people as they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thought they needed to. I don't even know that that would be the case. And it's also, it's like,  if you were Google and you were buying Twitter, you might decide that you don't need to lay people  off because you don't even need to make that much money off of it. You have a lot of cash coming in  from other things. You might think this is perfectly fine. We'd take our time with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think Google's just buying its time waiting for the stock price to tank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I think Google personally, and I don't have any inside knowledge on here, so  what you could do, I just suspect that Google just doesn't really want to get messing around  with anything social. They burnt themselves so badly. Then they go, then we go and get Twitter,  which has got problems. And then if it doesn't grow, despite everything that they do or whatever,  then it's like, oh, look, Google screwed up in social again. And it's like, at this point,  it's like, in contrast, it would be entertaining, perhaps for Google to watch Facebook actually put  it in a bid because then if I were Google, I'd immediately launch an antitrust challenge,  not directly. I'd get someone to do it for me. And I'd probably be successful in blocking that  deal and causing Facebook to burn some time and energy on Twitter and cause Twitter to drop down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and get messed up with it from there. You think there's some urgency to get this deal done,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  though? Isn't Twitter slowly losing users and cache? They've got lots of money in the bank.  They haven't got a burn rate that's going to destroy them. Their challenge is they gave a  metric that was based on growth and they haven't been growing. So now they're trying to revise that  and come up with other metrics they can persuade Wall Street about, which is the point about the  live TV stuff. So the fit with Google is around YouTube. That was the last time we discussed it.  Twitter has been doing gangbusters good work with the live TV. They had millions of viewers  of the debates and they had huge amounts of traffic there. Something weird goes on now when

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I go to Twitter. For some reason, I'm getting Bloomberg technology feeds in my ad blockers,  blocking it. So I guess it's an ad, right? Why am I getting this live video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just video. Just enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It used to happen to me when I went to the Bloomberg site. I hated that.  Now it's happening to me when I go to Twitter. Is that just me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not clicking anything. This is going to Twitter.com.  It's going down a bit. Okay.  Twitter.com. Above the trends, I'm getting live video from Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a scowling Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You must be on a little display. You must be in a little test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're in a test bucket.  Well, I don't like being in this bucket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But hang on. I want to screenshot that so we can write an article. Go back and show me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Screenshot that. I'll take my mouse out of the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just give me a minute here. Give me a minute.  It's a good screenshot.  Get my skitch going here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it going to come with the sound up, Lee, or down?  Do you hear sound, Carson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I can hear sound. Why is that skitch not going? Oh, there we go. Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the most annoying thing. I hate it when I go to Bloomberg's site.  But that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make sure you get your robo file in there.  Rogue One's trending. Okay. Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rogue One is trending?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is Rogue One trending?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Steve Kovac is talking about it. What is Rogue One?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. Oh, there it goes. What is Rogue One?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a Star Wars thing? Oh, it's the new movie?  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, says Danny. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a Star Trek guy. I don't care about Star Trek.  See, I don't even follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a fan of San Francisco tricks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So you don't get Bloomberg in your home feed?  I find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was that twitter.com or twitter.com slash the 11?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. Twitter.com. Well, because I'm logged in.  Oh, my God. Quick. Get your blaster, Luke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rogue One's going to be the new Star Wars thing.  And they're going to get the secret plans and they're going to get all the, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a bad feeling about this.  What makes Danny such a pro is that he got the headset off at the same time.  What do you get?  Mine's on the right. I have it on the right. Yeah.  You get it too?  What'd you get?  Bloomberg.  I have it on the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just prefer to appear above trends.  Just go to twitter.com, not twitter.com slash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's my front page because it's my feed. I'm logged in.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I have it now.  We all have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It deployed to the data center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was thinking the wrong thing.  Now, if it were Rogue One, I wouldn't mind, but I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My video.  Let me just, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This isn't on TV. Is this Bloomberg technology? This is an internet stream that they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but Bloomberg was who was doing the debates for them as well.  They were doing that as a partnership with Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is going to happen on your Facebook page, I guarantee.  They're going to promote video on everybody's home page.  I hope they get rid of that stupid trending that doesn't work.  They're going to promote video and I bet it's going to be live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's auto starting.  I don't know if it's auto playing the audio.  That would be really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not playing the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.  Oh, it's not.  Even if I mouse over, usually if you mouse, if it's not auto play audio, but I mouse over,  it's giving me a watch button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So all it is is just basically a moving ad that if I push it,  push the watch button, I'll get audio, I would presume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  So when you hit the watch button, it does open up in a new window and the audio is on, of course.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whether or not these things are going to materially add to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Leo, what if it was us?  That was important.  What was that important?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would never do that.  I would never do that to anybody.  That's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they did this, they did this with the Monday night,  Thursday night football.  They did this with the debates.  They put a little thing in the feed and said, the debates are starting now.  Do you want to watch it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got peanut butter in my Twitter feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this is exactly what I was talking about.  So I'm saying Twitter is doing a play for live video with commentary.  And they've done it with the event.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, I usually do it myself.  I'll have the debate on the TV and I'll run TweetDeck.  Because Twitter doesn't, unaccountably does not live scroll,  but TweetDeck does.  And I'll just sit there and watch it scroll through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the version that they have in the app shows you the debate and the hashtag that  goes with it.  So the hashtag is going by, which is arguably less useful.  I'd like to be able to see the people that I'm following.  But I can see how that makes sense as a tool for people who aren't using Twitter much.  So Danny, what's your scoop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a new Twitter feature coming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they're doing something.  Tech meme.  It was like not my scoop, just the scoop I saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've given Gabe Rivera two plugs in this episode.  But it's a good place to read news.  It's my first page.  I start on every single page.  But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People know tech meme, but I love meme.  And I don't think anybody knows it.  And every time I'm like, Gabe, it's like elections again.  You got to do something more with this.  It's awesome.  It wraps up all and you get news content from mainstream.  I get news content from far right sites that freak me out.  But I at least have feel like I understand what's going on.  Oh my God.  You really believe that?  OK.  But at least and then you get them on the other sides too.  So it's interesting.  Anyway, they're testing an explore tab, according to Mashable,  where on mobile that would be in place of the moments tab  where they're going to try to let you explore different things that are happening.  I don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I already got that.  That sounds familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I have it.  I think I just.  Is that like highlights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is like the third thing.  I get highlights, but I think that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there's so many different things they have these days.  There's lots of things.  Although I was very impressed and I treated the junction.  I was surprised the amount of attention it got relatively for me.  But like we were sitting there at home as we do.  And my son said something like, oh, yeah, I saw this thing on Twitter moments.  Like, and I'm like, you saw something on Twitter moments?  Like you're using Twitter moments.  And he said, yeah.  He's like, I use it all the time and yeah, my friends look at it.  So I was like, oh, so maybe they've been successful in getting that new stuff pushed out there.  Well, this is a good time to be doing that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But highlights is Android only, right?  You don't get that on the website or on the iOS.  Highlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have highlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to subscribe to highlights for children when I was young.  Amazon.  You know what I'm talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You guys have seen this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't remember it.  It's very bright and shiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, hang on.  You really need to clean your screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's gross.  I didn't like it.  I don't even like looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're in a test.  You're in a test pattern.  There's something.  No, I'm not in a test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This has been here for a while, but I think they shipped it on Android first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  Yeah, I don't see it on iOS.  Okay, so I'm going to grant you.  I have to revise a little bit my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's kind of like moments, but it's things that people have followed.  They rolled it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some valuable things.  There's I think Twitter is, you know, I mean, especially in terms of news,  and I guess in football, they're making some progress here.  Maybe they should just give up trying to sell.  Do you think you're going to sell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the problem is they got a value that was...  We are also like Facebook and they're not.  Yeah, so they're not going to be.  They could be a good little business and, you know,  there's a lot of great stuff to love about them,  but if you've got investors that just expect a lot more, that's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here it is. Highlights.  If they're gone public.  The most interesting content from Twitter tailored for you.  Yeah, popular conversations, tweets.  How do I get highlights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So only on Android.  Only on Android.  I'm not hallucinating.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tap the navigation menu icon, the hamburger, or your profile icon.  Tap notifications, mobile notifications, and there's a check box next to highlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, there's a little lightning symbol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a new Rogue One poster, so it's gone off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But highlights is...  It's my favorite.  These are highlights and moments.  Highlights is based on who you follow.  This looks good. I like it.  This is global.  Yeah. You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. Reuse it for a bit, you won't.  Boring. It's stuff you already know.  This is the highlight.  You already know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, but if Leo is not going to Twitter much, then he will actually like it.  It's another one of these things that make sense if you don't use Twitter much.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be like...  It's like almost here's what you've missed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. It's like here's what you missed,  but with a slightly different... with a more moments-like presentation.  They also let you create moments now.  You saw that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was last week, the week before.  I can make my own moments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. If you go to the website, you go to moments on the website,  on the right-hand side, there's a make moment button, and you can add tweets to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to do that, and then I couldn't get it going because they didn't make it.  Is that working now?  Yeah. I made one.  I wanted to make one the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see.  You can now create moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but now I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is this like track?  I don't care.  Have they finally brought back track eight years after they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not track. Basically, it's curated.  So it's basically a collection post.  You go there, and then you put a bunch of tweets into it  to create a collection of tweets that make sense to you.  And then you publish the moment, and then it says,  oh, can you give us some phone-shaped crops of the photos in it?  I'm like, really?  And then who sees it?  And then it tells you to share it with a link.  You've got a permalink to it.  And it shows up in the moments page for people who follow you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I should make some tweet moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was very excited about it when it first came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could do a per show moment.  When you publish the show, you can make a moment for the show  with the links and the tweets to things that were in it.  Yeah. So it starts to make more sense  because the moments only being made by them was a bit weird.  And this was a tool I think they gave to some content partners  so that you get ones that are credited to NFL and things.  So now you can make your own as well.  So as I say, they're clearly rethinking themselves  as a media company and not as a social company.  And they've been saying that for a while,  but they're actually starting to deploy things that add to that.  And that's the piece that would make sense for Google,  particularly in combination with YouTube, because YouTube,  the live YouTube experience is there,  but the commentary stuff is not strong.  Whereas Twitter's live commentary on real things is very strong.  And it's a piece that basically Google had bits of this in Reader.  The real debacle of Reader was them saying,  oh, there weren't enough users for this.  But they didn't realize that the users they had  were all the people who published news.  It was everyone Jeff knows was using Reader  because the journalists were using it to gather stories  and share stuff back and forth.  And that's the piece that Twitter rebuilt  with some very good work by the media team there,  making sure that everyone who was in media was on Twitter,  was verified, was part of the conversation,  and was having their conversation inside Twitter.  And also make it easy to break Twitter into news stories,  things like that.  And that's what we're seeing in the election.  Twitter is in the news cycle every day and is part of it.  And that's a piece that Google has sort of,  they had bits of it with Reader, they had bits of it with news,  but they never quite got the two together  into a thing that you could share well.  So if I was, it would make sense to put them in Google  or maybe Alphabet, but Google,  because then they could be wired up with YouTube.  But the question would be the turf war  of who gets to own it and run it and make it work inside Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — All the issues that Twitter's had since its IPO,  Snapchat is now about to move into the same position.  It would be probably the largest social media IPO since Twitter.  They've picked Morgan Stanley Goldman to lead the IPO.  That means they're moving ahead.  As soon as March, according to some sources, again, these are all—  — The same woman from Bloomberg is back.  — Yeah, I can't get away from her.  This is Bloomberg now.  I'm on the Bloomberg site.  I'm getting the same video feed.  Snapchat has changed its name to Snap, which is snappier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — If you go to Twitter, it's even bigger.  — Yeah.  I just went to an incognito window and it's like, it's—

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — This is the problem I have with Twitter.  You can try to change the subject,  but Twitter still sneaks into the subject.  People give, you people, you techno-literate digerati,  give Twitter way more importance than it ought to have in the general culture.  And also, I think you can make the argument  it's had kind of a baleful influence on the political dialogue of late.  — Amazon has launched a service for you, Echo Owners,  a streaming service called Music Unlimited that has—  they're not saying, but it sounds like close to the same number of tracks  as all the others, Spotify and Google Music and Apple Music.  But it's got a better price.  If you're a Prime member, $8 a month, $79 a year, $10,  the usual $10 for non-Prime members.  And if you don't mind having it on only one Echo, $4 a month.  So if you have an Echo in the house that's connected to your stereo  and all you care about is having a great, you know,  unlimited selection of music on your stereo, that's a very good deal, $4 a month.  Amazon is not resting on its Echo.  They are beefing it up.  Washington Post tracked Facebook's trending topics and  uncovered over the last three weeks five fake stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — Just kill trending. It is the worst Facebook feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — And three undeniably or profoundly inaccurate ones.  Okay, who cares?  Oh, here's a big one for people who are interested in the Pixel.  Remember Ron Amadio's story,  under no circumstances should you buy your Pixel from Verizon.  The update is Verizon says Pixels will get updates  even if you bought them from Verizon at the same time as Google's.  They won't stand in the way and Google confirms, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Really? So you would say don't get your Pixel from Verizon as well?  — No.  — Jeff, you left Verizon or no? You're still on Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — No, no, no, no.  — You're logged on. Okay.  — Yeah, I'm on Verizon Files to be clear. I love that.  But Verizon mobile is probably...  — Still probably should get your Pixel unlocked, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not at Verizon.  — Why would you buy it through Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — What advantage would you have in buying it through Verizon?  — Right. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — Well, do they have to do a different version or are they all multiband now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — I think they're all multiband. I don't know.  But the real concern was initially that Verizon would be  a gatekeeper to Google's updates, which of course you don't want.  If you buy a Pixel, just the same reason as you bought the Nexus,  because you want the updates promptly.  — Here's a good one from the New York Times.  Facebook's voter registration reminder that is splayed for a mere four days in September  contributed to substantial increases in online voter registration across the country.  At least nine secretaries of state...  — Look at the graphic. It's great.  — ...have said that four days made a huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — Now, of course, some will argue and complain,  oh, they're having an impact on the election.  We have how transparent...  — But just simply saying, registering more people is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — This is the Facebook bump in Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania.  It's across the board. Big difference overall.  And of course, as the Times points out, it's notable not just for boosting voter registration,  but maybe for the kinds of voters.  Facebook did not provide demographic breakdowns,  but it is more popular among females and males, younger, more than older.  Is that still true?  I feel like it's all old folks on Facebook.  If Snapchat did it, it would be for sure younger and skewed probably towards females.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — I got to say, as you know, I spent the last few weekends in Pennsylvania registering people,  and it's terribly inefficient.  One day I spent three hours there, got three registrants.  But yet, it's so gratifying when it almost always was a Latino who would say,  oh, good, I can register for one individual. Thank you. I can register.  — Wow.  — And the excitement they had. It was great.  — It's great.  — I had two people who moved from Puerto Rico who were citizens who could now vote,  and it mattered. And they were terribly excited.  — They could vote in Puerto Rico too, I hate to tell you.  — But not in a way that's going to have the impact of all of Pennsylvania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — No, and that's why I'm moving to Pennsylvania,  because it doesn't matter who I vote for in California.  — No.  — But I'm still voting. Dang it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — That's right.  Rohrabacher is going to defend my right to have Donald Trump be my candidate forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — What state are you in? You're in Pennsylvania?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Who, me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — I'm in Orange County.  — Oh, that's right.  — He's in Orange County.  — You're Dana Rohrabacher. Of course I should have known.  — Yeah.  — Is he up for election?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Rohrabacher?  — Yeah.  — Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — All right. But he's going to win because he's in Orange County.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — The state of the opposition in Orange County is such that  the opposing candidate did not even have a statement in the official booklet.  — It doesn't matter. You don't even know.  — Like, didn't even bother to file it.  — Don't even worry about it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  — Like, yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — That's going to change, young man. I just saw an article that says Santa Ana.  Was it Santa Ana is all Latino in the city council?  — Oh, it'll change.  — A Latino majority?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — We're like this little coastal enclave that just hangs in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — I know. I was in Irvine. I couldn't believe it. It's like, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — If you come to Irvine, you've got to tell me you've got to come out to Newport Beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — I actually was in Newport Beach. I was staying at the,  whatever they call that, ridiculous tower in the sky there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Leo, come by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — What is the name of that thing?  — Rostov.  — It was a couple of months ago. It was fun. I didn't realize you were there.  I also, you know who else is there? Steve Gibson's in Irvine. Didn't see him either.  — Yeah.  — Yeah.  — Well, he never called me anyway.  — In Connecticut, in three days,  yeah.  — In three days in Connecticut, because of this Facebook campaign, 14,883 people registered  a 12-fold increase over the week before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — And how many people, how many people—  — Don't keep that mystery to yourself.  — 527, I think, right? The minute difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — That's amazing. 12,000.  Pandora's also doing its music service, Pandora Plus.  And they've unveiled a new company logo.  Wow, I hope they didn't spend too much money on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Did somebody get their fingerprints on it, the logo?  — It kind of looks like finger painting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Yeah, potato cutouts.  — Oh, that's it. They did it with a potato. You're right, it's potato prints.  No, that's not it. I'm sorry. That fooled me. TechCrunch stopped that, along with the  new company logo. TechCrunch did its own potato illustration, but that's actually the new logo.  The new service will be $4.99 a month, but it's—  Wait, no, Pandora Plus—oh, I'm confused. Pandora One has always been around. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I don't get Pandora. Can you just play whatever you want, or is it still that case where—

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — No, you can't. And you have limited skips and all that? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Yeah, why wouldn't you just use Spotify?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody has a radio-style product now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I know, but with Pandora, I kind of gave up because I'd want to hear a particular song,  but they weren't allowed to play you that song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — With Pandora Plus, there's no ads. You could skip more songs, more replays,  and they have offline listening, so it's a little bit—  — Yeah, I'll just use Spotify. That's good for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although the Echo thing is good because you ask for a song, and if you're a Prime member,  you get the song sometimes, but then sometimes it doesn't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — So I quit Spotify for Amazon. I'm going to use the Amazon instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Yeah, well, you can hook—but you can hook Spotify up into the Echo,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  but the thing is, then you have to go—

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — You have to say, on Spotify.  — Alexa! Turn on my lights! I wonder if my lights went on. Sorry, no.  — Don't say the A word.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  — Alexa!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Echo!  — Alexa!  — Spotify! Alexa!  — Stop it! Stop it!  — Alexa!  — Nah, bitch!  You know what I did learn in that announcement is that the number one command on Echo—do  you know what it is? Echo, listen to music. Not any kind of music. Just listen to music.  And I tried it, and it actually does a pretty good job. But if you get the new  paid thing, it'll even do a broader variety of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — What's our betting on Google Home? Is it going to be good, or is it going to be  disaster?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  — I'm glad you asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — What do you think, Danny Sullivan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I think it might do all right. I think being price less than Amazon,  that's very interesting. I think it's going to be really successful if you have some music  bundled into it, though. I think that's one of the key things with Echo is because the Echo,  you were a Prime member, I think, originally when you got it, and then it would play your music,  and then it's really convenient for that. It'll be interesting to see how well they  do with some of the other skills, though, because it's just amazing the stuff you can do with Alexa  to get to your flash briefings and things like that. But I think people are interested in doing  it. I think it'll do all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — If you are an Echo user and you like the flash briefing, go into the app and search for  Twitter because we are in the flash briefing now. Monday through Friday, we have headlines from  Tech News Today with Megan and Jason, and then we'll have clips from Twitter and the new  screensavers typically on Saturday and Sunday. So there's new content every day. Add us to your  flash briefing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — They've done a lot where when I was at the thing, I got in trouble, kind of, because  they were doing the Google Home demo. And so they're like, look, and it can do this,  and it can do that, and it can do this. And they're like, now it's Play Jeopardy! And it's  like, hello, time to play Jeopardy! So you can tell that they've done a lot of stuff to build  in to try to get you excited about it. I finally said, can I just ask it a few of these questions?  — No, no, no, no, no.  — Yeah. They're like, no, I don't know if I can answer that. I'm like, that is sort of what I'm  trying to find out. But it did. I gave it three questions that I had run against the Amazon Echo  that the Echo could not answer. And Google Home got two of those three correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — So it's more like the Google Assi— well, it is the Google Assistant. So anything—

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Yeah, it's Google Assistant built in. I think Google Assistant is really whatever  direct answer you get at the top of your Google search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — So, Jeff, I'm sure you ordered the Home, right?  — Oh, yeah.  — Mine supposedly comes, let me see, order details. I think November 8th through 10th.  So soon. A couple of weeks, three weeks. Is yours sooner?  — How do I find it?  — I think if you ordered right away, it was as soon as November 4th, I think. Because one of—  I think Anthony Nielsen ordered it, and we're going to have it for that new screensaver  is November 5th. So—

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I was a bit delayed because I kept trying to figure out how to order the other colors  until I realized that there are no other colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — Yeah, that got me about 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — There's colored bases, right? And then you can say they're not even available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — November 8th, Leo.  — You're also November 8th. All right. Okay.  — I think that's as soon as the phone. I'm getting—  — Soon. October 20th, you should.  — Again, October 26th.  — 6th, okay.  — So do I keep it or not?  — You keep asking me that.  — I know I do. You're my—  — I don't know.  — Sensei.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — It's supposed to be a much better camera.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  — The pictures are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — And I'm really curious what the— I still don't know, maybe you do, Danny,  the difference between okay Google and the— sorry, everybody— and then the Google Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, Google, here's how it works. Alexa.  Now, Siri.  So the Assistant will still respond to okay Google.  The Assistant will still respond to the hot word like you used to have in the hot word before.  — Right.  — So that will change—

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Can I customize it? I really missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I'm trying to remember when I—

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — The Moto X was the last thing that would let you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I think there was an option to change the wake word, but that might have been— no, I can't recall.  I can't recall. I suspect probably not, but the speaking to it part hasn't changed.  It's just that the Assistant part is built in. Like, you know, right now, if you have a phone  and you do the Google and you tell it what you want to do as a voice search,  it will come back with Google search results.  So that's how to think of the difference between what Google Assistant does versus what you get now.  With what you get now, you say to Google, hey Google, what movies are playing near me?  And it comes back and it says, here are some listings.  With the Assistant, you say, hey Google, but the other way, what movies are playing near me?  And it comes back and says, I can show you the movies here. Would you like to know Showtime?  And it gives you basically a little button.  — And then you could buy tickets.  — The ticket stuff isn't quite there yet.  I think it depends on what application you have.  Like, we could launch Fandango, but it's a little more interactive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — But eventually that's the plan, is that it will actually assist you.  It will take a step beyond search to actually assist you in doing actions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Although I was having fun and I don't know if I can show you,  especially because my wife and I tend to get very…

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Intimate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — No, no. We cursed at each other in our text messages.  — Oh, you've been married longer than I have, I guess.  — As a joke. But she said to me something like,  I was saying, look, I need to test this Google Assistant. Can you run it?  So we were doing this thing going back and forth on trying to find out like…

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Jeff and I had a great conversation on Allo while I was at the airport in Paris.  It was fun. I liked all the things I could do with the Allo.  I just wish Google… I still don't understand,  and I think this is going to be the case still with the Pixel,  why it's not their default text messaging app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Oh, Allo?  — Yes.  — I don't know. I hate Allo.  — But if you're going to go all in on your messaging platform,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't have three messaging apps plus whatever the carrier and the manufacturer put on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I can't even with them, the messaging. I can't even. I don't even…  I can use Allo on one phone, but no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Oh, you're right. It's tied to your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — It's tied to your number, and I have a Google Voice number.  So then I'm tying it to one phone, but I can't use it on the other phone.  Meanwhile, I have a Google Voice number that was supposed to use Google Hangouts,  so now I can't use Google Hangouts because they're kind of going away from that.  It's like, why couldn't you just give us one good app?  And then I don't know what Duo is supposed to be versus Allo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — I agree. I can't even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — So while you were away, Leo, we did talk about this.  There was an article in Ars Technica saying Allo makes sense if you think about India,  which I just stuck in the…  — Yeah, yeah. So does WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Oh, yeah. Well, good. If I were in India…

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — But I'm not in India.  — That would be helpful for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — No, exactly. But that explains why they're not making it the default app yet,  because it's not ready for it. But they're focused on…

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Can I make it an option to be the default app?  — No, because that…  — What, Allo?  — Yeah, they will…  — You can't on the Nexus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — No, you can't. They haven't decided to do it. But at the moment,  half my apps on Android want to take over SMS already. Facebook wants it, and Hangouts wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Well, they better hurry up, because I'm using Facebook as my messenger now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — Yep. I'm sure they'll get to it at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I'm just going to leave Google for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — No, I'm as frustrated as you are. It's the reason I hate WhatsApp as well. It's like…

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — I understand that in much of the rest of the world, the rapacious cell carriers and  mobile companies charge you so much for SMS that people won't use SMS. They use a data-only  system like WhatsApp. That's explaining the popularity of WhatsApp worldwide.  Allo would be a plug-in replacement for that. But that does not mean it shouldn't also be like  Apple's messages or even its own Hangouts and be an SMS Plus messaging app. Apple does it quite well,  where it will use SMS or it will use data, depending on which is available. I presume in India,  you could tell Apple, oh, just use data. I don't ever want to use SMS unless you have to, because  if somebody's not on an iPhone, you have to. — Which is also the great thing about Hangouts,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is it works just like the Apple messages, where you can send the stuff via email.  — And it's cross-platform.  — And they're beautiful on cross-platform. So why they made Allo non-cross-platform?  Because it's tied to your freaking phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Well, it's cross-platform in the sense that you can talk to somebody on an iPhone from an  Android phone and vice versa. But that's good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — But heaven forbid you want to talk to somebody from your iPhone and your iPad,  because only one of them gets to run Allo at a time.  — Yeah.  — Yeah.  — But that's how Snapchat operates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — Which is very odd, very not-Google-y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — And that's the advantage of having an email account be the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — But the advantage, I guess, to them is if you're just doing your phone number,  they've hooked you up without you having to do passwords or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — Without having to create a Google account, it's part of the point. You can use it on the  phone without a Google account, which means they can deploy it on Androids that aren't  Google-ified. So if you want the actual internal turf for, that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Do you think it's important or a significant number that Google,  YouTube had for the second presidential debate 124 million views? That seems to me  a real harbinger of a change in how people consume content. That's almost shocking,  especially since the debate was on every network. You know, you couldn't, any TV you turned on would  have the debate, and yet 124 million people chose their—

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — So how are they counting it? How much time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Didn't they say that the viewing on television was down? Fewer people watched  the debate on television, so it's interesting if more people were actually watching the second  debate on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — The peak concurrent viewing was 1.5 million, which isn't huge. So that tells me,  to answer your question, Kevin, it's people clicking and clicking away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — This is YouTube, this is not YouTube Live, is it? This is YouTube, all stuff around it.  The distinction's kind of—

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Yeah, well, since it took place Sunday. So this is people, not just from the U.S.,  probably everybody in the U.S. watched live on television, but all over the world. The  highest country, the country with the highest number was the U.S., but then Canada, Mexico,  Australia, the U.K., and Vietnam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — Did Twitter release figures on that? I remember there being like 3 million or something  from then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Yeah, we're really—this is rapidly happening, this consuming content over the  internet as opposed to broadcast. Very interesting. Will Sheryl Sandberg be the next  Secretary of the Treasury? She says no. She's going to stay at Facebook.  I like the idea that she could be Secretary of Treasury or Commerce. I don't know who thought  that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — Remember when we thought it was going to be Schmidt, would suddenly be in the cabinet?  — Wouldn't that be a mistake? I like Eric, but—

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Elon says he's going to announce something next week to blow your mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — That they're actually going to ship those cars sometime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that he found the wormhole into the people who are running this all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — He's paying—we mentioned this on Sunday on Twitter—according to rumor,  he and some others who believe we don't live in the real world but live in a simulation  are paying programmers or experts or whatever, whoever you'd pay, to break through.  He's trying to develop the red pill. Physicists?  — Yes.  — Why not?  — If Elon came to you with a blank check, how would you break through the simulation  to the real world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — Well, the point is you look for low-resolution stuff.  — Glitches, in the words of the Matrix.  — Glitches in the Matrix. Is there an alignment that implies there are pixels involved? Is  there alignment of that kind of voxels involved? Is there some quantization thing that is—  — Yeah, because you've got to figure that some of the simulation—

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — There's no pixels in my brain. There's no low resolution in my brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — No, but I don't think it's actual voxels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — No, mine's getting more low resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Actually, there is because you think you're seeing clearly when, in fact, you are not. Your  brain is piecing together of you—  — I'm using glasses. Now I can see clearly.  — No, you don't see what's out here. You just think you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — That's because they only look right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — You've got a fervor and it's circading and it's making a model of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — The circading, which is the jiggling of your eyes all the time, is building up an image. So,  in fact, it's a raster image.  — So, the argument is that—and the crazy version of this argument get very crazy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but it's like if you look at quantum mechanics, if you look at the way physical laws work,  they don't tend to have higher order terms. The observer problem in quantum mechanics,  that's kind of a giveaway. There are any random things we look at. So you argue things on those  bases. But trying to break out of the simulation is kind of silly. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — I don't know. I hope he does. I'll go imagine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I would say, look, if I was in the simulation, I wouldn't be allowing some billionaires to fund  the ability to break through the simulation. So we're not in the simulation, stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Unless—I think that'd be kind of interesting, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  — Then you get an eschaton scenario, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Or I'd say I must be in the simulation because only in a simulation do we have people  with more money than God throwing out money to try to find out whether or not there's actually a God  controlling us in a simulation or not. And also, why is your Model X so expensive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Oh, but I like it. I have a Model X.  — Do you have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Is it really because I need to get a new car and I was like, laid them all out and I'm like,  — It's very expensive.  — That is like five times more. Why do I want that?  Like, I could find this and the amount of gas I would use—

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — No, no, no, no, no, that's not about that. It's the pleasure, the sheer joy of driving an  all-electric vehicle and knowing that the solar panels, which I also bought from Elon,  on my roof are charging the battery, which I also bought from Elon in my garage,  which is charging the car, which I bought from Elon, and it's a virtuous circle.  Somehow Elon's in every part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — No, I've got the solar panels on my roof that I don't want to charge Elon's car because it's  better for me to sell the electricity in the daytime back to SoCal and then charge my car  at night rather than put it in the battery. It's just all economics and not just by the gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — It's not economics. It's not. It's the sheer joy of driving a car that has so little footprint.  And it feels just like a gas car with the acceleration and everything. It's fun to drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — It's just a little footprint. It's like a car and it's using electricity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Which I make, which I take on loan from God.  — But I think that I'm just putting it out there for other people who need it.  — Well, you can buy a Chevy Bolt. Get a Bolt. If you don't care, get a Chevy Bolt.  — I'm getting a Bolt.  — Good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  — But that's not expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Yeah, and it's not as much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I just want to get one place or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Oh, well then fine.  — I mean, I do want the wing's doors of a billion.  — You should get a bicycle. Get a bicycle.  — And you know why they're called doors of a billionaire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Yes?  — Because Elon's making a billion off those doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — I want doors that go like this. They don't just go like this. They go like this.  — Is there anything you don't like about it?  — It's not a luxury vehicle. I mean, for the price you're paying, it should be very  a little bit more luxurious. Well, none of their vehicles really are luxury vehicles.  They're just luxury price.  — Why are you putting me—  — But no, I love it. Every day I pinch myself every time I get into it and feel good about it.  I just really love the idea of driving an electric vehicle that's fun to drive.  And we just got version 8 of the software, so I'm going to do the review on the new  screensavers on Saturday because we've held off on the review until the new software came out,  with 200 improvements to autopilot and all of that.  Last story before we—

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Does it automatically stop your car, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Does what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — It's a do the automatic if somebody stops in front of you.  — Oh yeah. Oh yeah, of course.  — I mean, it's fascinating for me because I haven't bought a car for like eight years, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Next time you're out here, come up, Danny, and I will let you take the Tesla for a day  and you could go anywhere you want, drive it around. Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  — But what's fascinating is—  — It's just not the wine country, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I'm looking at these cars right now and I'm like, wait, you don't have autopilot?  You still have like an old navigation system? You don't automatically stop my car? And I'm like,  why are you guys not this advanced?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Yeah, well, because you didn't pay $130,000 for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Well, no, but some of them are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — The reason I spent that much money is because I am an altruist.  I want to fund the next generation so that you, Danny, can have a Model 3.  That's what Jason Calacanis told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I bought my solar panels not just because I thought they'd make money,  but because I actually wanted to be more environmentally sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — We said even if we just break even, this is great. And we do save a lot of money on our  power. We save hundreds of dollars a month because we got solar panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — Oh my God, I got my first bill and it was like negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Yeah, it's a nice feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I gotta go away. I'm really sorry, I have to leave. I'm like, hard stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — It's your fault. I was trying to wrap this show up hours ago.  All right. Okay. See ya. Goodbye, Danny.  — Wait, you've got to wrap up? I'll hang in there.  — SearchEngineLand.com, MarketingEngineLand.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I'm sorry, I have to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — You know what? Give us one little tip or trick or something we should know about that  if we had just been reading Search Engine Land assiduously, we would already know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — I went through, it's been fairly quiet. You've got that RGB hex thing already on the list,  so I'll leave that hard JB hex thing to you. So I will say Snapchat's had some redesigns.  We've got some articles up on that at Marketing Land. But most of the news this month has really  been like, hey, Google's not penalizing you anymore and that's as boring as...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — Have a great afternoon, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — All right, you guys. Sorry, I gotta go. Have a great time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — No problem. Danny Sullivan, the greatest. SearchEngineLand.com.  — Bye, Danny.  — MarketingEngineLand.com.  — See you.  — OrangeCountyLand.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  — But it's nice in the summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — It's beautiful. In the winter, too. NewportBeachLand.com.  Our show today brought to you by Danny's Mattress. The Casper. Oh, my mattress, too. I love  our Casper mattress. They've reinvented the mattress business. You know there are a lot of  copycats now. Have you noticed that? Yeah, but you should go with Casper. They were the ones who  have revolutionized the whole thing by eliminating the middleman. No more resellers, no more showrooms.  You're buying directly from the factory. US-made, obsessively engineered premium mattresses  for a fraction of the cost. They're combining two technologies, springy latex foam,  supportive memory foam to create an amazing, award-winning, in fact, sleep surface. Just  the right sink, just the right bounce. It's cool. It breathes. It's environmentally friendly.  It's just lovely. 2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award winner.  Long-lasting, too, by the way. Now, you might say, but Leo, I want to try before I buy. Yeah,  you can. By getting it now in your home without any risk, you have 100 nights.  And if at any time in the 100-day period you say, call them. They'll send a courier. They'll take it  back, refund you every penny. It'll have cost you absolutely nothing. The nice thing is it comes in  this great little compact box. So it's very, I sent one to my son in college because he could easily  heft it up the three flights of this dorm. He didn't have to sleep on that ratty dorm mattress.  Instead, he's had a great mattress for his college experience. And it's affordable. $500 for that twin  I sent to Henry. And I'm going to save you in the morning, additional $50 towards a mattress.  Bit, just because you're listening, but you got to go to casper.com slash twig  and use the offer code twig. 50 bucks off. Please do that so that they know that you  heard it on this week in Google. casper.com slash twig offer code twig to get $50 off some terms  and conditions. Apply casper mattress. I love my casper and you will too, but you can try it risk  free. So why not? Jeff Jarvis, do you want to do a number or what do you want to do these days?  Jeff Jarvis Oh, he's silenced. You're silenced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis Sorry, I was turning up the TV. So I turned that down. So yes, I wanted a number,  a very important one. Our friend of everyone on the internet, friend of openness and great things  about the net. John Perry, very John Perry Barlow has been sick with unknown conditions that are  heart attack and so on. And his family just put up a plea for money to help him pay for his very  expensive, very difficult care. He's as funny as ever. If you go to his Facebook page, you'll see  him doing a New Year's Eve noisemaker. He's got the same spirit as ever, but he needs a lot of  equipment and ongoing care. And the guy is courageous in the face of all this, but he's  the best humor you can imagine online on his Facebook feed. But he's somebody who's really  important to the net who's given greatly to the net. So I'll as soon as we're off, I'll be giving  some money to him. Jeff Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I'll add to that because they're doing a concert down the road apiece. And Lisa and I are  going and we bought the top level because I wanted to contribute as well to John because I love John  Dearly. He's been on the show several times and we owe him a lot. He was a founder of the EFF  and just a really important person in the development of technology and of the internet.  And the concert, if you can go. Jeff Jarvis  Yeah, so who's playing at the concert? Jeff Jarvis  Well, Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead is kind of putting it together. And so that'll give you some  idea. You know, of course you should just go anyway, but I'll be there. Lisa will be there.  Let me see if I can find the Facebook. Jeff Jarvis  Boy Boy was down. They had it.  Jeff Jarvis Yeah. I will look it up at this. It's on this.  If you go to sweetwater.com, that's their site and you can buy tickets if it's not sold out.  The event is called Everyday Miracle. Jerry Harrison of the Talking Heads, he was the  keyboardist. Lucas Nelson, members of String Cheese Incident. Ramblin Jack Elliott. Sean Lennon,  Les Claypool. That's who's on the bill right now, but you got to believe there'll be a lot  of other people at this event. Now it's in Marin, so you have to be in the Bay Area.  But definitely, I bought tickets immediately because I really care about John Perry Barlow and  we really want him to get well soon and certainly want to help him with his medical expenses.  They'll also be a live and silent auction and all the proceeds go directly to his care and recovery.  So there you go. There you go, John Perry Barlow. How about you, Kevin Marks? You got something for

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  us? Kevin Marks Well, I've got my usual thing, which is indyweb.org. It's not a very bright  sunlight. Anyway. Jeff I like it. I'm jealous. Kevin Marks So there are two IndyWeb camps coming  up in November, November the weekend of the 4th to the 6th in Berlin and Los Angeles, depending on  which side of the planet you're on. So those are the next two. And we've got also our regular  Wednesday meetings, not this week, but next week in various places and the week after in San  Francisco. So go to those. The other thing I wanted to mention was Ada Lovelace Day. That was  yesterday. This is the annual Recognizing Women in Tech Day, organized by Sue Jarman. And it's a  day to have a live event in London, but they also encourage people to write about women in tech and  to show them as role models so that girls will find women role models to look up to and so on.  So that's a great organization, a great site, and there's a lot going on there. And they've  got a podcast as well now and a series of other things they put out. But yesterday was the big day.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does anybody know what the RGB to hex calculator that Danny was talking about, what that is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I play with it. If you just type in RGB to hex, you can put in any color and get the numbers.  Google does this for you.  Yeah, it's under my numbers.  So if you search for RGB to hex on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's hysterical.  Isn't it?  I was searching for... Oh, look at that. Google is so funny. This is something we used to do all the  time, right? In the web. I don't know if you still do it, but... Oh, that's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is... I mean, there's a color picker that looks exactly like that in the browser, but  it's kind of funny to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the search. Somebody's 20% project. I love it. Search for RGB to hex on Google and you never will  have to guess what the hexadecimal representation is of a particular color. Remember the days when  you had to use color safe colors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah. There are only 256 colors and they're all really bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you didn't, then you couldn't guarantee the browser would do the right thing?  You might get dithering. Yeah.  Yeah. We don't want dithering.  How funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There were only every... You can literally look at it in there. There were only every  three hex. So it was 0369AF.  Sure, that makes sense.  And then all the permutations of that, there's the colors you got, which meant there weren't  any very subtle ones in that. They were all variously quite glowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you're not already a Google Fi subscriber, you really ought to be. And they've  now added, they added just a couple of days ago, group plans. So now if you are a Google Fi person,  like I am, Jeff is, you can add your family members. They have to have Nexus or Pixel phones  to do it. But I think that's fantastic.  15 bucks a month?  Yeah, 15 bucks a month. And I guess they're in, instead of your 20 bucks a month and they're in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on your data plan at 10 bucks a gigabyte. Oh, so they share the data? If they don't  have separate data, they share the same data? That's a good question. I don't know. That's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good question. That's a big difference.  Not really, because you're paying for it either way, right? So I just think of it as a $15 instead  of $20 entrance fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If five people use five gigs each, it's $10 a gig. So five people use half a gig each, that'd be $25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't you paying for it anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no. What I'm saying is that if you can't add it up, in words, if five people use half a gig each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see. I see. You don't get the fractional usage.  That would be two and a half gigs.  Yeah. No, no. I think each person has their own data counter.  Okay. That's 10 bucks.  So really, essentially what it is. Yeah. But essentially the big change is you get a $5  discount on additional people on your account. Basically.  That's fine.  It's great. And up to six, I think something like that.  I'm loving FI. And I should report that I took both the FI phone and a T-Mobile phone  to the 10 countries that I visited on vacation. And what I found was that in many cases,  T-Mobile was a little faster than FI. And T-Mobile was cheaper because T-Mobile,  now maybe that was the phone. I don't know. I was using the iPhone 7 compared to Nexus 6P.  Presumably, if I'm on T-Mobile, the Nexus phone is also using T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But maybe FI is paying them something for it.  Maybe. I don't know. Because they're an MVNO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And you still pay the price. Whereas with T-Mobile, it's just part of your account.  It's unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. The T-Mobile, you get free data throttled at 120 kilobit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the point is that it wasn't throttled. They had said over the summer, they weren't  going to throttle. And then they've continued that. I suspect they're going to continue that  forever. So it was LTE very often. And that was nice. That was nice. I was very happy with that.  So I did a mix of them. Now, I'll let you know when I get my bill. I might regret that. I don't  know. But it's really great to be able to go now travel and not have to worry about crazy data  roaming costs. So if you travel, either a FIFONE or a T-Mobile phone, they were close enough that  I think you'd be happy with either. And you don't have to make any special travel arrangements.  Maybe that makes sense. Because they're an MVMO, maybe they get a lower priority than T-Mobile  Direct. I don't know. It was close, but I noticed in most cases I preferred the iPhone over the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  NET 6P. Yeah, there may be an extra handshake as you roam or something that it's got to look up.  The other one that was in the rundown was the patent trolling thing, which I think is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to talk about that. And I just, because Danny wanted to get out of here, I didn't.  Let's mention it. It's kind of complicated to explain. Sure. Is it that or is it the one about  these weird cases, the suspicious court cases? Which one is it that you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would say the patent one, but the court case is one that's interesting too. They're related.  They're related. Kind of. The other one's more of a Section 230 thing. Okay, so do that one.  So let's do this one first. So the suspicious court cases, they want stuff taken down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's say you're not living in Europe with the right to be forgotten, but you want Google  to take down that article. The problem is Google or Yelp or a lot of places won't do it just because  you ask them. On the other hand, if you get a court order saying it's defamatory, well, then  they're going to take it down. How do you get the court order? You do a fake lawsuit with fake  defendants. You're both sides. The same name as the person. Yeah, the same name. That's critical  so that the order looks the same. You play both sides. As the defendant, you say, oh, you're right.  It was defamatory. The court goes, oh, well, case closed. It's defamatory. Issues an order,  which you send to Google saying, see, it's defamatory. And Danny Sullivan says so. And  they pull it down. And Washington Post has found at least 25 court cases. And I bet there's many,  many more. The suspicion is that it's reputation defense companies that are doing these. You pay  them a lot of money. And what they're doing is basically they're going into a jurisdiction,  making up a plaintiff, making up a defendant with the same, it's very brazen, with the same name  or somehow that could easily be confused for the same person that you would like to sue for real,  have them plea. So for instance, Matthew Chan, a Georgia resident, posts a negative review  of a Georgia dentist on Yelp and a few other sites. Several months after he put up his post,  Yelp emails him saying it's about to take his comment down because it got a court order  that says the comments defamatory. But wait, says Chan, no one sued me. How'd you get a court order?  The suit was against a Matthew Chan of Baltimore, who doesn't by the way exist. It was filed in court  by somebody apparently working on behalf of the dentist. And well, actually the dentist says,  we didn't do it, but we did hire a reputation management company. And so the reputation  management company goes to another jurisdiction in this case, Baltimore, files suit, and then  responds to the suit saying, yes, your honor, you're absolutely right. It was defamatory. I'm  sorry. And then they have a court order that says Matthew Chan agreed. It's not illegal. Is it? Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no, it's impersonation of a sort. Yeah. You're impersonating, even though the name is the same,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you're impersonating someone. I think that that does sound like it's illegal to me, but I don't  know. Well, it would be up to the court that's being hornswoggled to do something about it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess. Lawsuits, post found lawsuits in California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland,  Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Half of them have been in the Baltimore area and Philadelphia,  which means it's probably a company doing business in that area. It's fascinating.  Fascinating. Anyway, that's a great story. And then the other story is a judge wants to make patent

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  trolling a first amendment issue. Well, so this is interesting to me in that this is how far this  has moved. So, you know, having been someone who's campaigned against software patents for a long time  with people and I set up fixedpatents.org and handed it over to engine advocacy later on when  they were to cut the cause. And by the way, we're very helpful in the podcast,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  patent troll case. Thank you for providing some prior art and so forth. I think it was very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing is that it seems that that actually has moved. We have the alias judgment now,  which says, which is being used as the precedent here. And we're starting to see  precedents being written up where basically just saying add a computer to something no longer  makes it patentable. And those kinds of patents are being challenged. And basically what this  judge is taking a bit further and saying there are ways of using patent trolling to suppress speech.  And we don't want to do that. So that's, that's, that's, that's a very interesting take. Yeah.  So this is interesting, but it's also the thing for me is if you actually look at the trend on  this, this is very encouraging because we've had lots of very, very stupid patents and many of them  in around software and, and the Samsung, Apple one in the Supreme Court about design patents,  I think is also factitious. But this is, this is a sign that things are moving in a good direction,  which is good. Or it may be just that computer firms are better at lobbying now than telco firms.  Maybe a sign of the shift in that direction. We point, we point you to Sarah Zhang's article

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the October 7th in the verge, a judge wants to make patent trolling a first amendment issue.  If you want to understand this in a greater detail, it's good. Sarah is very good at covering  these things. She's a great eagle writer. Yeah. She was writing about what was it? Oh, it was great.  She did such a great, such a great live blog of that. Hey, we're out of time, but thank you so  much. So much fun as always. I just, this is one of the shows I really miss doing because it's,  you know, I just keep asking. We missed you. What would Jeff say? Stacey was not here this week.  I presume she'll be back next week. She was traveling somewhere where there wasn't an  internet connection. But we will get her back on next week, I hope. Right,  Karsten? She could be here next week. Yes. All right. Good. I will be in Frankfurt. So I'm going

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
