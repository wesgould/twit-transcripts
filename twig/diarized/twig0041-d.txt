Transcript:  This is Tweet.  Bandwidth for This Week in Google is provided by Cashfly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.  This is Tweet.  This Week in Google, episode 41 from May 6, 2010, blinking 12.  It's time for Tweet This Week in Google to show the covers, the Googleverse, and all  the cloud as well.  Joining us, our regular panel of Google wizards, starting with the author of What Would Google  Do?  I'm the professor of journalism at CUNY and a well-known man about town, Mr. Manhattan,  we call him, Jeff Jarvis.  Hey, Jeff.  Good to see you, Leo.  Jeff's blog, BuzzMachine.com.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm in my office in CUNY and I have behind my shoulders my Museum of Dead Technology.  Over there is the Moro Pivot.  Over there is my Osborne One.  Wow.  People are going to think you're old fashioned.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And what is that extra?  You've got a framed newspaper or a broadsuit.  I see it was a store earthquake.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was told from Oakland.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  Was that the call bulletin that you've got there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Oakland Tribune.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Tribune.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very nice.  Gina Smith.  Gina Smith.  Gina Trapani.  My old friend Gina Smith saying, I'm on the show.  Gina Trapani is here.  She is the blogger at SmarterWear.com, kind of the proto blogger, the creator of Lifehacker  and the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave, CompleteWaveGuide.com.  Hello, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hello.  Good day, Mayo.  Oh, yeah.  May 5th, baby, 5-5.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I made the mistake of going to Baja Burritos today.  It was not a good day to go.  John, can you get me a margarita?  We should be drinking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A picture of margaritas all around.  Oh, wait a minute.  You're virtual.  I'll have to drink it all, I guess.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to bring my Corona wet lime, but it's a little early for me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, after all the trouble that Colleen went to to build Skypeasaurus, this four-way  Skype thing, Skype has announced that they're going to do multiple videos in one client  now.  They're going to have five-way video calling starting next week.  Well, it's about time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's great.  It's all because of you, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think they must have listened.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not getting rid of eBay, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe eBay was the problem.  Of course, iChat's done this for some time and there's other products like Oovoo that  do it.  But you know what it might do for us is it might mean that we can then have five people  in each of the four windows.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, sweet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Never get a word in edgewise.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It'll be the gang.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Gilmore would like this.  It's an actual gang.  Gangstas.  Let's take a look at the top stories for Google this week.  So much is all starting to run together.  Did we talk about HP buying Palm last week?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it actually happened during the show.  Okay, that's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because Paul Therot had that story.  So, I'm going to put a flag in the sand there and then everything since then we can talk  about.  I thought this was actually an interesting story and Dana has highlighted this that Facebook  had a little privacy leak.  Shocking.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love their spin on it.  He's practically saying it's a feature, not a bug.  The chat.  This way.  Yeah, we meant for you to be able to see everybody who's asked to follow you.  Facebook security bug allows users to access and view friends, live chats, friend requests  and friends in common.  And this is kind of the scary thing about all of this new stuff on Facebook is it seems  to me that there's so much stuff on there now that they need to double down on their  protecting our privacy and not...  All of these lapses just really terrify me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  After we talked about it the last show, I wrote a post thinking of, just because as  usual the show inspires me, and thinking that they got it kind of just exactly reversed.  What they should do is become our protector of our identities online and make that a business  model.  There you go.  They may have lost too much trust already to do that, but who better to do this than  Facebook?  I think they should start their equivalent of the...  What's the Google thing that allowed them to be sure that things got exported?  The free liberation front.  The free liberation front, that's right.  Right.  Facebook should have an equivalent spokesman for our needs within the culture, because  clearly it ain't happening.  And if they did, I think there's a business opportunity there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, one of the former Facebook security and privacy guys is now running for attorney  general in California.  And on his page he says, yeah, Facebook really ought to get it together.  I mean, to Facebook's credit...  Mark, here's a bust.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We're going to throw you right under that there.  To Facebook's credit about this exploit, it happened when you use that feature where you  can view your profile as one of your friends sees it, which is actually a pretty useful  feature, right?  So if you have like the crazy ex's friend or whatever, you can say, hey, what can he  or she see?  So that is a cool feature.  And that's the feature actually where the exploit happened, right?  You could see, you could temporarily see chat messages and friend requests of someone else's  when you did that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's kind of...  I guess you're right.  That's kind of moner.  But what about Jeff's point that maybe this is an opportunity missed on Facebook's part,  that we'd be much more likely to store stuff there if they'd say, hey, we are the safe,  secure repository of your stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, trust is really Facebook's biggest problem, right?  Like I trust Google.  That's why I'm doing this show.  Even though they scare me a little, they've earned my trust.  Facebook hasn't earned my trust.  They just freaked me out, period.  Which is...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, was that always the case or was there a moment when they did something that violated  that trust or went too far?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I was never really a big Facebook user until recently.  But everyone that I know who was, because I'm involved with a lot of people who are  involved in academia and students and administrators who use Facebook as just like part of the  job because it's just so embedded into that culture and that community.  Right?  You know, there's always been this feeling of mistrust of people that I know who use  Facebook.  You know, my other half calls it fascist book.  I mean, I think it's just kind of this like, it's this like accepted, you know...  Why do you think that is?  Because they change their privacy settings so often.  So that great EFF document, right?  Because they pop up dialogues that say, do you want to keep things the way they were  or do you want to go this way or do you want to import all your likes?  I mean, you could...  They change things a lot.  The options are confusing.  And I think that people have, you know, situations where they see stuff on Facebook that they  realize that they're not supposed to or weren't meant to.  And that that's just because, you know, the privacy settings had changed or they weren't  configured correctly.  And, you know, I really like Jeff's post about, I think that Facebook really needs to turn  things around in terms of trust because I think people are closing their accounts.  In fact, I'd love to see numbers on that.  I don't know if there are.  It does seem to be a trend.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I deactivated my account.  And then I brought...  That speaks volumes.  It does.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does, Leo.  Leo is a trendsetter for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I brought it back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh!

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the reason I brought it back was not because I miss my friends or because I need Facebook  personally, but because professionally I kind of... don't we have to have a presence on  Facebook?  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's why I stayed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did someone yell at you inside the company?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Dane said, what the hell are you doing?  No.  I was going to say, did you deactivate the Twitter page which was tied to my Facebook  account?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing, right?  So you administer pages, right?  Like public pages.  I do the same.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If I could have a public page without my personal account, I would absolutely do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  You know, I was in a session about online identity with Chris Messina this weekend,  this past weekend at Foo East, which is the O'Reilly's get-together in Cambridge.  And we had this kind of conversation.  It's like, okay, everyone in the room is like... isn't comfortable with the idea that Facebook  is becoming the person in charge of your identity.  So the question was like, who should be?  And one of the better answers was Google.  But you know, like...  It's not good either.  I don't think Google's a good choice either.  You know, of course...  Well, is there a startup here?  Is there...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  It already exists.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It already exists.  And this is, I'm sure what Chris Messina said, because he was the OAuth advocate, is that  if you support OpenID...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  OpenID, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can have your page or any page you delegate be the keeper of the keys and use OpenID to  point to it.  And I think that that's a system that exists now.  I have an OpenID page on my twit.tv.  That's my...  Twit.tv is my OpenID page.  It's...  If you use...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think there's an opportunity to create a startup on top of that, using that as a platform.  Well, there is.  Yes, I agree.  We're it for you.  Because the problem is OpenID...  Yeah, it's gotta be easier.  You know, it doesn't do anything.  You need to make this ready for prime time.  And you need to be able to show your presence across the whole web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There are quite a few of such things.  There's claim ID, which is I've used for a long time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I used it once and I haven't kept it up.  Part of the problem is you gotta keep it up.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is the thing, like...  And this was the point that they brought up in the session, is like, there has to be a  compelling reason, right, to use a system for your identity.  And Facebook has a very compelling reason, which is that all your friends and connections  and information are there.  And you see that Facebook Connect button everywhere.  And even Chris said that OpenID is just a little too geeky for...  People had a hard time with the idea that URL represented you versus an email address  because we're used to email address representing you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that's why companies like Jan Rain and OpenID started is, well, we'll make it easy.  We'll help you do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I heard from Rick Clow at Google, ex-blogger.  Now he is the product manager for Google Profile.  And it's been interesting.  He's been talking about this, listening to everything and thinking about it.  And he's brand new to it.  We should maybe have him on and challenge him and say, well, if Google were to try to  go into this area, how should they do it?  And under what principles?  And he's listening to people about it right now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Rick would be a great guest for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Rick's a really good guy.  Remind me, we'll get Dane to get him and book him in as quickly as we can.  I mean, I use Google Profile.  I kind of thought that might be the definitive page.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's where Gina's point is exactly right.  The problem is, I don't know that anybody looks at my Google Profile.  So there isn't that necessity and feedback to doing it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, when?  Well, wait a minute.  If it could, if Google would do the right thing with it, which is make it be the first  result on a search for my name, then it works and everybody sees it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's right.  That's their power.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They use their power for good.  Yeah.  Make it be the...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And I thought that's what the intent was.  I thought so too.  They didn't quite fully commit to it.  I can tell if it's because they're waiting for more people to fill them in.  I'm not sure.  Because it shows up.  Or Leo, it doesn't show up for you at the bottom.  It doesn't show up at all for me because I'm a celebrity, apparently.  You're a celebrity.  Yeah.  But it does show up for common names or regular names of my names at the bottom of the search  results page.  But who scrolls down?  No, it should be number one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're exactly right, Leo.  And that's why I leaped on it.  I thought finally I can control my Google search result.  This is the number one result.  This is what Leo says is the canonical information.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, and you also offer that then.  If Google were to do that right, you offer the same thing to every brand out there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Maybe that's why they don't do it.  Maybe that's why they don't do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, but what would be wrong with that?  As long as, you know, if it's a real brand and a real person, there's not a spam problem  there because it's, you know, who's going to go search for Russian Viagra?  Right.  I got to have the Russian Viagra site.  Well, maybe.  Well, maybe.  Fine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you do, fine.  That's where we're going to go.  The problem is, but Wikipedia solved this.  The problem is ambiguation.  But Wikipedia has a disambiguation page.  If there's 14 Jeff Jarvis's, they list all 14 and say this one, this one, this one, this  one or this one.  And you click the one you want.  Google would have to do something like that as well.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I didn't know what I could have myself lately.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think there's only one Jeff Jarvis.  I was just being optimistic.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The talented Jeff Jarvis is a jazz musician.  The fun Jeff Jarvis runs Segway Tours in Thailand.  The smart Jeff Jarvis is a professor with a doctorate in Australia of tourism.  Wow.  I'm just the blathering Jeff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's a Google employee named Jason Chen.  God help him.  Oh dear.  But if you search for Jason Chen, like you'll see Jason, the Gizmodo editor and Jason, the  Google employee and you know, at the bottom of the.  So they do offer some sort of disambiguation.  And it will say the name, their location and their title.  So you can say, oh, that's Jason from Fremont who works for Gizmodo.  This is weird.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've got, there's four profiles for Jeffrey Jarvis at the bottom of the Jeff Jarvis search.  Three of them are mine.  How the hell I ended up with more than one?  I have no idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Different email addresses?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Huh.  That's strange.  I don't actually see it at all.  Where is, maybe it's Jeff.  Just Jeff Jarvis?  Jeff Jarvis, yeah.  Oops.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's some Marine.  That's the, that's the masculine Jeff Jarvis.  Oh yeah, there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  United States Marine Corps, Cooney Graduate School of Journalism, Cooney Journalism Professor.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think Leo, I think you just hit on it.  I think you hit on the secret to identity.  You need to, you and Gina together, right?  Gina says you need some reason to do it with positive feedback.  You gave Google the positive feedback.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They've got to, they've got to use their power for good there.  And that's how they fight against Facebook.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, cause I would trust, I mean, Google profiles, I was willing to trust.  I put everything in there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I could buy some more Google stock right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's a different kind of trust by the way, because on Facebook you put things like,  what's your relationship status?  Yeah.  You know, and there's this whole social graph of who you know, who they know.  That's what was leaked out, right?  And that's what you really go to.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did you guys see the EFF page where they looked at Facebook's eroding privacy policy timeline?  If you read the privacy policy in 2005, it is this quote, no personal information that  you submit to the Facebook will be available to any user of the website who does not belong  to at least one of the groups specified by you in your privacy settings period.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's how it should be.  That's good.  And now 2006, we give you control.  But the default privacy settings are considerably broader even a year later.  Limit the information displayed in your profile to your school, your specified local area  and other reasonable community limitations that we tell you about, but not here.  Then it goes, your name, school name, profile picture, thumbnail will be available in search  results across the Facebook network unless you alter your privacy settings.  That's 2007.  By the way, it's also getting, they're getting longer and longer.  There's more to reveal.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And glazed eyes.  Is that Facebook started with private information and got more public.  Google started dealing with public information and then started offering services that dealt  private information like Gmail and stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Get ready for this.  Here's the current policy.  When you connect with an application or website, it will have access to general information  about you.  The term.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I love this soothing radio voice.  It's perfect.  Perfect.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't worry.  The term general information includes your and your friends' names, profile pictures,  gender, user IDs, connections and any content shared using the everyone privacy setting.  The default privacy setting for certain types of information you post on Facebook is set  to everyone.  As it takes two to connect your privacy settings only control who can see the connection on  your profile page.  If you're uncomfortable with the connection being publicly available, you should consider  removing or not making the connection.  In other words, you want to protect yourself on Facebook, don't use it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's where we're headed here.  They're going to kill their own golden goose because they want us to connect more.  If we stop connecting us of all these fears, then the value of Facebook declines.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now he's growling.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I might deactivate again.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was talking to a friend who has teenage sons who was saying that her kids have figured  out that you can change your name on Facebook and that they kind of play games with the  relationship stuff like saying that they're married to their teacher or to their...  They list a sibling who's a friend.  My nephews I noticed do similar things.  They set silly names and they say they live in different crazy places and are related  to other people who they're absolutely not related to.  That's kind of fun to think about how the younger generation is disrupting Facebook's  stuff.  They get it.  They get it.  They get it.  They get it.  Go ahead.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're turning the data bad.  Right.  In fact, there's something that college bound seniors are doing is changing their Facebook  name to some handle so that the college can't search for their name and see their Facebook  information.  My daughter told me that they were doing that and that's very widespread.  The thing is this information spreads immediately to all the kids.  They know how to handle this.  It's people like, frankly, it's old farts like us that are getting bit because we have  certain different expectations.  What's her name was saying at South by Southwest?  Dana Boyd.  Dana Boyd.  Our generation has a different expectation than their generation about privacy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  There was also a video out by the American Library Association this week for modern privacy  month and Cory Doctor, whom I respect immensely, is on there.  I also think that there's this fear thing about privacy.  Everything's going to be locked down.  My next book now is going to be about the benefits of publicness and I think we risk  giving up all these connections we can now make.  That's the beauty of the web.  Well, I agree.  We have to learn from our children about those connections.  We have to teach them the risks and dangers, yes, but I think there's a lot to be learned

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  there.  But they're figuring it out and they're saying, oh, okay, we just give phony names, phony  connections.  We are in control.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the key to it and Facebook forgets that at its peril.  There's an old big goody, maybe this is too old for, but I just put on the chat to you,  a 2008 video about the human Facebook.  Yes.  You remember seeing that one at the time?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Should I play it?  I don't know.  Yeah, it's too old.  It's two years old.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Facebook in reality.  We'll put it up on the...  It really is wonderful.  We basically Facebook...  You know what?  I don't know.  It might even still be apropos.  I'll just play a little bit of the audio.  Just play it for you.  Because you'll get the idea pretty quickly.  They're hammering at the door.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello?  Poke!  Edward Banks, I'm here.  Poke!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Edward Baxter, it's me, Todd from school.  We sat next to each other in maths.  We didn't get on, remember?  Yeah.  Do you want to be my friend?  What?  Do you want to be my friend, confirm or ignore?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where did we meet?  You know where we met.  Do you want to skip this step?  We met at school.  How about we say we met on an oil rig and we were lovers for 50 years?  That's not true.  It's a joke!  It's like a really brilliant joke.  Can I get confirmation on that, please?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I get confirmation on that, please?  No.  Okay, are you in a relationship?  I've got to come.  Is it complicated?  It's complicated.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What are you looking for?  Friendship, dating, whatever you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's just say random play.  Because that could mean anything.  Like, really, really kinky, horrible...  What's he doing?  Writing on your wall.  I love it.  It's really...  It's great.  It hasn't changed that much.  But what that was, the people who first came to Facebook, kind of shock at the whole thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's sad is that now, so many people have used Facebook for so long, we're inured to  that side of it, and so we just kind of accept it all.  And I think that that's really the great risk is that we've changed.  I feel like we've changed a lot, just a little bit, and that's what we've been able to do.  You know, it's been a lot of fun.  And I think that that's really the great risk is that we've just kind of gone, oh, okay,  that's the way it is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to go back to your brilliant idea.  The two of you can claim a patent for this together, I think.  But the problem is that the more our identity becomes Facebook's property, the more we feel  free to lie about it.  The more the canonical me is my property, the more truthful I'm going to be about it  because it's me.  It affects me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You wouldn't lie on your Google profile.  Why bother?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  Well, then the problem becomes, well, yes, I lie, but I lie to pump myself up.  Oh, okay.  And you need something to check against that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's my resume.  Another matter entirely.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But at some point, you know, I think we have to own our own identities, and when we do,  that will maintain the highest value possible for them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  So, a great subject, and I'm glad that...  You solved the problem, you guys.  I'm glad we fixed it.  So, did Chris Messina say anything else?  He works at Google now, we should mention.  What is his title there?  He's kind of in charge of open social stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Open person.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Open social guru person.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, look Chris.  We didn't really come up with conclusions.  It was more just like trying to figure out how do we get to this place with Facebook.  At one point, you know, Tantik Chelluk brought up a good point, which is that Facebook will  be disrupted by another startup that we can't even predict.  You know, that it used to be, you know, Friendster, and then it was Orca, then it was MySpace.  You know, back in the day, we never thought anyone would overtake MySpace.  Now it's Facebook, and that most likely it'll be some other small startup that will, you  know, upend Facebook at some point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I would invest in that.  I mean, I'd damn near start a venture fund for identity right now.  I think that there's a huge opportunity that Facebook is weak.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What would you...  Where would the opportunity be?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it starts with services that help you maintain your own identity, to give you  control over...  This is the reality where we are right now, is our identities are what you find online  about us.  Right.  And so how can I manage that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's an SEO for me.  Jeff, that's huge.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Try it again.  It's an SEO for me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's huge though.  SEO for me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  But that...  And that's our concern as geeks with resumes, right?  I mean, as like media personalities who want to be found.  But for people who use Facebook, for most people, the value is the social thing and  the identity thing is just kind of this byproduct.  You know what I mean?  Like how many people...  I don't know.  I'd be interested to know what's the market?  Like how many people are concerned about your identity?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It would be a big market as soon as it becomes widespread that people...  I hear from people all the time that somebody's writing something about me on a webpage or...  I mean, I think people more and more are going to want to control what is known about, what  is canonical information and what is not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  And in a sense, Google tried to attack it but reversed.  It was like I think Facebook got the bizarro wrong version of what they did.  The Open Connect wasn't open.  Same here, Sidewiki tried to say, well, you can go to that site now and you can leave  a comment there whether they like it or not.  Saying this or that.  Well, that's not the point.  I don't want to necessarily control my distributed identity because I can't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to give you one that is mine, that is official.  But that's what claim ID...  I mean, truth is, that's what claim ID...  So why isn't it more widely used?  Why is...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because that's where, Leo, you added the secret sauce to it.  It's because no one uses it.  No one goes there.  I have to maintain it.  How would you know it's there?  It's going to get stale.  Whereas if I knew that the first thing you're going to see on a search for me is this thing,  I'm going to maintain it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So only Google can do this then.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Only Google can do it.  I mean, Facebook could do it too because that's why I maintain my page.  That's what Gina said.  That's what put these two together in something very big.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what maybe we need to just kind of keep telling Facebook.  What's interesting is I think for the vast majority of people, Facebook is their webpage.  Yes.  Right.  So that's what's really happening here is that it's as if GeoCities came to you and  said, okay, make your own webpage.  And now anything that you put on that webpage, we're going to sell and we're going to manipulate  and we're going to make public in ways that you didn't know unless you explicitly tell  us not to.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or it's like LinkedIn, you know, predecessor to Facebook comes along and says, oh, well,  now we're going to reveal to the whole world all the contacts you have and everything else  about your career and everything else that you only intended for people you had connections  with to see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it's not just selling.  It's just it's the same mistake that Google made with Buzz.  It mixed the public and private.  What occurred to me this week too was that in Facebook, I can make my own public.  I can decide who to connect with.  In Twitter, I can decide what publics I belong to, whom to follow.  The fatal flaw in Buzz was, okay, here's a ready made public for you.  We know you're public.  Here it is.  Right.  And in a sense, Facebook's doing the same thing now by saying, well, we're going to  make you public in these ways that then you can go fix it if you want.  And it doesn't give me sufficient control.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It gives you you have to jump in and fix it after the fact.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Somebody said in a brilliant headline, I think I said this in the last week show that privacy  settings are the new setting your VCR.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nobody, nobody knows how to do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I say that to young people and they say, wow, what's the VCR?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're all blinking 12 now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We're all blinking 12.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe that's what I need is a blinking 12 in graphic on my Facebook page.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can't figure this out.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, so your second one more thing, Leo.  So your backup to destroying or disabling your Facebook identity is to erase everything  on it and denuded it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to eliminate the personal page entirely.  That sucks.  And then I'm going to take the there's I have two pages.  I have Leo G Laporte, which is friends and family.  I'm going to just kill that.  And then I have LG Laporte, which is the tied to the twit page and the Leo Laporte public  fan page and all that.  I have to keep that alive.  Otherwise, the twit page and the fans.  But really, all I want is fan pages.  Right. This is really all I want.  That would solve people.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what the Internet is about is making connections with people.  That's what Facebook enabled.  That was its entire value.  And they're giving up that they are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're changed. They changed their business model, basically.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really it's it's I don't think they realize what they're doing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think they do. It's interesting when they did the first steps in this direction  about a year ago, we actually streamed the press conference live.  Scoble had a laptop that was holding it up.  And then I asked Dave Morin and I can't remember who else from Facebook.  I said. You you you didn't go far.  You know, you kind of have took a half step towards making this public facing,  but you didn't go all the way, which makes it less useful.  Why didn't you? And he said, well, we have this contract with our users.  And I said, well, you know, you have a choice here between being,  you know, classmates dot com or being Twitter.  And it looks like you're heading towards Twitter,  but you're not kind of scared of going on the way.  And he said, yes, we are.  Obviously, they lost that fear.  And they and they realized that this is where this is where they wanted to be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They didn't define evil. Right.  Right. Google defines if Google loses our trust, they lose the whole game.  That's what that's what the equation really is.  And enabling their employees to stop them from doing that in their own protection  is what don't be evil is all about.  And that meant that you had a common and shared definition of evil inside Google.  Developing. Sure. But but pretty common.  People could add to it if they got critical mass.  It strikes me that Facebook didn't define evil. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true. Good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if they don't define it, it will be defined for them, I guess.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Keep going. We're going to change this.  The name of the show to Twif.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, this week in Facebook.  It's all the cloud, baby.  All right. Well, let's talk about Google.  Google is given once again,  I guess they're always tweaking their search results, a little facelift  to the search results. What's changed, Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I couldn't tell you.  I was first because the problem is I don't get it on the actual page.  I see it on the official Google blog. Not not there.  That's that's the issue for me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're they're kind of rolling it out.  They seem to be tweaking that options panel on the left side,  which I have to say, I really kind of how I wonder how many searchers  actually click that show options.  But what's interesting is that instead of just it just being a list of links,  there are now like little icons, this little color there, which is

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  blogs, images, books.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think, you know, this is a little being a little bingish.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is a little bingish.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is it an option anymore? Is it just show up there?  And the screen image that they have up there screen grab, I don't see any close.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's no clothes. It's it's now no longer an option.  It all they also said, we'll know the difference between,  let's say, Gossip Girl and Times Square Bomb will show,  you know, if you do Gossip Girl will show things that seem to be appropriate  for a television show.  And since if you search for Times Square Bomb, you're going to see things  that will be appropriate. It seems like the same things.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you're right.  So sorry, Gina, go ahead.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, no, I was going to say, you're right.  They must be just be rolling it out because I'm one in one computer.  I'm not getting it on the other. I am getting it.  And the one I am getting on, there's no hide show options anymore.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It just shows up. You get it now. This is it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Strategically, I think this is where Google has to go in a few ways.  One, it's going to go more and more and more to personalize  targeted, more relevant search.  Right. And which is going to start to kill the dark art of SEO, I think.  And and they want more signals from us  so that they can be more relevant to us.  And I think this also goes to what Matt Cutts said on the show,  you know, some weeks ago when we talked about demand media  and how Google has to find two things.  One is the signal for more original content.  The other is a signal for more quality content.  And I think that they've got to fight back against SEO  in a strategic way to say that the whole idea of gaming us  the same for everybody isn't going to work anymore.  The more signals they have of what we want and relevance,  the less SEO is going to work and the less those tricks are going to work.  I think. But I read too much into Google all the time.  That's what I do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You give them so much credit.  Well, it looks like what what they've done here is

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I thought Buzz would work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I did, too. I still keep using Buzz.  I love Buzz. I want Buzz to work.  Silly us. Silly, silly fools.  So what they've done is is you still have more search tools,  which exposes the real time stuff and a lot of the drill down stuff.  So you do have a drop down.  But what they've now said is always you'll see these kind of four  extra categories, everything, news, videos and updates, these filters.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So they're still on the top now.  It was moved, those actually, if I go to.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and they're still on the top. Look, you're right.  That's interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's interesting. It's quite a bit of UI for for for Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe Marissa Meyer took the week off.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it feels like a lot of UI for what used to be textbox and button.  But, you know, maybe this is just them kind of, you know, tweaking and.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really what you don't want to do is have this same thing  as on the top duplicated down the side.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you know them, they're going to A.B.  test the hell out of it.  Yeah, they definitely are.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And there's something very eye catchy about those icons.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, we've learned this.  I think Twitter taught us this images are very important.  And you know, you got to have a picture.  It's just how the human mind works.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I suspect I'll get rid of the stuff on the top.  But it's weird, too, that that they saw on the top.  So you see what matters to them.  Images. Yeah.  They don't miss shopping.  Books, blogs, updates, discussion, those are all under the extra.  They're hidden. Yeah.  Now, if I just search for McDonald's, I mean, look for times where bomber.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what you get?  You get a little bit.  You have updates, the changes, the changes, the updates, the adaptive menu.  And this is a new link updates.  I don't know what that means.  I guess. Oh, this is the real time stuff.  This is the tweets. That's tweets. Yeah.  OK, that's interesting.  Now, it's not just tweets, by the way.  Here's friend feed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I presume Facebook better be in there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Still looking for buzz.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't see it. Right hand left hand.  I don't see buzz in there. No buzz.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Twitter, Facebook and friend feed.  But no buzz. Jesus.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wow. We have a committee meeting, folks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, this is what happens at Microsoft, by the way,  is you get these fiefdoms fighting with one another.  And I wonder if that's what's happening, if that's what's happening.  Can't be. Can't be.  I do like it that it's real time, that they're scrolling real time.  I think that's the nice thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  People are talking about the Times Square, Bobber.  They're just asking.  And it's not there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of Twitter.  There is Facebook. There is friend feed.  I mean, why would you include friend feed and not include buzz?  Maybe buzz doesn't, you know, it may be a lack in the API.  I mean, you think they have that internal API.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's what's holding buzz back.  Yeah, they're still developing it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Got to work on that API, guys, at least get us a third party.  Yeah, for your own sake. Yeah. Yeah.  They may not have a fire hose, you know,  which is obviously what this is working with.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's funny that I didn't know you could get this.  You get a fire hose of Facebook out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what one of the things that was changed recently, you know,  you could get the fire hose, but you'd have to delete the cash results  after 24 hours.  So it was kind of a limited utility.  Who wants to get a fire hose that you have to keep track of how old the data is  and throw it out after 24 hours?  They changed that last week or two weeks ago.  And now you can keep it forever.  So I would not surprise that Google didn't include it until that time,  because now it's in their search. It's indexed like everything else.  But you've got to wonder, I mean, if they're putting, let me find  one of those Facebook results and see.  It's taken me back to a link from Mother Jones.  Dot com.  I wonder that there's the Facebook link is not hot.  I guess I'll have to click the actual link.  Does that take me to Facebook? It does.  And it takes me to a Facebook fan page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hmm. And by the way, I'm not signed in.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't see any Facebook updates.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did I like it? Damn.  No, I try to stay unsigned into Facebook.  It's not easy, believe me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, there's a there's a Facebook.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Interesting.  Now, and now gossip girl, there's there's updates,  but it's under the, you know, the extra thing.  You have to if to unfold it.  There's a Facebook and that takes me to.  Some person's site.  Name Gossip Girl, but it's not the gossip girl.  It's a gossip girl.  That's confusing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The Facebook's open graph API makes this,  you know, indexing public pages, especially public posts, much easier.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what is a public post?  Is it anybody who has said my wall is available to everybody?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, but I think mostly you're going to see pages like fan pages are public.  Right. That's what we're seeing now.  Yeah. So the posts and the comments there are all indexable.  And like you said, ever since I've eight, they announced that  that applications have no limit on how long they can cache data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So let me just see if I on my Facebook page say what the  hell is Gossip Girl.  Now, with that automatically, I mean, what is what is PageRank doing with that?  How does it know whether include that in its gossip girl results?  Just I mean, do we even know what it's doing?  I mean, it's not obviously everything about gossip girl.  I mean, let me go. Maybe I made it. Let's see.  It can't be because I mean, there must be millions of tweets  every minute about Gossip Girl.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, probably.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. So there's some some some food going on that we don't know about.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's Twitter just has such a me, a friend of mine,  an investor in a company called Amplicate, and they put up pages that just  suss out whether a company rocks, sucks or rocks.  And puts that up. And I was talking to him at lunch today.  And the data that you can get out of that, you can just start to realize  who likes more stuff, who liking is a huge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's what dig.  That's what Kevin Rose figured out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's the interesting thing about the Facebook like thing.  Ricky Thomas, my friend, and he said that Ricky said that that every  the volume of dislikes is so much greater than likes.  Right. Sucks is much greater than rocks. Right.  Yet what did Facebook enable?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Likes. No sucks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's no sucking in our world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, maybe they did that on purpose.  But if I mean, doesn't that skew the results if people are just going,  oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you know, advertisers.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, advertisers. Yeah.  Well, but wait, you know, I thought dig did a brilliant thing,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  which was it lets you go thumbs up or thumbs down on the ads.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's not what Facebook is going to do.  I was brilliant.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And dig says it's working for us because the advertisers love to know this.  They don't show ads to people who don't like the ads.  They don't want to annoy them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I agree. But but but but every ad salesperson I know would  your throat. Oh, and I have to say the story came in.  What happened was USA the insurance company.  And I'm a customer of theirs and pissed at them right now.  They came in, they sent a cease and desist letter to Amplicate saying,  take down this negative page about USA.  They even mentioned them as a use of their trademark and blah, blah, blah.  Right. Stupid.  The great thing about this was if they had to take down the negative page,  they have to go on the positive page.  And the positive page had like 10 times the number of posts  that the negative page did.  Stupid, closed out lawyers ruining the world.  You know, didn't realize that this notion that you can control your brand  on all that alone.  I know ads salespeople I deal with would just would, you know,  would scream about what they did.  Yeah, he's right. But that's really.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Google has said it's going to go into ebook sales  this later this year.  I wanted you guys to comment on the story because I'd like to know what this means.  It doesn't seem to me that they're going, although all the press said,  oh, they're going after Apple and Kindle, but they're not going to have.  They can't possibly be getting random house bestsellers on here.  This is going to be their Google Book Search stuff, right?  This is going to be the public domain stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know that article that I read.  I'm actually trying to find it.  It said that it sounded like they would be striking deals  with different publishers to sell ebooks.  So I don't think that this is just the.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is also the mechanism to sell the orphan or the old out of print books.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what I thought it was.  That's what I thought it was.  The journal says publishers have yet to publicly comment  or publicly, I'm sorry, commit to participate in the service.  But Google isn't expected to run into much trouble getting them to join.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is they hate Amazon?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But wait a minute. I thought there was no copy protection in this.  Is there DRM? Yes, there is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can't. Yeah.  No, no. Google said that they would.  If I come into Google search, Google Book Search, right?  And I find this mention of Greek history that you listen to in lectures.  Leo, I want to I want to look more of that book.  It will stop me before a certain number of pages.  Now Google will have the opportunity to sell me the book.  And that was part of the settlement was what share they would then give  publisher, what share Google would take. OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why don't they just use the Amazon affiliates program?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because this this this lets them fight up against Amazon  because because the publishers hate Amazon.  I was at my editor's office this week and well, you mentioned Amazon in there  and they just I can't say anything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really? Really? Yeah. Interesting.  Why? Because Amazon sets the price.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the apple of print. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not anymore. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, the cool thing about Google Editions, right, is that they're  they're saying that it's platform agnostic, right?  So they're going to you're going to read the books in a browser or whatever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why there can't be copy protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, well, how would you do that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because the Kindle uses one thing.  Apple uses another thing.  A browser does a third.  I don't know. Can they do cross platform DRM?  I don't think so.  Does it say anything about DRM in here?  Because I'll tell you what, I know for a fact, no publisher  is going to do it without DRM. Absolutely right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Well, I mean, the DRM could be I need to be signed into my Google account  in order to read the books that I purchased.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like HBO everywhere.  Well, how would I do that on a Kindle?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's that's maybe that's one you don't do near near near Amazon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, but no, the only device I could do that on is a web browser.  It wouldn't work on an iPad.  It wouldn't work on a Kindle and it wouldn't work.  Might work on an iPad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, they said that the company could also build.  This is all just speculation.  Google could also build software to optimize reading on certain devices  like an iPhone or an iPad.  It hasn't announced any specific plans.  So, I mean, it's just kind of an interesting.  It'll be interesting to see what happens.  I wonder if this is going to if anything's going to be announced about this at I.O.  along with the TV announcement that's supposed to come as well.  But but it's interesting that just the different approaches, right?  Like Amazon launches this reader and then and then every single book,  you know, ebook that they sell only you can only get on on on the Kindle.  Well, what was taking the open approach?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's your sense then?  Would publishers I mean, are we  we're in a post-DRM world in music are is both our books next.  Will publishers be willing to sell books without DRM because they hate Amazon so much?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  No, good question.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a big log to leap over.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, I mean, I'm just think I just think there's technical issues to doing DRM  if they're going to do that cross platform.  It's EPUB. They're going to use EPUB.  EPUB can support DRM, but it's but it's done differently, I think, on all these devices.  I don't know. Maybe I'm maybe I'm full of it.  I'm curious, though.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if it's a technical problem that needs to be solved,  I think Google could probably solve it.  I mean, maybe it's maybe we're talking about a browser plug-in.  That's kind of annoying because, you know, right.  You don't know how it works.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And just now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hmm.  Twitter has launched a I don't know, is this going to be your tip?  Gina, I don't want to steal your tip.  Twitter is going to launch or Twitter has launched its Android app.  They did not license Seismic or any other app, Twit Droid.  They did their own thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, they did. Well, or they bought.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we don't know. It doesn't say.  And it's not clear. It's nothing I've ever seen before.  And I thought I'd used every Android client for Twitter.  It's got a nice little floating cloud thing going over there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does have floating clouds.  The floating clouds annoyed me, so I turned them off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you can turn them off.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can turn them off.  And if you go into settings, uncheck animate background.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I always. Yeah.  I just it looked like they spent more energy on that  than actually making a competent client, for instance,  I think very important to me to tell me maybe I missed this setting.  I like notifications, but I only want to be  notificated, notificated about direct messages.  And and most of these Twitter, a lot of Twitter clients,  it's either on or off.  But the ones I use like Twit Droid and Seismic,  you can be notified just for DMs.  Can you do that in this client or is notification globally on or off?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can do it. So in settings, under notifications,  you can set it to notify you about new tweets, new mentions or new DMs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's I just want DMs. I don't want mentions.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So you can uncheck the other two and just get.  Yeah. And you can have the notification light, you know, glow, get glowy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Mentions, DMs, you vibrate or not notify light.  Oh, good. I missed that. That's good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ringtone. And it supports multiple accounts.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does not.  This that's that's one of my that's my main complaint about it.  It does not support multiple accounts unless I miss that.  You know, I like the I like the UI of it.  The multiple accounts thing is a problem.  What I really like is that it integrates your Twitter  contacts with your Android contacts.  So, you know, if I'm going to call Adam, like, you know, that are at Lifehacker  and I pull up his contact, I can see he doesn't use Facebook,  but I can see his last Twitter update, which is great, because you can be like,  you know, if the last Twitter update was like, I took my dog Puffy to the,  you know, to the vet, I can say, hey, how's Puffy? Right.  That that kind of six.  That's using Twitter, which is the contact integration is super sweet.  And that the Facebook app does that as well.  So when I when when I saw that Facebook did that, when to one came out,  I was like, oh, I want this for Twitter, because most of my friends use Twitter.  And what I also the other thing that I really like and Leo,  maybe this is going on in other clients and I just missed it to turn on location  when you tweet is a is a one, you know, is a is a toggle that's that's on by  default, which is kind of sweet by default, which is an issue.  And it's on by default, which is an issue, but it's a very simple.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't have to do it on a per tweet basis. You can do it globally.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Where do I get to that?  No, no, it actually it is on a per tweet basis.  Now where? Oh, that that the.  Where is that? So now I'm so yeah, location off location on.  It's a little toggle button next to create.  Oh, I didn't see that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, this is this is a site designed for people with good eyes and skinny fingers.  A fat finger problem is really a problem on this thing is you want to get  into that little tiny thing and then since I run with it all the time,  that's kind of my problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like it, too, Gina, but it's kind of my problem with the Nexus one in general  and the Android in general is it's a little bit fiddly.  A little digitizer needs to be better.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There is a type of spacebar needs to be moved away from the keys.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. I'm reinstalling it.  I went back to seismic. I'm reinstalling it.  I do, you know, I turn on location generally globally,  but you're right, if you're at home and you don't want people to know where your home is,  that's not a good idea. Right.  You should have control over that.  It's the beat problem. Yeah.  Yeah, because you'll forget at some point. Someday you'll forget. I have.  Kevin Marks made a good point, which is that the Twitter this Twitter

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  client tracks on red tweets and on red mentions.  That's important.  That unread number, which is generally like different than what Twitter has done up until now.  Right up until now, it's just kind of been this stream that flows by and you don't have that like unread tweet guilt thing happening.  So I don't know. That's something I wish that you could turn on and off.  I look. I'll see things on my desktop, you know, and look at my phone and be like,  Oh, I got to look at these things again because they're listed as on red.  I think on a phone, one of the things I look for in a Twitter client is that it will cache previous tweets.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that if you haven't lost, you know, a lot of them, it's just, well, this is what you saw when you logged in last time.  And this is what you saw this time. And I want to keep I want to kind of keep it running.  Tweety, you would show you the jagged line to show you there's something missing here and you can download it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, or maybe that's seismic seismic does that I think.  No, Tweet does that.  Some of them do this better than others. But others, you just suddenly jump.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You lost. You lost. I don't know what happened then.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. You can't get it.  There's a there's a sync Twitter data checkbox in the set up.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Twitter data checkbox in the settings. I believe that that is the other.  So there's some contacts and there's sync Twitter data.  So I'm not sure what sync Twitter data does, actually.  I think you're right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Contact sync is the killer feature.  Yeah, that's that's worth installing it considering it's free and then just not using it.  If you wanted to use something else, at least you're going to have the contact sync in there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Right. And you get the choice to sync with only the contacts you already have on your phone, all your Twitter friends or not to include Twitter data with your contacts.  So that's pretty sweet.  And I think that Froyo is actually going to have Twitter capabilities built in.  So you're going to be able to tweet something like from core code in Android, which is which is really nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think I was just kind of it was the blue user interface in the floating clouds.  It really turned me off. So I'm going to take a few frou frou frou frou frou.  I've been using to a droid, which has the world's ugliest icon on Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, there's an old Bobby Slayton joke, a comedian that no no man can sound masculine ordering a patty melt.  It's the same problem here. No, none of us can sound masculine saying Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I could just use Bobby and his gravelly voice saying that I just I love Bobby Slayton.  Reply, retweet, favorite chair. And of course, you know, among other things, you're going to have to use, I'm sure, Twitter's retweet instead of the via.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I love the fact that I have the choice in Seismic.  Yeah, which one is it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Almost all of them allow you the choice now.  But of course, Twitter is not because they want everybody to use their their retweet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And that share that share button, which I never really played with before.  What does that do? So I use paper droid, which is like to read it later.  You can you can actually save a tweet to your read it later list, which is huge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Not only that, but if you've installed things like PixelPipe, I can save it to share it with Seismic, which is a little disorienting.  That's fantastic. And I can send it to Delicious.  I can send it to it doesn't do insta paper. I'm an insta paper guy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If you if you have I'm not sure maybe I have to install insta paper on install insta paper or an app that supports the paper.  I'm not sure if there's an app that that supports it.  I use paper droid, which which supports later, which I use.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You use read it later. Yeah, yeah.  So it does see what you've got. I can even do it to Google Buzz or this is great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And that share menu is totally pluggable by any whatever app you install.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't have Delicious on my on my share menu.  I must have something installed then that.  So how do I? Yeah. What do I have to install?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Delicious? I don't know. No, I don't think so.  I don't know why Delicious is in there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You have it on yours. All right. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you have it on yours? No, I don't.  I have Delicious Facebook, Twitter, email, Evernote, for example, which you guys maybe put on.  I have Hawker. Yeah, we made you put that on there.  Yeah, I had Evernote. Evernote I got.  I have Google Buzz on mine. Yeah.  I have WordPress. LastPass, PixelPipe Pro.  It might be PixelPipe Pro installed that because that that sends to a lot of places.  That's and can I change the font size?  Because I'm an old man. Yeah, it's so tiny.  Really tiny, tiny little text.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't think I don't think it does it. You can view a tweet on a map.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's pretty sweet. These kids today, they just don't understand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't understand. You know, I couldn't.  We have. Now, what is this tag?  Don't be scared. Are these trending topics?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, they're like they're trending topics or too much too much sugar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't turn that on. A lot of animation.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  See, even with the clouds turned off, those those those little bubbles.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't like clouds. I'm like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does anybody know this is interesting?  Does anybody pay any attention to these hashtags anymore?  No, because they're all some some like sub teens have gotten a hold of them or something.  Yeah, they're not. They're like Jonas quote.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, they got they got hijacked by the general public, which is fine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A real people are using them. Oh, that is the problem. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there's the problem.  The other good thing that this client does is it will embed.  So if there's somebody includes like a twit pic link, it will embed the thumbnail of the photos.  You can actually see the photo in line with tweets.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, OK. That's that's another killer feature.  I really like that. And most of the clients I use like Brasley or on the iPad, I use Twitter.  If it will do in line, I think that's really great.  Yeah. Hard on the old phone. But I guess I guess it's small.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's pretty small. But you can get it. You get a sense of what's happening.  It's a little bigger than the person's icon avatar image.  So it's small.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there you go. And of course, when you search now for Twitter, it's the first thing shows up because it's called Twitter.  Yep. So that's what everybody was afraid of.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a big it was a big week for Android apps in general.  Right. So so the Twitter client came out and drop box.  Am I going to steal your OK. Go ahead.  Oh, no, I won't steal your tool. Go ahead.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Go ahead. Steal my tool. It's OK. Dropbox and Mint. Go ahead.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sorry. No, no, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Dropbox and Mint. We might as well talk about them. We're talking about apps right now.  Mint. I've been waiting for Mint. I'm so pleased.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Me too. Me too. Really happy about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you're the one who got me back into Mint because I wouldn't use Mint because I was afraid of giving them all my stuff.  And then you you did the research and you blogged about it on SmartMachine.org and said, oh, no, they're using Yodly like all the banks do.  OK, go ahead. Yeah.  Gina said it was OK.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And the good news is that if someone breaks into your account and steals out your money, you'll get an alert about it.  That's how I look at it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  At least you'll know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Assuming their email system doesn't go down.  Right. Or in my case, take the email system.  Take down the email alert system if you decide to break into the system.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  First thing to disable. So there's not a lot of settings in here.  It's a pretty basic set of settings, but you can change the notifications.  You can turn off the animation.  You can at least say I want to use Bitly and I presume I can give it my API.  No, I can't.  OK, that's a flaw.  So it'll let me use Bitly for my URL shortening service.  But I like to be able to say, well, OK, but use my Bitly account as well so I can track it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Right. Yeah.  The URL shortening service and the photo upload service.  Also, the choices are a bit limited.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I always use YFrog because I don't like it that they named it Twit Pick.  That's just a little thing of mine. You don't have to do that.  All right. It's OK.  You know, but I have to say that the couple of good killer features are inline photos and sync with your contacts.  That's good. Nice job.  Dropbox, I think is significant.  Dropbox did an iPad version and did a Android version.  And what that means is really they're bringing cloud cloud storage to these platforms, particularly important for the iPad.  Very important.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what Apple should have done.  I think they did.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google Docs needs to be as good as Dropbox is.  I agree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, you can't upload any arbitrary file.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can, but they have to do the kind of computer to computer syncing that Dropbox does so instantly.  I use a Mac and a PC side by side and I save things to a Dropbox between them.  And it's literally instantaneous with the desktop clients.  And I imagine the same thing will be with the iPad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And if you have a file in here, you can then get into other applications by opening them from those applications.  You know, it's pretty flexible.  It's they have camera settings.  That's too bad.  This is the iPad version.  This is this really is cloud storage for the iPad and now for the Android phone.  It's on the iPad.  It's on the Android.  It's on Mac.  It's on Windows.  It's everywhere.  We use Dropbox all the time.  I paid for a 50 gig box because it's just a very handy thing to have.  I don't think I've been trying to.  I don't think I thought MP3s would play.  I don't know if they do.  Maybe it's just.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, that's an interesting question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me see, because that's pretty cool if you can have Dropbox storage with an MP3 in it.  I don't hear anything coming out.  It did launch QuickTime, though.  I don't hear any sound.  So maybe it just doesn't do that.  That's something they could fix.  So I think that the Apple lets you do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And then Apple will let you play.  Apple will.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I believe Apple permits that.  You'll have to check.  All right.  All right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did you see Ellen Jenaris got in trouble for her iPhone?  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She did a parody of the iPhone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was a parody ad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And first of all, Apple has no standing to say anything about it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I miss this.  What did she do?  Did she do a skit on her show?  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it was OK.  It was a little long.  But she said, boy, I'll do everything.  And then she can't do anything.  She can't figure it out.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoops.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And she actually apologized, which is the next day and apologized, which maybe mean that  she just wants to keep getting free laptops or it may.  I mean, because there's no.  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is that since our last show, the John Stewart appeal to Steve Jobs?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, God, I think that's a that's a that's a sea change for the company.  I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tell us about it.  I think most everybody in this audience has surely seen it where Stewart just said, I  love you.  I love you, Steve.  I love Apple.  But, you know, don't go Howard Hughes on us.  You know, what's this world happening?  You're bashing down doors and and Commandant Gates is is putting up mosquito nets because

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  this world is backwards.  He called them App holes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was really brilliantly, accurately devastating.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought I'll play a little bit of it.  Why not?  John, you won't sue me, will you?  Comedy Central loves twig.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Halfway up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We got a barn burner show tonight.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can't watch this on an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At that point, Gizmodo guy gives him back the phone.  And the story ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Red Team Alpha swarm swarm swarm swarm.  Tech crime investigation team goes to this guy's house.  The editor of Gizmodo has a search warrant and raids it.  The officers bashed into his front door while he was at dinner.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The word Apple.  Now, I wonder if Apple sent him a cease and desist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cops had to bash in the guy's door.  Don't they know there's an app for that?  Ram it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I think he's making a good point.  Although there's no evidence that Apple in any way incited this investigation.  I mean, everybody assumes it was at Apple's behest, but there's no...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But Apple could call it off and say no big deal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They can't call it off.  It's the attorney general, the attorney general or whoever it is, the sheriff.  I don't know who it is.  The prosecutor.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The private security forces that went to the guy who...  It's not private.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not Chen's house.  The other house was a private security force.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  That's the thing.  Hired by whom?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By Apple.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple hired a private security force?  To invade this guy's...  No, he's talking about Jason Chen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, they tried to get in, to knock on his door and try to get in.  They didn't bash down that door.  This is where Stewart made his joke that the great thing about the private security force is they have the neatest stun guns.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see, let's see.  We got to watch now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's back up a little bit.  So the Gizmodo reviewer gets the meth lab in the basement treatment after it had already given the phone back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's before this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess everything was okay with the guy who found the phone in the first place.  That's where he was screaming into his wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wires.com is reporting that people claiming to represent Apple showed at the finder's address and asked to search the premises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is it.  Okay, that's creepy.  That's it.  Although the thing about Apple's cops, they have the coolest tasers.  I didn't hear that part of the story.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But they didn't have a search warrant.  They weren't a governmental agency.  They're paper cops.  So some guy goes and says, can I have the phone back?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They already had the phone back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What were they doing, intimidating him?  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the issue.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I tweeted, when did Apple lose their sense of humor?  And somebody tweeted back, they've always had it.  They just have to approve the jokes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not going to defend Apple, but I do think that there's a little bit of a, that people are leaving a conclusion that Apple stimulated the criminal investigation.  We don't know that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think we're going to find out because there have been FOIAs filed with the cops on this.  Oh, interesting.  I'm impressed now.  We'll find out more.  We'll see.  I think Stuart was in line, though.  I think that they are, you know, they're Howard Hughes.  He's Howard Hughes.  I love him.  Steve, love you, but he's Howard Hughes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is after all, just a phone prototype.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not the Pentagon Papers.  And meanwhile, Ellen DeGeneres does a spoof on iPhone commercials and Apple says, but now see, there is a difference here.  Apple advertises on the Ellen Show.  Right.  So that's different.  I mean, if an advertiser, if I said something bad about an advertiser and they complained, I might, I might apologize.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just got an update to tell me if this is new.  Wall Street Journal says that FCC Commission Chairman Julius Jadokowski has decided to re-regulate Internet lines to protect net neutrality.  So he's redefining what Internet is, reclassifying it as Title II.  Good.  That's the traditional phone line.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is in response to that, that, the court case where they lost the Comcast judgment because the, the District of Columbia  Circuit Court of Appeals said, it's not really, it's not none of your business.  Yeah.  You don't have the authority for that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You went overboard here, FCC.  None of your business.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then of course, the FCC, it's a completely reasonable response, which is saying, no, no, we are, we are chartered to cover this and that's what this is.  Right.  Phone lines.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If anybody sees me getting up every once in a while, it's because my light thinks I'm dead and so I'm just, I have to move and do a screen.  Technology.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kuni is obviously on a frugal kick.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's worse than that right now because we had, after the Times Square bomber, we then had nervousness because right here on 40th Street where I am, a manhole cover fire of major proportion came in.  We lost our power.  I don't have air conditioning right now.  I don't know.  I'm sweltering.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Like three stories high flames, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, it wasn't that bad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That happens every once in a while.  A manhole cover goes shooting in the air.  That's what I love about New York.  That's what I heard.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Everyone kept saying, oh, that happens in New York all the time.  I was like, three story flames happen all the time in New York.  Where's that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, we got rats the size of our Schwarzenegger here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, Alligator's in his suede.  You've got to have a place.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You've got that whole wussy since you went out to the West Coast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I gotta Google exploding manhole covers.  We'll just see if we can find some video on that.  Seriously.  How Stuff Works has a page called How Exploding Manholes Work.  Manhole covers have been blasting out of the ground in New York City.  This apparently isn't that uncommon.  Wow.  50 feet in the air.  An 85 pound manhole cover can become a missile when blasted out of the ground.  What's a feature terrorist that?  Hey, does it bother you that the response...  Let me ask you, because you live in Manhattan or you work in Manhattan,  that the response to the Times Square bomb is, let's put up more cameras.  No, I'm fine.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You don't mind that?  Don't forget, Leo, I was also at the World Trade Center on the last train in on 9-11.  Oh, dear.  And no, I'm fine with it.  Catching suckers.  I'm in public.  It is public.  Things that happen in public.  It is public.  I couldn't be happier with it.  I do not want to depend my life on it.  God bless him, but I don't want to put my life and the city's life on the backs of a T-shirt vendor.  Okay, you're right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  As a New Yorker who's also nearby the Trade Center on 9-11, I agree.  More cameras.  Whatever.  It should be like Britain, as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And by the way, the T-shirt vendor should now sell T-shirts that say, if you see something, say something.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Definitely.  So this is how a manhole cover explodes.  Gas builds up.  Then damaged insulation causes wiring.  Is this demand media?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is this demand media?  No, this is How Stuff Works.  How Stuff Works is a great site.  This is a great site.  This is leading to Leo's new show, This Week in Terrorism.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But did you know there are 13,000 volt power cables in there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're cables.  They are awesome cables.  They are incredible cables.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so the gas, if the gas accumulates and there's a spark from the cable, the manhole  cover goes 50 feet in the air.  What's the big deal?  You got a problem with that?  I've got to break.  Hey, what do you want?  Hey, what?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hey, just a manhole cover.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wouldn't stand on a manhole cover as a matter of course.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other thing that happens here in the winter is the snow and the salt mix and then get  electricity on them and dogs die on them.  Oh, that's not good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Poor dogs and their paws on the clothes grids.  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's terrible.  God, New York is terrible.  Tough place to live.  YouTube is going to start running videos.  Did we talk about that last week?  We mentioned it briefly.  Okay.  We knew about that.  Google acquired Bumptop.  I thought this was very interesting.  This is a very fancy looking, I thought it was for Linux only, window manager.  It's not?  It's for other operating systems?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I definitely beta tested a very early build on Windows.  Oh, okay.  Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, what is, describe it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was a really long time ago, but it's...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess it's Mac as well.  It's kind of a different, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's kind of just a really fancy, eye-catchy, flying kind of UI.  It's not like a touch UI, but it's kind of like what you'd imagine a touch UI.  I've got to find a video here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This three-dimensional stuff flies in and out.  Is there a touch to this?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is this where this goes?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's touch too, yes.  Isn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, actually there is touch support.  I didn't have a machine that would support that, but yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this would be for, what do you think, for a tablet?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hmm, perhaps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is a TED Talk with, you could see the bump top prototype.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, there's a video on, yeah, but this is like from the 2000s.  This is the thing, we haven't heard anything from them in a long time.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, the idea is your desktop looks like this, and now it can on your computer too be a complete mess.  And you drag stuff around.  Oh, I like the bling.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, you drag stuff around, and it's got that angle 3D.  Right, and you can lasso icons and move them and fan them out.  That's right, that's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Raskin was working on something a little similar to this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, he was, and I was concerned I was going to get confused with his touch UI.  Yeah.  That would be good for a tablet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'd like that on a tablet, wouldn't you?  Yeah, sure.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Anything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anything.  I'll take anything on a tablet.  Let's see, what else?  FTC may be fighting Google's acquisition of AdMob.  I think it's imminent, the decision.  I can understand that, but if Apple's got iAd.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think most of the commentary I've seen from people who you would think would be against the acquisition are saying, no, let this one through.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, that's why Google was so happy about iAd.  Yeah.  It meant, well, see, there's competition in this market.  Apple wasn't.  Apple, well, Apple wasn't happy about losing AdMob, but they found something else.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Apple's just not happy about much.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're cranky.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, they are.  They did sell a million iPads.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they're doing all right in the iPad.  They're making a lot of money on the iPad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Somebody tweeted, a million people can figure out how to use it, and you can't, Jarvis.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sending it back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It looks like Google TV at I.O.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So Google is invested in something called an ad TV ad startup called NVIDI.  Twenty three million dollars, in fact.  Makes a lot of sense.  Series D funding led by Google with Group M, Motorola, Menlo Ventures, Interwest and EnterTech Capital, a bunch of venture partners.  So it's not all from Google.  What does NVIDI do?  They offer a digital set-top box application that delivers targeted advertising and marketing messages to individual viewers.  So you'll get custom ads the next time you watch Glee.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google keeps trying to get into display and trying to get into TV.  You know, I was talking to an executive, I believe, unnamed at a big media company who said that Google kind of promised years ago never to go into display advertising, into brand advertising.  And that if they come in and take the same share there, that's going to kill media, is what it said.  But I think they had no choice to.  They're going to be in advertising.  They're going to be in these other areas.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So your prediction for Google I.O. is that they will do TV.  What will it be?  Do you think, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Android set-top box or a build of Android, which is going to be a media center if the box itself doesn't doesn't come out.  That's what it sounds like.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of a ho hum announcement, to be honest with you.  I mean, there's a lot of stuff like this.  There's box like Apple TV, Apple TV, which has never succeeded.  I think it's a pretty ho hum announcement.  And, you know, Microsoft tried for years to get the cable companies to do a Windows based set-top box.  And the problem with this, and I presume it be true of Android, is that these makes them too expensive.  You have to put too much hardware, too much processing, too much RAM in a set-top box.  These things have to be dirt cheap.  You don't want a smart set-top or not at least not that smart set-top box.  Times have changed.  I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Interesting.  I don't know. I'm excited.  I'm like the app market, you know, the Android app market on my TV.  That's kind of interesting to me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that that could open things up.  The problem is you're not going to get they're not going to get it onto your cable box.  It's like all those others.  It's an added box.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's another it's like Boxee or Roku or something like that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, like Boxee.  Yeah, yeah.  My sort of best.  I'm not really a media center geek.  I should qualify that.  But my best kind of media center experience was with XBMC and Boxee.  Boxee is just a fork of XBMC.  So I just I don't know.  It feels like an open development platform like Android, you know, and the Android market.  Just a lot of potential.  Yahoo is ahead of them in this market is Yahoo of all people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A number of television manufacturers, Panasonic, Samsung make Yahoo widget enabled TVs.  And you know nowadays most televisions are computers.  They have an Ethernet port.  They have processors.  They're doing a lot of work anyway.  There's a cell processor in one of the new Toshiba TVs.  I mean, that's how much power they put in this thing.  And it just that's where it's that's where you put it.  You put it in the TV.  You don't you don't try to get through the cable company.  You don't try to sell it through Apple or, you know, Linksys.  You put it in the TV.  Samsung sells it comes with the TV.  And then I think there'll be a brisk competition there.  And by the way, it will not just be Google in that one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And that will push the cloud more and more because you when the TV everywhere structure the different architecture of this that once you bought the show, you should be able to get it across those devices.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know that Steve Perlman, the guy who did Web TV is has been pushing for the last couple of years something called on live similar idea.  You you you it's basically server side gaming.  So all the rendering all the heavy duty hardware is server side.  And they just send a stream down of the game so you can use an inexpensive television or even a device about the size of an iPhone to play these games.  It's called on live.  It's we've been waiting for this for a while and the beta tests have been kind of underwhelming.  But that's but but if you think about it, there's a way to make a lot of money is you put games on these things.  Google just bought a company called Recorded Future that tries to predict the future.  That's a good thing to buy Google company.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can invest in such a Google company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the idea is they're trying to just like a weather for cancer with the future we already have.  Look, if Google starts prediction, the future I'm worried it be financial markets like a weather report.  You could say what's IBM stock price going to be tomorrow or next month or who's going to do the next IPO in television widgets?  I wonder how accurate you can get.  It's an interesting acquisition.  It's probably very speculative, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah, you can predict things.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's just like Google's in the best position to do this, right?  Because they have all this data.  And actually, this app appears to have a lot of like plugins like it uses like Google charts and things.  I don't know if they if it was just it was about their algorithms or maybe put in the sidebar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the next thing in the sidebar.  You know, you've got the real time timeline last week, last month, yesterday, tomorrow.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Tomorrow. What's going to happen tomorrow?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, you go to the fact the story the Times had about a month ago that the Twitter discussion about movies is ninety seven point three percent accurate in predicting Box Office.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Interesting. How accurate?  Ninety three percent.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Ninety seven point three percent.  Holy cow.  There's your number.  There's your number.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.  Done.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow. That's impressive.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And while we're on predicting the future, you saw Conan O'Brien spoke at Google and his tweet was and I quote, I'm in San Jose and I'm going to visit Google.  If I look up Google on Google from Google, you see the face of God.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's that.  That's the programmer joke.  If you Google recursion on Google, what do you get?  Did you mean recursion?  Did you mean recursion?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Google started to get a little bit of this like prediction thing with the with the flu trends.  Right. So they could predict where the flu outbreak was happening based on search term, you know, search queries for symptoms in different areas.  I guess that's not really prediction as much as just trend spotting.  Right.  Well, what's the difference?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you're going to the next step.  You're seeing where does where does this where does this curve lead you?  Right.  Right. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Dane's going to put this story in our rundown until we do it.  So I'm going to do it right now.  Google Street View driver caught peeing on Google Street View.  If you look at the Griegel Street, I don't know where it's a street view for somewhere in the middle of freaking nowhere near San Jose.  I'm sure the poor guy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No wonder he's safe to do it there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no one around.  And in fact, if you scroll around, you'll see there's the open car door for the street view car.  And there ain't nobody else around.  And there he is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So that's once you start, you can't stop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, that's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  I wonder, you know, maybe left the car in gear and just slowly rolling.  That's pretty funny.  Google Street View caught in its own maw.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, if it's good enough for us, it's good enough for everybody.  That's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Big gains for Chrome in the browser wars.  In fact, according to Mashable, Chrome is gaining while Internet Explorer is slumping.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What's Firefox doing?  Firefox is holding steady.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Firefox went from twenty four point five percent to twenty four point five percent.  Google's Chrome, though, gained half a point.  Ten percent improvement.  That's a month to month.  Fifth month in a row.  I love Chrome. I do.  I love Chrome.  It's fast. It's lightweight.  Very reliable.  I've been very happy with it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One thing I wish is that when I accidentally hit the red button on top and I close all the windows, most of the time, if you open a tab right away, it'll let you reopen all those windows.  Right.  Or it'll know that you did it.  If the thing crashes, it'll restore it for you.  But once in a while, I lose all my tabs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mashable points out, though, that while in general the Chrome usage in the worldwide market is six percent, it went from six point one three to six point seven three, among Mashable users, twelve point six to fourteen point eight percent.  Mashable users love Chrome.  I bet you if I look, I should look at the twit numbers.  I bet you'd see a big spike as well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Huge, huge number of Chrome users probably.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It'll change in the next two minutes because you told people.  Go get Chrome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Install it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Go get Chrome.  Install it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You bring down the Google server, Leo.  That's your macho goal.  All right.  That's my goal.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That would be a serious accomplishment.  Then you'll see the Google cops.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not going to.  Yeah.  What kind of tasers will they have?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Open source ones.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One last story, then we'll get to your tip, tool and number.  And that story is from Rupert Murdoch.  The subscription plan is coming.  Paid content.  Do it already.  Really?  He likes talking.  Rupert loves to talk.  He's planning.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's arguing now that the iPad will, you know, it's kind of their salvation.  We get all this money from the iPad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think he's used the word savior.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because he doesn't use the internet.  It's a savior.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll be giving a press conference in about three to four weeks in which we hope we'll  have some important announcements, Google.  I mean, Murdoch said.  Three or four weeks.  Why do you announce a press conference in three to four weeks?  I don't know.  Will it be a competitor to iTunes Store?  I guess so.  An extension of it.  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Murdoch started a New York section in the Wall Street Journal to compete with the New  York Times.  It's rather laughable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But he doesn't really care whether it's good.  He just wants to nudge the New York Times.  Maybe nudge him out of business.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He says that the Wall Street Journal app has 64,000 paid subscribers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's a fake too because I went in and I downloaded it because I was already  a journal subscriber.  I think he counted me.  I didn't pay extra yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, but I did too.  Then three days later it said now even though you subscribe to the paper edition and the  web edition, we want more money.  That's when I deleted it from my iPad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Even when I was reading it, it still said this story you can read, this story you can't.  It's very frustrating.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, let me just see.  I'm just curious.  I mean, that doesn't sound like a huge number.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me do some...  But he said basically all that money goes to us.  It doesn't go to Amazon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's no middle man.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So wait a minute.  64,000 times $18.  That's some good money.  That's $1.15 million a month or something.  I mean, that's not...  Unless I did my calculations wrong.  That's pretty good.  If all of those people are paying.  Yeah, almost a little more than a million dollars a month.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But that's chicken.  I think I saw somewhere that they were counting people like you and me, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that doesn't count.  They can't count me.  I deleted it.  I sold.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I gave it back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina has a good article on Steve Jobs' Flash open letter.  Just go to SmarterWear and read it.  So much has happened since we've met last.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know.  A lot of stuff happened.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And some good comments too.  Of course, you have the best smart readers on there.  So some good stuff.  SmarterWear.org, Steve Jobs on Flash.  AppleShutLaLa bought Siri.  We talked about Siri.  I think we're ready to move on.  There's so much.  Boy, I mean, I got on and on and on here.  There's a ton of news.  But let's get to Gina's tip of the week because frankly, this show can't go on forever.  We've got to train to catch.  Gina, you got a tip for us?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  My tip is for, I don't know, hopefully I'm not the only one excited about this.  But for those of us who still love and use Wave, big thing happened this week.  You can now embed Waves onto web pages and anyone who, anonymous users who don't have a Wave account, can see that Wave.  Oh, that's good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a change.  Which is awesome.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Which is awesome.  So you can basically add a real time group chat onto your site and anyone can see it.  And you can see, and actually I wrote up my blog and I made a Wave public and it promptly got kind of destroyed.  I mean, like anarchy, you know, which is wonderful because I love anarchy.  Lots of people commenting and chatting.  Really lots of fun.  The cool thing, though, you can make a Wave public so that anybody on Wave can comment on it.  But I started using, you can restrict edit access to a group, right?  So I'm using it now, Wave, to do office hours with my developers on my open source project.  Good idea.  So only the people in the Google group on my mailing list can edit the Wave, but I can publish the transcript and archive it later on a regular web page, which is really cool.  So yeah, embedded Waves are really a lot of fun.  So hopefully we're going to see Wave out a lot more.  This will make a difference.  This will make a big difference.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  People will finally get a chance to look at it, use it in a functional way.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Definitely.  That's what I'm hoping.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cool.  SmarterWear.org.  Another reason to go.  Jeff, do we cover your number?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  God bless Dane.  He's giving numbers.  Then you know to stay away from them.  Well, besides the fact that YouTube tops 13 billion views a month, that's good news.  A month?  No.  Video this month.  Yeah, hold on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, this month they got 13.  Hold on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hold on.  Hold on.  I just lost the tab.  Myself here.  Jesus, I'm an idiot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  TomScore says that more than 180 million users watched online video during the month.  YouTube delivered video to more than 135 million viewers.  Three out of every four video viewers, an average of 96 videos per viewer.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what's amazing, isn't it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah, in the month of March, internet users watched 31.2 billion videos and Google had

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  that.  Google TV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe.  Makes a lot of sense now.  Now it makes sense, doesn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Makes a lot of sense.  Now the volume of video that's there and if they can go to advertisers and say, no, no,  no, we know when they're watching on the big TV, that makes you comfy?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Google had 41% of all videos viewed online in March.  YouTube, of course, I don't know how much Google video was watched.  Hulu came in second.  So Google had 13 billion views.  Hulu had 1.1 billion.  That's the second place.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Unbelievable.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Incredible, isn't it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That gives a whole new meaning, the value of YouTube.  Yeah.  And if I'm doing Hulu, if I'm a network, I'm wondering why am I doing my own site?  Why am I not using it?  Go to where the people are.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This whole idea, I wrote a post a while ago that I think the notion that brands are the  magnets that draw us is now out-loaded.  Search changed that because we started the transaction.  That's a good point.  Right?  Links from Twitter and Facebook, we the humans start the transaction.  Brands remain labels once you've found something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You still want a brand.  You still want a brand.  I mean, you're going to still look for lost.  But why would you go?  Why should I have to look for it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Why doesn't it look for me?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  On the other hand, I mean, you can still use that argument to say, well, I don't need to  live on YouTube.  I can live anywhere I want.  It's embeddable.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which is, by the way, the smart thing that Twitter did this week is they created the  embeddable tweet.  I'm going to argue with the newspapers, should create embeddable articles.  Why didn't we learn from YouTube that embedding things all over the web gives you distribution  and control at the same time?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Twitter is doing that.  And I think the lesson here is that's how you get distributed.  And so that's exactly the lesson.  That's how YouTube got to be so big.  Not because everybody goes to it.  Because it comes to us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you think the embeddable tweet...  I mean, it mostly looks cosmetic.  I guess it's linkable.  Yeah, I think it is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And one person in the UK pointed out with their libel laws, if you say something nasty  in the tweet and then believe it, it can still be distributed everywhere and still get you  in trouble.  It says, you know, two minutes ago, which in two weeks becomes meaningless.  And I think it was TechCrunch had a post today about another way to embed tweets that put  a timestamp on it and make it better.  But I think just the idea simply is right.  And it's smart.  So when you have the New York Times complaining about Huffington Post quoting them too much,  well, then make your stories embeddable.  And they'll put them up there with brand and links and analytics and all kinds of things.  Why not?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, YouTube certainly gains from that, don't they?  I think this is the lesson to media.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But we keep on not hearing it because we think that they come to us.  That's, again, why the iPad is so beloved of the media companies.  I control you again.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I control you.  Our tool of the week isn't really a Google tool, although it's a great tool that has  come to Android.  As you mentioned, Gina, it's Mint is finally available.  It was for a long time.  It's a website.  You go to Mint.com.  And I'm sure Gina and I both use Mint on the web.  But it was very nice to be able to get it on the iPhone because Mint will tell you things  like, you know, you're overdrawn or what's in your accounts right now.  And having that in your pocket with you all the time is just great.  I'm not sure I'll show you my Mint thing because the first thing says, well, you live in public  and it says how much you owe, what your net worth is and all that stuff.  It's great, though.  You know, you can, Mint will alert me when a big check is written.  I can go through my accounts and see what's going on.  And I actually use it as a business person.  I use it to monitor all my accounts, including my business accounts.  So it's very handy for that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And having it on the phone, it's like, you know, I hate going into Quicken and like dealing  with all that.  I hate balancing my checkbook.  But if I'm like, you know, off in line somewhere at the grocery store, I just like, oh, how  am I doing?  It's kind of that casual way to just be like, oh, you know, just take the pulse of my bank  accounts in one place.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and of course, it is in a way a cloud story because Intuit bought Mint.  Mint was so successful.  Intuit bought Mint.  And I suspect this is kind of the next Quicken.  I mean, it's kind of the replacement for Quicken.  So really just a handy thing to have.  I've got 14 new alerts.  It'll tell me, you know, what's overdrawn, whatever it has, my budget, has my cash flow.  My total net worth is really nice to have that in your pocket all the time.  And as Gina and I have pretty much ascertained, pretty much figured out it's safe to use.  I think it's really good safe enough.  I think it's sort of safe.  It uses it when you, well, it's getting a little scary because when you first set up  Mint, you started giving it all your bank account logins.  And all your credit card, everything, all your financial information.  And that's a little nerve wracking.  But the Mint doesn't save that information itself.  It uses a service called Yodly, which all the banks use.  You know, the truth is, Yodly already knows all that stuff because the banks have been  using it for years.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a big 90s business that survived by changing its ways.  This is part of what that idea of putting somebody having been the guardian of my identity  and my safety that I can trust who then knows what other things are done becomes a good  housekeeping seal of approval.  There's a company called, I think it's called Gist.  Have you seen that one?  No.  What do they do?  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  So people, the guy who got me on the Howard Stern show, Jeff Schick, when we complained  about Lotus, made fun of them.  They've got to deal with this company and they say it's wonderful and it takes your  email and other things and finds where all, it's not, it's not, it's on the web.  It's not on a, I don't think it's on the phone.  Remember the web?  The web?  What's that?  It's on the web.  And the thing is, I was at the point of saying, okay, here's all my email.  And I thought, no, would Gina let me do that?  What would Gina do?  WWGSD stands for what would Gina do?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What would Gina do?  We all want to know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Does it use Gmail OAuth or do you have to actually give it your account?  That's what I want you to tell me, Gina.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know how it does it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So is it gist.com?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  So it looks like a neat idea and they were raving about it.  But I just had that last minute moment to say, I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No more about who you know.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If they use OAuth, I would be fine with that.  I would.  You know, I have certain passwords I'm a little crazy about.  My Google account password I'm crazy about.  I wouldn't want to give that to any third party.  But if it just needs my Gmail, they should be able to just use OAuth, right?  Because that's available now in Gmail.  But, you know, the other stuff, I don't know.  I might be a little worried about giving my Twitter account over.  I mean, it all depends on, you know, what services you really care about and have the stuff that, you know, you're really concerned about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just checking right here.  Well, I can't do it now.  I have to activate it.  I hate it when they have to activate it before I can try it.  I'm sure everything now uses OAuth.  I mean, Twitter uses OAuth.  Facebook uses OAuth.  What is XAuth versus OAuth, by the way?  I'm unclear on that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think that XAuth is sort of the next generation of OAuth.  But I think that it's like better, new, improved.  I'm not exactly sure of the details.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, that settles it.  Chris Messina will be on next week's show.  We'll find out.  Chris is the only man who actually knows.  All right.  Hey, thank you so much for being here.
