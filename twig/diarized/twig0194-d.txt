Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But anyway, we'll talk about in a moment because first I have to say hello to our other hosts Jeff Jarvis from buzz machine.com  professor of journalism  graduate professor anyway Jarvis  Jeff, I love you. Anyway, you're not gonna you're gonna keep this up, huh? We're gonna have a few

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Before the show you're going you're doing the salty my Chromebook again. You won't let it go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's my fault, oh now it's my fault, okay  Jeff is also  President journalism, it's  You weren't really doing that were you doing that  Hey look, there's another person here also with us Lamar Wilson youtuber Lamar Wilson the host of our show this week in YouTube  Every Sunday on the Twitter network. How are you? Good to be here. Thanks to have you  He's also of course on YouTube Lamar Wilson. Hey, I got I got a YouTube story. We'll lead off with a YouTube story  You know our show this week in YouTube  blocked on YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Already

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the whole damn show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's only one dude, this is the first episode  Zero still on there. But yeah, you're right. Oh, yeah, there is an episode zero  So is it is it TWI YT on YouTube YouTube comm slash TWA's this week YT  this week  YT we're now we're theorizing that maybe we don't get as much slack on this because we're a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  YouTube channel I bet that's what it is. That's why we need we have a contact at Google  we need to push this probably to him because I think that's what it is, it's a new account and  And a lot of spam accounts come up new and they start putting up illegal content right away, right?  They're probably treating us no differently. That's what I would guess I would hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz so what the weird thing is the it was one of those automatic, you know content things  And it was by Psy  Remember Psy was very famous in his first video Opal Gangnam style that he you know  Let everybody do anything they wanted with it  I don't know if they issue takedowns, but it was very free and there was it was I was ever did no no  No takedowns. Well, boom. He's got a new song now. I guess he's a big shot doesn't need anybody  We played just a few maybe 15 20 seconds of his new video, right and talked a little bit about it  How hard it might be to do it wasn't even the whole thing. No, which by the way sucks  But here's the interesting thing that Chad correct me if I'm wrong  But he said the they say the audit the automatic content filtered detected as a live performance of that song

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the live performance of size  News the new song. I don't even know with them. So we appealed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't have the appeal process and they said no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, they said they said sure but it's gonna take us it could take us up to a month to get to it  Which which for a new show is a big deal. That's episode

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can make that go faster. That's ridiculous. Well, we're gonna we're gonna pull in all our chits with people like you and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I think you should do you should go back and edit it  You just have that's a screen that says Psy is a jerk during that time. That's that's a great idea Jeff and we did that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except and still except now that our account is no longer in good standing  We can only upload videos less than 15 minutes long

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll have to have a mini show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a guy I have a guy let's take header. I we're theorizing that because it's fair first of all, it's fair use  We didn't play the whole song. It's a new show. It's commentary and normally we can make that  A  Appeal because we get knocked down all the time on all of our channels

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there's so many shows to do what's trending does this I mean  That's the basis of their show is to put other people's videos in there and and and they get away with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, but sure is a lot better looking than I am and I think that she this is accurate. So  No, but let me show you I just got an email from YouTube it happens all the time  This is I don't even know what show this is. This might be a twit episode  They just blocked it this video contains content from a  Brazilian radio and TV it doesn't by the way from either of these in a Hungarian television station  Met one or more of whom have blocked it  They pulled this video down even though there is I guarantee you no Brazilian or Hungarian content at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There have to be penalties for these bad take down this happens so much. We need some sort of slap

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Shield law or something and from an article I think we saw and we talked about me  It may be two weeks ago to dig it up. This may actually get worse with some new rules memory  Yeah, we talked about this universal got in got in UMG. Yeah  And so there's there might not be any appeal process. That's something you you actually brought to light the episode

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you should be I mean, I think you should threaten sigh and these these scumbags with suits counter suits  Yeah, yeah, sue them you they're clearly losing your business. There's there's there's there's tangible damage to you  I think that's gonna turn this around a bit and Google finds itself in the middle of those things. They don't want that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it likes that. We have a rep that reached out to us. They'd like to show that they've blessed the show  They don't have a plan. That was YouTube in the name  And so that's the guys that I was gonna reach out to because he asked he said if you have any trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me know. Hey, guess what?  But and so I don't I mean I'm not gonna whine about this  But but what it does raise is this larger issue if YouTube wants how do they balance this?  I mean, I remember when YouTube started before Google bought it  We were talking to the founders of I think was Jeffrey Chen  We were talking to one of the founders of YouTube and I asked him that question  This was the six month old startup. Aren't you gonna get sued out of existence and  He didn't have really a very good. He said no, but he didn't have a very good answer  I think he was already negotiating with Google  I have to think that  That this was the the best way to save this company is to pair up with Google  Google's response is no we're gonna use the safe harbor provisions of the digital Millennium Copyright Act  We're going to offer DMC takedowns and content providers will have a good recourse  But now it's swung so far in the opposite direction that independent content creators like me and I'm sure others right Lamar are getting  Hurt by us

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's so many people that are getting  hit by this and some like again journalists like like yourself or just people who are innocently just trying to create good content or  Commentary are getting hit unfairly and again, there may be no appeal process and in the future  And I think on one hand on a business side. They feel like they have to do this to to keep  Everybody happy that's on the business side, but it hurts  Content creators like us obviously and so I don't see a way out of this unless we do what Jeff said and some type  Of legal action. I can't I can't go around suing Hungarian television and Brazilian radio. I'm not gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I'm not litigious. I think you're right Jeff. That would be a good thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think there's an opportunity here for the likes of an EFF  To to to give cover to a Google to say that there's there's a real tangible business damage that's being caused here and  We can't just willy-nilly well take this and the good of forces Google to say that if you issue  You know three bad take down notices in a row you're out for a month. Let's let's penalize them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a couple of yeah, there's a couple of things that come to mind  First of all, I think and I've mentioned this before that people are gaming it  I don't think either this Brazilian or Hungarian now normally what I would say they do is they wouldn't do a takedown  They'd want to have ads placed on our content and make a little money off it  So a takedown I don't understand the benefit of that, but it's obviously an erroneous  takedown but the second point because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ad ran on there on that channel and so they're matching  No, I mean the video that you featured also ran on this no one  Well, I hope not on Hungarian radio and I mean, I don't know maybe they did some commentary  You know, maybe you kind of a similar thing right  I mean, I don't know and that the bot sort of erroneously picked up made the match run related kind  I don't know. I'm trying to imagine, you know how this  Haven't been anyway, so go ahead Lee. I didn't mean to interrupt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one issue and that both those videos are down  In fact our channel are this week and YouTube channel is down now because we can't upload content to it  Yeah more than longer than 15 minutes  But then there's the second issue which somebody in the chat room pointed out what this does do is point is push  Independent people like Lamar and others to go work for these YouTube partner channels  Because the YouTube partner channels have the cloud and to protect you which is interesting because I feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what YouTube wants to happen at first. I wonder why YouTube allow I'm thinking  Allow these networks to exist in the beginning, but YouTube is still going to get they still take their what is it?  45% cut no matter what so they don't care if a network comes in and wants to cut cut you up  Some more it takes the pressure off them to be able to have to offer technical support to have to offer any kind of support  They can say hey you talk to your network and then they'll have a rep right who will handle the whole network  So I think that's where they're moving to where their hands off is the hey a universal made a deal  With maker or whoever it is that that's their business you deal with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that's just the wrong direction because I think the whole beauty of YouTube is the democratizing nature of it  that gives anybody a kid in  You know in Hungary who wants to do a show a chance to do a show and get global distribution  But if he's at a major disadvantage because big companies can stomp on him. I don't think that you know what proportion of your

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  views comes on YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not hugely significant that one that they pulled down had about 5,000 views  But this week in YouTube is going to be a little more significant  It's a show about YouTube and not being able to post those shows on YouTube hurts us pretty badly  I  Just I think it also should make people question whether YouTube should be part of their distribution strategy  That yeah, the nice thing about YouTube is you get free bandwidth  But if you have but if but if you get pulled off all the time  This is not a good way for you to consider maybe you should look at Vimeo or somebody else  That's gonna hurt you. I think that hurts YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it does it'll be interesting to see what they say when you speak to your contact

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds like you need to talk to a human. Yeah, I mean emails him already. So he'll get back to us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a Python script that can interact with them beautifully and  We should just have really I mean if you're gonna talk to YouTube you should have a Python script on your side  I agree appeal that pie know they do claim they're improving the content ID system. I've yet to see any evidence of that  All right moving along because I don't want to make this all about me you want to see my new phone  We should put all our shows on daily motion even this week in YouTube, what do you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Daily motion. Well, what I  I don't know. I don't think I've ever watched a daily motion video. It's big in Europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it Yahoo rumor to be bidding for them? Yeah, that was the rumor I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To me the user experience of daily motion is worse. It's so crap. Yeah, because of all the ads and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it used to do some neat things back in the early days. It had some innovative things, but it's owned by

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  French telecom, I think so. That's probably not a good choice. Oh, yeah, so the HTC one came  This morning I had ordered it and said overnight it and of course it's available on AT&T as of yesterday the 16th and they overnighted it  So I got it on the 17th this morning  This is what many say is the best at least in terms of you know, attractive hardware  Android phone there's gonna you look the top the top new phones are obviously the galaxy s4  Which looks just like a galaxy of any kind  I think if you're willing to go outside of Android  The new iPhone which should come out sometime in the next few months will certainly be a contender  And I think the Nokia Lumia's are very nice HTC also makes a very nice 8x for Windows 8  But we're Android users. We love our Android right Jeff  Yes, okay. I can't remember what you're using an Android phone now  Yeah, yeah, I live in la vida Google la vida Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm living la vida Google la vida Google you got my line somebody else's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I gotta say that's the best thing about a Google phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is that Nexus for and a Nexus 7 for Nexus 7? I am I am not just you know in the operating system  I am in Google's pants. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's in there?  There's a python in there. Oh, it's a  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should talk about the Google Drive downage after the HTC one will drive downage outage honeage honeage

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw Jeff moaning on Twitter like no no, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I've only had this this phone for a little bit and I had actually call AT&T to activate it  I'm not sure what the activation issues were  but  And it will be available I think on every carrier in the US and of course it's available around the world  This is a gorgeous gorgeous phone  1920 by 1080 now I haven't changed the HTC sense. This is the new sense remember  They said they had this new content thing. It's kind of flipboard on the front page. You can specify what the sources are  I like that. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's pretty look at that  So that's the front page. It's a little I'm gonna put age. I'll put Facebook home on it a minute, but  The new sense is flat notice. That's the new style. No more gradients. No more rounded corners and so forth  Very fast and I tell you this screen is so gorgeous and everybody has said that  1920 by 1080, but they've done some odd things  They there is no home button in the middle just a dead HTC logo doesn't do anything  The home button is a little to the right of it, which is an odd place for oh, that's weird  Yeah, you gotta get used to that and then the back button is to the left of it  And you know how I feel about the new Google standards, what do they call that the the new Google programming interface?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The ones that no one listens to you know that nobody does what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mahalo hello. Hello  No  You know  Cholo what no  Holo holo the holo. Okay. So the holo is you have those dot dot dot menus everywhere  So there's no menu button. I really like a phone with a menu button  However, there's the you know, the the holo style buttons up here so I could see a menu there  This is 412. It's not 4.2, which is too bad  But and given how much HTC is customized it with sense 5 I doubt we will see  It'll be a while. I think before we'll see I don't have 4.2 on my yeah  Note to you just frustrating the other negative on this. Yeah, I do you're right  I had to route it and put it a yeah, I don't want to do all that. Yeah, I don't either  It's a mistake. Don't do it. The other thing that is interesting, of course is is beautiful unibody aluminum case  They say I think I read that it took 70 minutes to mill each individual case and it's beautiful. No removable battery  No additional memory. You can't put an SD card in it  But I have to say it's it's it's the closest thing to an iPhone running Android  It's just it's just a gorgeous the other thing that's odd  Of course is it is that they're doing something very strange with the camera which I support and it remains to be seen  How good this is it's a 4 megapixel camera not even a 5 it's a 4  But but they've done it because that way they can make the sensor have larger pixel sizes  These pixels are 2 micron compared to the half micron sensors pixels on some other  Phones so 2 micron means great low-light performance and it's a f2 lens  It looks pretty big too, doesn't it? So I haven't done any photography with it yet  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  most people do internet photos and you  In general don't need more than three or four megapixels to be honest  I mean it but most of us are uploading online is the key is the sensor how good you can make the picture look

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The screen is so good that the viewfinder looks fabulous. I don't know  The detail there is fabulous. I don't know. I don't know how good the picture is gonna be but yeah, so we'll see  Yeah, it's pretty pretty crisp. Can you disable sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is my only objection with this phone is that it's not kind of the pure the pure Android Google experience  Is it possible to disable sense or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know I don't think so. Although of course you can put another launcher on it, right? Yeah, you can put another launcher  So I'll probably end up putting  Nova launcher which I like on here, but let me see. I mean, I doubt there's this  Turn-off arc sense by the way, the new sense 5 is I mean look how pretty that is. It's really gorgeous  But yeah, I think a lot of people want some songs. Yes much better than touch whiz touch whiz is a little junkie  Don't like it. Yeah, I doubt you can turn off sense, but you could always put another launcher on here  Which I may end up doing I'm gonna put home on it first right home is compatible with right  This is the other thing the sound quality on this is fantastic. It's beats audio  I don't have a huge amount of respect for beats audio, but  What's really cool about it is that they've put stereo speakers on the front left and right and nobody does this  So if you're watching a movie, you've got speakers left and right so you have a little bit of stereo situation  Separation. Yeah the sound quality. I don't know if you can hear but the sound quality is superb on this  You can't tell but it but it really is a beautiful sounding phone. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead  Nosset I'm so I heard that that was it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, watching watching your videos Lamar on this on a night on a 1080p screen with stereo speakers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh boy. Now if you put it this close, it's just like a big screen  Putting you putting my videos that close at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Please pocket review of the HTC one so far. It's beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is gonna be my main phone for at least looks like a gorgeous phone it really is gorgeous  Yeah, nothing you'd be ashamed to pull out at an iPhone fest  Yeah, it looks very much like an iPhone. I realized like oh, that's a beautiful phone. I want that phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, oh, I that's looks like an iPhone, but you know the compromises now. It's 412  HTC sense on top of it buttons are a little odd no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  removable battery, which I regret  and  No, you know, you know, I'm not a fan of the HTC  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you know, I gotta say since I've gone back to Android I have especially with this note, too  I've yet to even care about a removable battery. I just have not a note to is huge. That's a yeah  Yeah, so it's it's been it's been a great experience in that sense. My mom is now my experiment. She's she's getting the note to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your mom  You know, she loves it cuz she I didn't tell her about the stylus right away  Let her play with a little bit and I said, oh there's also this and she's an artist and she's sketching now on it  She loves it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny my mom I gave my mom a stylus for the iPad and she let she just has she has long  She has nails. She has long nails that she has done and and I hand out the stylus  She's like, oh so much better. Yeah, you know just it just made you know, she liked it a lot a lot more  But that's really cool to hear an artist sketching on. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can make cards said yeah  Yeah, so she's figuring it out like this is a real challenge she's 80 years old  Sharp is attack, but she you know, and she's cuz she has an iPad and a laptop  But I've been putting I installed last pass and I'm teaching her how to use the last pass her passwords  She has a a document a word document on her desktop called passwords

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Passwords dot doc. Yeah  So  Lastpass like teaching mom how to use last pass. That's first of all ambitious. Yes  extraordinarily  My wife on the last pass yet and she's no sly like she knows she just has no patience for anything that isn't easy  You know what I mean? Like she's it's less about her not being able to get it  It's more about her just being like this is ridiculous that I have to go through this like  I use it and I love it, but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's pretty nerdy. She seems to be getting it  She likes the idea that she only has to remember one password. We created a nice long password. She's okay now  I'm gonna write it down. I said no you're not  The last pass password has to be up here. She said I can't remember anything  I said well, we're gonna work it out and I came up with a mnemonic for and I think she'll remember it  Of course, I kept a copy of it. Just any oh is a wonderful son. That's it. No  Oh  She's gonna hate me when she gets home and can't figure out how to use her phone  But she had she doesn't she had a feature phone like a really old bad feature phone that didn't even work

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is gonna be your first bit. I bet that big screen is perfect for her then I just loves that  I had to think about that for a minute. That's why I went there exactly Lamar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's actually a much lower resolution  Than this ironically than the HTC one even though it's it's five and a half inches, but she can read it's much easier  I made the I even made the text a little bit bigger. They have a Samsung has a simple  Launcher version that is perfect for her

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

It's really cheap. No, no, no used to be no that used to be they wouldn't deliver

No, it's fun  Fun, it's it looks daunting  No, and there's no words. It's just pictures of strange ball-headed people. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's fun until you twist that one piece in and lock it and realize that  It's aligned and then you have to in my case go to my wife and be like, please fix this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  I like y'all put this together. That's my exact reaction is I this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it was cheap furniture, but i'm gonna pay 500 bucks. That's what I paid for two bedroom sets in an office  That's not too bad to assemble it. But I just i've decided it's kind of I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't like them. There's something I feel I have never done such a good job of derailing the show is right now

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that that table is cheap that's 329 bucks they're great they're great, but then it takes four hours to assemble it  Oh, what's your hourly rate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm gonna have you over it was how I worked out all my nervous energy during the pregnancy. It's like, okay  Let's put the baby's dresser together. Well, i'm encouraged now. I think I can do this now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I can if you guys could do it. I should be able to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought you had to have some skills  I I fit our entire dining room set when we had it in my honda civic. There's no way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In a civic, yeah, because it's just flats. It's a bunch of flats. Nothing's too big

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this whole big set. I mean now we've grown up since then we have a you know, like a grown-up. I'm gonna have to try it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've assembled furniture. I just I looked at that. I thought this looks really hard and I hired

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina's right too. It's it's one of the distracting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, all right, all right, all right  Well, it turned out that there were two pieces missing from my desk  So it's been sitting on pieces on my floor for six months  So I have to go to ikea to get those two more pieces

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you go you go into through the exit and you go to the the desk there and you say I need the  And you're right  That's what they said  You are an ikea pro  Well, I i'm telling you man. I am telling you I know ikea  I uh, the the ad agency for ikea was dunny doige  Oh, yeah, also the ad agency for entertainment weekly  And so we sat in one of the first meetings about entertainment weekly and I and I said ikea you represent ikea  I love ikea. I started telling all these stories  I was a killer and I tell them all the rooms in my house where i have ikea and he finally just sits there  And i'll censor myself and he just said you are effing disturbed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so the chat room web 77 71 in our chat room said dan arieli who wrote predictably irrational. He's a  brilliant interesting guy who does  The psychology of economics  Yes, and econometrics and he says dan arieli says this is an intentional device from ikea  He says because you were put so invest so much in assembling this furniture. You love it. You have now invested

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In this furniture. It's like the reason in early cake  When when uh early cake mixes came out  And you could just make a whole cake for the mix. They didn't need eggs. They didn't need milk. Just water  They didn't like that they didn't like that so that's why they they took the eggs out you had to put the eggs in  So you thought you invested something in isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like that's what that's that's why I feel like my furniture strangers to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like i'm not comfortable sitting on you and I are alienated from our bedroom sets because we didn't put the time in to build them

Transcript:  I still have my beloved stockholm chair

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I i'm at my jerkered desk. I won't give this thing up. I love it. I absolutely love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like you built it and yeah, I I made it with my own hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's true. It's it's a very effective psychological trick

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have to have tape of this too

Transcript:  Why maybe maybe when we come up for i.o. We'll go get your missing pieces. We'll do the wrong thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, you will get it'll be funny. It's it's good. So you everybody want the first time puts it in sideways

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's also got a bs. It's still yeah, it's a weird. I mean, I guess they have to create some sort of comparison

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the equivalent of an 80 inch screen, you know, right? What does it mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but no they're talking about the angle  uh, you know  the  Camera is only five megapixels 720p video. So it's kind of a lower quality, but that's fine again  You know, this is four megapixels five's fine. Uh, the audio this worries me bone conduction transducer  So that's when you have a thing on your on your temple that goes  And you're supposed to hear it i've never found those work very well  Wi-fi bluetooth 12 gigs of usable memory you could put some apps on this  Syncing with google cloud storage 16 gigs of flash total they say in battery life a day of typical use  But some things like video and hangouts are more battery intensive you charge it via micro usb  This is the thing I found most interesting compatibility any  bluetooth capable phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah, so scobel didn't have to run over to android

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That surprised me  But if you want to use the my glass app, which you can get by the way now in the store

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to have android 4 and by the way, by the way, here's a problem  So I downloaded and and they've done it again. They've done it again according to one report. It won't work with apps accounts  Oh, just i'm trying to move everything over to my app. I have to I have to now do something  I'm going to be committed to it with my  Gmail account  That's really frustrating that is frustrating rex hammock who's this wonderful guy publisher in the south who?  I've known online for years. He finally moved his google plus over to  His own account his apps account  It took a month  And he lost stuff along the way and he's kind of saying unless you have a really good reason to do it  Don't do it. So now i'm sitting with trepidation saying i'm going to do this again  I'm going to commit to something because google didn't get their act together

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a bummer

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, my only issue I guess it could be solved since it's connected to your phone is that it doesn't have  Uh, you know 4g just automatically built in so this thing is always on but i'm assuming you're required to have a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, a little spigot there that puts the beer in your mouth jeez lamar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he has a hat for that  All right, and now apparently, uh another city has been named  God, this is this is the jealousy episode  Yeah, first it was kansas city, missouri  Uh, then it was austin texas and now google fibers going into provo utah next. Oh, you're kidding me  Oh, I didn't hear about that one just happened just happened. Yeah  So what's interesting about that is that they're rolling it out so fast. I mean, I thought that kc was just a demo  But maybe not maybe they want to maybe there's more going on here than meets the eye, right?  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not moving to utah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Provo is a very techie. These are all the three things these these have in common. Well, certainly austin and provo  They're yeah, silicon prairie. They're calling it silicon prairie silicon hills silicon slopes  These are all big tech cities silicon alley here. Darn it google. Well, yeah, what about yeah, what about that?  And what about silicon valley  Well, and what about telecom valley aka petaluma california us of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, I have I have uh the former atd headquarters in my town

Transcript:  So what is la called

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sin city, baby arm pit of america. No, don't say that  My old professor at claremont his wife would never come down because he was in the armpit of america

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you read uh the um?  The faq after you looked at the specs  Kind of tongue-in-cheek funny. You can't scuba in glass  That would be kind of tempting scuba dive in google glass  It can't get wet apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, you know in the rain

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well can get a little wet maybe maybe you have to wear a hat

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, some people actually thinking they can scuba dive. I guess that they had to put that in there people actually assuming that will work

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and jeena they had they've released besides the app have they released an api

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have they announced the api they called the mirror api  And uh, it looks like very very simple rest api aloft  They they um, they shipped uh, sdks and python and java, of course, because it's google. That's what they do  um, and uh, and yeah, and they released guidelines as well what's interesting i haven't had a chance to dig into the mirror api yet, but  You don't actually run apps on glass from what I can tell. Oh, and by the way glass apps are called glassware  You don't run apps on glass now. This is now for some reason and I I guess I just didn't  I was thinking that glass ran android on it, but but that's I don't know if it's actually true  So the apps don't actually run on glass. It's a cloud  Api right so the user kind of kind of authenticates their glass with the api and then you send rest  You know you send api calls to to google through the cloud and then it notifies  Uh your glass and that's how you show those timeline cards also really interesting. They release the terms of service the mirror api  No ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ads are forbidden. I saw that you cannot have an ad which is very apple-like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fascinating right? I mean google is an advertising company and and the and the the companies that are releasing the first sort of glassware apps are  Evernote new york times twitter. I mean these are all ad-based businesses  um, so I can't tell if this is a launch thing  Or, you know, they just want to keep it clean for for launch right because what you know, and you know to me  I'm not huge on advertising but to me, you know  One of the things about glass that I would love to see is things like hey  There's a four square special at the place, you know down the street, which is kind of an ad right? I mean, you know  Um, you know new york times top stories that those are going to have ads on them, right? I mean  Um, I imagine if I had had glass I would have found out about the the bombings  You know that this week on glass versus on twitter, which is where I actually found out about them  So it's interesting that no ads part was very very interesting  It must be just about sort of having a a clean launch and you know  The advertising thing has been one of the critics sort of biggest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Points right like oh, yeah, let's give the world's biggest advertising company like real estate right in front of your face

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm actually happy about this. I don't want ads on my glass. Yeah, I I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm happy too, but i'm also just perplexed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do think that there's a real value to location aware offers maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And those are those not ads?  I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are there  Well the con on four square every con every bit of content is kind of the same  right, so  I think what's gonna happen is your your glass will drive you to your phone and your phone is where you're gonna find the commerce

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go. I think one of the one of the best apps that should be on here. My opinion is that  A field trip app  I played I played around with that when I was in New York and I was like really helpful to  It will just pop up local landmarks as I was driving by them and and a cab and that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an example of our where where the full app is not going to work on glass  I don't think very well you're gonna have to do a glass version of that and you're gonna go to your phone for more

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely, you'll just pop up. Hey, you're here and then look at yeah, you're right. Look at your phone for more  And this would be a little like reversal sign for glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The eyebrow pinch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would imagine I wonder how much information will be on there  I think some of this has to do with the fact that there's not they did they give the resolution of the screen?  They didn't there can't be probably a lot of information on that little scroll. So it's going to be a chime and an icon  Yes, look at you. It's an answer to a question. Yeah, it's a bit of a little bit of direction

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you're not going to be reading the New York Times on your glass  You're gonna say bullet and something's happening and you're gonna go to another device, right? Right. It's gonna be breaking news  Yeah, but imagine on a day like Monday and by the way our hearts and yes indeed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, go out to everybody in Boston, but imagine on a day like Monday where everybody's fixed to the news  Probably a lot of people watching on TV and if in a world where everybody's wearing glass  That's all people are going to be doing is like looking up into their glass, right?  Well, I don't know Leo. That's what that's what I'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not gonna be reading the whole story, but it's emasculating to look at your phone  He's never gonna he's never gonna live that down  He's not but isn't he isn't it didn't Sergey say in effect that Ted the point of glass is so that you don't have to look at your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think from most note of view  I think it's a little bit of a different story. I think it's a little bit of a different story  The point of glass is so that you don't have to look at your phone  I think from most notifications it makes sense  Well, we these are all questions that robert scobel will be answering later today

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His pair is he picking up his parents he had to go and get it at google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so but does that but i'm wondering do does that we're all gonna have to do that. I guess we have to get trained

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a york la or but that was for the people were invited via the twitter contest

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about well, oh, I see right and they're all explorers all of us are explorers  I saw some option to mail. I don't know. Yeah, I thought they were gonna mail it to us google i.o recipients

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, trust me robert wanted to go to google to parade up there to yeah to get it. Yeah, I know robert

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the question then so so if if the if the so when I get it  This is I can't do anything right like change my skype in in ubuntu  Uh, you know, I won't be programming anything for the glass. I'll be using whatever is made available to me and trying to figure out  the implication  What i'm hearing from eugene is that I won't be getting glass apps  I'll be getting glass ready phone apps, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no  So from what I understand the apps don't aren't don't live on your phone and they don't live on glass  I believe that you authorize these apps. These are basically web apps  You authorize these apps through your glass account on the web and that they're that they have you grant them rights essentially to push notifications to your glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. So what you have here is the glass play store  no  the glass app store  I think so maps

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's more like chrome. Yeah, I guess I guess you'd say more like chrome apps  I mean, I think there's going to be a section in your google account settings  Which is like just like in your twitter account settings. These are all the accounts that can touch my twitter  It's gonna be kind of like these are all the all the apps that I have authorized to interact with my glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Challenges are amazing because because it's not like you're gonna have, you know, a hundred apps constantly alerting you geez  No, and how are you gonna call up a new app? I feel like getting pizza now  How do you how do you go to that app or is it voice command to go to an app? It's gonna be very yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It will be interesting. I mean, I think it's gonna be okay glass  I mean, I think I think you're gonna be able to summon an app  Different ways right voice right there's a way you take a picture by doing some sort of gesture  I'm totally totally not completely sure but but but your question about the store  That's interesting, right?  There's gonna there's gonna be some kind of place where there's gonna be a store or a place where all the apps you can discover  Glass apps, right and didn't cliner perkins just just announced that they're that they're gonna be investing in glassware

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we had the picture of them last last week, right? That's right. Yeah, we talked about it last week

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not entirely sure  Right, right, right, but that's storage that 12 gigabytes of storage  That's a lot of storage and it's and it's automatically from what I understand sync to google cloud storage, right?  So you're not keeping anything on glass. I think that's through your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um

Transcript:  That would be fun. That would be really fun. I was just gonna go to l.a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right  It should give you a loner piece that you can wear during the whole experience of getting the glass right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it says you'll meet with a member of the glass team to have them fitted properly  See that you don't get that if you just get them shipped to you and then get a basic walkthrough of the device and operating system  You're encouraged to quote bring a friend good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I forget was okay  The the term of art now for a person who behaves baddie badly wearing glasses is of course glass hole

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Looking glass alice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And i'm still jeff and london saying this glass thing is overly totally oversold. I am still skeptical  I I just want it because I want to try it  But I I find this hard to believe that this is going to be anything but a but a car wreck, but we'll see  Why are you laughing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think it's funny. You think it's gonna be a car wreck. It's gonna be a car wreck

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always say that  I don't always say that  Dvorak always says that some technologies I love i'm I look i'm i'm a pro technology. I'm a technology lover  But you also have to say hey when something's kind of like this isn't gonna this is this can't possibly work  And I just I find this hard to believe that people wearing these little things is gonna go anywhere at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but look at what i mean the pixel  Mind you I adore the machine. It's wonderful, but i've said it's not going to become huge  Glass is not going to become huge. No self-driving cars  Are not going to become huge under google, right?  They're gonna it's gonna take a long time right?  But google is really pushing this I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts besides yours leo  Is a guy named peter day at the bbc who does a show called?  Um, it's a business show. I forget the name of it, but but peter is a world of business  And he interviewed uh eric bryanielson and his co-author his name you always forget because you're so proud you remember bryanielson  You can't remember the other name  Race against the machine and and they do the old story of the  Wise person who was rewarded by the chinese king. What do you want?  I just want a chess board and one grain of rice one grain of rice  Right and their point is it's it's things start to get crazy in the second 32  Squares right and we're now in the second 32 iterations of moore's law, right?  And we're in the second 32 of of wild innovations  You never could imagine so one of their examples is for example  That they said one of the things that will never be taken over by machines because it just can't be as being a truck driver  Because there's so many decisions you have to make and blah blah blah blah and of course now we have this  And we have ups drooling over the chance of getting this  So so I think that's where google is that's the whole moonshot talk that's the whole you know x labs is they're pushing  They're trying to push  Because the because it still goes back to saying the more we use the internet for more reasons the more money they make and they're  Set up in a position better than anyone else including facebook to make money that way  So I think that you're right leo these things in and of themselves as google branded products  They don't care if they take on  But if they push everybody else  Things will come out that'll be good for google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But really do you think so somebody else is going to make glass and it's going to take off

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to see I think we're all going to see some measure of notification  That's going to be acceptable and will work whether we'll have a camera on at the same time or not might be a watch  Uh, that's where I mean other people will try. Yes, there have been tried tries before  But I think I think notification up by your eye makes perfect sense. This is geeky and everyone's gonna make fun of it  But everybody made fun of us walking down the street talking on the phone, right and then talking without the phone, right? So we adapt  Um, yeah, I think there's some kind of constant  notification structure that we're gonna want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not adverse to the idea of glass. I just I just  I think it's ungainly. This is not a product. This is this no, I mean, I this but I wouldn't expect it to be you're right  I would there's no reason for the concept of an idea where they've gotten

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  uh, you know  10,000 people right 10,000 people in on it, right?  And actually covered the basic costs of it while they're at it  So there's gonna be all kinds of development all kinds of surprising wonderful things  As I mentioned my student and acrobat is coming up with something that's going to help people with dementia and Alzheimer's patients, right?  Recover their days using this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All kinds of patients like I'll wear it and my pebble watch  Am I monocle? I'm gonna wear them all  Did you get your money? Not yet. I monocle  Yeah, you still haven't gotten it no, so here's the deal so they sent me a note saying hey, yeah you orders yours in a color  Uh, we're having trouble with the color. So would you like black and I said yes  and then nothing so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've sold mine so long since I've already sold yours

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Received and sold

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo I left the car wreck thing just because I listen i'm skeptical too  I don't know how to feel about it  But I just I just don't presume to know that I know the future like I still just want to try it to get an idea  We all thought that it was crazy that we'd all walk around wearing headphones, right?  There's plenty of technology we all thought that would be crazy that no one would accept  So I just I just kind of want to try it. I gotta tell you though. I you know, jason was saying last night  Oh, you know people when we go to google ios a lot some people are gonna have glass and some people lots of people  Are gonna have glass, you know haves and have nots. Yep  I don't know if i'm gonna walk around this with the wearing these things in public, you know  Like right now I feel like just the kind of the social implication is i've got 1500 dollars to you know, disposable income  I have this i'm connected to google or have access to google  I'm, you know living sort of the the techno utopian lifestyle that sort of this early access to these types of things  Signifies and i'm not sure if i'm ready to identify  Right, yeah, right exactly it is very much  It's a one percent. It's very much flaunting very much a one percent thing. Yes. Yeah a techno one percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a reference leo will understand it's like wearing a neiru jacket worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although that pretty much marked you as a glass hole, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is gonna be one of those things like I remember when the kindle first came out and I got on a train  And and people you know, it's that oh, what is that?  Can I see it? Can I touch it?  And I have a feeling and you don't I don't let them because i'll show you but you can't  You can't have my thing that I just got this is my precious  So you can imagine people saying with the glass. Oh, can I try it on and it's that privacy invasion thing  So gene I kind of agree with you. It's gonna it's gonna be weird in public

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I we all have that experience when you know  At least certainly I did with the first ipad the first iphone whenever you have a new technology  And and you're the first kindle's a very good example. You do get attention, but this is a that's generally positive attention  I think jeena's point is it's kind of going to be negative at like  Oh, look at him over there. He thinks he's something the first brick phone recording right the first brick phones. It's really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know the thing about that's a good example. Yeah  Because it's on your face. I don't know how many people are going to say can I try on your glasses?  That's a very personal thing to say, you know, I might have said to someone can I see your kindle?  But I may I wouldn't ask them to wear their glasses, but that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She knows right you can't share it the way you can share the things  No, Lamar could show his kindle to somebody even while holding on to it for dear life

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because you're wearing it's what's funny  You know when I take the baby out and I have her in the stroller people will touch her and talk to her and stuff  If I have her in the ergo if i'm kind of wearing her on my chest people are much less likely to touch her because it's  Just kind of a personal space thing. It's a difference between wearing something and and carrying it, right?  So but but I think with glass is going to introduce the whole like are you taking pictures?  Are you recording me right now?  You know, and I think the people are just kind of kind of stare at the little cyborg thing, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Be like what's that? You know and distract them a little bit. I predict I predict it's going to become such a cliche  In san francisco, you're so used to seeing it out there that it's going to become no big deal  And a lot of people spend money to look cool who aren't going to look cool anymore and it's going to be just really

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you should loudly say gina. We are bork and then just scare the heck out of them. I am loctus

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You wanted something let me ask gina  But with the glass app somebody in the chairman said you could say well, yeah, this is glass. Let me show you what i'm seeing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's true. That's that'd be cool. Oh, yeah, that's nice. Yeah, that would be cool  That's probably why they do that right? Okay. Good got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think because they're 1500. I don't think you're gonna see a whole bunch of them around for a while  Oh in san francisco, i'm saying that's a lot of money. I'm interested

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Something that is very speculative. There's a lot of rich glass holes in san francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you all think this is going to drop down to I predicted a very aggressive  500 dollar price when a year from now just to get into people's hands is that too drastic of a drop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that you know, that's an interesting question lamar the you know, you can imagine  This phone to get this to the price that the nexus 4 got to  They really had to do some neat things and subsidize right the class. What's the what's the expensive technology there? Oh, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's  Yeah, that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm not so sure it's so it's so it's really I think it's just the tininess of it  You know the compactness of it. What's you what you've gone through that expense and amortize that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not like you're buying a big piece of beautiful gorilla glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we'll know pretty quick because I presumably I fix it. We'll have a copy of it  You know have one as sometime in the next few days and they'll do a tear down  We'll know what's in there. I'm thinking more and more that it isn't enough. It will not run apps directly  Right, so it doesn't have to be quite as fast or powerful a machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if it's dependent on your phone for the most part, I can't I can't see them going over  $500 for this I think even that's a lot. I think that's just too expensive. Yeah. Yeah, it has it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has it two antennas in it, right? It has your Wi-Fi in your and your  Bluetooth antenna in it. It has some smarts in it to handle the memory offload and that kind of stuff and display  Right, it's got the little display but that's not you know, that's just that's just the lcd.

Transcript:  Did you hear about the new inactive account manager for when you die, yeah  When you stop using your google account leo, which you know could be death but could be other situations too  I could I could move to china. Yeah, you could move to china. So google launches a new inactive account manager  This is a part of your google account settings  That's let that lets you specify what happens if you stop using your google account for a certain amount of time  So you choose a timeout period three months six months nine months 12 months  You add your phone number and you add 10 trusted friends or family members their their phone numbers their email address  And um, you let google know hey  You know what get in contact with these people and give these people access  For example, you could say give these people access to my account to download my data through google takeout  Um, or you can tell google, you know, just shut down my account after so much time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You may not want for instance anybody to see what's in that account  So you may just say google after three months six months a year if I don't log in  They send you an email saying hey, you're not logging in i'm gonna do something and then they delete it  Which may be what you want right for privacy. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, they give you a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they email you they contact you they try to contact you and you give your phone number as well to say hey, you know what?  You know in a month from now, we're going to take this action that you specified and the inactive account manager

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to turn this on. Did you uh, leo? Did you uh, do you still have the email you set up on twit?  Yeah  So it's still set up that  Because you were laughing that that oh, oh, if I gotta go back and change this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah  I set it up on twit this week and the message that goes out to all my friends when I die is I was batman  You're right, I forgot to take that off

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoops

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can also set up an automated response that goes out to people who email you after this after this event  Of inactivity comes the timeout period  So I haven't actually set this up here to have to kind of think this through like who are the 10 people?  Who i'd want to give access to my google account or do I want to do that?  Do I want to just have it deleted? I think it's so great. I just I I I would I would want everything deleted

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I would kind of want my video still up. I wish they had a way to specify which parts can be deleted

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And which parts Dave Weiner has talked for a long time about the need for  You know kind of a digital will and a digital executor  Um who can follow your wishes? Yeah, definitely definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean my plan was like well, i'll just leave my last pass, you know, my one master password, you know behind  Figure out I right right which  Exactly, which my loved ones will not be able to figure out especially my wife  She'll be like, of course, she made me use this stupid thing  I love last pass but you know, it's a little it's a little complicated for the non the non-power user  But you know the fact is I change my master password sometimes, you know things happen you change your password  So just hard to keep it up to date. Where do you keep it? Do you lock it in a safe somewhere?  So I really like this and I hope to see and I think that as sort of the web apps  Mature and this becomes an issue that that more apps more hosted apps will do this sort of thing  Let you say what happens to my data if I disappear  Okay, uh what else what else do it? Yeah, so the oh um next up the chrome beta for android got a new update a couple of cool  New features that we'll soon see in stable these these features move pretty quickly from beta to stable  There's a new full screen on phones mode as you scroll down the page the toolbar kind of gets folded under and disappears  And when you scroll back up it reappears, you can see your url  When you search in google in the search box the keywords that you search for right now in the stable version  You search in google and they they appear in the google search box  So you have to go edit them in in the search box in the page  And with this new update they actually stay in the omnibox, which is the the the kind of the url  Search key keyword area so that that makes it a lot easier to edit your searches after you search  Ah, that's good. Yeah, which is which is nicer and also on  Tab history on tablets so chrome beta on android tablets you long press on the back button you will be able to view your tab history  Speaking of mobile search google's been making some changes to some of its results  There's a new quick view badge for sites like wikipedia  So if you search for I think the example they gave was poker hands  Uh, the wikipedia page is the first happens to be the first result  You'll see a small blue badge on the bottom right hand of the uh of the search result  Which chat is showing us right now and you click on that and you can see a preview of the wikipedia page  Um, so you can kind of read the wikipedia page without actually going to the wikipedia page  Just quick access to the information you want  Kind of along those lines, uh rotten tomatoes is getting kind of the website rotten tomatoes is getting some special treatment that apparently more  Websites are going to get if you search for rotten tomatoes on your phone  The results will actually break out rotten tomatoes categorization of movies into subsections actually in the results  So I think the top result is um, you know, what's in theaters right now, you know  Show me theaters now at what's in theaters now and then the first option is best movies in theaters right now  So right there in google search results you say show me the best movies in theaters right now  Which makes a lot of sense if you're searching for movies on your phone  Chances are you want to go to one?  Um, so and and google says that this this kind of functionality, uh will roll out for other websites  Love that many sites will have similar functionality going forward  Uh also in chrome and this is on the desktop when you install chrome extensions. Uh, google's adding some security  Measures to protect you from malicious binaries  I guess um chrome extensions that don't follow all of google's guidelines about how to deploy and change settings  Maybe that they shouldn't be changed that they shouldn't be changing  Google's starting to flag those as malicious and we'll show you a warning if you try to install them  So we always welcome that a little extra extra security  And finally we talked about this earlier good the google glass my glass companion app is out for android  It's in the play store. It's an android 4.0 and up only you can't do anything with it unless you actually have glass  And the web-based setup wizard for when you do if you do get glass is also is also live  um, so the the my glass companion app just gives you like like leo said earlier just  lets you get sms and navigation pushed from your phone and um, and so  And leo they said that glass will work with any bluetooth enabled phone  But this is but the my glass app is only available for android right or above so I don't know what that means  Last time to work with the iphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe it's a very fancy expensive earpiece. Yeah, perhaps

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, my glass doesn't do much the biggest thing it does is that play back the video that you're seeing through the phone  And then it lets you set up some stuff on glass. I presume it's an open api, right? So so that you could write apps to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Write an app on it pushes sms messages to glass and it and it uses uh the the gps  Of your phone as well. So navigation  At location so that's that's significant, right? I mean those are two huge cases for glass  uh, so  So that's out, uh for all of us who don't have glass yet  But wilson, that's all I got

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, did you already install it? I did  I want to be ready

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to be ready? Yeah, the minute that it arrives. I haven't installed yet, but i'm totally gonna install it jena with the um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  with the bluetooth 4.0  Which i'm assuming all the android phones will have you can  Uh have multiple devices on under at the same time, right? Because I sometimes play my radio. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Through the phone and and other yeah, lots of you can have multiple bluetooth prices cool, but and oh wait a minute though  Can you have multiple paired?  That's what I was asking time  That's a good question. I don't know. I don't think so  That will be yeah. Yeah, that's a big point  I don't want to get in the car and not be able to use my bluetooth connection to my phone because i've got glass on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not getting it. That's it. That's it. It's done done. Yeah, and that speaking of done is the google changelog

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of ran down like that facebook home is getting terrible reviews on the play store, but you explain this lamar  48 percent of users gave it one star lamar says  It's just because they don't have a phone that can use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what some people say I was incorrect with that that you that and I probably was that  You have to install something in a play store before you can review it. Oh, okay  So I I can I have no problem taking that back. I still  Believe that these people who got it didn't spend more than five minutes within and got disgusted. They just don't like facebook  Yeah, it's a chance to vote on facebook. It popped up. They freaked out right and and then they gave it a one  I just think people on the android stores particularly they probably do it in apple store too  They um, excuse me the play store is that they just they're too quick to judgment without giving something some time  I personally  Like facebook home because i'm looking at it from a from a different point of view  You know for the person who's immersed in facebook. This is perfect  And I don't care about android at and on the on the bottom end and that's really what facebook wants you  They don't want you to care about the os  They want you to just use facebook and the apps that you love to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So i'm gonna install it right now. You don't have to be afraid to say you like it lamar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She doesn't sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, I think it's a really good well designed out  We reviewed it last night on all about android. Uh, ron richards reviewed it and um, he's not a huge facebook user  But even he was like, you know, this is really well designed and I interacted with facebook so much more  Having this up and for someone for whom  Facebook is the main thing they do on their phone and you know for me  It's just twitter twitter is one of the main things I do on my phone  I mean I do social just doesn't happen to happen, you know happen to be facebook  It makes a lot of sense that you know, you don't have to tap through a bunch of apps in order to get stuff done  Um, so I mean, I I really like the idea of facebook home  I I don't happen to be a huge facebook user, but I think that the concept that that is is very powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what those people were wrong. I just installed facebook home on this htc1, which I thought it supported  I was able to install it, but then it said thanks for installing facebook home. Your device is not supported yet  So that would I would give it a one star after so you can write can you write now?  Can I write a review? Hell? Yeah  And I'd give it one star because I it don't work so you could install something even if it's not compatible  Well, I guess in this case a lot of times no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird usually you shouldn't be able to but there are some apps when it happens and I don't know if that's because  They're rolling out  See one compatibility. I mean they said they were they said that was gonna work on the one  It might be just early you might just be you know, one of the first people who has the one and you are interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because i'm usually always right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a frustrating experience that that deserves a one star review. Yeah, I think that's that would explain a lot of those bad reviews

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Meanwhile eric schmidt says I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Holy cow  He has to say that you know, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He can't say I hate it. There's their evil. That's the evil empire. You should trust us not facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He has to appear open, you know for open source. So he  You know or the idea that's what he was saying. So he he has to embrace it. I've been behind the scenes  They're kicking themselves that google plus didn't do it first. I wish google plus would do it. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might make you actually use google plus. I would use it. Just steal it steal it outright just say hey, nope

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it schmidt said it took some guts for them to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know in my opinion it really puts puts things like htc  Samsung to shame that they have to put all their crapware  Inside android and embed it where facebook can just lay right over it  And and you get all the function that you need and you can turn it off if you didn't like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to say the uh this the on the sense five which is part of this htc one  They have that that home front page  Uh that combines a bunch of stuff and I kind of like it. I mean it's  It's it's not quite  Facebook home, but it's but it's kind of you know, you see all your you see, you know, these are from facebook flicker  You know, you see different posts from different. Oh, that's a nice angle. You like that head  Sorry, we pointed the camera somewhere different  So this is this is my uh, this is the front page on the htc one with the traditional sense date and weather  Although it's nice and flat and then uh, here's a here's a picture from coachella  Uh, here's facebook postings  uh flicker postings  Uh, I presume twitter as well and so forth  So I think that's that's that's a nice way to do it's like flipboard  And that's somewhat like home. I don't have the chat heads but gosh google could just well  Maybe when they come out with babel or babel or whatever the heck they're gonna call it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone on twitter said it's babel like the yeah, and it didn't look like he was a googler  But he seemed pretty sure that it's babel. So how would he know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know right. We don't know when google tells us how to pronounce it. That's you could be either way  But the babel fish in hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is pronounced babel. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, one of the ways I made I made facebook home really useful  Um is I took things like I talked about some twit, but I took things like  Uh twit mashable verge and all these things that normally have in facebook, excuse me and flipboard  And I and I like them on facebook. So now you're seeing them. Yeah  And I can see news as it happens. I put breaking news in there  So it's really helpful and the nice thing is you don't want to see your family feed of certain  Your friends you can turn them off of your news feed and just show you know  Your news feed without a lot of the crap on it. So  I think it has a lot of potential  I'm very positive toward it because that is where my audience is and that is where my friends are  And they're just not on google plus and i'm i'm tired of  pushing that  Wagon alone when it's not moving for me that well, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, i'm with you. But but again if google got a clue and saw this and said we could do this

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would use google plus more i'd prefer to use that over facebook frankly  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right more people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anti-trust complaint against android is an attack on open source. Yeah, whatever  Did you see this? I thought this was so surprising andy rubin the creator of android  Yeah, who sold it to google said, you know what we really were thinking?  It was a camera. It was a camera operating system. It's a great story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's so great that it became that eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Only right and then it actually thought that was so wowie somebody thought about it  It's a camera it is a camera we were right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's so heartening especially for people sort of just building new things to be like  Oh even even something as successful as android like had to pivot in its early days and figure out what it should be  Right, like every every good product has that moment of reckoning when it's like, oh, okay  Maybe we're not this but this is really working right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and they said the cameras weren't a big enough market yet, which was true  Because it all went smartphones. So it was a good call on them to to not allow that to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But these smartphones are for many people their camera. So yeah, I have a way that also is  Yeah  It's conveyed  Um now my windows machine is frozen again. All right  I'm gonna buy a pixel. I tell you does that ever freeze on you jeff you ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it doesn't I will I will say i'll tell you that today. I had a brief moment of self-doubt when uh google apps and and and  And uh  The drive went down

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I oh let's talk about that. How long was it down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not that long enough for everybody, but it was down for me  The front page of drive the directory was down for a few minutes  I don't know how long i've been down before that but then I tried to get to the rundown. I couldn't that's why I  I went and then I only got to the one I finally got to the rundown chad said oh I was out  Late when I started getting to the morning. So I had it stuff in  but uh  I'd say 15 minutes. It was a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it I was I was prepping for my show  I do on five by five and we use a document to get ready for the show and I couldn't get I was just  It was just a 500 and I was like, hmm  I don't know if i'm gonna be able to do this show that makes you second guess the cloud doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but then I went to this unfortunately, I didn't finish the experiment here so that I said well  But I have a chromebook and I have uh  local storage of the cloud  And so I went to the chrome app the the offline chrome app and sure enough  There was a director of everything there. I said it was synced, you know seven minutes ago  I said great and then I tried to open it and because I was online it tried to go open up the online version  And I was about to then go offline to make sure that I actually did have it stored locally  But then it came back so I didn't I didn't fully experiment with that. But no, I do have local storage  But it does make you think it does make you say it makes you think for a second like oh crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I shouldn't keep stuff that I really need to be here all the time on here

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or do I have some automated way because the problem is I have more problems with dropbox than I do with the cloud the cloud  Works docs works fine. So for this morning  The other thing by the way, the fullest load that happened on the on the chromebook was I was getting these horrible full page  Uh takeover ads and I thought this was acting like and I was like like it was changing dns and doing a route around  I thought this this does not happen  on chrome os  But it was called infinity ads  Seen  And so somebody just in twit said and twitter said just go erase the cookies dummy and I did and was gone  Wow, but where was that coming from?  This this thing called infinity ads  And well you would go to a site and had nothing to do with the site  It would suddenly open up a full page blow up  Which in the old days you did that by by doing a dns route through it was really dubious thing the isp

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't do that can't they? Yeah, that was weird. There was a isp in florida. I think that was doing that was pretty horrible  But how did you get that on your system? That's bizarre

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was the cookie. So the when I erased the cookie it was gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I sent messages to troll you and be like those dang cookies. They're killing the internet  Sorry  Sorry, sorry poor jeff. We're abating too much already because of the pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's just an odd thing. I I don't understand. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I stole there was something to be done here  That sure feels like malware to be honest it kind of does yeah, and you think well, here's the other thing is  Because of you and the need for skype  I don't know whether i'm less secure because i'm in dev mode, right?  That may well be yes, it may well be yes, maybe more. That's our that's our fault. It certainly is. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most certainly certainly is  Well, what we're hoping is that we can get web rtc working

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be very cool, that would be very nice something the great thing about that is you can write your own darned app  To do whatever you want to there would be neat things you can do with that  Right

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  righto  Uh, i'm just looking to see if there's anything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you did it. I think we're done. The twitter music. Do we talk about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it hasn't launched yet. We've talked about it before but there's nothing to see here if you go to music.twitter.com  That's true  Uh, we keep waiting to hear what's going on. They have created a launching page. Oh, I know what else the galaxy s4 now  available on all us carriers this month  So i'm gonna probably get one on my t-mobile account. So we'll have a little head to head between this and the uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hgc1 i'm gonna get it on t-mobile myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, me too and somebody said uh on venture beat that the crapware that comes on the galaxy s4  Mark will mark the beginning of the end of samsung smartphone  Dominance, this is an opinion piece  obviously, uh by john  coit sear  Uh than the mobile beat he says it's because of you know, this crappy  Stuff like the hover and they follow your eyes and all of that stuff. There's so much kind of  Gim Jim crackery gim crackery. How do you pronounce that gim crackery?  On there, I don't know grandpa

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You never heard gim crackery i'm way too young to understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just made it up. Maybe jean and iron in our 20s. So we don't know you young people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll be old someday too. You're snapper whippers  Napper hampers  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So wait, he's calling that the samsung apps like the the eye the eye tracking and all that crapware gadget. Yeah gadget

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  gimmickry

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, and I think he's probably running is the samsung thinks it's what what?  Well distinguishes that differentiates it right it does in my mind too. Yeah, it makes me say no. Thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but is the difference between samsung's translation app and it's nav app and all that just that it's and google's  It's just that it's not google. I mean, I don't know. Do we just not take samsung seriously as a mobile app developer question

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why are these mobile apps from the carriers so crap are the manufacturers so bad?  Because they are generally right. They're not software development houses

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not they're not web services. That's it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even apple's own apps are not as good as in fact google's apps for apple are better than apple's apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On the iphone, but but also at the same time there is a brand thing going on here  There was a study that's up on the rundown that says that people prefer google search results  Even when it's just the google brand put on top of bing search results

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good for google  And also I saw the same things they get five times more malware from bing than you get so search results  And you get from google now  I will do one last story and then we'll get our picks of the week because we're going to wrap it up coming up patrick  Rothfuss  Who is the author of a book series that i'm just loving called the king killer chronicles?  A book series that trey ratcliffe told me if you don't like these books, I don't want to be your friend  You will join us on triangulation just a bit the neiman journalism lab published. I thought a very  Affirming article for me the end of big media  when news organizations move from brands  Like the new york times the wall street journal cbs to platforms for talent  And uh the writers nico millet and then john wibby  Who are the authors of a book called?  Melnico is the end of big how the internet makes david the new goliath  Did you read this? Uh yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, yeah, I got through most of my life. I I got distracted squirrel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And forgot to come back. I just like it because what they're basically saying is that news brands should invest in the people the talent the names  Because that's really why people follow a news brand

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the problem with this is that it it's not right for you leo. It's what you do  It's it's what others do. It's you know, it's it's it's the existence of lamar and folks like that  but  Uh, my argument lately has been that thinking that we're in the content business is a trap  That we make a product called content and that it's about our value what we bring to it is so wonderful  And I think in journalism at least we should see it as a service and the service has entirely  Yeah, and that's a very different thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're teaching journalism to to young impressionable children who should take your word because that's we need journalism as a service

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it serves the republic it serves but instead what I see is all a lot of my you know  A lot of people come in and say oh we have to we have to have more long-form journals, right?  And I make fun of that because I said, you know, I don't wake up in the morning saying  I want to read something long

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think a long in fact, you couldn't even finish this article. It's not even that long exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the problem. Uh, and it's not that long at all. Um  Touche, uh, but I read it on my on my pixel and it was beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Looks good on this old windows crap top, too. You can't even see it because it dies

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so I don't disagree for certain circumstances, but I also think there's a trap  There's an editorial ego trap here that says that we're so wonderful  We we writers and you know, I always remember the story that when I wrote the only time I ever  worked and in the same market as my parents lived is when we both lived in chicago and  More than once honest to god my mother would say to me. Did you see this story about it? I would say ma  I know I wrote it my own mother wouldn't notice my byline

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right  Well, that's true in a on a on a platform where you aggregate a lot of writers  But on the other hand this tweet is an example of a big ego  Creating a thing around the journalist say here's the in the article  They say on election day 2012 more than 20 percent of the new york times traffic to their website was nate silver's blog  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that makes a lot of sense, right? Yeah, it does and I think I think the times are smart to know that and and to work  with that and uh  They've worked with these kinds of brands and and yes, they're aware of that now  They're a collection of brands used to be the newspaper's brand would rub off on the writer  Now the writer's brand can rub off on the news. The real test will be andrew sullivan, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's gone off on his own to do his own thing behind a paywall no less?  Yes, um, and so it'll be very interesting to see whether he can succeed  With an outlet that is just him  behind a paywall

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um, I think what makes what makes something like this so successful and so  interesting is that  media right now  Uh, especially what what does article saying is really personality driven. I know yes what I do what I do on youtube is people can  You know, they don't really care about what i'm talking about. They care about  The the the person the the person or how how I deliver I think primarily that's why they stop by my channel  That's why they invest in it and I think it's the case for any any writers, you know, there there's certain writers  I prefer I prefer to to uh, uh read on tech crunch and I do others when I read it because I just like their  Flare and I I think that's going to be the case whether we kind of like it or not  But I do agree with jeff, you know, hopefully doesn't become too eagle-centric where it's all about the writer  But I I think the social aspect cannot be ignored here going forward or it's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Commentary and no reporting because reporting is kind of a thankless task that isn't about personalities real value  It's gathering facts  um, they also point out that social media is one of the reasons this has changed and  In order to capitalize on social media the brands the media brands really have to put people first  Upfront on twitter and facebook and that does make sense as well. Well, I just like it because it just kind of affirmed my model

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know for you. It does

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well because it's all about us if yeah, right, yeah if I only had a pixel  All right. We're gonna take a break. No, we're not we're gonna go right into it  Right and time for our tip our tool our number of the week. We'll start with jeena's tip of the week
