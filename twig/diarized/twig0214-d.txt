We're doing it today in the old studio, which is fine in the cozy confines of the old Twitch studio,  only because they're doing something else outside there, which we'll be doing later in the day.  Jeff Jarvis is here, professor of journalism at the City University of New York,  the author of Public Parts and What Would Google Do blogger at buzzmachine.com.  Hello, Jeffrey, an irascible, irreverent critic of all that is Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you call me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Irascible. How dare you call me irascible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's also jovial, kind and sweet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Irascible is a good word.  I was describing Gina Trippani.  She's the host of All About Android.  Been on air a lot this week.  We'll talk about that in a moment.  She's also a blogger at smarterword.org, the author of Think Up.  And hello, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hi. So good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, there's a lot to talk about today.  I don't even need my notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just a couple things. Just a couple things happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess we should start, Gina, because you were here this morning with the Samsung announcements at IFA.  Berlin is the host of the big telecom conference, IFA, this year, as always.  And Samsung took this opportunity to announce three new products.  Do you want to summarize?  Sure. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Samsung announced the Note 3, Galaxy Note 3, the new Galaxy tablet, 10.1 tablet.  And the thing that I was really excited about, we all wanted to hear about the Galaxy Gear smartwatch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it requires the Note 3 or the tablet, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has to be a Galaxy phone.  So it will work with the Galaxy, the GS4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A Galaxy phone running 4.3.  Yes.  So most GS4s have not yet been updated to 4.3.  But once you get that updated...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. The software update will come out in October.  So it's not just the Note.  This is what I was worried about.  Because they presented the Gear as a companion to the Note during the presentation.  And it was like, do you have to have the new Note 3 in order to use this watch?  That's not true. You just need to have a Samsung Galaxy phone and those updates will roll out over the next couple of months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm wondering if that has to do with Bluetooth LE.  Possibly.  Which is supported in GS4, but I wonder if OS support is not quite there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I think it's also going to work with the GS3 as well. Did that have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Samsung jumped on LE early, as did Apple.  The nice thing about LE is it doesn't use much battery life.  And yet you can keep a communication link open.  This Fitbit is an LE device.  It won't work with the HTC One because it doesn't support LE in hardware.  And I guess that's probably why.  I'm sure Samsung wants to sell more Samsung phones, but at the same time they probably also want to sell more $300 watches.  Yes.  So I'm guessing it's hardware. It's a hardware issue as opposed to a non-competitive issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there have to be non-Samsung devices that have the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The iPhone is the one that leaps to mind. I don't know if they'll ever support an iPhone with it.  They're not going to support the iPhone. It's an Android device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's an Android device. I believe it just doesn't have the keyboard.  The battery life is supposedly around 25 hours.  That's good. That's pretty good.  That's better than the leaks that we heard, which was 10 hours, which to me, as far as I'm concerned, 10 hours seemed unacceptable.  Although some of the folks that tried them out, like the Virgin Gizmodo said that the battery was low, just in there trying it out in the experience room there at the demo.  So I don't know. I'd wait to see what that looks like.  But you know, the watch is I happen to like chunky watches.  Well, first of all, I don't wear a watch anymore, but I used to wear a watch all the time and I always kind of like chunky watches.  And the watch is it's it's large. I would wear it. I would wear it.  Like it doesn't strike me as like, oh, that's a big nerd watch that's going to announce what a big nerd watch where I am.  It's not. It's actually quite I thought it was a lot more stylish than I than I expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks a little bit like a Casio calculator watch, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least it's smaller than the Sony, which was also out.  The Sony looks like a cereal box on your wrist. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty sleek, though. It's got the stainless steel and the little screws and like the screen when it's black is is nice looking.  I thought it was a little sleeker than, you know, your classic Casio.  There was another smartwatch announced today. Is it was a clock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? Yes. Qualcomm. Yes. That's on the rundown.  Boy, we're going crazy with this brand watches. Yeah. Everyone's trying to write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does the Qualcomm not use Android? What does it work with? It is Android.  I believe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All of these, you know, except what Apple does will be Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It makes sense. Android is the operating system of choice here.  Yeah. What's it called? Talk. The talk smartwatch. Am I pronouncing that T.O.Q. Tok Tok Tok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tic toc must be talk. I must. It's also three minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now it's a new version of it. So you've got three smartwatches out today.  So that makes a trend. We got an official trend going on. Yeah. No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. We officially have a here's a video from somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is from the verge of the watch.  So there's the camera, which is a wart on the band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is that camera thing. Yeah. It's a giant camera.  And it's one point. So how do you have to hold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to wear the watch on your right on your right wrist.  And then, yeah, you have to hold it up like this to take a picture. Right.  Now, I'm a lefty. I normally wear my watch on my left wrist. So yeah, that looks like some military salute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. If you if you flip the watch around and wear it on your left wrist, it's upside down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the screen reorient. Oh, it should reorient. Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would surprise me if it didn't. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you see the picture you're taking? I don't get it.  You see the picture you're taking on the watch. Right.  But you're going to be going to be down here. It's plastic or rubber band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have different colors. Nice screen. It's an OLED screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It doesn't look like it's changed because the stuff is embedded in the band.  It's changeable. No. Or you can just buy them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're looking at a video that shows every color. One guy wearing them all.  I think it's a really you think women will wear these. They look kind of kind of big.  Pretty big. They're big. They're pretty chunky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I happen to be thick-wristed, whatever that means.  I think someone with a small wrist that will look unusually large.  And I do think that there's a trend in chunky watches. That's that's pretty it is pretty break big.  I admit. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even on this guy, I don't know how big he is, but it looks huge.  It looks like something Borat would wear. Look at my American watch. It's from Korea.  I don't know. I think we're in such early days on this wearable stuff.  It just is really ungainly at this point. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the major consumer value? What does it do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do it do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it notifies you of text messages.  Obviously, you can take photos with it and immediately share back to your phone.  Those photos are share out to your friends. You can issue voice commands to it.  And actually, we didn't get to see as much as much demo on stage as I would have liked to have seen.  But you can issue voice commands. I think that it will even do things like translate signs.  So if you're traveling overseas and there was a sign, you could take a picture of the sign and it would translate for you with their translate app.  I believe that there is an accelerometer or pedometer.  So which is something I was interested in to some of the health aspects of it.  Seventy apps is a lot. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to have a lot of apps, you know, social apps, those apps resident on the watch or on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Communicate on the watch, right? You don't have to have the phone or do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, for a lot of communications, I think you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you do. The watch has to be paired to the phone in order to do things, especially like you don't have any Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can use the watch without that. Right.  I mean, you don't know. You just don't have any Internet access. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You wouldn't have Internet access, but the watch still works.  So that's what I would probably tell you at the time. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I should be able to take a picture still and stuff like that. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. So it must if you take a picture without Internet connectivity or without the being paired to your phone, I guess it just stores the picture there and syncs back when you do pair to your phone again. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it have, you know, it's got a pedometer in it?  Seems so trivial, but it's got a it's a health watch.  It measures your steps, right? Yeah, I can measure your steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's all I saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how rushed by just about anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This isn't doing it for me. It's not getting me out the door. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think you have to have a Samsung phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's a very good point. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, if it worked with my HTC One and it was maybe a hundred bucks less, I would might consider it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, somebody's pointing out the GS4 does all of that.  This is what puzzles me about these watches. Your phone already does most of everything. Right.  Yeah. GS4 has a pedometer and all that stuff.  It's it's wearable in the sense that it's in your pocket.  If you're a guy, it can be right in your shirt pocket, which is pretty handy.  It's right there. If you've got a Moto X, you can even talk to it. Hello.  But I don't know if I want to wear glasses. I don't know if I want to wear a wrist.  I understand. I love wearable computing. I love the idea of making it more accessible.  But I don't know if we figured out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think your name hurts. Hey, surprise. You got a new email. No, s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And you can't respond to the email. You can't do anything.  Does this have can I use s voice with this? Yes, you can.  So I can dictate to my hand. You could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you could. You look silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK, Google now. Tell Jeff I'm not buying it either.  I guess. Can you can you make a phone call that way?  No. Are we going to see a lot of morons walking down the street talking to their wrists like Dick Tracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to be the Secret Service. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I just it feels like such a it feels like there's all these companies are doing this because they heard Apple was doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it does feel that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they want to just quickly get in the market with whatever piece of crap they can because they know once Apple does it, if Apple lives up to the hype, nobody will want theirs anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would so love it if Apple came out the next week and said, we punk you all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's stupid? I you know, I know everybody's going crazy about this is for sure true.  All of our, you know, smart Apple people like Renee Richie and I more say, oh, no, it's definitely true.  They've hired J Blahnik. They've done all these things.  But, you know, we said the same thing about a TV set three years ago.  I still wait to see that. Yeah, that's true.  I don't know. And also the date to me and I get a lot of heat for saying this, but the days when you could count on Apple to come up with something that was going to change the world are gone.  They're just another company.  Yeah, you know, if they ever were.  But I think with under Steve, they they they managed to do it a few times.  An iPod, an iPhone, an iPad. Those change the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I just don't think that the iPod or the iPhone moment comes up that doesn't come up every year.  It doesn't even come up every other year.  I mean, I think that those things take a long take a long time.  I feel like with any every sort of new category of of of device, whether it's glasses or or or watch, it feels like everyone's like, oh, this is going to be the thing that everybody has that changes the world.  And these are incremental add ons. Right.  These are these are add ons to the to the to the smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a believer in the idea of wearable being a big thing.  Yes. But I think we're reasons.  Well, it's a long way off, too.  I think, you know, we're in the fabric of the clothing or I don't know.  I just I don't know what the form factor is that makes sense at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is the thing that your watch would have to do that would convince you I need to have this in my life?  Like, I'll start wearing watches again if the smartwatch did.  I just I actually wear watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wear expensive jewelry style watches sometimes, not all the time.  I wear inexpensive jewelry watches, but I wear them as jewelry.  I don't know why wear them actually at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to know what time it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually want. Well, you're a professor.  You need to be a class on time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm the absent minded professor. I don't know where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I work in a business where it doesn't matter when I show up.  Actually, it's not true, but I've made it to be true, which is not bad.  I just don't I don't I like watches.  I think watches are very cool retro technology.  I just think it's hard to imagine how you can turn this into a useful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, even during the presentation, the photographs of like, you know,  good looking people sort of gazing down at their watch and touching the little tiny screen was just it was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  speaking of presentation in the panoply of amazing Samsung embarrassing presentations, how did this one rate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was no I didn't watch it. There was no Broadway.  There was no Rockets. Yeah, there was no Broadway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was no excessive showmanship. They had a host who was very lively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That English guy with the white glasses, they use him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. And he was he was pretty good. Jason Bradbury. He was pretty good.  He was a little high energy. I was a little bit like, whoa, I found the pacing of what's wrong with high energy.  You know, like, I mean, it's really well, you know, it started out and I just worried that it was going to be another Broadway type of thing.  And then he intimated it was going to be an interview style thing.  So I was like, oh, this is an objective journalist and he's going to ask the tough questions.  That was clearly a rehearsed deal. Yeah. The pacing of the event was really he's like he's not a Samsung employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He works for a gadget show in the UK's on the on the TV. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's kind of one of us. Right. I mean, he well, no, don't please don't lump us in that category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's a presenter. I don't think he's a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You look good in white glasses. What is the new amazing thing you've done?  I am so excited to be able to reveal a new wristwatch.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, maybe I'm just used to the Apple presentations, but, you know, there's a there's a pacing to it and a cadence and there's a lead up.  Right. So you start out with, hey, we've got this many developers here this year.  This is how many we had last year tickets sold out in this amount of time in the past couple of years.  Here's the line chart that goes from the bottom up to the up and to the right of what's been happening.  And we've been you know, we found out this there's a lot of lead up.  There's a little background, a lot of lead up.  And then there's like the big reveal and you're ready for it. And it's exciting.  This this presentation was a little bit like, oh, yeah, here's this new phone.  It's kind of, you know, the note three and it's kind of an iteration on the other thing and, you know, whatever.  OK. Oh, and look, I just got a notification on my watch.  Like it just came very quickly and it just and then they were like, OK, well, let's go back to the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're like, wait, notification that I can want is an emergency notification.  Right. The ability for my wife to say, damn it, call me now.  I want that. Right. Yes. That's functionality doesn't exist.  Right. It could just as easily be her saying they come in home for dinner.  Right. So notifications have to there has to be a new notification layer that and this is the important thing.  It must be recipient control.  Yeah, it's like you've got to allow really good filters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Yeah. Well, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a little moment of a fun killer.  Nostalgia here for you, young Gina.  In the old, old days, we tried to call somebody and the phone was busy and there was no such thing as call waiting.  And it was really an emergency.  What she did to give people a heart attack was you called the operator and said, this is an emergency.  You need to break in. Have you ever done that? The operator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I need to interrupt this call.  I have an emergency call for you. Imagine the heart attack.  It's terrifying. That's yeah. And that's how you used to do it.  Call waiting is horrendous, too. I think we've gone beyond the call waiting.  The call waiting is of the era of the answering machine on the kitchen counter.  I mean, these things are rapidly being eclipsed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My mom has this whole rant about phones.  Whenever I talked to my mom on the cell phone, the call drops or the delay or a horrible experience.  And she just goes to this thing where she's like, remember the black phone?  It used to work.  Oh, curly cord.  You picked it up and there was a dial tone.  It was crystal clear like Jennifer's like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She wanted she for she always wanted a kitchen phone with a long cord.  You never lose it. You never get ever falls under the cushions.  The power goes out. It's still work.  And it's fun. If you're talking to a boy you really like, you can wrap yourself around in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so much fun.  I really do miss phone calls.  A bye bye birdie. It's Ann Margaret.  You're not hearing traffic.  You can actually hear the person.  That is something in the past that I actually do feel nostalgic for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually have a number of phones because my main phone, my AT&T phone is not usable in my house.  I don't have a landline.  So every day and I accidentally pick it up every once in a while and people go, what?  What? Hello? You're breaking speak into the phone.  I'm speaking into the phone.  And it's so frustrating.  And then but the T-Mobile will work in my house.  So I just have to pick up the right phone.  It's gotten worse. It's not better.  I thought not having a landline would simplify my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't feel like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't feel like it.  But this is modern times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the notification that the CEO of Samsung got during the presentation was don't forget to talk about Android.  Which I thought was interesting. They made a point to talk about Android and how it was 4.3.  Which is something that they really didn't talk about the last Unpacked event.  Right. I mean, that was one of the things that a lot of a few journalists noted was that Android,  they hadn't even said the word Android.  I think it was like once the whole presentation.  So that was interesting because Samsung might just be cooking up their own OS and their own app store for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a little break to hearken back to the days when teenagers, teenage girls in particular,  would spend all their time on the telephone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now I'm alive, fulfilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now you try to call a teenager, they will not answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the funniest thing. My kids, when they were teenagers, it was all I am. Right?  And now it's not I am, it's text. All they do is text.  Let me see if I can skip ahead because I think that they end up...  Yeah, this is the various poses of teenagers.  She has a princess phone in her room. That meant she was pretty fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is not my childhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on, Gina. This reminds me of you. That's you right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My parents actually got my sister her own landline when she was a teenager in the 80s and was always on the phone.  And then I inherited it. That was a big deal that I had my own landline.  I had my own number. It was very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Diverse... Pardon me for this, Gina, but diversity is considered if you're Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Bye-bye, Bertie. You did not exactly feature people of color.  Just people a little swarthier than you and me.  You know, it's so amazing, Jeff. You and I live in a world that has changed that much in our lifetime.  Yes.  And it's changing really fast. I mean, it's just incredible.  Now we have phones of color instead of people of color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, we still have people of color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're gender neutral.  So Android 4.3. It's interesting. They really are doing that.  Samsung is upgrading their phones because they want to support it because they want to support the watch.  Their new stuff all is 4.3. And then Google says, owned by the way, it's now 4.4. Kit Kat!  Finally we can talk about that so I'm hungry.  I know, I know. You guys, you both brought candy. I didn't bring candy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had a whole bunch of it in the office there yesterday. Everybody eat it?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Jason dumped a whole, like, a pound bag of Kit Kat on the floor.  Where's my Kit Kat?  It's during all that Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want back sheesh.  Do any of you, you don't have any of the specially marked Kit Kat bars, do you?  No.  Oh, look. We got little Kit Kat's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go. Wow. I'm impressed that those lasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Larry Page on his Google Plus posted a picture of a giant Android made out of Kit Kats.  Sundar, I think that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was that Sundar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it was Sundar.  No, Larry Page got one too. I saw his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, he did. Okay, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was supposed to be KeyLinePie, wasn't it?  Yeah, KeyLinePie.  So, is it Hershey that went and made a deal with Google or?  All the way around.  Google went to Hershey and said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually Nestle, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Nestle owns it. It's licensed in the US by Reese's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's licensed in the US to Hershey.  So now, no money, change hands. I mean, the company...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just a lot of chocolate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just a lot of chocolate. Well, I'm sure a lot of lawyers and accountants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that we, from a journalistic point of view, I need a point of order, Mr. Journalism Professor.  From now on, I think we can't call it Kit Kat. We have to call it Android 4.4.  I'm not going to give an ad to the Hershey company, the Nestle company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the issue. Is it Citi Field or what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.  Yeah.  It's delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina still needs it as a prop for other shows. Oh, no, she opened it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm good. All that Android happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't open it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It bothers me that they've done an obviously completely gratuitous promotional name.  You might as well call it Android Citi Field Android 4.4.  I mean, you might as well say AT&T Android 4.4. It bugs the hell out of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think there are a lot of good reasons for them to do what they did.  And this obviously, this wasn't about money, right?  They didn't get money from Hershey or Nestle to use the name.  You know what?  They got everybody to talk about it.  They didn't get cash.  They didn't get cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got value, including promotional value.  They got in-kind.  It's very disingenuous to say, oh, no money traded hands.  That's disingenuous.  This was a business deal.  This was biz dev 100 percent.  This is cross promotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is cross promotion for sure.  But I think it's funny.  I mean, I wonder, the first thing I wondered was who paid who in this.  I don't find it funny.  I find it annoying.  But I guess I'm getting like you, Jeff Cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there are a couple of good reasons to do this, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And actually Saleh Ismail, who develops Carbon for us,  develops Carbon for Android, he made a really good point,  which is that KitKat is a globally recognized brand.  That's a word that is the same no matter what language you're speaking.  Keelion pie and jelly bean and ice cream sandwich are not those things.  Right? Everyone has a good feeling.  Everyone knows what KitKat is.  So I think it kind of goes in line with Google's sort of wanting to globalize Android.  I mean, that was a big push at I.O. this past year.  They want developers to...  You're trying hard, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo's not buying it.  And let's not forget that Nestle is tarnished by this selling formula in the third world.  This is not a brand name that you necessarily want to associate with.  I don't understand.  This seems pure greed on Google's part.  I don't find it amusing in the least.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why not call it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it bugs the hell out of me.  You can find a global...  First of all, it's just a code name.  But now it's more than a code name.  Now every time we talk about it, we advertise a candy bar.  I don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So did you disapprove of ET trying for M&Ms and ending up with the previous pieces when maybe they shouldn't have just said jelly beans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do admit that when I see a TV show where there's obvious product placement, gratuitous product placement, it bugs me.  In fact, I don't usually watch music videos, but I've seen a few of late.  And all of a sudden, music videos are full of product placement.  There's that little boom box that somebody makes beats probably is in all the videos they do like close up of boom box.  Okay, move on.  Obviously, these are ads.  And what's happening is it's very obvious advertising is not working for these companies, right?  Right.  They need product placement.  They need ways to sneak advertising into content.  And to me, this is Google giving Nestle and they're not giving it away.  I promise you whatever they may be saying, a big promotional push.  And for the next year, we're going to be saying Kit Kat a lot.  And what do you think is going to happen to sales of Kit Kat bars?  Will it affect them?  Oh, no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot.  A little bit.  A lot.  Developers eat a lot of candy bars.  Leo, isn't it time for you to have a sip of that delicious Snapple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not against advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're ad supported.  I'm against stealth advertising.  I'm against sneaky advertising.  I'm against, oh, we didn't get any money for this.  It's just good, clean fun.  Kit Kat bar.  That's not what it is.  It's advertising.  And I think it's repulsive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Nestle didn't go to Google and ask for this, right?  Google went to Nestle.  What does that matter?  Because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went to Ford to get them to advertise in this network.  That's how advertising works.  I bet you they went to other K companies.  Do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, shouldn't it have been Krispy Kreme?  Could have been Krispy Kreme.  It should have been Android 4.4 Krispy Kreme.  I feel like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you made a good point, Leo.  And mostly because now we are going to be carrying water for this.  We will be advertising Kit Kats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but you're right.  You can say Android 4.4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should say 4.4, and I plan to say 4.4.  This is a...  And as a programmer, I think it should offend you, Gina,  because programmers come up with code names.  They're fun.  They're mountain ranges.  They're lakes.  They're whatever.  They're surf spots in California.  Whatever.  It's fun, and it's great.  As soon as it's advertising...  Even that is commercialized.  Well, maybe, but to me that's not commercialized.  This is really about selling candy bars.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even now a code name, a simple code name...  Yes, exactly.  I just feel like that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think we're just going to see a lot more of it.  In fact...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I now need...  After all that chocolate, I need a cig of my Poland Springs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not against product placement.  I don't like it in movies and TVs where there's gratuitous product placement.  If somebody came to us with a product placement deal,  we actually were hoping to sell the name of this studio.  I would have to say every time I talked about it,  the Norton Ghost Studio or whatever,  I just...  Okay.  This is a code name for a software product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got a hell of a lot more personality than Donut or Eclair.  Well, so does Donut.  Sure, Donut does.  Eclair does.  I don't know.  KitKat's a really strong brand.  It's a brand that people feel good about.  They're trying to add personality and flair.  If you compare KeyLinePie to KitKat, I'd take KitKat any day.  Okay.  I don't know.  No, but I want you to convince me on why I should be offended.  Because this typically is a thing I'd be offended by,  but I thought to myself this was a brilliant marketing move on Google's part.  I am not denying it's a brilliant marketing move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's disingenuous of Google to make a point of,  oh, no money, change hands, because that's BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but they've got a partnership page up where you can win...  I don't know, you can win a next step with a KitKat.  They're not saying that they have nothing to do with Hershey.  No, Nestle.  I mean, clearly it's a partnership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're getting a lot of free ads.  In fact, I thought I read somewhere that sales of KitKat has skyrocketed.  KitKat has skyrocketed already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't have to read it somewhere.  You could write that story.  You assumed that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I just don't want to...  I just feel like, come on, you really...  Do you need money that bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But how is Google...  Where is Google getting money in this deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Gina, please do not be naive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's number one if they're promotion on the candy bars.  So you think that Google's getting the cut of KitKat sales at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All we know, Google...  Oh, no, they didn't give us any money,  but we're going to get 10% of every KitKat bar from now until eternity or whatever.  Of course, Google is getting something.  There's a lot of in kind.  If you have Win Google Play Store on a KitKat bar,  you think they just said, oh, we'll do that.  That has a value.  I'll tell you what.  We'll do that for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What the hell?  Right.  I mean, my biggest beef is that KitKats are just not good for you.  It should have been kale.  Yes.  Kale?  But that wouldn't have happened if they had any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Candy kale, candy kale at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That wouldn't have been not nearly as fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody gets what I'm saying here.  I'm completely...  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I get it.  I think a lot of people get it.  I've heard a lot of that on Twitter yesterday when they announced it.  I heard a lot of people saying they felt creeped out.  Google is an advertising company.  This is proof they sold out.  It cheapens the Android brand.  You know, I just thought this is brilliant.  On a day when there were so many big news stories yesterday,  the fact that everyone was talking about...  They got a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It worked.  That's what they got on it, Petita.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But marketing works.  They got free marketing.  And they're getting it right now.  And they're going to get more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everybody has an opinion about KitKats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, nobody hates KitKats.  And I think if you're KitKat...  I like other candy better.  I think of...  You know, the example that we always use,  there was a...  Well, basically it was Grandma Candy.  I'm not going to say the name,  because as soon as I say the name, you'll go, oh, yeah.  But there was a candy that basically was completely known  as a candy that grandmas would give you.  You know, a little candy dish.  You'd come over and you'd go, oh, I don't want that.  And then MTV launched.  And MTV said they went...  They literally went to this candy company and said,  we can make your candy hip.  We can take your grandma candy and make it hip.  And they launched with MTV.  And Mentos, the fresh maker, became a hip, cool brand  all of a sudden because of the relationship.  It was a great relationship.  And you better believe those folks at Nestle  know exactly what Mentos did with MTV.  This is the modern version of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  KitKat 4.4.  This is on the website at KitKat.com.  Under its sleek interior,  we've ensured maximum breakability in KitKat 4.4.  They've got a whole tech specs on KitKat 4.4.  Confectionary perfectionary.  Yeah, this was...  You can't tell me that the biz dev team,  hundreds of marketers...  Oh, the agency calls for this.  The agencies...  Oh.  There's a lot went into this.  And it's completely disingenuous for me to think  Google is not getting anything for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what, Leo?  I'd feel a lot better about it  if this were kind of a rogue thing  that a couple of candy crazy eat kids did.  That's fine.  That'd be fine.  We love KitKats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this has been in the works for months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you're pulling me over to your side, Leo.  You're killing me.  When is it Mentos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  KitKat, Elle, what can we do for Elle?  M, Mentos is in two iterations of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it'll be a fight, Mentos versus Eminem.  Eminem's lost out on ET.  They learned their lesson.  They learned their lesson.  E-T eats Reese's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, Reese's is the company that owns

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the license to KitKat in the United States.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So we know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lesson learned.  They'll rush it up to R.  Lesson learned.  Well, you could even argue that 4.4 doesn't deserve a code name.  Well, did they say, by the way, in all of this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  did they say what 4.4 does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one talked about that or cared about that.  No, they didn't give it actually.  No, no, no, it was just a statue.  It was just a statue.  Well, there was the KitKat statue on the lawn of Google, right?  And there was the guy with the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, let's talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they didn't talk about features at all of 4.4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So 95Google, Mark Gurman, who is really good.  He just knocks it out of the park time and time again.  Notice a little something in the video Google posted  and has since pulled down of the KitKat video.  There's a guy.  You know, there's the usual Google employees taking pictures  of putting the new Android statue out.  The woman on the right, she's using a Nexus phone.  That's obvious.  But wait a minute, what's that Nexus phone on the left?  It even looks staged.  The guy doesn't even look like he's taking a picture.  Actually, yeah.  Basically, they said, okay, see, take this and hold it.  And don't move until the camera's off of you.  Look at him.  So what is that?  Is it the next Nexus, Nexus 5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's a Nexus that no one's seen before, right?  It's got a much bigger camera that are on the current Nexuses.  There's a little pixelation or they deleted the N.  The N from Nexus.  It says Exus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it look like they blurred out maybe near his finger there  with any other sort of branding or writing on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it says LG, but I don't know.  I think that's what it looks like, the LG logo, doesn't it?  I'll have to get my Nexus 4 out and look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, that's a bigger camera sensor than we've seen.  So everyone said, oh, this must be the new Nexus.  It's about to come out.  And then Google pulled the video, which basically just confirmed suspicions  that it was something that people shouldn't have seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or it was a very clever manipulation itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  True, true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate to be cynical, but that kind of feels...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That you think that's what it was.  This week they cut the price of the Nexus 400 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and announced they're out of the 8G version.  They sold out immediately.  And they said, we're not going to restock these.  So it's very obvious to anybody who's paying attention.  Yeah, there must be a Nexus 5 coming.  I thought maybe the Moto X would be sufficient for that.  But I guess they have to have a Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you know what I'm doing? I'm torturing myself.  You still haven't opened it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy cow!  Jeff, I can do that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is crazy restraint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do I do it now? Do I get my fingernail ready or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So wait, wait, wait. What is stopping you?  What is stopping you?  Nexus 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, I would bet...  Well, I don't know. They say maybe October, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so to launch in time for the holiday season, right?  It's going to be October or November latest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think the Nexus phones are for holiday buying.  I said this about the Nexus 4 and I guess I was wrong.  I thought the Nexus 4 was...  This is a cheap phone for developers.  This is so that Google has a platform developers can buy inexpensively  and test their software on and they know it's pure Google.  That's to me what it feels like the Nexus line is about.  But it turns out, and this is where I was wrong,  fans, geeks love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a very good phone.  If it were LTE and if I hadn't gotten the 8 gigs,  that's all I could get when I was trying to rush an order while I was on the show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The geeks fell in love with the Nexus 4. I didn't predict that.  I was not a fan of the screen.  It's a little washed out compared to other screens available.  I just thought, oh, this is kind of a...  I had the same reaction that people are having the Moto X.  It's kind of a mid-range phone. Yeah, it's cheap.  But it doesn't wow me.  But I was wrong, obviously. It's been a huge success.  Now, we don't know how many they've sold.  No.  It could be that it's one-one-thousandth of the number of Galaxies sold.  It probably is. Yeah.  But people are very interested. I know.  Maybe it's our audience. We talk to all the people who know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a beloved brand among sort of power users and Google fans and Android fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is it, Jeff, you are looking for in a Nexus 5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the unknown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He doesn't know, but he wants it.  He wants the future and he wants it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to have a built-in bread maker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, you know, here it is right in front of me.  I don't know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, after... and you know I have all the phones.  Every one of them. Yes.  And I... what I don't have yet is an Xperia Z1,  which they just announced, the new Sony phone.  And I don't have the Optimus G2.  Neither of those are available as far as I know.  But I've played with the Galaxy Gear, I mean the Mega, the GS4 I own, HTC One I own.  And I ended up, oddly enough, this phone is oddly appealing, going with the Moto X.  You know, I had a review unit which I sent back.  They offered me a freebie and I said, no, I don't take freebies.  And I just... after, you know, I was kind of pining for it.  It's just there was something pure...  It is what you like about the Nexus 4, to me.  It's the pure Google experience.  With a few exceptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What appeals to me is that it's LTE, it's 32 gigs.  Yeah, I got the 32, yeah.  And, you know, I drive a lot out here on the way home.  So being able to do the voice activation in the car is good.  Talking to it is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not perfect, not perfect by the way.  It doesn't understand everything, you know.  All speech recognition is still early.  It wakes up perfectly.  It's very good at that.  I like the thing, and this was the thing that I thought was under reported  that was really cool, which is this trusted Bluetooth authentication.  When you're in your car, you don't have to unlock it.  It just says, oh, I'm in a safe area.  You get to choose those areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That presumes you have a modern car with Bluetooth.  Yeah.  You don't?  Oh, no. My car is 10 years old.  Yeah, I have some.  I had a loaner.  I was so amazed.  I was like, I got out of prison.  I had a loaner a month ago and I paired my phone with the car.  I couldn't believe everything I could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's magical.  Whenever I rent a car, I'm like, wow.  You don't either?  I've got this old used Toyota.  I'm not really a car person.  Lisa, we've got to pay these people more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe this.  I feel terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, hell, I'm even cheap enough not to show where I should open this.  Let alone a car.  Well, this isn't cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, this is not a cheap phone.  That's the other thing about it.  It's a sticking point.  It really is overpriced.  The rumor is they'll drop this $100 soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I nicked my Nexus 4, which killed me on the glass.  I don't know how I did it, but I got nicks on the glass.  I got some other stuff and it wasn't charging well.  That turned out to be something else.  Of course, I'm looking for justification to open up the phone.  I was thinking to myself, I could just buy another one of these for $200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If this broke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  I'll send you my Nexus 4 because I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's fine now.  It's actually fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Leo, the fact that you gave back your review unit and then was pining for it, how often does that happen?  Very rarely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because there's always the next thing.  I love the HTC One.  The HTC One is great.  Yeah.  But there was just, it's funny, it's small.  I like the Galaxy Note 2.  It's completely changing my feeling about a phone, but it's a very personal phone and I really like it.  And things that people mock like the wrist flip, I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How quirky does the product evaluations.  If they get tied up, they have a vote for the whole audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I still there?  You're frozen a little, but that's all right.  We hear you.  That's fine.  Somebody in the chat room says, if you love the phone so much, why don't you marry it, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's just I know that you try every single phone and so that seems like quite an endorsement, Leo.  But here's what I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A phone is a very, it's the most personal of all personal computers.  And there's no perfect phone.  Nothing is perfect.  There's nothing even close to perfect.  So you should really try, you, everybody should try as many as you can.  At least go to the store and play with them.  Because this is what I like.  Yeah.  It's not necessarily what you would love.  I think you're I think, for instance, you seem very happy with your HTC one Google edition.  And I think that's an excellent choice.  Yeah, it's a great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a great phone.  I do love it.  But I have to tell you, Jeff, if I was sitting there with that box right now, just hearing what Leo just said, I'd open that up.  I'd open that sucker up instantaneously.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should I do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should I do it?  I'm not going to say should do it.  No, I don't want to be responsible for it because it doesn't yell at me later.  Should I do it?  Let's see what is it?  You think Jeff should open this?  Do it for Johnny.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Blend it.  You have 30 days.  Yes.  Open it, Jeff.  Open it.  Open it.  Wait for it.  Do it.  Do it.  No, no.  There are few people say don't open it.  Send it back.  I don't think it's a consensus.  How much did you pay for it, Jeff?  Six hundred seventy four dollars.  Yeah, really it's kind of outrageously expensive.  Very expensive.  Especially since the Nexus 4, which is really in many respects a similar phone, is half that.  Yes.  The Nexus 4 though, screen isn't as good.  It's bigger and heavier and has a glass back.  I like, there's something about the size of this.  Motorola said this, you know, we really paid attention to the size.  We want it to be just so.  And then, you know, I have to say it just does fit just right.  And the feeling on the back, there's something about it.  But this is me.  This is my hand.  Your hand, it may not fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chat room is saying no.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it covered in LSD?  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Straw poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could do a straw poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd say it's going negative in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody set up a straw poll.  We could do a straw poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say, before Quirky does this, they have a polling mechanism.  That'd be fun to do with the chat room.  We can do that.  I'll set up a straw poll real quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have the technology thanks to Dan Dirks, who wrote a very good little tool called a straw poll.  So what is the question we should ask, Jeff?  Should Jeff open the Moto X?  Jeff open and use, right?  I think once it's open, I can't return it.  Oh, of course you can return it.  You can?  Yeah.  Let's say right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you remember the Larry the Lobster moment on Saturday Night Live?  Larry the Lobster.  It was one of the best Saturday Night Live spiel where the audience voted live whether or not to kill Larry the Lobster.  Yeah.  Dunk him.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'll give somebody...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you're going to mess up the voting results.  Well, I guess we add them then.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, so what's at stake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't think you can return it once you open it?  It says unopened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can return 14 days unopened.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The straw poll number, everybody, is 390329.  So if you're watching live, go to strawpoll.me slash 390329 and cast your vote.  Now, the nice thing about this is we can actually watch the results in real time as they come flying in.  And so far, I mean, 28, 29, 32 votes.  I think yes is pretty strong majority here.  That's the yellow...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you got one yes and you got three nos.  You got to add up the three nos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Wow, look at that.  But I think all you have to do is say what is the yes, and right now it's 54%.  So actually, it is kind of close.  You're right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is kind of close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chat room, get a life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, don't get a life.  Please, I beg of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eat more Kit Kat bars.  I never see this straw poll move so fast.  This is amazing.  I love you, chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't they great?  Right.  But anyway, this is carefully done so that you can only vote once.  Each of these is a unique vote.  Each is a completely unique vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's been solidly yes this entire time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's 55%.  Yes is pretty strong.  Now, I don't even know if Jeff should get an LTE Nexus 7 as a no.  I don't know what that is.  Non-sequiturs, what that is.  That's just you baiting me.  Wow, 400 votes.  But if you had an LTE Nexus 7, you know you could use that as a phone.  Because you could put Skype on there or Tango or some other.  I'm eager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who has it now?  Who?  Italy.  Gosh darn it.  You want me to pick you one up in Venice next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll pick one up in Venice next week.  Just for you.  Excuse me.  Where can I get a Nexus 7?  I want to get the one with the LTE.  What, is that next week already?  No, two weeks.  I fly out on the 17th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go find yourself some good pasta, some good mozzarella,  and don't forget about the phones when you're in Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I had to get the Moto now because I was really soul-searching.  What do I want to carry with me as I travel six countries in three weeks?  And this really, even though the camera is not as good as either the Galaxy S4 or the HTC One,  and it's not unlocked, I'll probably bring an unlocked Galaxy S4 just so I have a SIM card phone.  But just the size of this and the weight and the friend, it feels friendly.  It's a friendly little phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So by the end of the show, we'll go back to it and then I'll use the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we got 500 votes already.  Wow, 500 votes.  The power of video.  I don't think at this point it's going to change, but we'll...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's up to 57%.  It's slowing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think everybody wants to vote to vote.  All right, should I do it now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I'll tell you what, no, let's keep it going.  We're going to keep the poll going.  I mentioned a couple more times.  At the end of the show, whatever, and we have 45 minutes left to vote.  At the end of the show, whatever you decide, that's what Jeff will do.  Jeff, thank you for putting your fate in the hands of the chat room, you nitwit.  What color? Did you get black or white?  Blue, royal blue with silver accents.  You went to Moto Maker and did the whole thing.  Oh yeah, I did.  I got crimson red, and I even... I suckered.  I fell for the headphones, the crimson red headphones that match it.  Wow.  I suckered.  Those are actually decent headphones. They're not bad.  They're only 30 bucks or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have very strange ears. No headphones work on me.  Ear buds don't work on me.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I...  You have a tiny hole? Is that what both of you...  No Bluetooth and tiny holes? Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They fall out of my ears.  Unless I have the clip for here, they always seem to fall out.  If it's just been walking around, I'm always having the...  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got the... I get the flanged ones.  You know what I'm talking about?  These things never fall out.  They have little wings?  No. Well, these are from Edimotic, but other companies will make these.  And so, each of these flaps goes deeper in your ear.  By the time you get it there, you're gagging.  But it will never fall out.  And these are Edimotic. This is what I recommend, by the way.  Edimotic.  E-T-Y-M-O-T-I-C-S. They're expensive.  But they're audiophile quality.  And I wear these on the airplane because they seal your ear.  So, instead of noise-canceling headphones, I don't hear the stewardess.  I don't hear announcements.  The plane could be on fire behind me and I'd just be listening to my music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's impressive. I've never been able to find...  I've been through a couple of sets of noise-canceling big cans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they make them with a microphone as well, if you want to use it for your headphones.  So, this is what I will take to Europe also.  Let's take a break. The poll continues.  Strawpoll.me slash 390329.  The votes are pouring in.  You control Jeff Jarvis.  He is a puppet.  You're pulling his strings right now.  I should have put something about making immediate kick-ass.  It's like the dancing chicken.  Yeah. Make him dance, chicken dance.  What should Jeff do?  Open the phone or not open?  Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com.  If you are making a website, you need to know about Squarespace.com.  It is a fabulous place to go to get your first site off and running or to create a new site.  Maybe you just got a great idea for selling Android-shaped KitKat bars online.  But you got to have web hosting, right?

All of these, by the way, are mobile responsive.  That means they will work on any size screen.  I'm going to pick Aviator here.  And by the way, you can look at other customers using Aviator and you'll see what I mean.  Every site looks different.  Aviator is a gorgeous site for somebody who wants to do a photo blog or a gallery where you really want the imagery to stand out.  See, it's full bleed, goes edge to edge, looks gorgeous.  Here, let's look at this one.  Sir, it's got a mustache.  I don't know what this is.  Is this a guy selling mustaches?  I don't know.  Oh, it's a film site.  This is what artists love Squarespace because they get to look the way they want to look.  Look at how it's embedded.  The video is embedded right into the Squarespace site.

Squarespace.com.  Really, this is the place you've got to go.  All right.  I don't think the straw poll uses Squarespace, but we haven't brought it down yet.  676 votes total.  They're coming in.  We don't know yet.  I'm not going to call it.  It's too close to call.  But I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That yes percentage is creeping upward, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all about Florida at this point.  Florida, Florida, Florida.  We've just got to wait and see what Florida does.  We're going to wait for the Chads.  Oh, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Chad.  We've got Chads hanging.  Yeah, he's hanging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't miss him because he's got the red hair.  I love it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what else we've got to talk about here.  I got completely distracted by Kit Kats.  We've got the trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trumpets.  Trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, let's do it.  I don't know how to play trumpets without Chad.  I don't have that capability.  No, I'm sure I do.  They didn't tell me how.  So I'll tell you what.  Just imagine that you hear trumpets because it's time for the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do do do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was terrible.  Pathetic.  It was pathetic.  Pathetic.  Only a couple of things in the changelog today.  Google releases and then pulls their new Authenticator app off-grid to version 2.0 for iOS.  This is a new release of the Authenticator app.  This is the app that lets you do two-factor off, not just on Google, but on LastPass and now GitHub.  Users found that when they updated the app that it would delete connections to different services that they were using and all their data.  Google says that it has pulled it almost immediately a few hours in and says that they are working on an update, on a fixed the update.  So if you if you download the update, don't run it until the new the fix comes out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, if you use Google Authenticator, you really should be backing up your see what I do.  So Authenticator will read a QR code, which is the easiest way to get that secret number into the Authenticator.  That's what you have to do to get it set up.  So when you get a QR code, what I do is I save the image into LastPass so it's secure.  I mean, I'm not saving it on a piece of paper, putting it next to my computer.  I put it in LastPass, which is locked up in the in the secure notes.  So I have all my QR code.  So I don't care.  And one of the other reasons you want to do this is when you set up another phone or another device, let's say Jeff gets his next to seven.  He wants to put Authenticator on it and he could take pictures of the QR codes and set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If only I could use it on my next to seven.  If only I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I let Authenticator like I switched phones at one point and didn't set up Authenticator again.  And now I just say like text me a new verification code to my phone number.  And I've been meaning to just get it set up again and have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I do it all the time.  That's the first thing I do when I set up a new Android phone is I download Authenticator and I go back to my LastPass and I take pictures of all the QR codes.  I have Google, I have LastPass is in here.  Outlook for Microsoft is in here.  Evernote is in here.  So that's how I authenticate.  And I don't know.  I like having it on.  I have it on all my devices.  The same, you know, and it works.  And that's the nice thing.  If you save that QR code or regenerate it and save it, you've got it forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're taking a screenshot and then adding that attaching that to a LastPass entry.  Is that how you're saving the QR code?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you can take a picture of it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  You bring it up in LastPass.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  LastPass will bring up its own as part of its LastPass settings because LastPass uses Google Authenticator also.  Google Authenticator is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if Google Authenticator is down, then you can't use LastPass?  It's not down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The update, all the update did, I can, you know how this happens with programmers.  It just wiped the data.  So we're going to start over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was like that office space moment.  I was like, I must have messed up a zero somewhere.  I always do that.  I always do that.  We just wiped the cash.  Oh, they might have wanted that.  Oh, right.  It was some flag that wiped the cash.  But why would they want that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if anybody, well, you know what it is, is probably the guy who wrote it does what I do and thought, well, that's fine.  And just set it up again.  And then you realize most people do not save.  I didn't even know you could.  Somebody told me, oh, no, you just save those QR codes.  Use it again.  It's just a secret number.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a big deal.  That's really smart.  I'm definitely going to do that.  I'm going to get it.  Put it in LastPass.  Google is testing a new tablet search interface, which is similar to the mobile search interface that was very Google Now card like.  And yeah, that just about kind of explains it.  It's sort of like the Knowledge Graph cards on the right side, but all the search results look like that.  And I believe that this is one of their kind of A-B tests where they're experiments where they're rolling out to some people and not others to see how users react to it.  And similarly, there's a new sign in page for mobile devices on Google.com.  If you go to sign into Google now, it used to just be kind of a pretty pretty plain just sign in email password.  Now there's a new page that's been redesigned.  It says one password, all of Google.  And kind of annoyingly, they state they took away the stay signed in checkbox, which I don't don't understand.  But luckily, I mean, of course, if you're on Android, you kind of have to sign in once to to your Android account.  You want to count on this page very, very often.  But that's it. Pretty thin changelog this week.  It must, I think, with the holiday weekend, things were maybe a little slow at the flex.  And that's the changelog.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Whoa, whoa, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have the video. We just have the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I tell you something I am lusting after.  Yes.  Is the Sony QX10 or QX100. Have you seen that?  No.  What is the lens camera that attaches to your phone?  You want that? You really want that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to carry that around in your pocket?  Well, I carry around a camera now.  I guess it's not much, but I don't know what just carry around a camera and two lenses.  Right. So instead, you'll carry this to your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's either brilliant or stupid. It's one or the other.  I grant that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does seem on the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's on the stupid line.  Remember Eric Schmidt's creepy line?  This is the stupid line.  It can be one side is genius, the other side it's ridiculous.  It'll be pineapple pizza. Remember that?  Remember that pineapple pizza?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I decided to carry an actual camera with me and a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I do too, but it's a lot.  It is a lot.  And you just click it on and your phone is the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I really struggle is I've got a DSLR with a big old lens.  I don't know much about photography, but I do have a nice lens.  And when I want to take pictures of the baby, like nice pictures of the baby,  like her monthly, I do a picture.  We do a portrait every month.  I break out the DSLR, but I never take that outside the house.  I just, I don't have it in.  It's too big. It's too heavy.  It's too big. And I've got a camera in my pocket.  Right. So there's part of me that's like, I might want to try this.  I'd be interested to see what kind of pictures this makes,  but it's still a big chunky.  I mean, if I'm going to carry this thing,  that I might as well just carry the whole camera.  Well, and there's a couple of things I'd bring up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First of all, you're still using the crappy camera phone sensor.  Right.  You haven't upgraded the sensor.  I guess it's no...  No. What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the sensor's in that thing.  Oh, you're right. It has its own sensor.  Oh yeah, this is not an add-on.  So the whole thing is a camera.  What do you need the phone for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an add-on. It's a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it stores the photos onto the phone.  Yeah, it has its own slot for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All that happens is you're using your phone's screen as the viewfinder.  And what phone do you have to use?  Any Android or iOS.  Really? Oh, it's wireless.  You just hook it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's wireless.  And it uses, what do you call it?  NFC. It actually uses Wi-Fi or NFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So does the file stay on that lens thing, or does it go onto the phone?  Yeah, it stays on the lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It stays on the lens, but it obviously goes right over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't, okay, so I admit, I looked at this and went,  I thought it was just a clip-on that you put over your camera.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's a camera all by itself.  You don't really need the phone. You could just go like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to use the phone. You can do that, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay. That does change things a little.  It's just a funny form factor for a phone.  Again, the file stays on that lens thing.  Yeah, it has an SD card slot.  Okay. So you do have to transfer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think you could, well, the Wi-Fi, Gina, you can move it over to your phone,  or maybe it also goes in your phone right away.  It needs to have the storage on the lens thing,  because if the phone doesn't have sufficient storage.  You know what? I could see buying this.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the $250 QX10 has an 18-megapixel sensor, an Exmor sensor in it.  Not the best lens. It's an F3.3 to 5.9.  They don't say what the length of the lens is, which is odd.  It's a zoom lens. I guess it has 10x zoom.  It has 10x zoom.  It's a 10x optical zoom. Not physical.  Right. Oh, really? Oh, that's, it looks like it's physical.  Really, it's optical? Okay, that sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so. Both. I think so.  That sucks.  The lens on the other one is much better. It's 300.  This is an ice lens. It says there...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's $500. QX100. It has a 20.2-megapixel Exmor sensor.  And F1.8, which is nice, to F4.9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, what are you going to travel with in terms of cameras?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A ridiculous amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My 5D, of course, my Mark II.  That's the good camera with all the lenses.  Okay, that's about 150 pounds.  And then I'll also bring...  I bought a smaller camera about six months ago  and was trying it and working out with it, the Olympus OM-D.  It's a nice compact micro four-thirds camera.  I have a few lenses for that.  Lisa and I have matching cameras so we can share one set of lenses on that.  That sounds good.  And then I'm going to bring a little...  I bought...  Olympus makes a little waterproof, shockproof point-and-shoot.  And I'll have that for sand and surf and sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. And two phones.  And two phones.  Two phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, yeah, I'll bring a MacBook Air.  And I'll bring...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I sort of want to come...  I'll take a picture.  ...meet you in Italy for a day  because I would just like to know what a day trip on vacation with Leo is like.  I can't leave it all in the hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll bring just the stuff.  You know, I've booked...  There's a website called toursbylocals.com  that you can meet somebody and get a tour from them.  And the woman we booked a tour in Venice is a wedding photographer,  professional photographer in Venice.  She's Finnish, but she speaks Italian and English.  She's lived in Venice for 20 years.  And she's going to take us around for four hours on a photo walk.  Of course, you being you, you could have done that with a chat room probably.  You know, I didn't even think of it.  I, you know, I should...  Anybody who lives in Venice, come say hi.  We'll be at the Hotel Luna Bajoni.  And so that'll be for three days.  Oh, nobody comes to see me.  Anyway, it's going to be a lot of fun.  But I did want to have...  So each camera has a purpose.  And I am going to use my camera phone probably more than any of them.  Right, because it'll be...  Because it's in my pocket.  It's always here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I'll take it out to dinner or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is one issue with the Moto X.  What I've seen in the pictures is it's greenish.  Not terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mediocre, though.  If there's good light, it's not bad.  But there has to be a lot of light.  It also does a lot of lens flaring.  So you have to really protect it against the bright light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, you didn't like the little clip thing that I bought it on Kickstarter.  I bought two of them.  The thing you mentioned I had all on Android last night.  What are they, blinders?  You put it in the audio jack.  In the stereo jack?  Oh, you bought that, huh?  I bought it.  And then it becomes another button.  So you could use that as an instant button to take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the other button.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  So you programmed it to be a shutter.  So you just pick up the phone and click that button.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but the Moto X...  No, you don't do that.  Because the Moto X...  Moto X is different.  You tap the screen.  And you can set it to tap to focus and shoot or to just shoot.  And use the built-in focus.  I think the camera's adequate.  I know it's not as good as the Galaxy S4 or the HTC One.  Both of those are better.  But it's adequate.  And remember, it's just a camera phone, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I didn't want these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought, oh, I'm not going to use my camera phone to take the...  But that's different.  These are cameras.  These are cameras.  It's kind of an interesting product.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is really interesting.  If you start to think about how you can use the phone as a computer and display...  Yeah.  ...to other devices and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ultimately, that's why the 1020 and these other phones with really good cameras are  very interesting.  Because you have this powerful computational platform behind a camera.  And then behind that, you have internet access.  And you combine those together.  That's a pretty cool thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, are you talking about the new Samsung with Android?  Well, there's a number...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  I was talking about the Lumion 1020, the Windows phone, which is a 41 megapixel.  That's a camera phone.  Samsung...  I know, they make a hybrid weird camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, they've got a new one.  They just found.  Oh, okay.  Which is $1,700 with lens.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And so it uses all the Samsung lenses, all the stuff.  And it's very high quality.  But it's full Android in the back.  And so you get all the benefits of that.  Leo looks like he's eating a 4.4.  I'm eating Android 4.4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's eating Android 4.4.  What a world we live in.  There's too many gadgets, too little time.  Amen, brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amen.  You know, I find it odd.  I find it interesting that here we are on the show.  We go off on all kinds of things.  Not even the...  I put it on the rundown as a question mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Steve Ballmer.  Microsoft.  Yeah.  Ballmer, Nokia, Microsoft.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, who cares?  No, I was going to...  Actually, that was the next story.  I was going to bring that up.  Oh, okay.  It looks pretty clear at this point, reading between the lines, that Nokia was either...  Their contract with Microsoft to do Windows phones runs out next year.  They were either going to move to Android, which would have been the smart thing to do,  or literally go out of business.  It's that bad.  So, it seems likely that this was...  That was point one was, we got to...  This is the only company making decent Windows phones.  We got to keep them making Windows phones.  Point two is they have a CEO who's a former Microsofty, who is easily the front-runner anyway.  And I think the people at Microsoft, the board probably thought,  this is kind of like Apple acquiring Next and getting a CEO to boot.  And then the third point, which really convinced me, I think Bloomberg noted this,  is that this is overseas money.  So, Microsoft, like many companies, Google especially, has a lot of cash outside the US.  If they bring it back to the US, they pay US taxes on it.  So, it's money that's sitting overseas they cannot bring back.  They can't use it for shareholder buyouts.  They can't use it for dividends.  It's just sitting out there.  So, they only got a couple of $7 billion, $8 billion just lying around.  They can't really do much with it.  They can't repatriate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry, somebody's walking on the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If somebody suddenly appears in the show in a spuff of dust.  So, you put those three together, this makes a lot of sense.  I don't think it's going to save Windows phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did Google pay for Motorola?  A lot more. 12?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  12, 13?  Yeah, 12.5 I think.  Now, this was a good deal because only $5 billion, something like that, was for Nokia,  $2.5 billion for the patents.  So, this wasn't even a very expensive acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But even so, it's a headache.

Transcript:  It's not going to save Windows phone.  Windows phone, that's the real point of all this.  It's not going to save Windows phone.  Nothing can save Windows phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does feel like the two people who wound up without a date to their prom,  just decided to go together.  I have warm and fuzzy feelings about both companies.  The first smartphone I had was a Nokia candy bar.  I was geotagging photos and uploading to Flickr.  It was my first experience with that type of thing.  So, Nokia makes great phones, or did at a time.  I grew up honestly using Windows.  I want them, and I genuinely, sincerely want there to be another great leading operating system.  The two choices to me, from my perspective, seem like iOS and Android.  I would love for there to be a third.  And it's not quite there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was my first really good camera phone, the Nokia N93.  Yeah, that was an expensive...  Yeah, and it was like you turn it this way and it was really a camcorder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talking about the stupid line.  Well, I was really happy to get this.  And this was back, I don't know, 2005, 2006.  It was before the iPhone.  And look, it even had a mirror on this side so that you could do selfies, selfie videos.  Wow, that's ahead of its time right there.  Oh no, people have been taking selfies for as long as there have been cameras.  Nothing innovative about the selfie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we just see a lot more of them now.  You just see a lot more of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would Blackberry have been... just to play with it.  Blackberry has a huge business audience.  If you could fix Blackberry, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because here's the point.  Samsung makes Windows Phone, but they do it by rebaking half-year-old Android devices.  HTC, same thing.  Nobody's making a good Windows Phone except Nokia.  Nokia's making great Windows Phones.  They had to because they had no choice.  Yeah, I mean, phones so good that they make me actually consider buying a Windows Phone, which is saying a lot.  So I think this was a smart move in the sense that if you're devoted to the platform, it's...  you know, it had Nokia abandon Windows Phone, the platform's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My co-founder, Anil, floated an interesting idea, which is that Microsoft, with this acquisition,  Microsoft now has rights to Google Motorola's patents at Nokia's license rates,  which protects them to some degree.  He was like, you know, if I was Ballmer, that's how I'd pitch it to the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet you there is definitely patent stuff in there, sure.  Yeah.  There's other... you know, it's much like the Google-Rola deal, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although, you know, Google got a company that... that's why it's still...  I guess Google... see, one of the things Google is doing, I think, quite well is building a firewall between Motorola and Google to reassure OEMs.  At this point, anybody who makes Windows Phone that's not Nokia is going, pfft, yes, see ya.  In fact, it's probably the case that anybody who makes a Surface, or rather a Windows RT device that's not Nokia is going, pfft, thank God.  We can get out of that business.  So it's...  Do you think it's a change in conditions that will break contracts?  It's a risky move, yeah, of course. It's a risky, risky move, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Microsoft's in deep doo-doo, I don't think anybody thinks otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think that's probably the biggest tech story of the year.  Yeah, it is, but it doesn't...  Well, Android is so dominant at this point that we don't even have to pay attention to those stories.  Yeah.  Any other Google exciting Google news I want to talk about?  Hugo Barra.  We didn't mention Hugo Barra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, okay, now I watched you talk about this and all about Android, and you guys were really generous and kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a feeling you think that about a lot of our Android news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought, no, I thought you took the high road and I was very impressed, because I would have brought up the whole girlfriend...  ...gawker story there. Do you think that has anything to do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think people in offices have all sorts of relationships all the time, and I don't think it had anything to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're right. And you and Jason and everybody said, Ron said, is this is what happens when a company is successful.  The people who have built the success move on.  Hugo Barra, a big part of the success of Android. He was the face of Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think this is like a jilted lover thing? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is soap opera Leo, okay? No evidence for this.  So I'll tell you the story as I see it.  And I have to say, this comes from my upbringing, because my mom would look at somebody.  Mostly we'd be like in the kitchen. She'd look out the window in the neighborhood.  She said, let me tell you about that guy, and would spin an entire story about the family.  Mrs. Kravitz.  Yeah, she's like Mrs. Kravitz.  Oh my God, he's a drunk. He's in there. He's in his underwear. It's four in the afternoon.  He's watching TV. He beats his wife. All this from like one glimpse.  So anyway, I'm channeling my mom now.  Larry Page is married to the very talented, how do you pronounce her last name? Ann Wojcicki.  Wojcicki.  Wojcicki, whatever. Has been for some time.  They're a cute couple, engineer couple. She's a CEO at 23andMe.  He supports her efforts. They have a charitable foundation together.  She has a lot of Google stock, non-voting.  I mean, Sergey was, did I say Larry? Sergey. Sergey Brin.  Sergey was quick to point out on Twitter or somewhere, don't worry, she's not voting the stock.  So they, suddenly they're separated. We just find this out, but apparently it's gone on for a while.  Then we shortly after that find out, oh, Sergey has a new girlfriend.  He's going out with somebody else at Google.  Oh, it's Hugo Barra's ex-girlfriend.  So this, okay, I'm telling you complete fabrication. Those are facts.  Complete fabrication now.  But I just can see this scene. If I were writing for the Sopranos, I'd write this whole thing out.  Hugo storms in and says, are you sleeping with my girlfriend?  What happened?  Sergey says, oh, you got me.  Boom, bam, zoom. I am out of here. I'm going to China.  I don't know. I just, that's what I see.  Sergey Brin's at home and is in underwear. It's four o'clock in the afternoon.  He's watching TV's, a little bit tipsy. I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I'm sure that happens a lot with Sergey.  I mean, so Sergey and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's nobody's business, but there's, it's stupid.  The only reason there's any news at all there is of course the amount of jointly held Google stock by Anne and Sergey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean Sergey being separated and dating someone at Google actually is news, right, for that reason, right?  Because there's the stock and there's a prenup and I think that that's all protected.  I don't know. Listen, it's hard for me to believe. They work in completely different departments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but he's stooping his girlfriend and he says, that's it, screw you, I'm going to China.  He might as well have bought a boat on a ticket. A ticket on a boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's also, his wife's sister is also like VP of development.  I know, it's a mess. It's all kind of a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a mess. Yeah, Anne Woczicki's sister runs advertising and did you know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because she gave him the garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She leased him the garage when they first started, Larry and Sergey.  And now somehow she's running Google advertising. So that was a good deal on her part.  And her sister was married to Sergey. So obviously they met.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're a brilliant family. Their mother is a journalism teacher at Palo Alto High.  Okay, see, I'm feeling guilty now. I'm feeling very guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, Mrs. Woczicki, I'm sorry I said anything.  I'm sure this all happened in non-sequential order.  It's a small company. It's easy. People fall in love.  Just because it was Hugo's girlfriend. Life happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even among geeks. Life happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's hard for me to believe that Barra is, I mean, I just, he strikes me as someone who has gotten so far.  And who is so ambitious and is so smart and is committed enough to Android that he wants to be.  I mean, China is an interesting, you know, it's a really fascinating market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe Xiaomi offered him, you know, hey, we'll write you a check for $10 million.  But you got to think that Hugo's got a lot of money and a lot of Google stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you imagine he already has a lot of money. Yeah. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe the opportunity to be VP at a Chinese phone company. That was, it's not compelling to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it is kind of cool to see a Google insider take over a manufacturer in a new market.  I mean, like, because now you have someone who's played both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's good for Google. That's how they're going to, that's how they spin it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's how they spun it. Like, hey, we're so glad that he's staying within the Android ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a soap opera going on about Android? Andy Rubin leaves, JBQ leaves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a more relevant question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hugo Barleaves. Yeah, there seems to be a little bit about people going on.  A lot of people. A lot of people, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't know who's sleeping with whom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just, that's me.  Kit Kat bars or sleeping with yogurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kit Kat bars. It's totally low of me to even mention this.  It's very sleazy and gawkery.  We expect nothing better of you.  Just being honest, I understand that this is totally fabricated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that the gawkery is the synonym for sleazy.  It's so gawkery.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so gawkery. And I'm, you know, I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and gawker did it. You know, part of this, you have to feel for her as well.  She's obviously a smart, intelligent person. Otherwise, you wouldn't be at Google.  And now this is what's, you know, it's a woman in technology.  It's always ugly. It's always ugly.  And I've been on the other side of these stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I, you know, it's sad. And I shouldn't even bring it up.  But, you know, we're humans.  There's a part of us that kind of likes, wants to know what's, you know, what's the gossip?  What really happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So ABC, to my mind, the winning headline, men apparently do make passes at girls who wear...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that Rupert Murdoch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  And Rosenberger, man, the Rosenberger was the person who came up with the OK Glass phrase to activate Glass.  Oh, really?  She works on Glass. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So your spin on Last Night on All About Android was, and I think this is actually much more reasonable than what I said, this is just success.  Anytime something's successful, people get opportunities.  Oh, you did OK Glass? Can I throw millions of dollars at you to come to my company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, this is not Hugo.  This was the his ex-girlfriend, who's the one who came up with the OK Glass.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So she and Sergey both work on Google X, right?  Which is the lab that does the balloons and glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you're doing things, you're doing moonshots.  It's late at night. You've done a couple of moonshots.  It's a little romantic.  The music's playing.  Elon Musk is calling you.  You kind of, you kind of get a little, like Lucy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're coming up with catchphrases of the future.  I mean, come on.  This is actually, it's kind of sad because there are kids, there are kids involved and, you know, these things are hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's always, it's horrible and I should, it's not worthy of anything that I should even mention.  And I'm deeply ashamed of myself for bringing it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just hope that Google can find someone who does, who is just sort of personable and does good demos the way that Hugo did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who does the best? Vick's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Vick's pretty good. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sundar, not so good. He's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he's okay.  Andy Rubinoff almost never did demos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never did demos.  Hugo was the face because he wore those black t-shirts and he had the nice biceps.  Yeah, he had the arms.  And he had the arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he did the arm with the Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he was, he was, he was handsome and romantic and I think that that worked pretty well. Yeah.  He was only slightly foreign.  He had a slight foreign accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That slight foreign thing, you know.  Yeah.  Right?  He was just a little bit exotic.  It works for Americans, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, let's check the, let's check this drop hole.  Uh-oh. Uh-oh.  I'm sorry.  Chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel terrible. I shouldn't have brought that up and I apologize for bringing it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, don't worry about it. You know what?  I just have that kind of imagination and I blame my mom.  We hadn't mentioned it and I thought, oh, maybe we should have and then I was like, no.  No, you were right not to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was watching all about Android, just wondering if you would and you did.  You guys took the high road.  I'm very proud of you.  So I decided to drag us through the dirt.  Somebody's got to do it.  Our straw poll continues.  The vote is on strawpoll.me slash 390329.  By the end of the show, we will decide if Jeff Jarvis is going to open.  He's going to kill Larry the Lobster.  He's going to kill Larry the Lobster and open his Moto X.  And I got to tell you, it's only getting stronger.  59% yes right now.  That yellow wedge is growing.  It's going to look like a Pac-Man any minute now.  Unboxing, unboxing, unboxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is like, this is the horribly boring geeky version of Howard Stern's show.  Lisa G would kiss Ronnie the limo driver if a certain number of votes came in.  What did Howard have to say about the Google thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't talk about it at all.  He's off.  He's doing his NBC show.  He couldn't care less.  He couldn't care less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Glass will have an app store coming next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it sounds like Glass is moving more towards product.  Like it'll be an actual product we could buy maybe next year.  Right?  I just, I spent the last week at the US Open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't, I was going to take it and I thought, why?  Didn't, you didn't do, I saw the, I saw your great auto awesomes, including the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Auto awesomes, including the victory shuffle or whatever it was.  But that wasn't with Glass.  That was just with your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, cause you would, cause you only get far away.  You can't zoom.  You wouldn't give you anything.  So it's not a very good camera.  You know, up close it's okay.  You know, I'm going to go to the US Open app to find the stats or the scores of that kind of stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here's Andy Murray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to see, but he has a great winning grimace at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You had, are you, you, I like, are you on the court?  You had great seats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had great seats.  Well, here's the trick.  It's got to seem obnoxious.  If you buy seats for, this is, this is not Ash.  This is Armstrong's, but this is, this is the junior stadium.  And if you buy seats, you can then sell them through Ticketmaster.  So my wife was doing great.  She sold most of the seats back.  We earned money.  So there's Andrew Murray serving.  Yeah.  Now people are yelling at me for using auto awesomes.  Those were camera phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those were not glass photos, Jeff, right?  No, those were, those were neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was my Nikon one.  And you uploaded it.  And I uploaded it.  And then auto awesomeness.  And the point of that post is that I went, when Janine Gibson, who's the editor of Guardian  US and one of my colleagues here at CUNY, John Smock each talked about using dancing  gifts for news.  I screamed at them.  I know.  I know.  No, don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How could you do that?  And then I had to admit I'm wrong.  That, you know, why not have like a Harry Potter newspaper, The Prophet have the photo  that moves because you can see the reveal of Andy Murray coming up as he's got, yeah.  You know, and that reveals something in the, in the motion.  And we don't care.  Why not use a video player?  Cause you got to launch the player.  Right.  No, no, no.  It's not so bad.  It's a light version.  So the idea that a photo could move.  Why not?  What makes it holy that it shouldn't move?  People are yelling at me.  Something I'm going to unfollow you because you think it's moving.  Fine.  Goodbye.  I got 20 million followers on Google+.  Goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But is there an argument that a moving gift would draw the eye away from the, from the  text of the story, like in a news story?  It's just irritating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just irritating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you can't do it in print, so it mustn't be right.  Right.  Would the New York Times have done that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  So, but Jeff, so you were going to the US Open, you decided not to bring glass because  you felt like you wouldn't get value out of glass.  You're not going to get great pictures.  You're already kind of in the crowd.  Well, it's two things.  You know you're not going to get the updated scores.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So what, what, what was it going to get out of it?  And the worst part of it, Gina, this is a moment you will have come soon, would have humiliated  my daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like in three minutes, she's going to have that one.  Oh, oh, my wife too.  They start right.  They started kindergarten being humiliated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can imagine a future where glass knows you're at the open and installs the, you know, the  app or you can say, hey, if I'm at a ball game or whatever, hey, just play me the, you  know, the live, the radio broadcast into my bone conducting, you know, like when it's  smarter and it's a more consumer.  What?  I went to a costres game and I thought, ah, I should have brought the radio.  Yeah.  Because I like to listen and know while you watch the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, at the open, the American Express gives away, if you have a card, these little  radios, you get American Express radio, you just listen to it the whole time.  So you hear back in row, call in the game you're watching, which is great.  They also very interestingly, they also gave out a time Warner cable all this time for  free, loans, lint, fan visions.  What's the fan vision?  You can watch the other courts.  Oh, TV you carry around, put your neck.  And you had like seven views around the tennis stadiums, three out of Ash, one out of Armstrong,  one of the grandstand, one out of 17, where you can watch these various things.  There's a lot of money in tennis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I don't go to baseball games very often, but I happen to this Padres game.  They don't show you replays in the stadium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because they're afraid you'll throw batteries at them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, why?  I was asking why.  She's like, oh, they don't want any people to riot.  I was like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't go to many games apparently.  I don't go to very many games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but it was so frustrating because there was a call that seemed clearly bad and you  wanted to see it.  But anyway, that's something I would love to have had to have had on glass.  Leo, if I were you and I was taking the trip that you are, which I deeply, deeply wish that I was, by the way.  And I feel like I love my daughter, but I feel like I'm not going to be able to take a trip like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think of taking Etta.  No, in 10 years, you'll be able to take Etta and it will be an amazing thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, she's maybe out of diapers.  But yeah, I would I would bring glass.  I would bring glass because I do think that it offered in particular being sort of out and about and seeing, seeing places or being able to look up things in those situations.  It is in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny.  It's so much more intrusive to pull out a camera and take a picture than it is just to go, you know, OK, glass and do that.  So, yeah, I kind of understand what you're saying.  This is something you can do with the Moto X that you might be interested in just to help you, Jeff.  They have one of the things that's in it is a slow motion video capability.  You know that so you can take with the camera.  You can take slow.  It doesn't do audio.  I wish it did because you can slow me down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, wouldn't that be fun?  You just add the sound effects yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've had people tell me that they normally listen to twit podcasts with the speed up except this one because I talk too fast.  Yeah.  There's a few people Tim Stevens from former and gadget are now it's seen that talks really, really, really, really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you if you sped it up, you'd be like you're listening to Alvin and the chipmunks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He also must be the East Coast because I know that it's Eastern.  It is.  It is.  It is.  I get people all the time asking me to slow down.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got to get rid of.  No, no, we have to let Gina go.  That's it.  That's the phrase in just a few minutes.  So let us get our our tip and our number and our tool of the week and then we'll check the votes and see what Jeff's going to do with his moto X starting with you, Gina Trapani and your tool of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, can for can for Chicago in the chat room mentioned that today is the 15th anniversary of Google.  And look at Wikipedia.  Indeed, Google was founded on September 4th, 1998.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And no doodle or anything.  They should know doodle.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you can you believe that the Google is only 15 years old?  Is that crazy?  It's only a teenager.  I mean, it's of course, that's ancient and Internet company.  It is actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's surprisingly old to me about it.  I remember the days before there was a Google.  Google.  I remember going to Mr. I remember to go and do dinner with Larry and Sergey.  I mean, you know, they would invite press to go to dinner and ask them questions and talk and stuff.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's access right there.  All right.  Well, I had to bring that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Well, no, that's a huge deal.  Fifteen years old rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to use it as a number.  Now, if you go to the rundown, there are 15 things to know about Google and the rundown, some of which are obvious, some of which aren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, sorry.  I was that your number.  OK, Gina, you know what the number is going to be now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's whatever comes up in the poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, we're making numbers even as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know that the first Google Doodle was a Burning Man symbol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  An average of one company every week since 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from The Guardian, of course.  Jeff's favorite newspaper now.  It is indeed.  I wish I had I could get it on my doorstep.  Google was originally called Backrub.  I don't remember.  Whoa, whoa.  Google has bought has acquired an average of one company every week since 2010.  They were burners.  Yeah, Larry and Sergey were burners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're still burners, aren't they?  Don't they still go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They probably go in a jet.  Yeah, jet parachute in.  Yeah, yeah.  A thousand Google employees became millionaires when the company went public in 2004.  One of them was the masseuse Bonnie Brown, who worked giving back rubs for the company in 1999 for $450 a week plus stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Back rubs is a theme here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe that's why they call them back rub.  When Facebook went public, the guy who painted a mural on Facebook's wall became a millionaire because they couldn't pay him.  They gave him stock.  Google hires goats.  They have 200 goats a week and to eat the grass.  You know, that's not a that's a typical thing in California.  Actually, Google's first official tweet was the words I'm feeling lucky in binary.  All those nerds and they probably didn't even use a calculator.  They just knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They probably they're late.  The Twitter game.  That was a nine nine.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First, let's see this here.  I'm going to see this.  There's a link to it.  It's from a Googler at Google.  I'm following that Googler.  I know that.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The exeugler, the exeugler, exeugler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a new player when you first start and a former employee like Hugo Barra is an exeugler.  And Larry and Sergey own just 16 percent of the company.  But that's worth here's a good number.  Forty six billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, man.  It's a good number.  You have a tool to.  Yeah.  Quick tip.  Actually, this week, as of the latest Play Store update on Android is actually an Android tip.  So when you when you get updates to your apps and you tap that update all button, it used to be that all your apps are updated.  Even the ones that you said don't update automatically.  But that has changed.  If you mark an app as manual update only and you tap update all now, the Play Store will prompt you and say, hey, you mark this app for manual update.  Do you want to or not?  Which is a nice, nice little bit of bit, little bit of choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is a number.  Let's take a look at your number, Jeff.  We have eight hundred one total votes.  Seventy three people said just get an LTE Nexus seven.  Eighty seven people said you should not open the Moto X and use it right now.  One hundred sixty seven people said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love how that now advanced over the simple no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the winner is with a total of four hundred seventy four votes.  Fifty nine percent said yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Jeff, I think there we go.  He's got to open it.  That's hard to open, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Six hundred seventy four dollars going down the old.  Oh, no, you can return it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm amazed that they're they're letting you return a customized one.  I guess you could peel the back off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here it is.  Blue. Nice, nice, slate blue black front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very pretty. Very pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I won't text while I'm driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, don't even turn it on because you have to call AT&T before you turn it on.  I'll just warn you. You do?  Yeah.  Well, they want you to.  It says there's a little thing in there.  So don't turn it on.  Oh, I'll give you a tip. OK.  I'll tell you how to you got it off contract. Right.  Or no. Yes.  Yeah. So you don't have a magic number.  So what you do is you call AT&T and you say I want to make a hardware swap.  I found out this after three hours on on hold.  I called Motorola.  They didn't know what to do. Blah, blah, blah, blah.  So finally I called AT&T. They said, oh, yeah, that's a heart.  Motorola said, call AT&T. Tell me you want to make a hardware swap.  And you have to have the numbers.  The SIM number is ICC ID and the IMEI is the hardware number.  You need both those numbers and they'll take your old phone offline  and replay your Nexus four and replace it with this.  You know what? If you don't like it, Jeff, your money back.  We will send you a check for that phone.  Seriously. No, no, no. Seriously.  Wow. No, we'll buy it from you, Jeff.  I don't want you to.  You were pressured into this by the straw poll.  Chat room, chat room.  So I feel bad since you don't have a Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I volunteered. I volunteered.  I feel so bad.  I'm actually I just need an excuse.  But honey, Leo made me do it.  You said you were going to return that phone.  But Leo said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'll pay up. I'll buy it for me.  Jeff, really seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's for your job. That's what that's what I that's what I say.  Also, we have to talk about the zen of being happy with the phone you have  and not the phone you want, not tortured by the phone.  That's true.  That is very true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, did you get the Motorola skip?  Yeah, they said that was true.  This is kind of cool.  You know, they're way overpriced.  This is 20 bucks for a magnet and an RF chip.  That's that's crazy.  An FC chip.  But so the idea of this is it clips on to something like your lapel or your  visor in your car and then you can lock your phone.  So my my tip actually is that, you know, you probably know that you can encrypt  the contents of your phone, but it's a pain in the butt when you do it because  you have to you can't just use one of those patterns.  You have to have a long number or password, which is a pain to enter.  Well, now, thanks to the skip and the Bluetooth authentication, which also  will unlock it if you want.  It's my phone's unlocked right now.  In fact, I can't I'm trying to lock it and I can't because it's attached to  the Bluetooth on my computer.  But that means you can say, OK, Google now and all that stuff continues to work.  Right.  So this is a nice feature and I like the skip.  It's crazy expensive.  So I'm going to look into if there's some way to get a regular, cheap NFC chip  and use it or something like that.  Oh, good idea.  Because they do sell little they're going to sell little dots and but 20 bucks for  this is nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did it also come with those?  I saw some reference on the package.  It came with those those things, the little dot things you put on desk or something.  It does not come with them.  What does it say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I threw them out by accident.  It comes with one skip.  They say they're going to make them.  Maybe it did.  And I just didn't see it.  I have I saved my packaging, so I'll look through it.  But yeah, that would be cool.  You put that on the desk.  You put that on the car visor.  Yeah.  And then you just tap it on there and it's unlocked.  And you do want to keep this phone.  I think it's important to have use encryption on your phone.  So I'm glad I could.  I did turn it on.  It takes it takes a while to encrypt it.  But it was I never used it before because I had to enter all that stuff.  Now it's not a big deal.  So I think that's good.  Now you can fly through London.  Yeah, this is really but come on, Motorola.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, 20 bucks.  20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  That's worse than the 30 bucks for a bumper case on an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  You know, the profit margin of the price of this is $674.  Throw it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's true.  No kidding.  That's a good point.  They only these only cost $221 to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  I mean, if you really want to differentiate the product that that's thinking like Motorola,  not like Google.
