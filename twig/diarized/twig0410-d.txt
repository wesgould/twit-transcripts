Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to see you Mike. Leo Laporte, great to see you. You know you're back in that country and I'm not  in that country but it's great to see everybody traveling. And I will do my best to be as smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and angry as Jeff Jarvis. Really there's no point in trying. There's no one better at cranky  than Jeff. Also with us is Stacey Higginbotham of Stacey on IOT, formerly of GigaOM. Hi Stacey.  Hello. How are you? I am back for vacation. Where'd you go? What'd you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Costa Rica with my family. Eco tourism. Eco tourism. I tried to surf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you mean tried to surf? It's very difficult to surf.  It is hard isn't it? Were you able to stand up at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did get there but I was not able to stand up in balance. It was too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I know. Did they give you one of those really wide floaty boards to start with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my gosh. I think I had the junior junior board. Oh it's so much fun though.  I had a great time. Even though I could not surf, I could watch my daughter surf and that was awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I just had a great time. Yeah. For some reason the little kids, maybe because they have a lower  center of gravity, they seem to be better. They have to lift less mass. I'm totally with it.  She just popped right up there. Welcome home. Wow this is a traveling show because I just got  back from vacation as well. Who filled in for me? I forgot. Jason Howell filled in last week right?  Thank you Jason for filling in for me. Both times? No. All right. Appreciate it Jason.  Did anything happen while I was gone? Oh I heard. In fact it's funny because I really,  we had very little internet access and I wasn't really able to keep up with the news.  But for somehow Amazon buying Whole Foods really broke through the silence. That was a big darn  story this week. And what's funny is that Amazon got it effectively, in a way got it for free.  It was a 13.7 billion dollar all cash deal for Whole Foods but their stock price went up more  than their value, went up more than that because their stock price went up so high. So you might  say that they got it for nothing. To give you an idea of how big an acquisition this is,  before the 13.7 billion dollar acquisition the next biggest was Zappos for 1.2 billion,  Twitch for under a billion, Kiva Systems, Souq. This is by far the biggest acquisition.  What is the, what does that mean? What is the strategy? Why does Amazon want a grocery store

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of all things? Who wants to go? Mike, you or me? You start and I'll let Mike. I'll let ladies first

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and then I'll let you go Mike and then I'll tell you what it really means because Ben Thompson told

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  me. Oh hey I was actually thinking Ben Thompson was the smartest guy in the room on this one.  It's a last mile distribution network for Amazon so it gets them access to, like Ben Thompson's,  Amazon is its own best customer with AWS and with the other products that it's  or services that it's released and this makes with Whole Foods a huge customer for its delivery  network. Plus it pushes it out to the edge just a little bit more for if you're going to do like  drones and that sort of thing or even just pick up lockers. So they bought it for the physical  locations? As a both the physical locations and as Ben Thompson said as a grocery distribution is  the most I guess just it's not maybe the most but it's a just-in-time  huge turnover lots of distribution like logistical kind of business and this is something Amazon  really needs to or it's already had but it wants to expand into this even more and groceries are a  whole new element with perishable goods and all that fun stuff. Is that what you're thinking too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mike? Well I so first of all I don't think we should undervalue or underestimate the perfection  of Whole Foods in finding locations. We actually whenever we help somebody find an apartment or  whenever we're going to do anything that has a location base if you assume that that Whole  Foods are in the best neighborhoods in terms of other resources that are in those neighborhoods.  Everywhere there's a Whole Foods there's also public parks there are good schools there are  Starbucks there are all these other premium stores and things like that. They're very very very good  and very disciplined at finding good locations so the location thing is huge. The second thing is  that and exactly what Stacey said they can these these can be distribution centers for not only  rapid delivery one hour delivery in the suburbs in the same way that they do it in New York City  but also the delivery of refrigerated goods in a more cost effective way that's a that's a big  thing but there are two other things. One of them is grocery delivery everybody wants to crack  grocery delivery because if you can get people in the habit of buying their groceries in a delivery  scenario and everybody loses money on it I'm old enough to remember Webvan where they basically  tried and failed to have a grocery delivery business. This gives Amazon the opportunity  to just nail that right out of the bat with an existing loyal customers around 69 percent. I think  that's the number I could be getting that wrong chat room can correct me but there's a huge overlap  between Whole Foods customers and Amazon Prime members so the Whole Foods customers that are  basically already mostly Amazon's Prime their best customers and they're already signed up and  so on and and so the third biggest element of this is that grocery stores are actually becoming  extremely interesting places. Over the next 10 years experts in the in the in the industry  expect grocery stores to be experience centers you go there to take cooking classes you go there to  learn things you go to their hangout a lot of Whole Foods are they set up bars and bistros  and restaurants and cafes in the stores that people are spending hours there they're reading  rooms essentially like coffee houses or whatever where you can just read books and magazines and  newspapers and they have local bands and poetry readings and beatniks and hippies and all you know  the whole bit and and community bulletin boards where people gather to do you know their grocery  stores are becoming sort of town centers in a way and and they're going to evolve in that and Amazon  if you if you look at what Amazon's trying to do in brick and mortar retail they're trying to figure  out what to do they have robotics they have a robotic store on their campus they have some  bookstores that have some automation they use it to sell Amazon Echo I mean there's all kinds of  synergies and again what's important for Amazon is the quality of the customer and the same way  that Apple has like these premium customers who spend lots of money on devices Amazon is essentially  doubling down on these Amazon Prime type of customers who spend a lot of money who are  willing to spend extra for delivery whatever it takes and I just think it's a brilliant move by  Amazon and I don't think the stock price really demonstrates I mean the stock prices go up and  down but and I also think it's interesting that all the other grocery chains tanked in terms of  the stock price and this was announced yeah but but but I think over the long term Amazon's going  to do its Amazon thing it's going to bring prices down run along a sort of almost a zero profit  level and just drive growth drive everybody else out of the out of the business out of the premium  premium grocery business I just think this is gold for Amazon it's just a playground for all of their  high-tech food related delivery drone delivery projects that they want to even think about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I'm going to disagree a little bit with you there Mike just on the idea of a grocery store  becoming that kind of Starbucks style third place experience center for stuff because I don't feel  a I kind of don't see that happening from a grocery store perspective but also because I don't think  Amazon I don't think that's like a real Amazon strategy or place they really want to be but  I do think they want to be in food delivery for a variety of reasons and and I actually wrote a  little bit about like what Amazon can do with food when the deal broke but but that's the only thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to quibble with on you I think actually you're both right in the sense that Stacey's  looking more at the immediate benefits it's a real estate play it's a you know it's a brick and  mortar play it's and and but I think Mike you're right in the sense that in the so in the short  term it's it pays for itself I think with as a real estate play and as a delivery play but in  the long term Amazon you know this is where I thought Ben was really right on let me let me  let me quote from Ben Thompson of course is the creator of Strategory which he's been on the show  many times we think the world of him Strategory.com he and this is kind of what you said he he builds  this is Amazon's new customer that the Whole Foods is actually now a new customer just like AWS is a  customer but I think where I got very interested is when he talks about Amazon's changing mission  statement so in the original mission statement their original S1 in 1997 they said Amazon's  objective is to be the leading online retailer of information-based products and services  with an initial focus on books that's exactly what they were they started as a bookstore but  they wanted to be a retailer of information-based products and services then as time went by their  mission statement changed to our our vision is to be the earth's most customer-centric company  to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online  and then now he says they've eliminated the second clause literally Amazon's  mission statement today is just the single sense we seek to be the earth's most customer-centric  company but he but he points out that really their goal is to take a cut and I really like this to  take a cut of all economic activity now obviously that's not doable but it's a great goal to say  every transaction we want to be the middleman in every transaction and I think Amazon in the long  run sees and I think they're not far off I think it's just maybe less than a decade off almost all  purchases occurring online in fact they just announced a new service where you can buy a bunch  of clothes and try them on and then send them back this is going to be death to sponsors like ours like  like a trunk club and so forth because Amazon's going to get in this and not only that they're  going to give you a bigger discount the more you keep so they they're going to and of course tie  that with the echo look right which has the camera that looks at you and says oh not that maybe that  Amazon's going to so that's an area where people it's shoes too for years now you can't buy shoes  online you got to try them on well they've proven clothes and shoes can be sold online I think people  today say I don't want to squeeze the melons you can't I can't sell groceries on I think it's but  I see you know you're right Mike there have been a lot of online retail companies that have peapod  and you know as you mentioned what was a web van of all kind of dashed against the rocks here but  maybe they were just too early if anybody could do it Amazon could do it they've got this new dash  wand right which reads the barcodes on all the foods in your refrigerator and then does the  shopping it has Amazon fresh so this is so what I but let me just finish then go ahead yeah and  so what I think is in the you're right in the short term Stacey but in the long run Amazon's  saying well what happens if every all transaction first of all we want a piece of all transactions  that'll be easiest if they're all online and we do delivery what happens though to to stores to  people people want to go somewhere they want to do something and I I wish I could remember because  somebody who's been a contributor on this show for years maybe it was you Mike but I think it was  somebody else has always said no no the future of retail is experiences not purchases that ultimately  you'll go to a bookstore not to buy a book but for lectures to see because people do like to be around  people movie theaters realize the only way they could survive is to become experience centers  not movie theaters that ultimately the future of brick and mortar is experiences and I think  Amazon in the long run said you know in the short run they've got these stores they've got this real  estate they've got this physical presence in the long run in order to get a piece of every  transaction to become the middleman for the world the way you do that is putting everything online  and then you keep these stores for experiences doesn't that make sense Stacey is a kind of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  future I think stores for experiences are fine I think there's two really interesting things if  you think about the physical retail experience that Amazon's doing and they're very different  the Amazon go people list kind of perspective which is a very convenience oriented I'm going  to get this I'm going to pop in grab it and go for a situation like you know lunch maybe near your

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  office but that's also an experiment I don't know if that's what they see the end game

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right but I think there's there's a lot of value actually in something like that I think even though  many people will have delivery right to wherever they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but you're right there's there's times when you want to now right yeah but I also I don't quibble

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with the idea of experiences I just quibble with the idea of going to a grocery store for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  experience and I've been to what if it's a well wait what's you think it's a grocery what if it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like there's cooking classes so there are cooking classes if you go to the whole foods in Austin  when Whole Foods built its original headquarters in Austin that's exactly what it was it had a  cheese bar a wine bar a beer cave it has still cooking classes it has it is an experience  I mean you go there and it's um it's not a flop they've closed some of those things down

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but they they open some of the things in the London store which is a really phenomenal Whole  Foods um and they've tried you know one of the things about Whole Foods is fascinating is that  they're super innovative and they let the stores sort of do the innovation themselves there's I  think there's something like 75 Whole Foods stores that actually have bars with micro brews multiple  taps tv sets big lounge chairs and according to what I've read none of that came from HQ the stores  themselves came up with those ideas independently to to to sort of give people something to do  probably I mean for the most part it's like give husbands something to do drink beer  while the rest of their families are shopping or whatever but but yeah they're they're pretty  innovative company in in terms of letting the stores themselves create these experiences that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey's talking about in each individual store but look what they did with the 365 stores which  is their new kind of program for expansion because they're kind of tapped out on the existing  high-end experiential thing and the 365 stores are much more bare bones minimalistic  they're designed for millennials things don't cost as much they stock the 365 brand of organic  foods as opposed to like I don't know the insanely delicious french balsamic vinegar I bought at  Whole Foods you know so there there is a place for some experiential centers but I don't think  that's where they're going to bet the farm but this is like a total small thing to be arguing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about over the big impact of this deal I totally agree with that and when when amazon thinks about  an experience they're not thinking about people sitting around drinking beer and taking cooking  classes they're thinking about more data monitoring the consumer behavior a few so amazon go is the  name of amazon's amazing incredibly high-tech grocery store that is on their campus I think  it might even still be in beta it was supposed to open months ago but it wasn't quite ready but  this store is crazy I mean it's crazy what they do basically what the idea is you just go in you  pick items and you walk out and your amazon account is just charged automatically they know  what you bought how do they know that what you bought machine learning so they have cameras that  watch you pick up items they they shelves themselves are scales so they know how much  so you remove something that the that the ai thinks looks like a canister of yogurt the the weight  differential is about the same as a canister of yogurt they look at your history and say oh this  person always buys yogurt they're recognizing your face as you pick the yogurt off the thing  and they take all this data together and say they just picked up yogurt off the shelf  and then yogurt is charged to your account later on you can put it back it sort of reverses that  and all this kind of I mean it's really it's really crazy but the the hint about what amazon  is after can be found inside the store they know what behavior looks like and they've gathered data  with what people do on amazon.com what they don't know is what you do in a brick and retail store  how long you linger how long you spend looking at things are you reading ingredients are you  um taking something and then putting it back are you concerned about the price so what is really  happening with your mind as you're trying to decide what to buy and what not to buy  so amazon go is their big attempt to figure that out and I think what they're what they're really  thinking now is okay whole foods is a huge opportunity for us to harvest all kinds of data  that you can't gather on people when they're simply shopping on amazon.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right and that that is a huge so I wrote on my site um I did a few things on what it means for  food because there's a couple things there um I didn't get into the data aspects as much but  getting getting food data on the web and digitizing food data is really a challenge  one because all of the devices all of the devices all of the items they can look a little bit  different right so for machine learning and computer vision purposes you know a beet and  a fennel may look close enough for a parsnip and a carrot may look close enough you know that it  becomes challenging there's also the idea that these things are all called different names like  we call arugula arugula and people somewhere else call it rocket so amazon's going to be able  to get a lot of data about what people are buying how they're buying in for amazon they have  historically focused on buying data they they their recommendation engine is all about getting  you to purchase more stuff so getting the actual data on how and what you buy is way more more  relevant to them so if you think about google being focused on search data and how that affects  what they're doing amazon's kind of like eh don't care as much about that give me the actual buying  data so this will be very valuable to them for that a quick prediction too i think that um one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  business amazon would love to get into is the meal kit business the blue apron kind of business  and uh whole foods would enable them to use whole foods markets and whole foods inventory as the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  foundation for that kind of business so see we we did for a long time say oh you're never going  to buy shoes online you buy shoes online you're gonna buy clothes online you're gonna you do you  do buy clothes online will do you think it's impossible to say um people will buy groceries  online i mean dry goods is one thing canned goods fine you do blue apron yeah but i don't do it for  all my shopping obviously i need to go to the grocery store for fresh goods uh can that be done

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  online i think so here's here's where i think things get really really interesting when you  have all of this data it is possible that amazon will look at me like we so i'll say in my family  we meal plan we have a kid and we we plan about four or five meals a week in advance and the rest  of time we're just kind of throwing stuff around or eating out for staples you can use something  like the dash wand which is like hey i just use this don't we use safeway for all dry goods they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just come every few weeks and it's just all the boxed and canned stuff that you don't need to look

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at and then for all the fresh food because we we buy all of that having a trusted supply chain which  for a lot of people whole foods is expensive but that's what it is just telling them you want that  it's no different than like trusting blue apron right for giving you fairy eggplants which i

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  never even heard of that's one thing blue apron has proven you can do i think it's been at a great  cost but to to to really bring you high quality produce because you know that's i think the biggest  concern is oh i'm going to get uh watermelon that are you know over ripe or i'm going to get  apples that are bruised i think that's the big concern i want to look at those but if you always  got as we do with with blue apron they're a sponsor but uh it's also the fact that  they have some sort of quality assurance that really you always do get perfect produce  and you would trust whole food to do that probably now here's the big thing that keeps whole food and  one of the one of the reasons by the way whole food is a bargain is because they were struggling  they're not doing well uh and partly that was because it was a very high price story  you know we called it whole paycheck i mean it really paycheck yeah but people who shopped there  affluent upper middle class people who cared more about the quality of their food and organic  whether this is true or not because sometimes i wonder if whole foods commitment to organic  was that genuine but that that whole health food thing and we're willing to pay more and you know  we're kind of less price sensitive but if amazon wants to turn whole food around and make it grow  don't they drop the price don't they make it more accessible to everybody or do they care would they  i think they would want to get was was they were moving in that direction were they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well that's what the 365 stuff was oh okay go ahead i'm sorry yeah mike go ahead you could

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  imagine all kinds of innovation on flex pricing i mean one of the things that um here's a couple  of tips for whole foods customers and i learned this from amira who's like uh who i think she  interviewed the the ceo john mackie i think his name is of whole foods at some point but basically  whole foods has some really interesting policies that amazon will probably change for example  you can try anything at whole foods you can open packages and try it really and and yes you can  you can pick up an apple and take a bite and that's so it's a way that's smarter than you can  order the bands absolutely they will also um especially in the beer and wine section if you  want something just ask and they'll start stocking it we've gone there before and they have  enormous in in silicon valley they have all the stores have really fantastic selections of beer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to be fair our local mom and pop store pedal in the market will do that also you know pedal in the  market is an example of a local small not a chain that store that's competing well against whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  foods on price and by offering service but pedal in the market pedal in the market and cutati market  also and olivers up and yeah i i meant i meant olivers yeah olivers market that's the one i meant  those are two of the some of the best little grocery stores in california are amazing really  really good stores but but i think what what amazon could do is some some version of that  instead of stocking in in perpetuate well probably the best grocery store in all of california is  rainbow market in san francisco right and they will literally stock anything from anywhere if  they can get it they will stock it right if you just ask that that's bad business and what amazon  could do is say look you have a kind of a obscure request we'll just ship it to you for free and we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't stock i mean that's kind of how a bookstore is work these days isn't it right it's not on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  shelf i'm calling amazon yeah so another thing that we think there's so much we could do yeah to  make this so much more efficient with combinations of delivery and pricing and inventory and which  whole foods just hasn't been doing go ahead i'm sorry stacy but no that's okay and i would say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  also think about how amazon prices things and how dynamic that can be what will be interesting is if  you think about inventory management in a grocery store with technology capabilities so not  necessarily people but if you have cameras looking at your stock you can say hey you know we have an  abundance of corn this is terrible let's discount this right and and those kind of things should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pricing yeah yeah yeah uber style surge pricing surge pricing on turkeys at thanksgiving you know  what's going to be sad whole foods is a very good employer they pay well they give benefits i don't  know if that's going to continue i think that that was a good job they weren't going to change

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the whole foods culture and they have a history of that with i mean look what they let tony's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tony shay do with zappos zappos they didn't touch zappos did they they gave them free rain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah so they said they were going to do that too with whole foods on the employee side

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so is this maybe just really because of walmart walmart said we want to you know  walmart's terrified of amazon right as they should be as they should be and walmart's going  after amazon and so is that really what we're seeing is a amazon versus walmart

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's i mean you can't discount that yeah food is what is it 20 percent of the budget wow yeah it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's a huge thing and and but i really think it's it's um it's android versus uh versus ios here  because um i'm sure that what will happen and what is already happening is that for the most  part whole foods is going after the high end of the market and walmart is going after the low end  of the market uh that's true in terms of locations that's true in terms of their pricing and what  they emphasize you can find organic food at walmart but the shoppers aren't primarily  interested in premium organic foods and the reverse is true at whole foods so i think that  i think they'll coexist and sort of battle it out on the margins a couple of other things that  come to mind which amazon could easily do people think that they go to the store and they're like  oh i can choose anything i think i'll choose this i think i'll choose that but over a period of three  or four years it'd be trivial easy for a company like amazon to to say you know what every three  and a half months on average you buy a carton of agandaz coffee flavored ice cream why don't we just  ship that to you every three and a half months or you know they can tell you what the patterns are  of what you buy there's probably a lot of um predictive capacity there and also uh they could  do predictive stocking knowing what everybody does i mean of course um walmart is really really  good at this if there's a they check weather patterns if there's a hurricane coming they stuck  off they're very data up on all the things that yeah yeah but but there's another business that  exists in in sort of like uh popular among organic farmers and so on which is that you can  subscribe i mean there's lots of people do this in california you can subscribe to get fresh produce  delivered and so you and and they decide what the produce is so like a csa yes csa so you get if

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's a that's one of those farm to table subscription services where you get a box every  week of and they choose what's in the box exactly so they you could imagine an algorithmically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  determined set of meal kit delivery delivery of food based on what how you actually do your shopping  plus this kind of farm to table well i already i already am an amazon subscribe and save customer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this is an amazon service i don't know how well known it is but you get five to 15 percent discounts  by saying well i'm going to get that every three months just ship it to me and that is something  missing i would love to see it no more i'm constantly adjusting it because i know i got  i got too many baggies now you know and i'm constantly adjusting it's a pain in the butt  although it's such a convenience that every every month on the 19th i get a big box and they put it  all in one box it's the biggest box you ever saw i feel sorry for the the mail carrier on my doorstep  and it's all the staples and yeah and and and it's not it's far from perfect but it is i'm already  using it and i think that that is a very natural thing for amazon to expand into one of the things  ben thompson says is that amazon likes whole foods reliance on store brands like you were mentioning  stacy the 365 brands and in fact one of the things i don't like about whole foods i can't get our  local milk brand there they they they don't have all the brands they're they're not big on variety

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's something amazon likes though yes yes because they can control pricing they can  they have all kinds of controls i was also going to point out because i do think this is  worth noting in the greater amazon walmart battle for supremacy or being the man in the middle  walmart has talked to some of its customers some of its vendors and said hey get off aws the amazon  web services cloud so the wall street journal had this story this morning and it actually ties into  a couple weeks ago yeah i put it in the rundown and then somebody also surfaced it in the chat  but a couple months ago maybe it was actually about a month ago one of the big logistics companies  decided to go with microsoft's azure cloud because they didn't want oh it was mersk the shipping  m-a-e-r-s-k yeah they're the big container shipping company yeah they went with azure instead of aws  because they were concerned about amazon being a competitor of theirs in the distribution business

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well they're smart ultimately amazon is a competitor of every single retail business  that's in the distribution business in the world it's true i loved it that ben thompson  says amazon's goal this is the base mission statement where they say sir and i take a cut  of all economic activity what an amazing goal right yeah i mean true and why not if you're jeff  bezos who's doing all right i think i just saw an article says he makes a million dollars a day  personally uh where else do you go well i just want a bit i want to i just want to you know a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  penny on every economic transaction that happens food is a great place people always need to buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  food is a really i didn't realize but now that i think about you're absolutely right i didn't  realize what a big chunk of our daily expense it's one in 20 of our daily expenditures is food

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  also if you're a big enough tech company if you're apple google or amazon really what you're doing  is your business is to build a better customer to get customers to have certain habits and  inclinations i mean starbucks is the perfect example they they move the the world from a place  where people bought coffee in a can and and it was like you know and they made it with a with  the malita filters or whatever uh to a world where you stand in line for half an hour and spend 450  for your coffee i mean they transform the behavior they made a better user and if if you think about  if you're a whole foods customer and you're an amazon echo user and you're making dinner and  it's like oops we forgot we forgot something we need we need some butter you are going to tell  and if that could be delivered within an hour you would tell us hello knowing that it comes from  whole foods and whole foods knowing what brand you prefer you would just tell us hello i need  some butter send it to me as soon as possible the psychological knowledge that is coming not through  the mail system from some warehouse somewhere but from the whole foods down the street  is really going to get people to buy groceries and if you're buying groceries and food all the time  through a scholar you're being trained to buy things through a scale and you gotta stop saying  your name mike i'm sorry through the through the virtual assistant that shall not be named and  clothes i mean you name it and and of course all that stuff comes from amazon so you know i think  i think a big part of this is how can we have a business and and a compelling um uh uh offering  that will get people to be using this thing for actual purchases several times a week  right and i think this so that this is this is a big thing toward that so this conversation has

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  been great because i have completely now come around to the notion that we will be doing all  of our grocery shopping online through amazon in the next five years that this is just going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  happen yeah well i'm going to tweak it i know you want to get off this topic because we are not this  week in amazon yes we are this is right down our alley so imagine so and this is what i did i broke  down food into the five kind of ways to think about how we eat right in our house and how amazon will  touch that but with um the echo the echo show which comes out you know june 28th so next week  at this time i should have an echo show to be like hello we can talk on it leo uh you can show  amazon thanks to the data it's going to have about what produce is i can be like hey this is what i  have and it will suggest recipes i can make what i don't have for it it can order and these things  are going to be so seamless and so easy it's just going to be you won't go other places and it'll be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  great well that's a good point because it's convenience that's going to win it well it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not just convenience it's also knowledge like i mean how often do you sit there and look in your  fridge and you're like well crap i've got this weird piece of fish and this vegetable and i don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know what to do with it right so i so now i think amazon was surprised buying buying whole foods is  a good idea oh yeah at first it's like what the what why would they want a grocery store

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah because we think of we think of amazon as as a the alternative to brick and mortar but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of course they've dashed that uh expectation long ago well but wait a minute really have they i mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they do brick and mortar things but ultimately uh well what so so the mission statement which is to  be the you know the world's finest customer centric company is really just here's how we get a piece  of all economic activity by by making it as easy as possible for our customers to use us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  then i see that i see there's there's two kinds of tech companies and i think that the quintessential  examples are apple and google so apple companies are visionary companies they work behind the scenes  in secret to figure out what you want and they chip away and chip away and then they release it  and like this is what you want and there are companies like google who are like we don't know  what you want we don't know what anything's going to happen in the future how about this how about  this how about this and they see what sticks to the wall amazon is a google type of company they  have done so many experience experiments remember they had lockers in seven elevens where you could  have things delivered and you go to the seven eleven they still have them they're they're  working on they still have them they're working on drones they're working on blimps they're working  on all kinds of uh delivery systems that they're buying their own airline they're i mean they don't  have any idea how people are going to produce food but what they one of the things they did learn in  one of their experiments which was the amazon echo was they were surprised to find out that  everybody puts the amazon echo in the kitchen and that the amazon echo was right from the start  and this isn't the amazon show this echo show this is the original echo people are asking it  for measurements they're asking for timers and they use it while they're cooking they use it  it's a food thing and they're like wow this this is amazing you know that's a good point because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i don't know if they knew that that's where it would end up but it is exactly where it started  anyway now i have echoes everywhere but it starts in the kitchen yeah so somebody in the chat  said something interesting we are addicted to convenience and that's the other thing amazon  must have realized is that you know while there are many considerations that you use to choose  your economic how your economic activity is is executed price convenience uh you know brand uh  status you know remember the uh the old you know conspicuous consumption you show your economic  status by what you buy and how you buy it um but more and more convenience is going to trump that  i don't know why because our lives are busier or go ahead why i can tell you i can tell you because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's a there's a news story okay it's an aeon magazine it is conspicuous consumption is over  it's all about intangibles now i saw that wasn't that interesting it was but that is why this is  and so people are now buying convenient like it's time you realize that is the most important thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you can't get more of you can always get more money you can always you know but you can't get

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  more time but i don't think that's it exactly um you mentioned we're addicted to convenience  we're addicted to addiction that's true too understand it yeah we're we're not we're not  robots who are trying to uh extract the maximum value out of every minute we're looking for things  that feel good yes we buy an iphone because it feels good when you use uh the amazon echo and you  ask it ask so-and-so a question and you get an answer back or you get a result you get a timer  you get something delivered or that or an uber comes or whatever it's not that you've done  something efficient it's that you've done something that releases dopamine into your brain  and you're sitting there going oh my god that feels so good we're all rats pressing the bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that gives us the food pellet that's it exactly that's it exactly oh that's even scarier  because what we haven't talked about we've talked about the how these make sense for amazon  this is good business for amazon we haven't talked about is the consequence to american consumers  which is ultimately that one company dominates economic activity and i i in my gut that tells

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  me that can't be good yeah no i mean people are already upset with amazon for a variety of reasons  and things like dynamic pricing of groceries are really going to piss people off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah but they still shop i mean you know there's all sorts of reasons you can hate amazon but just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah it's not slowing their business down any well actually so this will get into my pick so  this week's pick talks about some of this okay well save it you want to save it i will save it  or it's up to you this way people listen all the way to the end so we talk a lot about big data and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we talk a lot about how we can use big data and so forth but really i think like you actually  nailed it the whole reason that you put you you you collect data you put data in you you computerize  stuff you put stuff online is because it's easier than to gamify and it's easier than to  maximize the pleasure principle and and and and and and win by addicting people to your stuff  i mean yes uh somebody was talking about we i heard a great interview that we're trying to  get him on triangulation a guy who's talking about addiction internet addiction addiction he said look  at world of warcraft what did blizzard learn from world of warcraft well they have all this data on  how much time people spend in the game how much time they spend doing different things  and then they can optimize it what they found for instance was that people love to raid but what  they love about rating is loot so they made sure that all the raids provided a maximum amount of  loot in other words they can tune the game in real time because of the data they're getting to make  it more addictive and he said in many ways world of warcraft is an example of how addictive this  stuff can be so addictive people didn't eat they didn't sleep one guy in korea never went to the  bathroom it was for for days uh how long does that how does that work i think he died oh yeah  now maybe this is a pocketful story probably is but but i think it sounds it rings true because  you know people have done this and there are world of war there are places people can go to get off  world of warcraft um and and so but that's only because blizzard was able to gamify make it so  addictive so compelling and is is that ultimately what amazon's trying to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yes absolutely that's what everybody's trying to do and it's it's a scary thing i mean basically  we are as individuals in a long-standing battle between things that are distracting and addictive  and our own biology and our own biology is not evolving very quickly and everybody else all these  companies are trying to figure out how to get our attention get our dollars get our time get our  activity and you see this in all industries you see it the food industry look the fast food industry  the people who invent the latest jack-in-the-box burger sensation are scientists who have  they're doing experiments with people to see what is the food combinations of salt sugar and whatever  that will get people to just eat no matter what and so the food keeps getting more addictive the tv  shows keep getting more addictive and with the application of big data and ai like you say leo  this is going to be this is a serious problem that we we really have to figure out how to  not be those rats in in this endless experiment on the other hand and this i'm paraphrasing  something from dilbert the pellets are excellent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  john gave me this part of the group part of the confetti that came down during the john waters  us and then them concert resist and in fact that's what a lot of john roger waters stuff is is you  know comes from neil postman's you know what is it called addicted to amusing ourselves amusing  ourselves to death and neil postman recognized this decades ago yeah and it was with television  ultimately but but television was just the beginning of this yeah absolutely i mean we

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  were so innocent then yeah one of his theses is was that people used to complain that that  television news is too much like entertainment and his point was no it's television it's  entertainment it shouldn't try to be substantive because it's television it's got it's got to be  just pure entertainment and we should never take television news seriously as a source of information  that seems like you know when you when you look at today's fake news and the algorithm yeah we just  those are the days when when when cable tv was was the big threat amusing ourselves to death came

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  out in 1985 and we we're now living here we are 30 years later living that for sure isn't that tim

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wu has a book out a relatively new book out yes the attention merchants it's excellent excellent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yes we interviewed tim on triangulation and the same idea yes he says that's how the advertising  industry began and uh and it's yeah uh but what but what has changed is computers digital  information big data the ability to gather data and then churn it in a way that you can be so  effective in doing this um so now we took something very positive amazon buying whole foods and we  made it a grim dark future for us all our dystopian fantasy i don't mind you know maybe is is it  possible that jeff bezos he's a smart guy he's read this book it says but i'm going to make sure  that yes even though i control all economic activity i'm going to do it to the benefit of  humankind i think he's well this is he acts that way this is a libertarian this is a libertarian

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sort of viewpoint a libertarian streak that runs through all of technology which is just like you  tell me that i'm responding to all these things are addictive um so what you're saying is that  that all this technology is being applied to serving every desire that i have and giving  me exactly what i want that's the problem right i mean that's kind of jeff bezos problem issue  with you know he talks about undercutting on pricing and stuff like that he's like hey  people come to amazon because because they save a lot of money on books because the fast delivery  we're giving people what they want and we're benefiting literacy and i don't know if you if  he read that book about the addictive nature of all of this but he certainly sold most of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah yeah in fact where did i go to buy a copy damn you jeff bezos it's a really it's a really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  interesting world we're living in because what you have i think is a few very smart people  who saw this and i i think must have maybe they did it instinctively without you know explicitly  thinking or maybe not bezo strikes me is the kind of guy who he was a hedge fund manager  who suddenly kind of a light went on he said you know what's going to happen with all this we're  going to have perfect data and we're going to be able to use it to make customers perfectly happy  and we are going to grab a piece of all economic activity and that means he's already infinitely  rich i don't know what you could do unless that that's you know his well you read a shareholder  that's his food pellet right what yeah tell me about that because he this was a good thing right  oh the shareholder people were saying good things about it yeah well his his i his big thing was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like talking about how amazon needs to grow i mean it was it was about going after billion dollar  markets not small markets and i'm trying to remember the other big things the thing that  struck me was the the big markets so there was not like a super good thing he says this is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  question he got at an all hands jeff what does a day two look like that's a question i got at our  most recent all hands meeting oh that's right i've been reminding people that it's day one it's been  day one for a couple of decades i work in an amazon building named day one so he he obviously  was thinking about this and when i moved buildings i took the name when they i spent time thinking  about this topic day two is stasis followed by irrelevance followed by excruciating painful  decline followed by death and that is why it is always day one so right so and then he goes on  to talk about true customer obsessions and i think he's at he says by far obsessive customer  focus is the most protective of day one vitality staying in day one requires you to experiment  patiently we've talked about all of these things that are doing are very experimental accept  failures plant seeds protect saplings and double down when you see customer delight a customer  obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen so customer obsessed now  you might might say well that what that really means is obsessed with uh dopamine with with  generating the maximum dopamine in our customers so just another word way of saying the same exact

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing yeah um i mean how do you get people to do something different uh whatever the biochemical  uh process is is not really as concerning he's interested in the behavior and i think you know  stacy's too young to to remember that amazon started all of this i mean i remember um close  to 20 years ago amazon was the first company to do algorithmic recommendations with books and  basically what they did as i understood at the time is they see that you bought a whole bunch  of books and they see other people who bought the same group of books and some books you didn't buy  so they recommend to you the books you didn't buy and i remember you know in 2000 or whenever this  was that i was learning that amazon was doing this as a matter of course it was a mindblower  like wow that is brilliant that's amazing well that's what all business now is based on  that simple principle although it's just getting a lot more um a lot more sophisticated and a lot  more focused and a lot more areas and ones that are less easy to uh to sort of gamify i guess than  than books but but i really i really do think that jeff bezos everybody says yeah he's a genius and  all that stuff he has his own space program he owns the washington post all that stuff but he really  is i think one of the most brilliant and most importantly disciplined and focused uh tech  ceos in the industry he's really really really smart and really really ambitious yeah read the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  shareholder letter because that if you wonder how conscious is it is it instinctive is it planned  if you wonder that you will read this or dogfight which was a fabulous book about amazon  um you will see immediately that this guy is knows exactly what he's doing yeah and sees  you know as as the great ceo tech ceos have sees farther ahead than mere mortals and and really is  is playing the game way in the future um he talks about uh he says day two companies make high  quality decisions but they make them slowly if you want to be you know keep the energy and dynamism  of day one somehow you got to make high quality high velocity decisions that's easy for startups  very challenging for large organizations so he's really this is this letter he's he's giving you a  peek under the hood of how of how he's doing what he's doing he says we use machine learning yeah  there's you know obvious visible ways but really what machine learning is doing for us is making  our operations more efficient period you know uh in ways that are kind of more invisible good  inventors and designers deeply understand their customer they spend tremendous energy developing  that intuition they study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you'll  find on surveys he's arguing against focus groups and things like that they live with the design  you know that that could be steve jobs talking right there yeah dog fooding really this this  shareholder letter was very interesting i'm glad you brought it up because this was last month and  we didn't really spend any time with it and i think that this is really interesting  thank you let's take a break come back we'll talk more amazon just one of the many topics we can  cover on the show because this show has no portfolio we just talk about whatever the hell  we want to talk about you're gonna say this show has no point but i'm looking over your shoulder  stacy at a book called consent of the networked oh yes that's rebecca mckinnon from a couple years  ago yeah good book good good stuff see she's smart we got smart people this show is our  smartest show bring in the smartest people mike elgin is also here uh his his new enterprise that  he's doing with his wife amira is really cool it's gastronomad.net yes and uh the idea is to  really i think to finance your desire to travel and exactly and really build it on amira's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cooking yes exactly that and give us an excuse to find geniuses in the food space in all these  different cities our first one's in barcelona we saw four spots open oh good barcelona yeah yeah  and so there's uh so so step right up that's coming up september 12th through 17th do you  have any tech components to that mike not really um okay other than other than the fact that we  do a lot of the um the booking and uh and sort of the interaction and things like that but but  it's really for the most part so far it's a very low tech thing we find geniuses who are doing  visionary things uh and who are good uh good at at teaching um and and uh that sort of thing who  are visionaries in terms of making cheese or whatever it is and then we are just going to  spend some quality time with those people uh just serially every day we're going to be um just doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  awesome food stuff uh in each place so see this is an example of experience right uh exactly that  if amazon takes all the economic activity well what's left providing amazing experiences and  and just like that article that you read stacy that's the new conspicuous consumption is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  buying goods it's experiences and you know what's fascinating about this and i i learned this  fairly recently this whole idea of the experience economy which is a big big deal right now  this was actually foreseen by um in in the book future shock um uh alvin alvin topler yeah yeah  1971 alvin topler uh said what there would arise what would arise is something called an  experiential industry interesting and uh you know he he predicted the whole thing and what he didn't  predict was the degree to which uh the experience industry is being driven by instagram and social  media so one of the takeaways that people get from doing amazing things is the photos they take of  themselves doing it and uh and this is a this is incredibly um and and i think that's it's but  it's especially relevant today because today is national selfie day and um uh i like to look at  this um this experiential economy as essentially being the selfie economy it's it's selfie driven  it's it's photo and social media sharing driven behavior uh where people want to experience all  these amazing things and yes they want to experience it they want to be there in real life  but the thing that they take away instead of buying something they take away the social media  reputation the the sort of like the the the success theater on facebook instagram and all the other  social networks and so these things are all connected social media selfies and the experience  economy and it's a multi i think it's going to become a multi-trillion dollar economy well you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know what's interesting is if you've used any if you've been to a store like somebody in the  chat room saying last time i went to a sneaker shop in a mall the employees kind of ignored me  they didn't really care nobody cared like was a terrible experience and i think we're all  experiencing that lately uh that uh retail brick and mortar uh a service economy is deteriorating  so just which just gives a bigger opening uh for this for this transition we are you know that's  that's really what this show is about if you're going to pick something the show is about it's  about how our how the world is changing our technology is changing this world and it's  changing it dramatically and sometimes like a frog in a pot of boiling water you don't or water about  to boil you don't really notice it's good to get out of the water and look around and say wow there's  things are really there's a shift happening no but you may not jump back in well let's hope you don't  actually let's hope you don't and it doesn't matter if somebody's saying yeah like anybody  cares for you cares about you on amazon that's not the point and of course they don't care about you  but they've created about your money they but they've created a system that takes care of you  that's all that matters it feels like they care about it doesn't matter to me if they care about  me as long as i get taken care of yeah yeah yep our show today brought to you by legal zoom here's  somebody's going to take care of your legal needs in order to run your own business i could tell you  this from deep experience attention to detail is critical you mess up a contract one legal  misunderstanding and boom and the law is tricky the law is full of pitfalls and snares and loopholes  but fortunately you're not alone there's legal zoom over a million americans and i include myself  have used legal zoom we've used the legal zoom for our wills i use legal zoom to incorporate  or llc twit uh trademark stuff this is how i started twit but legal zoom services go well  beyond business formation they have a nation this is something relatively new they didn't have this  when i used legal zoom 12 years ago to start twit they have now built a nationwide network of  independent attorneys so you can actually talk to an attorney and get legal answers to the day-to-day  questions you have about your business legal zoom is not a law firm though understand that  but it but what they've done is they have without being billed by the hour they've set you up with  the kind of legal help you need from both both human help and and and of course the traditional  legal zoom forms and documents and all that stuff things like trademark employment law lease  agreements they're not designed by humans they're designed by lawyers and sometimes you need a lawyer  up but you can lawyer up with legal zoom without being billed by the hour because they're not a  law firm go to legalzoom.com today and be sure to enter the code twig in the referral box you'll  get special savings at legalzoom.com legalzoom.com don't forget the offer code twig and we thank them  not only for making the podcast possible but for making twit possible i love that phrase lawyer up  i don't know why but it just you know let's lawyer up here all right i don't know if mike's passed  out or disappeared or maybe just decided to run and get a beer but we probably in in france it is

Transcript:  so um you just got back from costa rica was that wonderful it was it was an experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one of where i did not take a lot of selfies so yeah i like going places where you can't get  online i i really like yourself though the amazon whole foods thing did pop through yeah but for the  most part i was offline in costa rica the food has improved tremendously since i was last there  15 years ago so i was really excited it's like yeah you can't be i think people realize you cannot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be a tourist destination without having good food that's another thing that's changed hasn't it  yes yes absolutely so did you go off and get a little glass of wine there uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mike or it's exactly what i did rose it's it's it's not a particularly elegant glass but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's a lot but no well that's that's a disguise see i had my husband bring me a topo because i  was like oh all this discussion is parched you know you mentioned the the food and the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  connection i mean we talked about this uh on on twit a couple weeks ago but when we went out into  the sara in morocco and um that was exactly the combination zero internet connectivity  an amazing food and these were these were desert um uh you know snowmads basically providing all  these services and they were actually able to get an internet connection from the top of a nearby  dune but we didn't have any internet connectivity and and you're right leo it was really fantastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i saw that picture you had of your guide holding his phone or his ipad i think it was up like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so he could get a little connection yeah and it was it was just barely squeaking but but i remember  when when airplanes business travel was a respite from you know nobody can reach me you know for the  next six hours and those days are gone so now we have to work harder and harder to find a place  where we simply can't be reached and it is a luxury yeah it's also painful as hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and lisa and i are both saying i can't wait to get back to the internet so it's one of those things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  where you know i noticed that i noticed you posted all these 360 videos after you got back oh yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because i couldn't there's nothing i could do with them yeah yeah and i you know i used a  microsoft tool which i'd never used before but uh mary joe foley on windows weekly had used it and  really to good effect on her travels so i was looking for some way and i i'm going to use  google photos also because google photos has a way of making an album and the nice thing about  google photos is that i can i have given access to everybody in the family so everybody who has  pictures could put them in there then i can organize them in kind of a big family album  but i use this thing it's part of microsoft office called sway i don't know if microsoft  pump publishes or promotes this very much but it's a it's a presentation tool so on the left hand  side uh you know i'm putting together a slideshow with my pictures and text and then what comes out  of it is actually something you can embed in a website or you can share um and it's it's actually  a really great way to share um both text and experiences you know pictures and and video too  couldn't put 360s in it which i was a little disappointed because i would love to be able to  put 360s in it but this is what's nice that looks amazing what it works really well i'm but i you  know is this going to be online 20 years from now when i want to relive this i doubt it so i don't  know i you know i guess you have to print your photo book print a book i think that's what i'm  gonna do is put in google photos make a make a similar thing in google photos won't be quite as  elegant but i could at least print a book out of it and then i'll have the book but it was kind of  fun and i thought if i do this i wanted to do it while i was on the trip so i would remember  everything but if i do this soon enough because i never do that i always think i'm gonna do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i never do this is that seal i'm sorry leo but this is an important question is that seal like  about to eat a penguin or is it yelling at a penguin okay this is my favorite you picked my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  favorite picture so we're sailing around this little rock on a zodiac boat a little rubber this  is the Galapagos in a rubber zodiac boat and the guide says oh look that seal is doing something  so this seal these are this is a sea lion it's california california sea lions exactly the same  as we have in san francisco which is weird and the bird on the right is what is something unique to  the galapagos called a flightless cormorant it's the only cormorant that doesn't fly it turns out  it could fish perfectly well and the smaller its wings the better it fishes so it just doesn't fly  has little wings and the flightless cormorant is sintering on the rock and the seal has decided no  no that's my spot so he's literally yelling at him at least actually on her website i should show  you that has the whole sequence so he's trying to he's using a dominance uh you know technique  that works great with other sea lions to convince to convince get off my rock but it but the cormorant  going what the hell you talking about so lisa lisa got the picture beauty i really got uh we're both  standing next to each other in the boat and i was so mad because i came home i said i got the best  picture ever and then she said oh yeah i got that picture too and hers is better because it's got  sea spray in it but anyway isn't that funny but uh so the seal ended up yelling and yelling  stopped yelling and eventually just laid down next to the cormorant he's in okay fine i'll share  so i think this is a lesson for us all isn't it you know a little less yelling a little more just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  co-existing accepting except sorry i know you were making another point but i know no no but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's the power that's the power of the sway right it grabs it i'll try to evolve we should all try  to evolve we should all just get along and i figure i could probably sell this picture for  a stock photos because i'm sure there's plenty of people using a presentation like stop yelling and  start listening and i mean i just think there's there's opportunities but i probably won't it's  just just going to be up on this on the sway but yeah that was a it's a it's a photo photographic  delight i'll tell you you have you been to the galapagos i haven't yeah i have not oh it's so  much fun i haven't even been to costa rica yet i want to i haven't been to costa rica either i'd

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like to go there i've been to every other central american country except for costa rica and panama

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but um it's definitely on the list yeah yeah we had a wonderful time it's the galapagos is pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or it works great you're a smart man anyway yeah i was pleased that mike this is a microsoft tool  but it has that big problem which is is hosted by microsoft it's on microsoft site it like any  product is you know google products too if they decide not to support it then all of this work is  for not but at least for now it's something you can you can do there's that's a tip there's a  little tool a little tip for you sway.com it's free but not so good if you're not if you have  no internet connectivity because it's you know you there's nothing you can do offline with it  you just have to you have to be online uh austin had a little uh as we've talked about before fight  with the folks at lyft and uber and i know the motto is don't mess with texas  but it turns out if you mess with texas and you have enough money and enough legislators in your  pocket you can win uber and lyft went around they did the old texas reach around and  oh my god  and spent i don't think that's what it is i do not think that means what you think it means  uh they spent two and a two and a half million dollars 40 lobbyists and they got the state  legislature to overturn right isn't that what they did well okay so there's a couple things here yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that did happen they spent nine i think it was nine million our mayoral

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and then there was a proposition right that they wanted that was the one i spent prop one they  wanted to overturn so by the way the way they did it was sleazy as hell because what they said in  the campaign against proposition one was a ballot initiative uh was oh no fingerprinting is fine but  who pays for that are you going to pay for that and austin never said that taxpayers would pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for it okay this is why they got voted this is why that was voted down it's because austin was  so pissed at the amount of money they spent the way they ran the campaign and the fact that they  were like just they had written their legislation and austin was trying to compromise with them and  they were like nope this is what we want and we're going to fight for it at issue was the right to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to fingerprint and do background checks on on uber and lyft drivers right and over and lift said no  for reasons i don't fully understand why wouldn't you want background checks on your drivers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because it costs money and it creates friction and friction is bad for web-based businesses trying  to move things in the real world kind of get the feeling that they want to hire drivers that might  not pass a background check i think they just don't want to worry about it and they don't want to be  responsible for it like the more responsibility and this was it austin when they did it was a  uh a test case for them this was a big deal for them they were like gonna prove that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they could win they had to do that because i mean obviously 10 million dollars is more than the  fingerprinting would have cost this was this was more a print on principle yes so but what so the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  texas legislature came in and what they did was so first we should say prop one failed uber and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  lift both said if prop one fails we're out of here and so at south by there was no uber there was no  lift there were only local ride sharing companies and the local taxi companies yes so what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now is they went to the texas legislature and the texas legislature hates austin because we are a  bastion of liberalism and people's republic of austin yes and in austin was already the  legislature was pissy at us and you know inner city houston and some other places for declaring  themselves sanctuary cities and so and they're mad at us for a bunch of other things and so  finally they were like you know what we're gonna override local legislations and that's the rule  that passed in the legislature is basically like i mean you hear the republicans and they're all  about quote unquote states rights and blah blah blah well they basically kind of did that to austin  and declared that the state gets to decide some of our governance issues  not a fan yeah so uber and lifter back we're back they're back well let's see if lift is back uber  is back you know and uber you know we still had uber eats in town so they never like abandon it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  totally but yes well you know who's not back travis kalinick  yeah that's the other big story of the week which broke yesterday i had read while we were away that  travis was going to take a leave of absence of a few months while they got it together because jeff  holder who was investigating all these allegations really susan fowler can take credit  for ousting kalinick i think i mean is he really ousted he's well at first he was on a leave  of absence now he says i resign he says the board he's still the chairman of the board  and the biggest shareholder he did say though that the board would basically forced him out  but that means he's not there for day-to-day operations right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  correct he basically he if you follow hbo silicon valley he just did what gavin newson just did  uh he called uh gavin gavin belson i'm leaving belson yeah gavin belson yes gavin newson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he's lieutenant governor of california similar name though i don't know if that's a future

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  governor in future yeah he he got on an airplane and went to debet or something but he's still  he's still pretty much in charge of the company more or less he's just got a better life because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he doesn't have to show up for work every day well this can happen though if you're a publicly held  company uh or you've got an independent board uber is not publicly held but if you've got an  independent board they can force you out so even though he founded the company uh and you know i  think get some credit for building a behemoth a unicorn even though it never makes any money  yeah it turns out it was the investors on tuesday yesterday five of uber's major investors according  to new york times demanded the calinic resign immediately that includes benchmark capital  um and uh they deliver this letter and even even though you're the founder and the ceo  you can't you can't ignore that and so uh he he's after long discussions with some of the investors

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the times right he agreed to step down so let me ask you a high level question leo which is that  they entered this space they wanted to disrupt essentially the taxi industry and in the long term  the car ownership idea uh by providing this uh model whereby there would be an app driven  uh flexible employment based ride sharing service thing uh and they're going up against you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  transportation giants big taxi companies incumbents incumbents that's the word you hate if you're a  startup is the guys who are already there and don't want to be disrupted and in order to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the uh uber basically their their approach to dealing with that fact is just to be bare knuckles  lie cheat steal be a bunch of jerks abrasive brush off the law brush off whatever  track people i mean just they they were just a hardcore company and you can make the argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they had to be because they were fighting taxi medallion owners and the that is a question would  they have succeeded if they would have played nice oh no no i think they had to be uh no i mean look

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at what happened with juno which was the hey let's be nice to drivers let's follow the laws they just  got bought by somebody i don't even remember them who are they juno it was a ride sharing  yeah ride sharing it was in in new york city mostly but this was also a very competitive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  space right so it wasn't merely that you're fighting the taxi commission you're also  fighting lift and juno and everybody else but he did i mean i don't so i don't know enough about  the inside to know if he created the bro culture that was such a problem but oh yeah dude he is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he was such a libertarian bro dude i mean did you read the memo that he had sent out about like  hey don't have sex with your co-workers please you know don't vomit in the yeah he had party rules  uber's party rules i mean i've worked for startups and it's really easy and i've worked for good  people and i've worked for bad people and i had a boss who would you know have meetings at strip  clubs and show people porn on their phone and that was a very different environment than  you know not good oh who was who was just a stellar person who like when someone said something  stupid he just turned to them and be like that's dumb get out of here good for ohm we're talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about giga ohm and ohm malloc of course uh this is the this letter came out in 2013 it's called  the miami letter a saucy rule book this is from recode for the 400 employees at the company who  were headed to florida's shore club for what was a party-focused celebration of the car hailing  company's success titled urgent urgent this is all in caps read this now or else you better read  this or i will kick your ass says travis kalinick four years ago um have a great effing time this is  a celebration miami's transportation sucks but i have to i have to bowdlerize it so i can he says  there's a 200 dollar puke charge if you vomit uh no throwing beer kegs off buildings uh  no fornication it says do not have sex with another employee unless  a you have asked that person for that privilege and they've responded with an emphatic yes i will  have sex with you that's that's good advice and b the two or more of you do not work in the same  chain of command yes that means travis will be celibate on this trip hashtag ceo life

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hashtag fml boy that is bro culture wow see i mean like that's that's that's not a memo that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he said he was proud of the letter and spoke to his team about it often  yeah he's a douchebag okay so you can fairly blame him for the culture yeah and and and it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  has to be you know to follow up on my previous question there's no there's no business benefit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to that kind of stuff well sexism maybe not but maybe there is because well for instance if you  lead a sales team of of young guys as as i think you both know that's the kind of thing that works  with them to get them pumped and motivated and rah rah and if you've ever been to a sales meeting  Mike you're an editor in chief you know what those meetings are like sales team young guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i mean well that's right that's changed fortunately i think yeah and so i i think that  you know if he was a visionary if he was jeff bezos and calculated that you need to be bare  knuckles and really push the limits in terms of laws and in terms of unions in terms of all the  rest that's one thing this is a guy who's kind of out of control who's kind of like  is doing lots of things and saying lots of things and creating a culture that is not conducive to  long-term success now i i know lots and lots of companies that started out like this they're  clueless geeks they don't really understand they they don't have a lot of experience  interacting with the opposite sex if you just add a college you're 22 years old  or whatever but they change but before they get as you know uber is like a social media platform  before they get as you know uber is like a super unicorn they're a deca corn or whatever it is  you know before they get anywhere near that big they have to change and become a company that  that respects people and has a fundamental decency about them and has a certain level  of professionalism about them you know you know i'm talking to you know when you transition from  a 10 person shop to a 20 person shop by the time you get to that 20 person shop you should not be  talking like a frat boy anymore this is a huge problem his investors let that happen and part of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the reason they let that happen is because this is a silicon valley is both a male dominated and  also a really youthful culture right so i mean even i when i was younger i mean okay some of this i  would not have responded but you know i'd be like yeah party and now you know i'm like oh i i can't  believe i even sent some of those emails or talked to people like that who were my bosses i'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what you know we had a really good triangulation i actually wasn't the hostess when i was on vacation  but i i just listened to it uh on june 5th with a guy rus larroway who runs a company really it's  kind of a he does a podcast uh and runs a company called candor incorporated it's a management  training company but it's was it's well worth a listen because one he's talking about he started  out at the age of 22 he was a second lieutenant in the marine corps and which meant he says i was in  charge of 14 guys and he learned lessons of leading which which by the way he probably one of the  temptations would be like be that rah rah you know guy put a bag on it it's okay if you don't get  caught kind of guy but he didn't and the marine corps encouraged him not to be and he learned  leadership lessons then went on to google and learned more leaders and that i think well-run  companies and the marine corps is very well run has to be or wouldn't succeed as a military  operation learn that there are ways that are successful to run groups of organizations of  people and ways that are not successful we listened to the interview because it's really  interesting and it taught me what a lousy manager i am but uh yeah it's it's it's so you might say  oh it's you know that's how uber was you don't like it don't work there um but i think it's  not good business and i think the board is right and i think the investors are right to say that's  not going to be good in the long run that's not how you manage you can't manage a team that way  it won't work well they didn't wake up to that yes they took their time and that's why travis  calinek is on the beach it's a very nice beach yeah girls and straight bikinis giving him  margaritas but it's not the beach that the investors want him to be on and it really it  all started with this and i have to give credit to susan j faller and you know i was just looking  at this this was in february this was only four months ago she wrote this blog post about her  treatment and isn't this really wasn't this the the you know the the trump straw that broke was  even more than that it was the straw that broke but it was also the thing that woke everybody up  and they said this cannot continue that's when they hired jeffrey holder they began the investigation  that's when ariana huffington got involved uh people people mocked susan faller i think we  talked about this when it came up we just absolutely did not mock her in fact we said  what a big problem this was for uber i don't think anybody expected that this would topple  travis kalanick but it did no question in my mind this did and rightly so yeah can uber be saved who  do you i mean yes it's on i mean millions of people use it it's a great it's a great business  well is it it's not profitable yeah that's interesting i mean really the reason people  reason is a dekakorn is not because of the of the the ride sharing business but the future of  autonomous vehicles although they're having trouble there right they had to fire levandowski

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because he stole intellectual property from google but but in general i think the the the the smart  money is on the future of transportation is that the majority of people in most especially in cities  will will conjure up a self-driving car with an app and it will take them wherever and it'll it  should be very efficient and cost-effective it should transform human culture in all kinds of  positive ways we can transform all these parking lots can go away so many good things can happen  out of this and uber is right there on the most direct trajectory toward that future  and so they should whether they're profitable today or not they should be on their way to  becoming the future of individual personal transportation and i think they can be saved  but it's going to be it's going to require radical cultural change they're going to have to do more  than they're already doing more than just getting rid of calinic more than adding more women to the  board but it can and should be saved and look nobody's on the right track really with self-driving  cars it's it's an open field anybody could own this future but but i think what we do know is  that it looks a lot like uber minus the driver well but that's right so people are talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that somebody the chairman says uber has a three years runway that means they have enough cash to  survive at their current burn rate their current current cost for three more years but all they  have to really do is get to the point where they can get rid of drivers because that yeah right i  mean is that why they lose money because the drivers they don't pay drivers that well i don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know what maybe it's their lobbying expenses yeah there's a slight difference between what people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  are willing to pay and what it costs to make them profitable it's a pretty slight difference  all those dynamics could change in the future if people are not buying if the drivers are not  buying gasoline for example they're driving electric cars if right you know all kinds of  things you know who knows what will happen with inflation or whatever i mean they're they're in  the ballpark of being a thriving profitable business and you know if i were them three years  runway is it's probably two two more years and they really need at this point you don't know  what's going to happen in the future but they're they should be on their way to to succeeding it  looks to me like i think that i think this reputation they're getting is probably the  best thing that ever happened to lift and and it could be there could be a swap i mean usually  the companies that are the first movers in any sort of industry are the ones you never have heard  about later on it's the latecomers that come in and take over and and really succeed so you know  who knows and really ultimately who cares if uber as a company is the one that dominates the future  of personal transportation what matters is the model what matters is the is the idea that that  you don't have to own a car that self-driving cars can run around and improve safety and all  the rest that's really what matters i really mean whether it self lives or dies i mean i don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why anybody would care i would say the vision is it matters it's figuring out the right metric to  measure for success for self-driving cars because we don't actually we understand the profit and  loss drivers for a taxi business we understand what network effects do for an online internet  business what we don't know is how we're going to measure like what are the defining metrics for  getting people to get in your self-driving cars and pay you money like is it going to be you know  is gas going to be the issue there's so many things is it electric cars is it going to be  you know the capital costs of buying x number of vehicles to cover a city what does that even look  like who gets the best is it going to be in your algorithms that help you allocate those cars most  efficiently like to me there there are so many unknowns right now because we're in an inflection  point not just around the technology itself like the self-driving cars but also how we're going to  power those cars how we're going to build the data to drive the cars to where they need to be i mean  that's what makes it exciting and also terrifying according to the financial

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  go ahead i'm sorry go ahead leo according to the financial time according to the financial now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's enough latency that we're like alphonse uh according to the financial times uh uber passengers  only pay about 41 percent of the cost of their trips wow that's ridiculous so that's why uber  doesn't make money they're subsidizing almost 60 percent of the ride and yet uber's not cheap  uber's more than a taxi why is uber so much no it's not no no it's not more than a taxi oh i thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was well it i i don't know where your day's taxis it depends depends yeah isn't this conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  very interesting it's almost like the conversation we had about amazon but 10 years before right  yeah uh uber's trying to do to transportation what amazon's trying to do to grocery stores you know  it's screw them basically no provide the so much convenience that customers just say uber uber uber  i mean at this point uber is cheap enough that i told my daughter you don't need a car it's cheaper  for me you know to not buy you a car pay for gas and pay for insurance it's cheaper for me to pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for your uber rides yeah and and i tell you as somebody i mean we travel all over the world and  we go to places where there is no uber and we go to places where there is an uber and when we travel  abroad of course we leave our we live our prius back in silicon valley but um we were sort of  entering into the future because we're living without car ownership essentially uh and it's  hell when there isn't uber or any sort of ride sharing service when we're in mexico city which  does have uber the uber i mean it's a godsend to to to to you'd be able to conjure up an uber  because mexico city is a is like a country it's it's a city that's so large that it's like a nation  right and you and it can be dangerous and you can find yourself on some dark street and there  aren't going to be taxis happening by whereas you can just call an uber they're there in two minutes  it's a brand new car in every case that we took um a courteous driver uh take you exactly where  you want to go cost nothing just fantastic and then we go to barcelona which has banned uh ubers  and now we're back we feel like you know we feel like the flintstones we're trying to find a taxi  we're you know trying to hail them oops they're full of people oh there's another one no they're  full of people i mean it's just it's it's barbaric really trying to deal with taxis when you go from  city to city and it's like no uber uber no uber uber you realize that the whole model of of uber  and lift is just vastly superior from from a convenience safety and every other standpoint  cost i mean it's just it's just fantastic but part of that is because they're subsidizing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right if you had to pay yeah uh the other 60 percent of that cost would you still think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  way i guess you would well in in cities like san francisco um i probably wouldn't want to  pay the full cost but i mean mexico city we i mean we went across the city and it was like a 45  minute drive that cost three bucks what i'd happily pay eight bucks yeah you know 10 bucks  12 yes i mean it's really nothing and and and so it really depends on on on the local economy you  know and in san francisco everything is way too expensive avocado toast is five bucks i mean it's  everything is way overpriced right and um i definitely don't want to pay the full price

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  where can you get avocado toast for five bucks because that's a great deal yeah right mexico
