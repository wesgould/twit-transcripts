It's time for Twig This Week in Google, the show that covers Google and cloud computing.  I want to be at great pains to mention that because occasionally something happens.  It's outside the Googleverse.  No, really?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google is Earth, Earth is Google, Google is life.  What is it they say about Frank Sinatra?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's Frank Sinatra's world, we just live in it.  It's Google's world, we just live in it.  That's Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.  He's both today, both impotent and incontinent, so that's exciting.  Thank you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the best intro I've ever had.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And if you're wondering why I said that, read Jeff's blog.  Jeff, I admire you.  I'm really glad you posted that because most of us guys are going to go, you know, it's  a very high percentage of eventually get prostate cancer.  Yeah, well, but it's good to raise awareness, I think.  So I applaud you for being so open.  Do you have second thoughts about that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I don't at all.  Not one bit.  The comments are the most gratifying part.  People coming in and saying nice things like that, but also sharing their experience with  prostate cancer or going off to get tested or, you know, that's the thing about online.  It's a chance always to coalesce.  And so you do something public and people coalesce around that.  That's the magic of the Internet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you have the conversation.  I was at Blog World and a couple of people came up to me and said, please thank Jeff  for that post.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Plus it was the best headline I ever could have written, the penis post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all about the male member.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  Thank you.  Gina Trapani may disagree actually on that.  Talk about a segue.  Gina Trapani, she's giggling now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a little embarrassed.  She's actually, she's turning bright red.  Aren't you cute?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I didn't eat boss today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You didn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina is the creator of Lifehacker, the poster at SmarterWear.org and of course, a great friend  of the show and of Google-ish stuff all over.  Hello.  Glad to have you on.  And a special guest today.  We've been trying to get Siva for practically since the show began.  So I'm so glad to get you on.  Now I'm going to try to say this right, Siva Vajanathan.  That's good.  Yay, I did it right.  He is the author of The Google-ization of Everything and you can find him at Google-izationofeverything.com.  And you're a professor.  Is that correct?  Yeah.  He professes.  Where do you profess?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  That's a good question.  No, actually, I'm at the University of Virginia and I'm in the Department of Media Studies.  I also do one of my classes in a law school.  But yeah, it's a really sweet place to work and it's been a nice couple years I've been  here after moving from New York.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One of these days, I'm going to get the two professors, Jeff Jarvis and Siva here, and  we'll do a show on the end of the university with Don Tapscott.  Yeah.  That's a very controversial subject.  I was talking to Don earlier this week and we practically started a firefight in the  chat room because we have a number of professors in the chat room.  And that's a good subject.  But we'll table that for the nonce because we've got to talk about Google.  And because Siva is here, I think we should talk about the Google book deal, which is  now apparently not a deal at all.  First of all, you got your wave invite yesterday.  Yeah.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  You know, late to the party.  Late to the party.  I have a good friend who was able to get me one.  Of course, I signed up to be on the list long ago when I first heard about it.  I'm very excited about the potential of it.  I mean, it's an amazing idea.  I know, I guess Gina has better observations than I do.  I've only been messing with it for a couple of hours.  So I mean, I have...  Gina's our resident expert.  Yeah, right.  So I'm just, I'm excited to be part of the club.  How's that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're now in the club and you're not late to the party because the party really hasn't  even started yet.  I mean, this is very early days.  It's true.  It hasn't.  It's not late at all.  It's still really early.  So, but we spend a lot of time talking about Wave and I appreciate it, by the way.  I want to thank you.  I wasn't here last week.  I want to thank you, Jeff Jarvis, for doing the show last week.  Did you mention Wave at all last week?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We forgot, didn't we, Gina?  I think I got a little bit in about Wave.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think I got in the, you know, one week in Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One week in Wave.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a new feature we now have.  Gina has inaugurated it.  Oh, good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This week in Wave.  Twil.  Twil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a very, very good show.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's like the confusion level from zero to ten.  Where is it this week?  Eight?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We could do that.  We could have red, orange, green and yellow.  We could have like a little, you know, home terror alert, home Wave alert.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  While you're on it, there's a great link on the FriendFeed feed to Samuel L. Jackson rides  Google Wave.  Yeah.  It's hilarious and it uses Wave to, uses Samuel L. Jackson lines from movies to demonstrate  the power of Wave.  It's not safe for listening around your kids in the family room, but it's hilarious.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I could play a little bit of it and we could just bleep it, but I think there wouldn't  be anything left if I did that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, there's plenty.  There's plenty there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's okay.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You kind of have to see it though, right?  Because it's like the Wave interface.  Yeah, it's visual.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  Unfortunately, it's been pulled off of YouTube by the rights holders, I guess.  Crap.  Yeah.  Well, but somebody told me that there's still, it's still showing somewhere else, but I get  this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Those damn right holders just have no fun.  I hate that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No sense of humor.  Copyright law.  For crying out loud.  What good is that?  This is the modern age.  We don't need copyright.  We've got Google.  So what happened to the Google Book Deal, Siva?  Was it the Department of Justice's brief that really kind of threw the whole thing  into the trash?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  That seems to be the inside story, the conventional wisdom anyway, that once the Justice Department  raised some very important questions, especially about competition, it just became too much  of a hassle to go through at this point, to go through in October.  I'm sure the parties hope that they can iron out some of the fairly big issues that the  Justice Department had with the agreement, but I'm doubtful that they can actually salvage  it and keep all the parties happy at this point.  To do it in time, at least to do it by November, I mean, look, no settlement is ever really  over.  They just ask the judge to keep deferring and deferring and deferring until they get  everything hammered out.  The Justice Department isn't the only party with an interest and a complaint.  You're still going to have to deal with the German government, the French government.  You're going to have to deal with the European Union.  You're going to have to deal with any number of other parties with issues.  You have to deal with potential competitors, Microsoft and Yahoo, for instance, or the  Internet Archive, which has major issues with the competitive advantage that this presents  to Google.  With all of that, it just seemed like this was one of those rare moments when Google  took a step beyond its foundation of trust out there.  It's been a very weird time.  It's been nearly four years building toward this moment.  When they announced the settlement, I think everybody was just blown away, first of all,  by how detailed and bold the settlement was.  I don't think anyone expected to have that level of detail come out quite so quickly.  Almost immediately, people started raising very serious issues about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was kind of the problem.  The settlement was between the Authors Guild, the publishers and Google, and there were  800 other parties that weren't really included, right?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Yeah.  There are two problems.  One is the micro-legal problem, which is that there are so many other parties with a stake  in the business and a stake in the culture that didn't really have a stake in the settlement.  That's problem number one.  Then there's the macro-policy problem, which is that this settlement essentially set up  a rights registry, which has two implications.  One is it's a formality in copyright law in practice.  Having a formality of that magnitude in copyright law in practice come out of a class action  suit and a settlement for a section suit, that's totally revolutionary.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, one of the DOJ's big complaints is this is making copyright law in a class action

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  lawsuit.  Exactly.  This is something Congress should have dealt with.  Here's the thing.  Google's major presence in DC now.  They've managed to actually assert themselves as a political actor.  They have important people listening to their interests.  They have a lot of money to throw around.  The old-fashioned way to get something changed in Washington or in the country is to make  a lot of donations and throw a lot of parties and take congressmen on junk kits and get  your lobbyists to write the bills that they send through.  Had they done it the old-fashioned way and actually tweaked the laws just enough to be  able to allow this sort of thing, it would have been kosher.  What you end up with by going through the courts, it ends up being a really troublesome process  in a completely different way.  In a way that's sort of more transparent but not quite democratic and certainly not in  line with how we usually make law and policy in this country.  Let's remember this was going to be, had it gone through, a revolutionary model for content  distribution and a huge change in how libraries operate and a huge change in the ways that  copyright actually works for printed materials.  All of this came out of a settlement among a very small group of people.  That's just not how we're supposed to make law in this country.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Siva, I think you would stipulate, Your Honor, that trying to get books digitized is a good  thing.  I'm curious to hear if you have a vision of how you think it should be done.  How can we get that done?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Oh yeah, sure, sure, sure.  The hard way and the expensive way.  How's that?  Look, this is a monumental task and the goal is something that has the potential of making  a tremendous difference in a lot of people's lives.  That's one of the reasons I think it's a great idea to get stuff accessible, to get stuff  preserved right.  Let's remember that Google has very little experience dealing with issues of preservation.  No experience dealing with issues of preservation.  Google has no real good record dealing with complex issues like metadata.  You have so many different quality issues on the way.  If you really want to do this, you have to step back and say, who's really on board?  I think we should say that most people would be on board.  If that's the case, let's figure out the best possible way to do it with the biggest  input, the biggest splash, focusing on preserving this archive for 50, 100, 200 years, not focusing  on delivering a handful of poorly scanned pages to people within 24 months.  I think that the priority has been on speed and size, which is how Google does everything.  That was Jeffrey Numburg's complaint.  Yeah, that was Jeffrey Numburg's complaint.  It's too important a project to leave to one company to do so quickly and frankly with  such low quality.  Who pays for that?  Well, we should actually pay for it.  If we want it, we should pay for it actually.  I mean, I don't think that's a wacky idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We as taxpayers, we as users.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  That's how I would prefer.  I would prefer if the Library of Congress took the lead coordinating a scanning and  indexing project by all the major university libraries in this country and some of the  major public libraries in this country.  We went about it systematically.  We agreed on a lot of the protocols like formats, like metadata, like the quality level of scans,  making sure that they're archive quality, making sure there is redundancy, making sure  that this project is something that stays with us and is not something that a company,  no matter what that company is, decides is not worth pursuing 10 years from now.  Let's be frank, companies change because the needs and pressures on companies change.  No matter what the company is, we don't know what it's going to be like in 10 years.  This should be a public project, not a private project.  Because the benefits are public and because the costs are public.  Right now what you have is essentially corporate welfare.  Essentially, you have all these public universities donating all their riches to a private company  which is then going to set up a commercial project through the libraries, in fact, and  with their benefit, with their goods, and with almost no direct benefit and actually  pretty high cost to the libraries, which they didn't expect.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Why shouldn't the publishers take a responsibility here rather than just complain about someone  who tried to fill a gap that was out there as they, like newspaper publishers, magazine  publishers, everyone else, just believed they were in Brigadoon.  They're going to benefit from this.  They have the first rights.  They have the means, I would think, to digitize easier.  They're going to benefit from it.  Shouldn't they be required to take a lead?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  No.  Well, look, publishers have been.  For more than 10 years, they've been digitizing their works.  They've been offering them in various forms.  They don't even need to digitize.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The works start digital these days.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Well, exactly.  Right.  They have been offering them in various forms, but they've been offering them as part of  library subscriptions.  They've been offering them to Amazon.  They've been offering them to Google for more than five years.  Publishers are on top of this and have been for more than 10 years.  There was no incentive to digitize the out-of-print material, certainly, and certainly no incentive  to digitize the works of the 20th century.  Isn't that what we really want?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the truth is that's the gold.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  In answer to Jeff's question, no publisher has an interest in doing that because the  reward per copy is so low.  Google has found an interest in doing it, and great.  I'm happy.  If they want to pursue doing this for their own means, let's do it, but let's not pretend  it's for the public.  That just makes me sick that when Sergey Brin writes in The Times that he's doing it to  make sure that the next time the Stanford Library gets in the flood, it's all about  preserving knowledge.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you think there's no?  Come on.  There can be some greater benefit.  If Google did only the things that were profitable, Google's mission to organize the world's  information and bring it to us, I think, yes, obviously that's how they make money and they'll  be the first to say it, but I also think there is a bit of a mission in it.  I don't think it was as cynical as you're trying to imply.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Well, if it weren't cynical, then it would have been more honest.  The fact is nowhere in that op-ed did he cop to the fact that this is a revenue-generating  project.  Nowhere.  You'd think that that would be important.  I was actually surprised that The New York Times gave away op-ed space for an advertisement  for a major corporation.  It was just a joke.  That's between me and Sergey.  He never calls, so he'll probably never hear.  But again, in answer to Jeff's question, look, every company should be doing what's in every  company's interest, and the publishers have been doing what's in their interest for a  long time.  The question is, from the publisher's point of view, who's going to pay for getting all  this stuff, much of which doesn't have an obvious rights holder anyway, right?  Much of which doesn't have a publisher to be attached to.  If we actually want a usable, comprehensive archive covering multiple languages, covering  every possible subject, organized and searched intelligently, there is a community of people  who are well-trained to do this and already paid to do this and are called librarians.  That's who should be taking the lead in terms of the nuts and bolts here.  That's who should be, because they're already committed to making such an archive happen,  making such a service happen.  Then why didn't they?  I mean, that's the thing.  Oh yeah, easy to answer, because they're uncoordinated and underfunded.  They're an undercoordinated political force, and they're underfunded at every level, right?  So if we actually cared about this, we should fund them.  That's basically what I've been arguing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's reasonable.  Do you think there's any political will to do that?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Yet, I'm hoping to generate it.  And I'm actually hoping that if, you know, one of the things we can learn from this,  if it fails, I mean, I go back and forth on whether I want the settlement to completely  collapse, right?  Because there's a lot of good in it too.  But one of the things that we might get out of this is this sense, a widespread sense  that we almost had a very usable service and it wasn't, we weren't able to push it through,  but they weren't able to push it through because this was not the way to do it.  And we might start asking, maybe there's a better way to do it.  And I'm not saying that my way to do it is the best way to do it.  I have a particular vision of how to do this.  It's something I wish we had started 15, 20 years ago.  I actually think step one is to bring all of the interested parties, public and private,  together to work on a 50-year project, because that's really what it's going to take to  do this right, to do it high quality, to do it globally, et cetera.  And I call it the Human Knowledge Project.  I want this to be done with the same sort of passion and commitment that the Human Genome  Project enjoyed at the end of the last century.  And that's a tremendous success.  Done of course as a supplement or a competition to a fast-moving, high-energy, brilliant private  company called Solara, which was essentially trying to do the same thing on the cheap and  fast.  And won?  I mean, won in the sense...  No, no.  It ended up being essentially a tie.  But both services are now very valuable to researchers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One has not destroyed the...  So maybe a private attempt with Google and a public effort as well?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Sure.  I mean, nothing wrong with that.  Google still has to deal with its lawsuit with the publishers, which is going to be  a whole other thing.  The publishers are always going to want a piece of whatever Google rolls out.  And until Google comes up with a system that guarantees the publishers some cut, then the  publishers are going to keep pushing on the lawsuits.  Jeff, I get the feeling you think...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't want to put words in your mouth, but that this is better than nothing.  It was kind of a necessary evil, if not Google Who.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I see this happening again and again and again, where Google sees an opportunity  in the market and seizes it.  And that's what happens in an open market.  And you have the incumbents whining about that.  But Google didn't do anything in the other cases, I think.  I think they overstepped the bounds on the book settlement.  And I'm not sure it was done as a cynical act.  I would argue that it was done as almost a naive act, which sounds silly when it comes  to Google.  But they just said, oh, everybody's going to love us for doing this, and didn't see  the opportunity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It doesn't sound silly.  I think what Google does looks naive.  And it sounds, Siva, it sounds like you see a lot more intent in what they're up to.  You don't buy the ingenuous act.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  No, I don't.  And I never do.  But I also know that...  I feel like they are naive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But obviously, they couldn't be.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  There has to be a certain level of naiveté in any company that takes risks like this,  because that's the leap of faith.  Right?  You have to have faith in what you do.  You have to have faith in your company.  And so you're going to be...  Look, Henry Ford thought he was making the world better, too.  Right?  Look at the damage he did.  Right?  But no one could look in Henry Ford's eyes and believe that he didn't believe every word  he said.  Right?  So, the bad and the good.  He thought he was making the world better.  So now that's not to equate Larry and Sergey with Henry Ford by any means.  But let's remember that to do all of that work, to raise all that cash, to put those  hours in, you've got to believe that you're doing it for more than the money.  But that's an internal thing.  What should matter to us is not what they believe.  What should matter to us is what happens in the real world.  What's right, yeah.  And I just don't think we need to be snowed by the pretty words that seem to outline what  they believe when in fact they're half-truths.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But let me ask you a hypothetical.  This wouldn't surprise me.  There is no political will to do this.  We're in a tough recession.  The government's already getting a lot of heat for the spending they're doing.  If public doesn't want to do it, would it be okay for Google to do it?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Not under the current laws, but I'll tell you what, if Google wanted to actually change  the current laws, maybe it could be.  So look, copyright is in the way.  And if Google wanted to change copyright, it should do it the hard way.  It should do it the hard way, the old-fashioned way, the way of old-fashioned American political  corruption.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what Larry Lessig says.  Don't break the law.  Change the law.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Well, in a way, yes.  But it's not just Google that would want to change the law.  Every librarian would be on Google's side changing law, too.  And I would, too.  Basically copyright law gets in the way of thinking this big.  Whether it would be the Library of Congress doing it, or Google doing it, or Yahoo doing  it, the law is still the law and the law is in the way and the law is dumb.  But to change it, you have to actually be political.  Regardless of whether you want to adopt my vision of a 50-year plan to connect the most  information to the most people in the world, the Human Knowledge Project, or you want to  do the quick and easy Google plan, either way, you have to change the law.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think maybe as an analogy of space exploration, which...  Oh, I'm sorry.  It needs to be done, right?  Siva, you paused.  It wasn't a pause.  It was a Skype pause.  So I didn't mean to interrupt you.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  A Skype burp.  Yeah, right.  Right, right.  So anyway, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to move on.  I think we could go on for hours on this and I think it's a great subject.  I'm really glad you're here to talk about it, Siva.  And I think I have to say I think I kind of support your advocacy of the public option.  You can now call it the public option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean...  That'll do wonders for us, Bill.  It's worked so well in the past.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  The question is, you know, look, do we want this?  If we want it, let's do it.  If we don't want it, let's not do it.  But it is a political thing.  It is a policy thing.  And let's not pretend that we should get something for nothing and hope that Google rides in  and gives us something for nothing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's probably not a hugely expensive thing to do in the scope of things.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  It really isn't.  It really isn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you have any idea?  Is it billions, trillions?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But only Google is willing to do it.  I mean, I think that's...  Only Google remains here.  Okay, no, no.  I go back to newspapers advertising.  That's not exactly true.  Google came in with new structures for advertising that took on risk, that provided pay for performance  to advertisers.  And the advertisers didn't leave to go to Google because Google is evil, but because  they got a better deal.  It's a competitive marketplace.  So Google sees opening to the marketplace and has the guts, as you would say, Siva,  to go in.  And they have the, if you want to call it naivete or vision or courage, whatever it  is.  I think that, I still believe that's something to be celebrated.  Did they overstep in this case because of copyright law?  Yes, I agree with you they did.  But I still think this is a worthy project on one way or the other.  If Google puts the pressure on government to do it, then that's a good in the end.  Let's keep the pressure on.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Yeah, as long as you do it the right way.  I mean, no, but look, Google wasn't the only party interested in doing this.  You can look back in the library literature 30 years and see a very articulated vision  of how to pursue this sort of project.  What they lacked in the libraries was the political support.  And that's because you and I were not rallying toward the support of libraries to do it.  Look, Google's boldness was wonderful, but one of the things that really shocked librarians  was the fact that they had been hoping to reach that level of coordination that it would  take and get the level of public support and it was never coming.  So Google took the place of the public.  Essentially, what you have here is public failure.  Now, in some ways, better Google than no one.  I understand that argument completely.  I'm sympathetic to it.  You know, look, better Walmart deliver the water than no one deliver the water after  Katrina, right?  But it doesn't make FEMA's failure any lighter that Walmart had to do it, right?  So that's essentially what we're in.  And what we need to do is ask ourselves, is this the real, the best way to build the information  ecosystem that we actually want children to benefit from in 50 years?  Do we know that Google will be around in 50 years, in 10 years?  Do we know that in five years, Google's board of directors will still think of Google Book  Search as a good bet?  You know, are they going to be...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we're in an age when we're not doing the best and the best was a bit of a myth  of the past.  We're in the age of good enough and the Internet makes it possible to do things just well enough  to make it work.  And so that's why things like paywalls don't work, because I can go to something else that's  good enough for me.  And we may not like that and it may kind of offend our academic view of perfection, but  I think that it's the true way the world operates is that vacuums get filled and they get filled  by good enough.  And what's a better tribute to that than Microsoft?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  It's not good enough if it's illegal, first of all, and it's not good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, nitpick.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well sometimes, you know, the illegal part is, I mean, this is for the greater good,  so maybe let's push those limits and maybe we can get those laws changed.  It is for the greater good, right?  Except if Google puts it.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's if, yeah, my vision of it is for the greater good rather than the  greater Google.  Yeah.  That line in your book.  It will be now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Was it structured in such a way so that if Google did say, oh, we don't want to do this  anymore, that data would not, would it not revert to the public and become a public available  database?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Not quite.  And it actually was a patchwork.  So one of the things that Google did with the libraries that were the source of this  was offer them digital copies of the materials they scanned from their libraries and they  would have ability to use that material within the institution itself, but not distribute  it beyond the institution and not distribute it in a way that would compete with Google  in any way.  So to a lot of universities, that seemed like a pretty good deal.  It was a way of getting their own material digitized.  What these universities didn't expect was, first of all, the low quality of the scans,  the number of missing pages, the number of human hands in the way, those sorts of things,  which has become a real challenge.  That's, I mean, that was one, that's actually a lesser problem.  The bigger problem was that in many cases, I know at my university, the university itself  is actually too scared to download the material to their own servers because that would be  contributing to potential copyright infringement.  Remember, universities shielded by this settlement.  Even if settlement goes through, universities are still potentially liable for taking part  in this and they are really upset about this and really scared about this because they've  been essentially left out of the deal.  And so that's one of the problems.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's ironic because I think that's one reason Yale decided to go with Microsoft instead  of Google for digitization.  But then Microsoft said, we're done.  We don't want to do that anymore.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Yeah, well, but Microsoft is working with the Internet Archive, which is a not for profit  institution and they also weren't doing any copyrighted material.  So that's how they kept themselves clean.  And of course, that leaves a lesser collection and it's a shame.  But that actually points out the fact that the copyright law is stupid and should be  changed for its own sake, not for Google's sake.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to commend Google for their bravery compared to Microsoft, at least to attempt  to open this can of worms.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Yeah, but then they check out and settle so they wouldn't even fight in court.  I mean, that was the other thing is like in the beginning, all the libraries were thinking,  well, this is great.  Google's going to go to the mat for people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  People were upset that they didn't fight for the fair use of this.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Exactly. I mean, I never expected them to go all the way because I thought they were  going to lose anyway and I thought they knew they would lose.  Really?  Really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because a lot of legal experts thought they had a good fair use case.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  I know.  And the funny thing is there are a bunch of people who are much smarter than me and who  teach at better law schools.  And the whole time I kept thinking, I was looking at the courts that were going to see  this case and the mood of those various courts.  And I just didn't see it stacked in Google's favor.  If this were a Ninth Circuit case, if this were a Northern California case, I think Google  had a really good chance of making a very creative argument because that's sort of the  style of the Ninth Circuit.  But this was a New York case.  This was a Second Circuit case.  And first Southern District of New York and then Second Circuit.  And then ultimately would have gone to the Supreme Court because you would have had,  over some very important foundational cases that actually let search engines be legal,  you would have had a discrepancy between the Ninth Circuit's vision of copyright and the  Second Circuit's vision of copyright.  It would have had to go to the Supreme Court.  And there is no reason to believe that the Supreme Court would have been anything close  to cool on copyright.  They haven't been for a number of years.  Sonia Sotomayor came from the Second Circuit.  She has no history of being particularly creative or even reasonable on copyright.  So I think actually losing Senator O'Connor was a big loss in terms of copyright because  she was very much a pragmatist.  And losing Souter was big too.  So I actually had no...  I mean, this was obviously long before I knew the court was going to change on this.  But really, I just looked at the odds and I said, this is sort of, you know, obviously  copying.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Steve, I hate to interrupt your thought there, but you're getting some breakup on your Skype.  And what usually fixes this is unplugging the headset and plugging it back in again.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Let me just make sure.  Yeah, it works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good.  Cool.  Cool.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Cool.  Cool.  Anyway, I've been ranting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was mud-sanALing Gina, I thought she was thingIng that!  All right, I'm going to move on because there are so many other topics.  This is a great topic, and Steve, I'm so glad you're here, but there are other things to  talk about includingëlaghrgyehr Ć needle farms, which is this is a really interesting  story.  But before we do that, I do want to talk about our friends at Citrix, the folks who do go-to-meeting-phoENatic.  It is, cause I've been doing a lot of traveling lately, and I'd much rather start бумf your  own business.  I'd much rather stay home than travel.  And go-to-meeting, that's exactly what it does.  It allows you to have those business meetings that you would be flying across the country  to do at great expense at home or at your office, wherever you are.  Go-to-meeting, you could try it right now if you want to.  Go to go-to-meeting.com slash twig and you could try it free for 30 days.  Go-to-meeting.com, press the join a meeting button.  Here's the meeting ID and boom, they're seeing your desktop.  They're seeing your PowerPoint or your keynote presentation.  They're seeing the documents that you're talking about.  They're seeing the spreadsheets, the drawings.  It's just a fantastic way to collaborate, to train, and of course to present.  Lot of sales happen through go-to-meeting.  If you haven't tried it, give it a try right now.  In fact, if you haven't tried it lately, give it a try right now.  It's faster and better and easier to use.  Go-to-meeting.com slash twig is the website for 30 days free.  The folks at Citrix, we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Remember that address.  Use no other.  Go-to-meeting.com slash twig.  I remember when Google changed its page rank algorithm or something.  People got all upset.  I guess it's when they started publishing page rank and people say, oh, no, my page  rank is lower.  My page rank is high.  And even then, I thought, this is kind of a silly metric.  Maybe Google thinks so too, because they've apparently dropped page rank from their webmaster  tools.  Gina, you haven't said a word in a while.  So would you explain what page rank is?  Are you there?  Uh-oh.  I can't hear you.  Is it me?  No wonder you haven't said a word in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's been muted.  We can see her.  She's waving.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you muted?  Did you press the?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, now I hear you.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  OK, now you hear me.  Sorry about that.  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, we thought you'd been awfully quiet.  Now I understand why.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I was letting Siva talk through the book thing, because clearly I drank Kool-Aid about the  book thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm actually glad to get some dissent about it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  I think it's great.  I was like, I love that op-ed.  I was glad that that's me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I love arguing with Siva.  It's so much fun losing.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I need a little more cynicism, I think.  Yeah.  But page rank.  So page rank is a number between 1 and 10, I believe, that Google would, over the years,  assign to sites to indicate how high they would show up in search results.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did it correlate directly to whether you'll be number one on the page or on the first  page?  Was there any direct correlation at all?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, not at all.  It was just a number between 1 and 10.  But if you search for a keyword, the higher your page rank, in theory, the higher you  would show up on the page.  But there could be hundreds of other sites who had the same exact page rank as your site.  And the algorithm behind it was totally opaque.  You had no idea why your page rank went up or down.  Things would change.  It would change.  People would freak out and get obsessed about it.  And frankly, I'm really glad that Google's saying, you know what?  Just don't pay attention to this dumb number between 1 and 10 anymore.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm with you on that.  People were really furious that I'm only a 4 and they compare themselves to other pages.  He's only a 6.  It's the human nature that you get all tied into this one number because it's an easy  number.  It's easy to see.  I guess it was when they put that bookmark that you could see the Google page rank.  Or maybe it was in the toolbar.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was in the toolbar.  There are a couple of websites where you can put a URL in and it would tell you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So did they say why they've dropped page rank from their Webmaster Tools?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They didn't really say why.  They said, for a long time, we've been saying that site owners shouldn't be too worried  about this.  And it used to be showed in the Google toolbar.  But this is our respectful hint for you to worry less about it.  Don't worry.  Be happy.  Yeah.  The fact that we haven't updated in a while.  Well, this is just our respectful way of saying, don't worry about this too much.  Page rank is just 1 over 200 signals that can affect how your site is crawled, indexed,  and ranked.  So I think this is a really good thing.  I feel like page rank is one of those tools that Black Hat SEOs use to scare you into thinking  you need their services and come up with all these crazy theories about how it works and  sell you stuff that you don't need.  In fact, this is a really good part of a larger conversation about SEO that was going on this  week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love that post.  I don't remember who it was.  Derek Powasek.  Yeah.  Derek is so great.  He said, here's what you need to know.  It's three things any idiot can do.  Everybody knows.  You put the title, you put your keywords in the title of the page.  It's basic stuff.  Everybody knows.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He was saying that good web design begets a site that is understandable by the Google  bot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Have a site map.  Put content on your page.  Don't hide it in Flash.  Simple things.  Everybody knows.  Anything beyond that is BS bogus bunkum snake oil.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Derek just quit smoking this week, so he's a little cranky.  He's crankier than usual.  So he really didn't pull any punches.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I loved it.  I thought that was so right on.  I've been kind of saying that for a long time because I get people on the radio show.  SEO is called a radio show.  Somebody called today saying, good web design.  I could get you to number one.  And I said, no, you can't stop it.  Go away.  And the risk of getting banned by Google for gaming Google is so much worse than anything  you can do to help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The new thing that Google announced also this week that you can put in your site and see  how the bot sees your site.  Is that part of understanding how well you've constructed your site?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  So in Webmaster Tools, oh, it looks like my video is not so good.  You didn't need to make up today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're all blocky.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'll try to turn that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like an Edvard Munch painting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There we go.  All right.  So in Webmaster Tools, which is for site publishers, there's a new labs feature that lets you see  how the Google bot sees your site.  So you pop in a URL and then you can see.  And this was something that I always did.  Whenever anybody asked me about how badly or well their site would get crawled, I used  what's called the web developer toolbar where you could turn off images, turn off JavaScript,  turn off CSS and just get the straight up text.  What does the Google bot see?  Which is basically the text of the site.  So that's basically what that Webmaster Tool does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I read also that the first 1400 characters are what matter on the page, but you don't  have to worry about JavaScript and stuff.  It ignores that, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe so.  I mean, I think the Google bot gets smarter and better all the time.  So I think, and actually Matt Cutts mentioned last week that they're figuring out ways for  it to crawl Ajax content, which is interesting.  But I think for the most part, yeah, I mean, the title, the head, the title, the body,  your headlines, you should be using H tags for your headlines and P tags for your paragraphs.  I mean, there's no trickery to it.  It's just good, good markup, ordered well on the page, the most important stuff first.  It's just like good journalism, get to the point, the first couple of sentences, write  your headlines well with keywords that people would search for.  I mean, not, you know, the fact is you shouldn't write your site for search engines, right?  You should write it for readers.  And if you follow that, you'll be fine.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And, you know, Leo, I think the page rank to me has an emotional tie to the earliest  days. It was really, to me, the first insight.  And I don't know if it's more or not, the page rank is not named after pages, but after

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Larry. Larry Page rank.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know if that's true or not.  But but I think the notion, the ding insight that Google had, that the two guys had was  to trust us and listen to our clicks and links and to use that.  And so I think that that's an important kind of underpinning of how our new world works.  But the other problem is we always get carried away with numbers and lists.  Doc Searles said long ago that though he loves Techarati, he was on the board of advisors  Techarati, he thinks the Techarati top 100 list is one of the worst things to ever happen.  The blogosphere, because we obsess about it.  Or we have Dave Weiner and Jay Rosen complaining about the suggested users list.  Follow our numbers. Yeah.  Right. And I think I think we do tend to get obsessed by these these lists and numbers and  it tends to pervert the web, which ignores that end of the tail.  And it says Matt Cutts calls it the big butt that's attached to the long tail where the  action actually happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that. That's good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, as in in in response to Derek's post, Danny Sullivan, who I actually highly  respect and writes about search engines, does incredible search engine coverage.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I'm trying to get him on the show, by the way.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say I would love to have him on the show.  You know, he wasn't happy with Derek's post.  He said, you know, there are people out there who are publishing sites and they are web  developers and they don't know these things.  You know, something like this comes very naturally to someone like Derek, who's an  incredible designer, who's someone who who creates WordPress themes and publishes them.  Like, you know, it's obvious, quote unquote, advice to him, but not to everyone else.  And that all SEO isn't bad.  So something to keep in mind.  In fact, I can add that to the show notes.  Both those posts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would say, however, that you don't need to hire somebody if SEO is four things that  you can easily write on the back of an envelope.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, though, Leo, I used to consult for about dot com.  And they have an SEO genius there.  And it really does amount to more than that.  It's also how you think about the structure of your world.  Right. So, you know, he got the New York Times to rethink the headlines and the way  they write headlines and the fact that they have to be clear and those some  lament that that it's headlines written for machines.  The truth is they were also just much clearer.  And forget about SEO.  RSS is the death of the cute headline and the anecdotally, you know, it's a different  structure of our world.  The fact that the New York Times started topic pages, which is now a cynical act of  most websites, but it was important at the time.  The next thing that strikes me, I got somebody who was yelling at me on Twitter that I  can't go a show without either, I don't know, holding up that book.  Or mentioning hyper personal news streams.  So there I did it again twice.  But if you go past the whole, I think part of the point about going past page rank is  the web is going past the page.  Right. Larry Page.  That's a very good point.  Yeah. Stream.  And we have to break out of that idea that everything is centered and focused and  centralized. And now in a new hyper distribution mechanism, you insinuate yourself in  all kinds of streams and that changes the structure.  So, Gina, I think you're you're right in that at the simple level of SEO sites are  sometimes you just don't know how to do it.  There's a sophisticated level of it that gets to about dot com.  And the reason that it gets half its revenue and 80 percent of its page views from  Google. But there's also a need to, I think, rethink the structure of how we and old  media think about content.  And we've kept it too much focused on the notion of the publication.  That's why people get so excited about every damn new e-book reader coming.  That's going to save the magazine and newspaper because they think it's going to save  its package structure of it.  But it's not because content is atomized now.  And that's that's what's really happened here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think we replace page rank with some sort of reputation number with a person

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  rank? Well, that's what we've been hoping for.  But again, I think the problem with all those things is it's one size fits all.  Yeah. Right.  You know, Siva and I can in our friendly jousting about Google, most people are going  to trust him more than me because he is more doubting than I am.  But a few might come along and say, no, I like Google, so I trust Jarvis more on this  topic. And the beauty of the Web is you can get both of us in a link.  Right. And so the notion that there's a one size fits all, who's best at this topic  or more trustworthy or anything like that.  The Web makes a lie of all those simplistic things.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Reputation is in the eye of the beholder.  Exactly. So you can't you can't have an arbitrary objective reputation.  It's you know, Gina might hold me with a in low regard and you might hold me in lower  regard. And that would be always Google.  Google would have nothing to do with that, although it's a really wonderful and although  thorny, but it really would be a useful nut to crack if we could somehow figure out a  way to convey that information.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, Google just made some recommendations speaking of personal personal page rank or  what what comes up for you when you search for your name in Google.  They made some recommendations this week about how to deal with that when people search for  your name. I saw that. Yeah.  Yeah, it was it was interesting.  I mean, it was pretty obvious advice, I think, for people who are, you know, think about  this stuff a lot. That's why I didn't bookmark it, because we know it.  Yeah, we know that stuff.  But I'm glad you brought it up.  Yeah, but the one the one paragraph I thought was kind of interesting is that they said,  you know, if someone searches for your restaurant or your business or yourself and they come  up with results that you or and you get results that you're not so happy with and you can't  get the site owners to remove that stuff and you don't own the site, so you can't remove  it. Just make sure that you get positive things published about your business or your  restaurant or yourself so that viewers on Google can get a rounded view, you know, both  the positive and the negative. And then that felt a little bit like they were kind of  encouraging not spam, but, you know, they were saying, hey, get both points of view  out there. If the negative one is out there, you know, come out and put a positive one  out there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, Gina, I think it's a call to creation and it's a call to everyone to have an  identity and a place on the Web.  Right.  You don't have that. You're lost in this new world.  And so you need to have that.  And we immediately are learning that the individual writers have more of a brand now  than the publication.  I see a lot of employees at Businessweek just sold to Bloomberg have basically said,  I'm not staying off social media.  Steven Baker wrote a great post about this.  He's a writer there. I'm not staying off social media because social media is how we're  going to have a connection.  That's our future.  We're good without a publication.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's our future.  It's our personal brand.  It's not a corporate brand.  You know, it's one of the regrets I had when I spoke in Dubai last week at the TEDx  there is that I didn't say I should have been more forthright.  I was what I what I meant to say when I was trying to say is speaking to the Arab world,  you have a chance with new media to revamp your reputation in the US.  The Arab world has been very poorly painted in the US after 9-11 for a variety of reasons.  But you and I'm talking to these wonderful people from all over the Arab world, you  know, Kuwait and Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  And I say, this new media, here's your chance to create podcasts and blogs and videos and  tell start a conversation and do an end around this poor representation.  You now can own your representation in the US.  And that's what we need to do if we're going to have world peace.  So it's really an important issue, not merely how do you keep your corner shop from being  derogated on Yelp.  It's a it's a it's a it's a it's really an issue that we need.  And I think there's good news, which is that everybody can do it.  Now, this is a good post. It's funny because I looked at it, Gene, and I thought I should  talk about it. But then now everybody listens knows that, you know,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other funny thing about the post is they were they used as an opportunity to remind  the world this Pache Siva that Google doesn't own the world.  Google doesn't own everything. You can't come after us to change it.  You got to go to that was that was the good line.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was a good line in there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But they also plug Google profiles, which we have been plugging.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And we believe in and I wish people would use it.  And I wish Google, you know, Google could do something by by making those profiles more  visible on a page. You still if you Google my name, you do not see my Google profile  even at the bottom of the page.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, really? Yeah. You got the bottom.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No. And I asked Kevin Marks when he was still at Google about that.  And he said, well, with some celebrities, they don't do that because they don't want  people fighting. I don't know what it is.  Like if you're Sharon Stone, not the Hollywood Sharon.  I don't know what it is, but for some reason it doesn't.  I think your Google profile, if Google really means what they say about you're  responsible for your reputation, your Google profile should be the first search  result. Right. That's right.  That's your canonical result.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I thought that was the idea behind it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. But that's not what they're doing.  For most people, it shows up at the bottom.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. It shows at the bottom for for normals.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. For normals.  Anybody but Leo, apparently.  Normals.  I don't want to step on your numbers, Mr.  Jarvis. So I don't know what your number of the week is, but there was a number  this week that I thought was stunning.  Is this your number 10?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, 10 percent.  I'm thinking of a number, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazing, Chriskin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm thinking of an I'll tell you the number 10.  According to Arbor Networks, 10 percent of all net traffic is Google traffic.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, it's 10. I thought it was six.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is Arbor Networks says it's close to 10.  Let's put it that way.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, OK. OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's related to another story that's up on the on the front feed, which is that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  we all thought another number zero, zero

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  bankrupt from YouTube bandwidth and that Google pays zero for bandwidth,  basically because they bought all kinds of dark fiber back in the day.  Brilliant. And they're not paying for the bandwidth.  They have all kinds of agreements in position, and that's why they can afford

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  bandwidth is free. Let's face it.  Bandwidth is free for these big guys because of peering relationships,  if nothing else. Exactly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is that is that? Wait, so how does this work?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  It doesn't sound right.  It doesn't sound right. Exactly. It's the new math.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm confused about how that works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. I'll see if I can explain this.  I've had it explained to me.  Jay Adelson, who was who is now at revision three, was used to rent Equinox,  which was a big Internet, I don't know, backbone company.  And here's how he explained it.  He said, if you're America on, let's give you as an example, America Online.  And you are.  Is this a good example? Maybe Google's a better example.  Let's say you're Google and you're putting no American lines better.  America Online and you're consuming a lot of content.  You're big ISP. You're consuming a lot of content.  It's a very one way street.  What you can do is you open up these peering relationships  with, let's say, YouTube and you say, look,  we're going to consume a lot of YouTube content.  So we, by the way, one of the reasons I know this is we get free bandwidth from AOL.  We help in their peering relationship.  They need to make an equal amount of bandwidth going in both directions.  So if they consume a lot of bandwidth, they need to send out a lot of bandwidth.  So they set up peering relationships, which are basically direct connections,  and they need to balance those relationships  by sending an equal amount of bandwidth in both directions.  And so, you know, Google might set up a deal  because Google is, let's see how we can put it this way.  Google's sending a lot, so they would need to receive a lot.  So they need a whiteboard. It's too complicated.  I'm sorry. I'm starting to cry.  You keep crying. You're doing well.  The idea of peering relationships is we want to have a direct connection.  You know, YouTube is directly connected to Comcast as an example.  And Comcast is going to suck down a lot of YouTube bandwidth.  So Comcast peers, we're going to, you know, we'll use a lot of bandwidth,  but we'll make a deal so that it costs neither party anything  by sending you a lot of content in our direction.  And then we'll just kind of write it off as a zero cost transaction.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So they're bartering bandwidth.  Essentially.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. So let me get this straight.  So Comcast customers are using all kinds of bandwidth. Right.  So YouTube, YouTube viewers are using a lot of bandwidth  or YouTube itself is using a lot of bandwidth.  So then it meets in the middle. It meets in the middle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So so essentially, you know, it's like, OK, Jeff, you and I are talking a lot.  Let's get a tie line, the direct line between each other.  And then our costs will go down because we have a direct pipe.  We're not using anybody else's connection.  And to make sure that that financial transaction is fair,  we'll just make sure we use it equally.  I send as much as I receive.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Oh, that's really amazing.  That actually blows my mind, because that's not at all how I thought  bandwidth was working for these big companies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, in fact, most of them, I think, are paying nothing for bandwidth.  Now, this dark fiber is another whole other issue because  there is a huge amount of dark fiber.  Google was very, you know, that was smart of them to buy it up  when it was cheap right after the Internet bust, I would imagine.  You know, they often talk about these boom bust cycles.  I've read economic studies that say these these big booms  have a real long term value because in the case of the Internet boom in 1999,  all of this money that came out of these IPOs was invested in infrastructure.  So a lot of infrastructure was built.  Same thing happened with the railroad booms, you know, right after  the Transcontinental Railroad was built, most of the railroads went bankrupt.  But we got a railroad out of it.  And so right right after the Internet bust, we lost all these Internet companies.  But we got all this dark fiber, all this connectivity, all this infrastructure,  which we're now benefiting from.  So that money that you lost when when when your pets.com stock went to zero.  Good news.  It makes Internet access cheaper.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's my other one of my numbers of the week is five twelve.  That's where I bought Google stock and now it's finally back over it.  Yes. Five fifty three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. Google's back, baby.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really, five twelve. It's that high?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, it's five fifty three.  Five twelve is where I bought it right before.  Boom, the plunge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's amazing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I was very transparent about that on my blog.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I had Google stock once, but I don't I no longer have any tech stock.  I might have some Google still.  Is it really that high?  It's in my if it is, it's in my, you know, it's in a fund somewhere that I unmanaged fund.  Yeah. Let's see here.  So but but I don't want to take your numbers away.  It's twenty five million a number.  Oh, no. Eric Schmidt gives.  That's a good one. It's Princeton.  Twenty five million dollars for a tech fund.  That's a good number.  A lot of numbers in the news today.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's what I'll give you my number now. Here it is.  Oh, I don't want to spoil it.  Go ahead.  Pardon me, Siva.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that was me. Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Ten thousand six hundred sixty four, which is the number of language pairs  Google Translator can now handle after adding two hundred eighty five languages to its service,  bringing the total to three hundred forty five.  And of course, as Siva would tell us, they're ready to take over the world.  So they're now worried about the seven thousand languages ready to die.  And I'm sure we're doing more things with the Google books for languages.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Cool.  To save. They'll take over speech.  But some of those languages are like Swedish Chef and Pirate and stuff like that. Right.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Cling on. Cling on.  The question is, what fraction is Swedish Chef and Pirate?  The language is definitely the growing and thriving language.  I think so.  Oh, it's the.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I heard the Swedish Chef gets like three million hits on Google, like a month or something.  I should look that up. I feel like you might have said that at some conference this week.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Really, why are anthropologists working about languages dying when you have so many silly  languages sprouting up at rapid rate from all corners?  Do you ever? You know, can we get back to the 25 million to Princeton?  Not that I have an issue with that, although it would have been sweet if he had given it to the University of Virginia.  But I see the University of New York.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You keep making noise, Siva, he might. You never know.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Well, OK, but let's actually look.  But I actually wanted to make a serious point about CUNY, right?  Because why do billionaires give money, millions of dollars to universities that don't need it?  Like, why not give that money to CUNY in the Jeff Jarvis endowed chair in, you know, in technology and culture?  From your lips, Siva, to Eric's ears.  Let me tell you what, Jeff, because Jeff has the potential to change lives of people who have not had an opportunity yet  to demonstrate their facility in the world and their ability to fill in bubble forms with number two pencils.  You know, those are the people the billionaires should be funding.  Like, Princeton got funded three centuries ago. Why are you giving money to Princeton?  I mean, I'm sure it's going to be used by these people there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He graduated from Princeton, is why.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Yeah, but, you know, come on, look, Bill Gates didn't graduate from anywhere and he gave a tremendous amount of money to the school he dropped out of.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He gave a lot of money to Carnegie Mellon, which is where my son wants to go now, if anybody's watching.  CMU.  But Siva, go back to the book point, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jake Jarvis, CNA.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Early decision time, November 1, he has to apply to CMU.  That's where he's applying to.  If anyone from admissions is listening, I'm not going to influence you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, as long as we're plugging, Abby's going to be applying early admission to Brown University and she's got her own podcast.  OK, I just want to mention that.  OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jake made Facebook apps and sold them, but he showed us not for nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Both of them should get in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Seriously, folks, Siva, this goes back to the problem, I think, of government taking over the book scanning, because part of the problem, I think, with the rich folks is that they say, oh, it's taken care of.  It's a government project.  CUNY is a government project.  It's government funded.  We will do great things with the money, as would you.  And I absolutely agree.  But I think that's part of the problem with government funding is it makes it seem as if, oh, it's checked off.  It's OK.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Huh.  You're right.  Yeah, I think just the opposite.  You know, we well, OK, that may actually be the be the issue.  I don't think it has anything to do with the with the idea of scanning books or funding libraries.  People don't think libraries are well funded or sufficiently funded, nor do people really imagine that CUNY is well funded.  Nobody says CUNY is well funded.  So it really is a matter of, you know, again, whether we want to benefit from from institutions like CUNY, which I mean, that money could help people at the community college level actually learn how to program.  And and push themselves into another level of wealth that I mean, it could just do amazing amounts of we have at CUNY.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Thank you for the plugs. We have two hundred fifty thousand students at CUNY, which is which is incredible how it educates New York.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And I am a graduate of CUNY, by the way.  You are. I didn't know that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If only we had a fight song, I'd sing it now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why you don't get money.  You got no fight song.  Do they have a football team?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  You might notice my shirt for the University of Texas, my alma mater, which certainly has a share of billionaires giving money to it.  And it is all you know, but it is all about the football team and all about the memories and all that.  And those aren't really good reasons.  Are you an Aggie? No, no, no.  Hook them horns. Right. Right.  The Aggies are the other team. Hook them horns.  Sorry. No, but that's the thing.  Like why there should actually be pressure on billionaires to get more bang for the buck out of their money and and putting money closer to more students,  making the student environment better at LaGuardia Community College, at Bureau Manhattan Community College, at Brooklyn College would do an amazing job to give it to community colleges in the in Silicon Valley, right?  In San Jose would be a better move than give it to Princeton.  You're a socialist, Siva.  No, not really. I'm just someone who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A socialist. If I make a billion dollars through the great American system, I can give it to any gosh darn university I want to.  Of course you can.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you watch the new sitcom Community, that might not work well for your cause.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is a very funny show, I have to say.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  It might. Anyway, so yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The money goes to the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Transformative Technology Fund.  And it'll be awarded through an annual campus wide.  I think actually this is very cool.  Campus wide peer reviewed competition to support the invention or implementation of entirely new technologies that will have a major impact on a field of research.  Or it could be used for the acquisition of new equipment that will change the direction of research in a field.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can fund my course in entrepreneurial journalism where we have seed money to do the same thing to to to save journalism, which Google killed.  I'll try that pitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you want reparations now, is that it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So that'll try that.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Anything. Anything that'll work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. You might get an apology, but I doubt you'll get reparations.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm learning how to beg.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. Now, since both Jeff and I do have college tuitions coming up.  I might.  Thank you.  I might shift the conversation to a little company you and I know as wait a minute.  I have to get the book.  Squarespace dot com.  We're going to do I was talking to the Squarespace people at blog world yesterday.  Of course, they were there because Squarespace is now the most popular.  I'm making this up, but it's probably true.  The most popular blog platform, but not just a blog platform.  Squarespace is all about websites.  The if you are a blogger, if you're on WordPress or blog or removable type or type had the beauty of Squarespace is that import feature that imports and exports.  They're wide open so you can get your data in, but you can take data out any time.  They've got the forums.  They've got a photo gallery, a form builder.  They've got Google Maps.  Great website tracking built in search engine optimization.  OK, so you don't have to worry about that.  Things like site maps automatic.  We're going to start using it for the radio show.  That's what I was talking with Squarespace about yesterday.  I want to do a redesign for the radio show.  I'm really excited about not only the great design features of Squarespace, but just the ease of use, the power and the cloud architecture that they use, which means that you never run out of bandwidth.  Squarespace sites are not the usual shared hosting situation.  It's kind of spread across the whole architecture, not just in a single location, but in all of their network operation centers.  It's really kind of amazing.  I want you to find out more about Squarespace by trying it free.  This is the simplest trial you've ever seen.  Just go to squarespace.com slash twig.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  You don't need a credit card.  All you need to do is enter your log in and your password, and you'll be able to try it for two weeks absolutely free.  It couldn't be easier to use.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  Oh, look.  It says welcome twig fans right there.  That's so cool.  And if you decide to stick around, you can get 10% off the account when you use a coupon code twig.  So I hope they explain that.  And oh, I saw the new.  It's not Apple's kind of Apple's Apple.  They've got a new iPhone app, which Apple will, I'm sure, any day now approve, hint, hint, that is mind boggling.  I mean, it's exactly what you want as a blogger.  It is so cool.  I wish I could show you more, but we will soon.  I don't know if this is telling tales out of school, but Erica told me it was it's one icon that Apple approved before.  But now says, we don't like that icon that much.  You got to change an icon.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Anyway, it could be worse.  Apple could run book search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true. Yeah, you know, that's a very good point.  You don't approve it. It's not up.  That's a very good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't even think of that.  It could be worse.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That would be worse.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's interesting how Apple is rapidly becoming the new evil empire.  They used to be the good guys.  I don't know what happened.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Now they were. They were just small, insignificant enough that eccentricities were considered charming.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you can't if you can't be good, be insignificant.  Yeah, OK. It's a good motto for us all.  Squarespace dot com slash tweet.  Give them a try. We appreciate it.  And of course, Jake and Abby appreciate it as well.  Squarespace dot com slash twig.  Yeah, that's a really good point.  What if Apple were doing this?  How would people feel?  Microsoft did this for a while, the book deal.  And of course, it was only public domain books.  But I mean, I think that nobody did.  People kind of say, ooh, is Microsoft?

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Now, well, let's let's also be clear here that they're in they're essentially in different businesses.  Right. Apple is fundamentally a hardware company.  Right.  And so Apple's not going to do anything.  Well, they have no interest in doing it.  Help move hardware. Right. Right.  So and they know with all the different things that Apple's done over the years, that's fundamentally what it's been about.  They've never deviated from the fact that they sell boxes with guts inside.  So so good for them.  And all the all the problems we have with Apple come from the fact that they insist on tethering and limiting so many things with with their boxes.  But, you know, look, Microsoft was essentially doing the book scanning as a throwaway, a public service.  They never expected to benefit from it directly.  It was a way of of working with both with Yahoo and working with libraries and ultimately with the Internet Archive to to essentially have a presence in that that might work out someday.  But they were never big in it because they sell software.  That's their job.  You know, Google's job is to keep your attention in the Google universe.  And that's why Google was interested in book search for that reason, to give you more reason to have your eyes on Google, which is good for Google.  But secondly, ideally to give them much more text to analyze.  One of the reasons that their language translation programs are such a tremendous success is that they are able to crunch so much syntax and figure out how languages work.  And having more text helps Google do that.  So, I mean, that's that's fundamentally what it gets as what it gets out here.  So each of these companies has a reason to be in the various businesses that they're in.  And Microsoft decided that they were, you know, had no potential reward from doing the book search any longer.  And and they got out of it.  Also, just I mean, Google had won.  Google had made the move that put it head and shoulders above.  And they just didn't see any reason to continue with it.  But it was a shame. It was actually heartbreaking because they weren't spending that much money.  It was only a few million bucks a year that they were spending on this.  And it seemed like all changed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it was actually now that Google's e-bookstore is a stab at all of the proprietary book readers.  Kindle and, you know, presumably one that Apple might have at all, because all you need is a browser to be able to read books.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's actually all you need right now for a lot of books.  And and people forget that.  I mean, the Kindle mania has been driving me nuts because I've just never understood why.  Oh, you don't like the Kindle either?  I hate it. And it's gathering dust downstairs.  It's it's like this. It's like this this half baked device that does everything half as well as my laptop does it.  I just don't get it.  I mean, the one nice thing about it is the constant connectivity.  But it's constant connectivity with what? It's little.  It's my laptop. I can read it in bed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Siva, you got a book coming out. You got to start sucking up to Amazon.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  You know, that's the thing. I would love to write a big slam on Amazon, but it would be the end of my book writing career.  They have way too much power.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Now, don't let that hold you back. Come on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My publisher, when I said that I had once refused to go on Oprah, they said, don't say that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why would you why would anyone refuse to go on Oprah?  She's such a nice lady.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was back in the day when she was trying to argue that after having really kind of created tabloid television and sleazy television in a way,  and she suddenly decided that she was all Miss Virtuous, she wanted TV critics to come on and praise her for it.  And I said, oh, thanks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, that's not my job, man.  Gina, I do want to correct myself, Gina, because you're right.  The New York Times article quoted this Arbor Network study as six percent of Internet traffic was Google.  And I was looking at a Wired article that said close to 10 percent.  And so I'm trying to figure this out by looking at the Arbor Network study.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I think the New York Times article was syndicated from Read Write Web.  I don't know if that makes a difference, but yeah, yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's like that moment in jeopardy when they take points away from somebody.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.  Our judges have looked over your answer and you've you you you neglected the question mark.  Your voice didn't go up at the end.  And so you're going to lose all those. I don't know.  I don't know if it's 10 or six. It's still a lot.  It's the study's very interesting.  I mean, just the points I'm looking at the study.  It was a long term study.  They did it two years, monitored more than 12 terabits a second.  Two hundred fifty six exabytes of Internet traffic.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's insane. That's insane.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hard to even imagine that much data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Unbelievable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, you know, I'm going to I don't know if you have to buy this study or what.  But I'm going to see if I can get a copy of it.  It looks like you have to request it somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. It's time for the moment you've all been waiting for, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina's tip of the week, Mr.  Jarvis's number of the week, if we haven't run through all the numbers and my and my tool that we have.  Well, there's lots more, but you got you got a minute or two.  Get another number.  And I have a really retro tool of the week.  But let's start with Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Cool. Cool. So my tip of the week is for Gmail slash Google Docs.  The Gmail team's been busy.  They've released a few new labs features this week.  And the one I want to feature is Google Docs preview feature.  So in your Gmail account, you go into the lab section, enable Google Docs preview.  And any time someone emails you a Google Doc, which is any time that someone shares a Google Doc with you,  you can preview the Google Doc right in line in Gmail.  And this is and actually there are quite a few features that let you view certain types of content inside Gmail.  There's Yelp, there's Flickr, there's Picasso Web Albums, there's YouTube.  So Gmail is really sort of moving toward this place where like certain kinds of Internet content that often get emailed around,  you can view right in line.  And Google Docs came out actually this week.  And kind of as an aside, Wave does a lot of this, too.  It's really interesting to watch Gmail and Google Docs, you know, get developed in ways where I feel like they're just going to sort of at one point just all merge together and be Wave.  But that's I had to say something about Wave this week, so I had to say that.  But check out Gmail labs in general.  The Gmail team's been busy and there are a lot quite a few new features this week.  And I'm actually I'm going to have to write up my favorites because there are new ones all the time.  Just run through that list and see if there's anything else useful there.  But Google Docs preview is pretty cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can I cast a vote for being able to share folders in Google Docs now, too?  Yeah, you can. That was that to me was a big little feature, but a big feature, because, you know, before you had to share the doc at a time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now you can share a folder and make it public, too, which I think which I think also goes to Wave that it becomes a means of publishing.  Right. Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's a very good point. I didn't even think of that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Google Docs means it can be can be a very easy way for anyone to publish to the Web now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow. Wow. That's way it's a very interesting world we live in.  Now, I see some numbers here like the ad sales numbers for Google, but I'm going to let Jeff come up with a number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, now I got to find that one. You're absolutely right. That's the one I should do.  We did zero. We did six percent. We did all that.  Basically, I forget the number. So to heck with it.  But Google's numbers were up. Its stock is up as a result, which I'm happy about.  And it's also good for the economy, one says.  The indication is the clicks are up means the consumers are looking around for things again.  And it also says that Google is going to start investing once again in new companies.  And I think that's probably good for the industry. We'll see what they want to buy.  Maybe we should do a wish list. I don't have anything on top of a wish list of what should Google buy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We were going to do that. I like I really like that idea.  They said the net income of one point six four billion dollars.  That's up eight percent from last year. Revenue was five point nine four billion.  And that excludes commissions paid to advertising partners.  So but that's that's a lot of ads. That's amazing.  And they beat the forecast, which is probably why they're at five fifty three.  My tool of the week is something you all know and have used.  But for some reason, I've kind of ignored it. I've always recommended Picasso.  I like Picasso a lot. And Picasso Web and the Mac version of Picasso I tried.  They just updated it to, I think, three five last month.  And they just are doing they're just I think really doing a great job.  This is rapidly becoming certainly it's better than anything on that's native to.  You know, comes with Windows or the Macintosh, much better than iPhoto.  But it's even starting to compete with commercial project products like Lightroom  and Aperture in the ability to modify photos.  And they've added now something they've had on the web for a while and Picasso Web.  But they've added now face recognition to the Picasso download.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And I mentioned this last week when you're in Dubai.  This is my tip of the tip of the week was to review your evolution of hairstyles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good tip.  That's a good tip.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It does a good job, doesn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does a great job.  Better with adults than babies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I didn't try it with babies.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I had my nephew, like my three nephews all look really alike when they are.  Oh, you're shooting me. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had to shoot the monkey at you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's my fault.  I should have listened to the show before I before I did my tip.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But it shows how much confidence you had that Jeff nailed it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I knew he did. I knew he did.  But I have to say, you know, I downloaded it to try that.  But then I'm going through Picasso and it's just really getting better and better and better.  Yeah.  If you're looking for it, it actually came up because somebody left a message on a friend feed said,  you know, I'm looking I'm looking for a good photo sharing service that's free.  This is pretty good. In fact, it was so good that I ended up spending 75 bucks to upgrade it to 40 gigabytes of storage.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So the web albums. Really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Nice.  I really like it. Well, I just I think this is going to be a good way for me to share stuff.  I'm always, you know, with the kids, you know, team sports and and graduation and prom pictures and all that.  I'm always sharing photo albums with other parents.  And you need an easy to use, simple way to do that.  And I have been using Smug Mug, but I think it's really off putting sometimes to to newbies.  But, you know, Google Web Picasso Web, that's easy.  It's very straightforward. So anyway, so much for my tool of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sorry, Leo.  It's OK. I had a little tip of the week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, you know, I got a little in on yours. So that's OK.  Hey, Siva, thank you so much for being with us.  I really appreciate it. Siva is a professor of stuff like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New media, I guess, is the best way to anything you want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll teach for food and law, media, whatever.  And you know, I love your contrarian point of view.  We should get you on here more often because we're just a bunch of Google lovers.  And it's about time we met somebody.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  Yes, I am, too. And I'm not even a jilted lover.  I'm. But, you know, look, who knows?  Who knows your flaws and overstatements more than your most beloved?  Those who love you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, well, he does think that that Larry Page is is disingenuous.  I don't know if I can go for a surge.

Speaker: Siva Vajanathan
Transcript:  I'm sorry, surge. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well, anyway, thank you for being here.  We'll have you back soon. I really enjoyed.  Thanks for that. Thanks for the opportunity.  Your your thoughts and of course, Google ization of everything.com is a place to go.  Gina Tripani is at SmarterWear.org and of course, writes for Life Hacker  and the Harvard Business Review and a lot of other places as well.  And it's always great to have you on. Thank you for being here, Gina.  Thank you. Great show. Jeff Jarvis at Buzz Machine dot.  Is it? I keep seeing it's calm. It's calm.  It's not it's not a nonprofit.  Let's not. Oh, no, no, no, no.  Let's not say that. It's a small profit.  It's a nano profit.  And do read his most recent penis post because

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was hoping you were going to say book, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry. And the book. Where's the book?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have the book. There it is. Hold up the book.  What would Google do?  I'm sure selling very well and it is available and audible as well.  If you'd like to listen.  OK, it is not TMI.  It is just good information. That's all I'm saying.  Thank you all for being here.  We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
