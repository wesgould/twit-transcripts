We'll put him in first base. His name was Lou Gehrig  He stayed at first base for the longest streak in over 3,000 games and no one ever heard a Wally Pip again  Who was the fifth beetle? Yeah, exactly. I feel like the fifth beetle  Anyway, thank you for in all sincerity for Jason did a great show and thank you Jason and I guess you guys had a wonderful time  So big story today is a Google story alphabet earnings are out and  It's we were talking earlier on Windows Weekly about Microsoft's earnings and Microsoft's ad sales were down big time  And you know all the companies Microsoft Apple  Saying oh headwinds from kovid from the global recession from a supply chain shortage, etc  Google probably less hit by a supply chain shortage than anybody although they still have  You know network servers and so forth, but I still got to build their own gear. Yeah  and in the call yesterday they  This is from Reuters a trio of alphabet executives sounded caution on a call with investment analysts using the word  uncertain or uncertainty 13 times  To describe the economy YouTube ad sales grew at their slowest pace since disclosures began in 2018, but did grow  Alphabet shares like Microsoft shares went up more than 5% after the result 7%  I just looked at wow the market loved it and the good news according to Google was a share of  ad sales for in search went up  14% in search ad sales during the second quarter  beating the street 40  plus billion dollar revenue in search ad  Sales and one of the reasons Google says it was good is because people are traveling again, and they're shopping again  And so travel and retail advertisers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Powered that which makes so it's not 40 billion, but Google cloud revenue was also up  It was up 36% a year before yeah, 6.3 billion  Gotta put that in perspective  Yeah, I'm saying it's only 6.3 of the overall how many how many billion did they report? Yeah, well of course Mary Jo

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Finally immediately said well compare that to Microsoft Azure which is over 25 billion right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Azure's like over 25 billion. Yeah, Azure actually their server and cloud revenue increased 20 increased 26%  So Google growing more from a way well, but it's a way smaller number, right?  Azure is number two in the cloud wars and Google's like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Distant third so shares are now up eight point one eight percent  On Google stock Jesus I checked two minutes. Yeah, so the market likes it  Even though second quarter profit fell. Oh  They only made 16 billion dollars. Oh  In three months, I got it. Oh, that's barely  Dollars a month. Oh, that's barely barely a billion in a quarter a week. Oh  Nevertheless the market says well, we think their Google might have a future or I'm sorry. She's the alphabet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think what what's happening with all the tech companies is there is they're using this as an excuse to lay off

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's exactly right  everybody  Spotify just said they're gonna lay off 10%

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they killed car thingy which never made sense in the first place and took a 30 million dollar write down on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But sure car thingy was what Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Piece of hardware a dedicated hardware for Spotify that you put on your vent in your car and you plug it in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the thing Amazon did right?  Yeah, do something similar to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they had an echo auto I still have one the echo auto was a terrible terrible car thingy was actually good  but  really weird like  Why like we still don't know Spotify says they learned a lot from learned a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's interesting took a 30 billion or 30 million dollar right Spotify snap some of the smaller companies really suffering on the market  With the you know economic woes  Microsoft Google  We'll see Apple's coming out tomorrow tomorrow. I think Amazon tomorrow. This is the big week for quarterly earnings  The Guardian says Google's earnings signal company weathering slowdown better than expected  So that's apparently what the street is saying. Hey, it could have been worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let's celebrate. I don't I don't know all of this macro micro financial stuff  When they said that they're talking about  Uncertainty 13 times or something like that. Is that a way of sort of hedging their bets for the analysts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, there's two things that happen and you probably Stacy could explain this better than me  There's two things that happen in these quarterly results in these analysts calls  First of all, they're gonna tell you how they did so far  But then and really the market reacts more to they then predict what their next quarter is gonna be like right Stacy

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So the market's saying well, okay. Yeah, you didn't do as badly this quarter and next quarter  Maybe things are gonna look up, but they're also sandbagging

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we talked about

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We talked about some Tuesday on Mac break weekly, which is Apple for a long time did sandbagging me clearly  Analysts would always come in low Apple would outperform and the stock would go up  It is supposed although there's no  Concrete evidence that the SEC at some point came knocking on Tim Cook's and look at May Street their CFO's door and said ah  You can't be doing that anymore  Because the SEC it is it is the SEC. It is illegal to lie. Yes. Yes and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know that is true  You can infer things and you can lead people to think things that would  Maybe lead them to different conclusions. Yeah  Yeah, okay. Yeah, there's and of course the SEC seems to be a toothless tiger these days

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, there's this thing called non ink non gap reporting generally accepted accounting practices  You would think would be generally accepted  But a lot of companies now do non gap  Performance you still have to report for your SEC and your 10 K's and 8 K's and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You still have to use gap accounting for that. Yeah, but but that's your fight in your financial statements  You still interesting but the headlines often report non gap. That's reporters being silly  That's because reporters don't know they're they're even up from their net profits from  Even up from their net profits from yeah  Yeah, I was I was gonna go to a very profane level well would have been a good title I wish you had

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nope, nope, they don't know their EBITDA from shine Ola  Yeah, Jeff will get that one there. Jeff. Are you almost remember shine? Oh, yeah. Yeah, and what and what it was distinct from  I'm gonna stop trying so hard. I feel really the pressure of last week's show over my head here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just rest and let us you know, just I'll let you carry

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Also somebody the chairman saying I look like I'm at the little kids table because I have too much headroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is that's a drum room shot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Fix my headroom  Facebook  We'll have results soon Mark Zuckerberg  And I love this the verge got a recording of mr. Zuckerberg's all hands meeting  And I you know, this is there's a little editorializing going on here, but I'm gonna read it anyway, cuz it's so well done  This is it. Neelay  You know, he's good at that isn't he? No Alex Heath and David Pierce, right? Okay, they are still good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is like my favorite yeah, yeah, I love Neelay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg stared into his webcam trying to make yet another remote meeting seem urgent  Since Facebook started he'd made a habit of frankly addressing employees directly at a weekly Q&A almost no topic was off-limits  But as the company grew these sessions had become more scripted  He stopped showing up every week letting other executives feel the most up-voted questions submitted by employees  But June 30th the raw  Zuckerberg persona was back. Well, that's almost a month ago. I guess they only just got the  recording  Sometimes he sounded like a general preparing his troops for the war ahead other times  He was the Wunderkid visionary, but mostly he just seemed annoyed  the first question  Hi, I'm Gary. I'm located in Chicago  will metadata's  Extra days off introduced during the pandemic will they continue in 2023?  Zuckerberg appeared visibly frustrated. That's a lot for a robot to appear visibly frustrated. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also a terrible intro question

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And by the way, they have so much they're not gonna he says um, all right  He just explained he thought the economy was heading for the one of the worst downturns. We've seen in recent history  That's the quote. He was already freezing hiring in many areas tick tocks eating their lunch  It would take over a year and a half Zuckerberg had said before they had line of sight to overtaking  Tick-tock and Gary was asking about extra vacation days  Given Zuckerberg, I'd be upset to Zuckerberg said come on people given my tone in the rest of the Q&A  You can probably imagine what my reaction is Zuckerberg said  After this metadata's were canceled  Yeah, everybody everybody is saying to the troops saying to the market  Saying to the press it's gonna be a tough time ahead. Yeah  Meta though seems to always react poorly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are robot they don't they really are people in terms of yeah the latest kerfuffle

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you talk about this last week the Kardashians  No, I know we did Kylie Jenner. I don't think go ahead. Did they start at the post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it was after last week. Otherwise, we would have been on the news because we're always on the news. It happened that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  the Kardashians  including Kylie Jenner  Hate the new Instagram  Kim and Kylie  say  Stop make Instagram Instagram again. Stop trying to be tick-tock. I just want to see cute photos of my friends  signed sincerely everyone  Yes, 1.1 million likes on this one. Yeah, y'all can make the photographer is green with them. I am too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  awful I  We can't all have the same social like I use Twitter for one thing. I use Instagram for another you can't have everything and  Though their opinion matters  Partially because they have a huge follower network Kylie Jenner has 360 million followers  Yeah, how is important Wow, and then also are they I?  Get it, you know, they've got a TV show right they've got their Hulu show. This is and maybe  Not everybody's into videos and there's lots of Instagram creators who are like  Video it's so different and it seems unfair to pull the rug out from under people all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know plus Facebook has done is how many pivots to video in the past?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was about to say plus how many pivots to video do we need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so the problem is Instagram was it started as  Photography it built this reputation offer photographers put in content out there that people enjoyed  You know, yes, there were regular quote-unquote regular people posting things  But the professional photographers went out there and really made a cat captivating and tried to build community off of it  And now you're telling those photographers to kick rocks basically just you're just a wine

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So get ready. How about you stop that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Photographers were a big part of Instagram. I thought Instagram was just a fun social network where you saw pictures  Yeah, well people who like pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Like people didn't like pictures, yeah, I liked it because I would post my pictures  In fact, I remember in the early days of Instagram being offended when people would do pictures not from their camera phone  But from their DSLR, you know their fancy cameras. Yes, but that became the thing you would post your best pictures  I know you do and so do I  Yep. Now it's all videos right and then but we're get ready because  Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri responded to Kylie and Kim  Where did he respond you'd think Instagram maybe no Twitter. Here's here's his video  Adam Mosseri who is  importantly, by the way, not  Kevin Systrom or one of the founders of Instagram  But a Meta guy brought in when the founders left in a huff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's former head of newsfeed very eye up and Facebook and now he's the boss  And here he is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Responding I'm experimenting with by the way, there's a lot of  Adam get a microphone. What do you Adam first you're posted on Twitter and now get a microphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a lot going on an Instagram right now  We're experimenting with a number of different changes to the app  And so we're hearing a lot of concerns from all of you  So one is like a few moments and clarify a few things  One is if you're seeing a news version of a feed or you're hearing about it know that that is a test  It's a test to a few percentage of people out there  And the idea is that a more full screen experience not only for videos before photos might be a more fun engaging experience  What but I also want to be clear. It's not yet good. Wait a minute what?  It's not yet good and we're gonna have to get it to a good place if we're gonna ship it to the rest of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Everybody's seeing it Adam. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't see a small percentage boy  Well, wait a minute. Let me go to my Instagram feed because these days you think I'm seeing something different from what you're seeing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't see anything on Instagram because I'm locked out of my Facebook account and I don't care to get it back

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nice nice nice. I see  Basically reels all the time, right? That's some videos, but I see more photos than videos  So maybe there is okay. So maybe there is a difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know  More videos that I used to by all means yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But so this is funny because I'm on the web and you're right. It's all stills as soon as I go to my phone  Okay, it's all video that's right it's all stuff like this  tik-tok video vertical video with captions and  Tik-tok II

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Things and this looks just like the first thing I see on my can you see this?  Here's the first thing I see in my Instagram feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Me and Lisa's yes your tongue out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adam is on Instagram to oh he is video. I next thing I see is his video. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There he is  So he by the way using the Z Frank editing style you said it was edited a lot  I think that's intentional. Oh, yeah comes from 20 years ago  When a guy named Z Frank who's a wonderful fella figured out that if he edited out all the blinking  His videos would be very compelling  But whatever happened to say say say ended up going to work  for a food  channel he invented  Can't do it got an edit this out  He invented he invented  The top-down food thing it's not taste made  I can't remember who he who he's doing in videos for me invented the modern way of showing food on  What?  Yeah on you know like insta and Facebook and all you know  It's a top-down where they it's fast and they do recipe in this world and stuff. Yeah, it's a frankenburg  Okay, you know I'm talking about didn't know that yeah  He also worked for BuzzFeed for some time. Yeah, it was the BuzzFeed food thing. Whatever that is. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They created a platform called tasty tasty. That's it. Also you did tasty as BuzzFeeds. That's buzzing invented. Yeah the tasty style

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I asked you have no answer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're on wiki. Welcome to our stream of consciousness where we talk about  And whatever else floats across our minds. What else did the Missouri say? I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Stopped the video. I was so bored

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His last on ze Frank comm his last thing was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  2012 what okay, so they're testing this out. Don't get mad at them Kim layoff  Chill Kylie, we're just trying you can you can still put you know photos of your limp lip plumper working

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It'll be great. And all right, and we know it's not good. I mean we know that so, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop and I loved that's very googly of them to just throw out stuff  That's already pretty craptastic for the public to play with or not tested internally

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and I think they're testing it more widely than they're admitting and  right and  Was it vice who said and the new Instagram will continue until morale improves  Anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, but Leo you should be happy because Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook  Yeah, now since you're finally gonna get the Facebook you want too late, but oh really what they're what what they're doing the Chrono  They're gonna do reels there. Oh good, and that's gonna be the main newsfeed  But then you can go and do your Chrono of just the people, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Incidentally another thing that Zuckerberg said at this meeting transcribed by the verge  there are a lot of people at the company who shouldn't be here and  And I think the employees went what who but wait what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the old look to the right and look to the left one of you won't be here and time to turn the fat

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, man, I remember when I matriculated at a fine  East Coast  Diversity they did say that one in three of you is gonna flunk out and a little did I know I was the one so  I you know, it's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quite the cautionary tale you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You could end up as this don't kids be cool stay in cool stay in school. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what so what they're gonna do chronological as the default yeah, that's down under I put that under quick takes that's the line  47 okay, I don't buy it sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the same the same company that's running Instagram that pretty much said the same thing I don't buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Followers you're no longer defending Instagram. You're kind of finally got to the point where I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have I still go over there because I have a community there  What I'm noticing is a dip in my community engagement and at first I thought it was just me  But it's not just me. And so I started to dig into it a little bit more  Looking at my analytics and whatnot and I noticed that they're not even serving my content up. Hold on  I can show you here cut to my screen on my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What is that a necktie bottle opener?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like it I thought everybody had one on their desk  Let me see if I can make it focus here, but there's like this image here. I have like 3,000 followers or whatever  How come is only reaching a thousand accounts and only reaching?  800 of my followers. Yeah, that's very frustrating  That's stupid, you know  I had I put a post up on the stories just to test it out yesterday or maybe the day before and it's just  a random phrase that I know only a few people would get and one person answered it and  They literally said in the message. We thought you were off of Instagram  Just like that. Why is that if they if you actively follow someone on any of these platforms shouldn't it be?  Prioritized that the people you follow the first thing you see in your feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know you're complaining about the ant and they're getting back at you  Got to behave you've got to behave

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It pisses me off. I'm totally fine with algorithms helping me helping me to discover other things  Yeah, but not not that that the mercy of me losing out on people that I actively want to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know your post on Twitter here this really bugs me if someone follows an account  That followed account should be prioritized in their view. Yeah, and I think that's completely reasonable, you know, you're right  Salt Hank has almost a million

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Followers on Instagram, but by the way, this is that is not whether it's photo or video because I'm noticing it on my reels as well  My reels are doing fairly well from a view standpoint. Yep, but  My people that follow me they're not seeing my reels  it's a bunch of other weird accounts and bots and things that are popping in there and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Honestly, I think this is  clearly  The tick tock application of Instagram and that's what tick tock is right? You don't get more than that  Even when you go to the following tab and you're sounding like me  Jeff you need a moral panic sign

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's more than just  application I  Think it's it's also that Facebook has never had a raise on debt  It never really knew why we have a whole bunch of people. What are they gonna do?  Well, they're gonna date each other then they're gonna have a newsfeed and then they're gonna have videos and then they're gonna live in  real worlds and then we're gonna have videos again and and and they never kind of said this is why Facebook exists at  Instagram too and and they don't have that that that soul  To guide them where they go. So it's the same problem with things like the the oversight board and all that it just it just  Okay, why are you here? What do you want to do?  Do that? Well instead of copying and buying things it's frustrating

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I'm gonna now point you to the article that I'm sure you put in there from Axios by Scott Rosenberg  Yes, I did this now tell us first of all who Scott Rosenberg is because this guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wrote a book. He's he's been around a good long while. He wrote a book about blogging. He knows the culture of online. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I is he that it was he did he start at the examiner? I want to say and then  His history is quite interesting, but he's certainly I was he  Know there's too many Scott Rosenberg's yeah, I feel like he was he was one of the founders of Slate. He's Slate  Yeah, he was I think he was so this guy's been around as long as you know as you and I have been  He says the end of the social network  Mark last week he writes it as the end of the social networking era which began with the rise of Friendster in 2003  That's accurate. Remember how quickly Friendster took over  Shaped two decades of internet growth and now closes with Facebook's rollout of a sweeping tick-tock like redesign  Basically maybe it has also to do with Elon Musk and the Twitter debacle  Well, he says the era in which social networking served as most users primary experience of the internet is moving behind us that holds for Twitter  Facebook's chief surviving Western rival as well is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think this would be the rise of the group chat? You know, ah people have their

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Friends I think you're right aunt, but go ahead Jeff doesn't so go ahead Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think the other thing I'm hearing I'm curious here what you think about this because you are one is  What they keep on talking about is how is the time for creators? So it's not social. It's moved to creators  That's a speckle iron in the warm at your creator and you're angry that's the fork in the road. That's the fork in the road because

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's what's happening is is is  Instagram Facebook tick-tock  YouTube  favoring creators  There that's gonna continue but I think it's the moneymaker. That's that's gonna continue but that's not  one to one  Communication that's one to many communications brought right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scott's saying that's disappearing. So one-to-one is social and that's going away and well, but I think it's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's not going away  It's going underground because when you go on discord for instance, and I think our discord for the club is a perfect example  That's a social network, but it's not Calgary there. I agree. You don't know about it. Yep, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Well, and I think part of it is we all realize that when you turn  social  content like social  I'm trying to different create a different word for this  But your your message is to your friend and family and you turn those into content  Like when you're talking about your day towards your friends or just towards the general public  You're not thinking of yourself as a content creator curator necessarily, right?  Or a content creator rather and I think people just got sick of that unless they're people  this is why journalists love Twitter is because  We're  Content creators, but we're not the kind of content creators. That's creating these highly crafted  Videos and that sort of thing. We're just like sharing our opinions  so the people who like sharing their opinions have taken over social networks because  Influencers, they're not social  It gets you back to like Dunbar's number number and everything. You can't be social to everyone. You're broadcasting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're now broadcasting so I think there's another piece here which is this creation piece  Pardon me for my Jeff history moment. I won't go all the way back to Gutenberg. I'll go to  1600 and Montaigne the  first essayist  You've read them too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yale and Montaigne

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I flunked out of Yale, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So  Montaigne I say in my upcoming book the Gutenberg parenthesis  Raised the bar for taking part in the conversation. You had to become a writer and if you were a writer  Yes, you could get books published and you could you could be part of the public conversation  But if you weren't you were scared of writing if you weren't that literate you were kind of left out for a very long  Time what the internet did I think was changed that the internet said you can use memes you can make emojis  You can you can or you can use emojis you can you can make little videos  You can just make posts you can make tweets. It's all okay, but that wasn't making enough money for folks  so now we're kind of going back to the  Dime store Montaigne is that everybody has to be a creator in a new literacy of online

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have a question for you from the peanut gallery. Can we drink if you say Montaigne? Is that okay? Is that part of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I won't say it  I  Do not I've not brought up Montaigne you brought Montaigne up last week. No, I did not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, which is a lot for a 16th century French essayist  You I swear to you you did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I bring it up last week get him Stacy  She's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right  By the way to confirm what your  Your supposition was and at the end of his Axios piece Scott Rosenberg writes  Facebook's sunsetting of its own social network could open a new space for innovation on this turf where relative newcomers like  Discord are already beginning to thrive. So that's the question I would have I mean, I don't I think ticktocks gonna survive  I think  Instagram might survive  You know Twitter cuz I love Twitter's what's what is different Twitter in its conversation Twitter is conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's not social and Instagram. Is it social?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's social to it's definitely social in my boat. Yeah, I feel like when you're posting on Twitter  It's a hybrid of content create because you're posting for an audience. You're not posting for your friends  Right. That's what this is  I feel like you're posting for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your audience so I feel like on Twitter, you know who you communicate with and you find things that you think that's true  Like what I see is  But that's not necessarily true of like 60 minutes there. No, no posting for an imaginary

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But when it would salt Hank posts to a admittedly large audience  He's posting to his people  And he's very aware of that the people who like what he does  And influencers so it's but it's still broadcast in the sense he's a creator  Yeah, he's still a creator  He tells sense because what you do is you look at how many people follow him and how many people he follows  I want to use him as a produces it. It's people who are influencers content creators  Follow very few people relative the number of people who follow them. It's not it is still broadcast  Whereas if you go into discord  You're following a channel not even individuals you're saying I want to be part, you know, I'm in the the lisp discord  I'm talking with other listeners, right and we and and so that's what you're following is a subject or though  Maybe it's your family auntie's your family have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Discord or anything like that where you all talk we have a slack slack. We have a thing we use slack. Yeah, and it's it's  Everybody's following the same thing and there's different channels in there to talk about different discussions and whatnot

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I would submit that your family's doing that because Facebook no longer served them  interesting, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think? Yes  Well for us it was hangouts  We wanted it. We wanted a group chat where we could have fun amongst ourselves when we're not all in the same room. Yeah  And still just be able to  Socially chat and not always say hey, make sure you clean up your room that right thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know just just have conversation but that wasn't happens in Facebook that wasn't happening in messenger that wasn't happening in WhatsApp, right?  I think it's a social network. That is of that your Dunbar number your 150 your people, right?  Whether it's family or friends and that's to me  More like the future. I don't know. Is it the future of social? I hope so. I like it and then  I'm fine with the smaller number you can still I'm fine with this model. You still have your platforms everywhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I enjoy what I get out of Twitter because it is like you said a bit of a hybrid for someone like me  I I don't follow as many people that follow me and I am either broadcasting or I'm engaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, it's I want to use the Twitter website or the Twitter app. What do you use both?  So my experience now with the Twitter app and website is it's so jammed with recommendations  Accounts, I don't follow it's becoming a lot like Instagram with a lot of crap in it  Yeah, so I use algorithm stuff does becoming very algorithmic  Why I use lists so lists or yeah, I just showed tweet deck  Which I use because it doesn't have the promoted stuff this promoted stuff's driving me crazy on the official Twitter feed  They gotta earn money. I understand they have to earn money. I understand it's getting in the way  So this is by the way why Twitter historically has had problems revenue generating revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's why like what mr. Jarvis said having a list is definitely helpful. I do that. That's all I do  I check lists all day long. Yeah, hardly ever going out. How many lists do you have?  Let's see here because Twitter is open I  Think I have like eight see to me tweet deck. This is see what I'm doing with a deck

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have my home which is my Twitter feed  But then the two lists that I'm following are tech VIPs and top 25 tech reporters, but that will change  Those are columns and they're auto updating. I don't see promoted tweets. I I've been seeing the same tweet  for six months about Elon Musk is more than just boring tunnels and  Whatever is launching Rockets here are his nine favorite books that same promoted tweet  Do you see it? Is it just me? No, I'm just you drives me not I promoted tweets Twitter knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a woman and it yeah, I feel real bad for women  I mean, yeah, you see what Twitter thinks of women don't you huh, but it's it's kind of nice because  Because  Because I'm not that I mean I am a woman who does like things that women like but I don't use Twitter that way  I it's weird to me because they're so jarring. Yeah, it's like  How to cook your family dinner and then I'm back into like networking arguments

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But that's kind of my complaint as well is that the Twitter feed is is full of other stuff so I use tweet deck  Because what I use Twitter for maybe different from you guys, but I like to use it as a newsfeed  I don't yeah me too. Yeah, it's like what's going on  And if you follow the right people or you follow the right lists, then you know what's going on on a list. Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I when I talk when I put something up there, I don't think I'm broadcasting to the world. I think I'm talking to people  Like a show like this just exactly like this you have but that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  An audience when you know because I'm waiting for their responses I'm eager I'm eager to hear what they say  Is this a good point and it's a way that is different. Yeah, and yeah, and I'm eager to hear about like what people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think right and I engage actively in conversations with people too. So so maybe it's the last social network

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe Scott Rosenberg is right, but it's also there is one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Surviving social network, I think they figured out a way if they could figure out a way to make money  I think they figured out a  Fairly decent model. I know you've hated Twitter, but for people who like it it really like Twitter works for me  No, it's a you know, really valuable. I've come around

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because I I think the way I use Twitter has evolved and so I don't hate it anymore. I don't engage in conversation on it  There you go, which for me is a  Is a way of avoiding the negative stuff you guys get a lot out of your conversations, I guess  And I don't pay much attention to the at mentions. I I'm not looking at people talking to me  I'm looking at the broadcasters, I guess you're a broadcaster  Well, but I yeah, you're right when I post on Twitter it is hey, we just put out a new show or you know, it's promotional

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what we're not talking about what which was probably is it our advertisers LinkedIn Oh No, I just quit

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  LinkedIn. I love LinkedIn. I just quit it. What?  Really? Because you had yet. It was its turn. It was his turn  There's nothing wrong with LinkedIn  But I'm not looking for you know what Leo just quit pointcast. Yes  No, I'd like to put out a blog post no, what's the point of me being on LinkedIn

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, good point. Well, so here I actually get a ton like I treat LinkedIn almost like a broadcast network for me  Like Twitter is where I talk to people  But LinkedIn man my stories when I post stories on LinkedIn probably because I'm more technical  You have value not to a yeah broad consumer audience man  Readers love my stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Lisa says the same thing. She gets great engagement and she loves the article. She gets from LinkedIn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, so now mr. LaPorte, I would say you could still still be on leak  Excuse me still be on LinkedIn not necessarily because you're looking for a job, but maybe just part of the networking standpoint of  Growing to it more or something. Yeah, you promote business audience. That's where you're right. Are you not promoting the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care  Do like little audio clips people love those those little

Transcript:  We have a marketing team. We have a social team if they want to do that they can  I do not engage in those kinds of pandering

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Posted on LinkedIn and could you also insult your LinkedIn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't want to be a member of a club that would have me as a member and  Feel that if I have to promote what I'm doing clearly  Really what it is, it's late stage broadcaster. I don't care anymore. I just I give up. Yeah  If I were I think it's your old and introverted. I'm old and introverted another way of saying it. Yeah old

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Introverted and that's why I use these platforms  Because it's easier for me, you know  it's easier for me as an introvert to just broadcast from the keyboard and  Just was way more comfortable versus me going out here in the streets broadcasting myself, you know in the streets  I  Have done my cold calls in my day. Oh, I don't do that. No totally fine  We're doing cold calls to drum up business, but I am much more comfortable  code calling from the phone or  using the keyboard here I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Of course, of course. Yes in tick-tock you you and I'm the future right?  I was on tick-tock before Zuckerberg so I'm there on tick-tock. I part of I think it's not important  But I'm gonna since we're here. I'll bring it up. There have been a couple of stories this week about tick-tock  One using its new is now gone newsfeed to feed Americans  Disinformation and there's now some this is a story from gizmodo leaked documents from within tick-tock reveal how the company  Games out responses to tricky questions. In other words how they handle PR. It's a PR  Trove of PR documents gizmodo got it  tick-tock master messaging and  tick-tock key messages  Both are explanations of press talking points in English  They include a version translated into an unnamed European language  Well gizmodo is not naming the language to protect the sourcing of the document that  small place

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The larger the two  53 page tick-tock master messaging document actually I would love to see this  I don't think it's an indictment of tick-tock every company. No, it's everybody has doesn't say doesn't doesn't every big company do something like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you have Q&A's about what are what are the questions were most vulnerable to yeah, what are our answers to what are yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sure, they'll so among other things you could completely predict this  downplay the parent company bite dance  downplay the China Association its owned by China downplay AI  Emphasize tick-tock as a brand slash platform  Employees should stress that although young people love tick-tock. This is exactly the PR speak  Yeah, you can see it coming from their mouths. Although young people love tick-tock. The app is only for users age 13 and above

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because of course, well, that's an admission way  We've got an admission that people under 13 are using it because how else would they know that they love it? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm a little biased. I and I know you are too Jeff. We love tick-tock  I don't see I could see the potential if they're starting to feed me Chinese propaganda, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what they're convincing you to  take Tide Pods

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  which by the way is  Complete moral panic right? Yes  You know, and you know, this is the end of local, you know local news media, especially local TV loves this so  Kids are eating Tide Pods. Thanks to tick-tock. None of this is yeah, really what's going on on tick-tock

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean the misinformation I see on tick-tock is the same misinformation  I can find on podcasts

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  YouTube  newspapers and magazines and Twitter beans spreading  Yeah, so one of the people actually the fun thing about the cruise is to get to meet our audience  We have a really interesting audience one of the people in our audience and he came down in his dress uniform  At the fancy meal works for the army. I said, well, what do you do? He says I'm in human  I said what human you meant human intelligence human intelligence. I said, oh, that's interesting  He said yeah, was that a little grave? I was an interrogator  whoa  I am very nice to you, sir. Later today. We'll do a demonstration on waterboarding in its uses  But he but he was a sweet guy really nice guy. He was not torturing people. I'm pretty sure  He would work with an interpreter. He said, you know, you get a lot of people who want to tell you stuff  So you you know, yeah, you talk to him  And you know you get there being waterboarded. Well, I don't think he was torturing anybody. He was too sweet a guy  But he did say  with in a darkly ominous tone that  Civilians have no idea the depths that foreign governments are going to to subvert our  democracy to subvert our beliefs to create dissension and and and chaos in this country using  You know a variety of techniques social on the platform. Yeah, I mean this isn't an eye-opener

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But going after the vulnerable who are already being that way and they push them exactly  Push everybody they push a very few and a very few spread that is information. It's all takes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, all you have to do is go to get that is amplified on media. Yeah  And you know what though? I'm more and more convinced whatever that number is the 30% that are mush minds  Have always been that way and always will be that way. Yes, and  Will always be susceptible, but it doesn't have doesn't take Russia or China to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can be also Ellie Bostol points out that that we have a constitution that enables that 30% to end up running the country

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, there is a problem there and a problem that should be probably structurally fixed  Which is that we do have a minority rule situation in the US now  It's even more dramatic because we have essentially have a Supreme Court that is there for life that is unelected  That is essentially going to change the face of American life, but let's not talk about that  Let's talk about pink sauce. We were saying before we'll get no pink sauce  We were saying before the show, but I want to reiterate that recommendation, which Jeff gave us  During the cruise. I was reading allow me to retort Ellie mistol. My STALs  Stunning book a black guy's guide to the Constitution. You were listening to it  I was listening to it recommended on audible because his voice is amazing  And it's very powerful very very hard to disagree with  Absolutely highly recommended my STAL allow me to retort on audibles. Very good  Stacy is there anything better than pink sauce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How about some Google News so you remember the what was he a Wiccan the engineer?  Slash was a  Mystic pagan pagan pagan Blake Lemoine the guy who said oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lambdas become sentient. Well, Google's finally just fired the guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, it's not sentient and you're you're you're not you're not doing us any favors. You're done  No, I have to say I agree with him, right? I mean, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was a right move. Yeah  What about this one this I have a hello doorbell, that's the Google Nest hello trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CNET story. Yes. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Also had an Amazon ring doorbell  Which I maybe foolishly replaced with the Google hello doorbell because we'd heard so much about how ring  Was handing over stuff to local police. Oh, yeah  Well now turns out Google does the same thing without consent yes and without warrants  right Chris

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is an important story and  Rye did a great job here  So he talked to a bunch of camera makers and the two big ones Google and ring  When police have what they they call emergency orders or emergency requests  Tend to be like somebody's dying right right like there's a shooting happening right now or there was a kidnapping or something big  When the police make a request an emergency request  They don't need a warrant they don't need a subpoena and they don't need to tell the user

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They just pull the video because no company wants the headline  There was video this guy being murdered  What was the famous story Jeff in New York City where the poor woman was was well it turned out it was absolutely wrong  Yeah, it's all story. Yeah  Well, then never mind I won't have a say  But yeah, but you know what he wants to be Genevieve's Katie Genovese

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody wants that headline it was a moral panic of his time of its time that people thought that she was being murdered and nobody  Stepped in and that turns out it turns out

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  typical urban legend, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See a four-year-old get murdered on their ring camera and find out that the police could have stopped by the way Google and thanks to

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  the chat room for  Putting this up at 1 45 today released a statement  That they shared with nine to five Google quote Google has clarified the company has never  Exercised its ability to share footage with law enforcement to date  So they haven't done it today, but feels that it is quote important to reserve the right to do so  But in those kinds of cases, do they limit it to that? Yeah in those kinds of cases

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So ring did it 11 times and they told at 11 times last year  They told Senator Markey this in response to a letter that he sent to them  Some things to note about this that I think are really important emergency requests are the same thing that  Hackers abused to get access to people's private Facebook accounts. They spoofed a police officer's  Credentials basically a police station's credentials and said hey, we want an emergency request for these accounts  They got access to private photos and then did a extortion kind of thing  So these are not fail proof or failsafe or whatever the word I'm thinking of is  but  Cool proof  Nothing is  So so that's one these don't happen often what's really upsetting is ring says that they didn't notify the people so like they  Pulled this data. They shared it with the police, but they didn't tell the camera owner that they did this  Actually what they said is when asked if they shared this information with the owner. They didn't respond  So that's not great

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They shared it with the owner, but the owner ignored them. Sorry. They shared it with the police

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't tell the owner until that is wrong. That's right. That's wrong. Yeah. Well, I mean it depends on your point of view  Well, there's no reason that you couldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Save somebody in emergency and tell the people on the camera that they use their camera  That just could go hand-in-hand without any risk  Without any risk they just and they probably should it probably should yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the other thing to note is Arlo got back to them and they were like, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We don't do that ever nor does and then there's nor does you fee right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You feel that has problems wise doesn't do it right wise doesn't do it. So that does have problems  I mean, I guess we could see a four-year-old getting murdered in their front porch with a wise camp  or a wise doorbell, which would be terrible, but  The other thing where was I gonna go with this Oh Oh  If you have a ring doorbell and you do two-way encryption  They can't pull that video. So right could actually stop this by turning a two-way encryption  What's interesting is if you do that with ring ring is very careful to tell you  Hey, then you can't send your ring data to your ring video camera data to other devices in your home and  Certain other features won't work. So most people decide not to do it Apple is there an associated fee with that encryption

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's free question that someday soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Want to say one thing?  Let's you  It's apples to apples or apples to ring  Apple does encrypted end-to-end video as part of their home kit secure video and they have figured out a way ironically  They don't sell a camera  Right, but they do work with Logitech and I can't you fee for their stuff  And you can see that on Apple devices on within their ecosystem  So the they have figured out how to do end-to-end encryption without breaking the features that ring

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cannot do and that could what should the policy be Stacy? What would your prescription be if if you use emergency?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you use emergency  If you answer emergency requests, you should put out a report as a tech company noting when that happens a transparency report  I agree. Yeah a transparency. Yeah, I do think you should tell  Users I can see  If the person is a suspect Oh during the emergency, maybe you didn't want to tell them afterwards. Yeah  Yeah, so I'm like  There's some things that we'd have to figure out how that should look  And I think I think you probably should turn on end-to-end encryption and make it  Easier, I know that means people can't get it  But if you want surveillance video then have your municipality go through the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Process to get those up. So we're not saying it's a bad thing it for police to say it's an emergency a child's being abducted. I  Could we we need that video now ring and for ring to provide it we're not saying that's a bad thing are we  I think that's a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't I think it creates a network of privately owned but publicly accessible  That could be a problem. That's an interesting interesting interesting Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's different different from the city having a camera in London on damn near every corner. It's the city's camera  Well, I'm not real fond of that either

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're not but so there's actually a really interesting case right now in New Orleans  They had stopped using facial recognition, but like two or three years ago  But now because of like an uptick in crime during the pandemic  They voted recently to allow facial recognition on their public cameras  But they did that sort of publicly the same thing that's happening in San Francisco. We talked about it a couple weeks ago. I think  They're looking to use actually San Francisco they're looking to use private cameras for that  But anyway, the point is if you want this sort of surveillance you should have to get that surveillance in a public forum  That's that's the bottom line for me and I don't think can't we people would be so concerned if

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They trusted police  Or government I think the real issue and it's hard to take me seriously when I'm wearing it  Yes, it is. Yes, my head was cold. The real issue is  That we don't trust government or police  To do the right thing with this information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right. That's the fundamental issue. I don't think you could trust anyone to do the right thing  I mean, this is absolute power which we all know corrupts absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You don't you don't want a surveillance state  a so I you know, that's part of the problem, but also and this goes back to Haley Mistel  Who really says if you if you want to solve the problems with police in this country  You just you simply enforce the Fourth Amendment the the right against unreasonable search and seizure this this is covered by the Fourth Amendment  You have a right to privacy  and  We're people are afraid of what an  untamed police force  Which in many jurisdictions is the case  Will do with the access to this kind of video  all kinds of things right I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think this conversation is getting a big  boost from things like the Dobbs decision because now all of a sudden we're recognizing what if you're across the street from an abortion clinic  Right, right  Exactly. So is it an emergency if someone's thinking about having an abortion?  Maybe if you're in Texas, then you're arguing that someone's life is on the line. Yeah, that's exactly right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah some unborn fetus his life is on the line. That's exactly right. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should at least know that it got used once so I can I can tear it out and put in an electric button

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's he talking or or that he's  Has been used to Arlo. Yeah, but again

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  none of this would be an issue if we trusted police and  Because we don't many people rightly so don't I think especially if you're a person of color don't trust police  It doesn't matter what transparency reports or what Google says or what?  You know wise says  This stuff is you're taking these videos  It's out there  And so maybe you it's a shame that property owners need to encrypt to prevent, you know unlawful use of this stuff  But maybe the way we do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then the next flip I'll throw this out there because there's tons of tik-tok videos of people like  Showing off people at their doors like we saw this video  The homeowner right we're going to neighborhood ex guy go into neighborhood

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That app right? Yeah, you know, there's a black man walking up and down the street. Here's the video now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even just like a black person it's like people like often is though in Petaluma

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's some black guy walking around. I don't know if I trust him. That's it. He's taking pictures knock it off

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's why I always wear after your espresso machine. No, it's a shame but and has to wear orange  It's a shame

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do not want to look suspicious. I want you to see me out there. It makes me cry. It's Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's terrible  and so this is all part of that and  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why it's an issue it's got it's it's one of these cases where this is Stacy  This is Stacy's line something we need to talk about  Yes, because there is it there is a different level here where we'll figure out the norms we expect we'll figure out what's right and wrong  But we need you know, it's like scobel going into the men's room at  At IO with his Google Glass on and people freaking out

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I should say next door comm not neighbors next door comm  Phoenix war is in our chat room and as a person of color  Says if I know that my video could prevent my fellow humans from being hurt preventing a kidnapping or murder or anything  I'd be more than happy to help I'd say that much. I agree. We're not saying that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know they have  Not an emergency situation they can totally use that for they can ask you for your data  The police will come to you and be like there's a form they get to fill out and bring  Talks to you and you can share your volunteer. You basically say yeah  You can have my data to solve this crime like there's a bunch of car thieves a car was stolen in front of your camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can we yeah, you know, hey if I had a video that I would share that absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's the other case though. If you're a journalist  You  The norm has been you share with police what you've already shared with the public and no more  But there's an argument to say that that's wrong  Look at what's happening on January 6th if those filmmakers who had followed the proud boys and followed the trumps had said no  We're journalists. Well, you watch our film. That's it. We wouldn't have things that we have so it's it's  What's your right to withhold  In the case of public interest, that's a question. We should debate that is interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, okay  See Stacey. Yeah, so we should talk about that. Yeah, we should talk about that. What is pink sauce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's what people really want to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey if you follow the thing I have I have not fully followed the pink sauce thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so this creator created something called pink sauce. It's got dragon fruit. It's got oils  We don't even know milk solids. Who knows what's in there?  The issue is it went viral she started selling it people started realizing that she was selling it and shipping this but it wasn't consistent  The nutrition labels that were on it seemed really sad and not quite well thought out  So people started doubting both like the nutrition labels and their content as well as the safety of shipping something that contains

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Milk and whatnot honey dragon fruit sunflower seed oil chili. Wait a minute garlic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so this was essentially done out of the trunk of her car basically, that's the fear

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, or or the basement kitchen. I mean look my son

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Salt Hank sells salt, but he bought it from a salt company. Yeah  Legitimately made salt

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, his thing in the backyard or something he's like I found this salt in my backyard  here  So that's that's the issue is she's also added please refrigerate to the label

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There was a typo mixing up the number of grams of product with a number of servings there's  30 servings filled vinegar totally 444 grams instead of 444 servings  She misspelled vinegar. Well, yeah, you know and the video by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It shows the importance of paying attention to detail when you're trying to establish credibility for

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sold out 700 bottles big deal if 700 people get sick from pink sauce

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Nope tablets  Android tablets  Android tablets  Maybe Google is gonna do a tab list. They remember at Google I oh they talked a lot about tablets  oddly and  And of course as we've always said the real flaw in Android tablets is the lack of supporting software  So Google Drive will have multiple windows just like Chrome  You can drag and drop text and images  From apps like Chrome and sheets right into an existing document  Upload files by dragging and dropping them into the Google Drive app  Keep will allow you to insert images  again with drag and drop that is that is you know what much needed and maybe this will transform the  Landscape for Android tablets. It's a good idea have some choices

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crumb with them. It's all about value the  low end cost with tablets is  People that want a tablet. They usually want an iPad right if it's something that you know  Utility wise kind of thing. Yeah, go an Android. It's not cheaper. Yeah

Long before UEFI attacks started being publicly described  This discovery begs a final question if this is what the attackers were using back then  What are they using now?  Probably a nation-state. It's a fairly sophisticated hack  Which means probably?  You're okay unless you work for a three-letter agency. You're a well-known podcaster  that kind of thing  Anyway  Security security time watch out  Watch out as long as we're at we'll talking about that. Here was a bug in the the coding of  Intel's GPU  That made them one one one one hundred times as fast a hundred times slower in ray tracing  You and the only reason people noticed is because they pushed out an update and all of a sudden. Whoa, what happened?  My  GPU's got a hundred times faster. Well, that's not cuz they got a hundred times better  It's cuz they had a bug line of code was missing. That's it a missing line of code

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's how I approach all my jobs. I start out. It's one percent  Yeah, and then once I hit a hundred percent, they're like, what the heck? Yeah, whoo

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Justice for data janitors. This looks like a Jeff Jarvis story to me it it is and I think it's an interesting angle here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the the people you know, whether it's social or whether it's more likely AI  cleaning up data is  Going to be key to quality and credibility and somebody has the dirty job to clean it up literally clean it  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're gonna let an AI do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But what do you mean cleaning? I understand what needs to be cleaned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you have data so like let's take temperature data  They're cleaning up there. They're organizing it. So like if I have a sensor reporting temperature data  Yeah, I got to make sure everybody I'm comparing to they're all reporting Celsius or all report. Oh, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it's just like sweeping up old data that's on the floor  Sanitizing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sanitizing but but it is it what what they're saying here is there is a human role in  Going through this data stuff and the people who do it are usually not employees of Google. They are contract workers  And if the the burden of AI's quality is upon them and they're not treated fairly  Ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Human fueled automation. They never got invited to the parties is what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't get free lunch no, they don't get free lunch health insurance or all these things. I mean, it's a better days  Well, I should unionize  People think they I mean this goes back to this idea that engineers are the kings and everyone else is just there to support them  I mean, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are you upset about the loss of the Choco Taco? I Jeff Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never had one but it feels like that's something you'd be upset about  It feels like something I should be mad about and now  It's maybe Alexis Ohanian. That's a hysterical

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I think I think he's serious. Oh, I'm sure he is a guy's got a lot of money  He founded reddit and now is married to Serena Williams Serena  He says dear Unilever it's kind of gross when you think that Unilever makes the Choco  I think they do it under a better brand name than that. What is the name of the ice cream company?  They made and for many years sold in the in the ice cream truck  You knew and love as a child as they drive around playing the turkey in the straws theme song  Through the neighborhood a ice cream sandwich that had a folded over ice cream cone with a chocolate  sealant inside delicious  melted something peanuts peanuts and  You'd take a bite and Choco Taco heaven  But apparently not enough people love the Choco Taco

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not that the problem is the problem says the company  Yeah, is that they just had to look reduce the the product line because it's so popular. Yeah all of their banks

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, it's made by Klondike. So they're gonna focus on on the Klondike bar or something else  Anyway, Alexis says I'd like to buy the rights to your Choco Taco  I don't what is he thinking though, maybe like a Choco Taco pop-up store on Fifth Avenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think we finally get the Choco Taco truck on every corner. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They promised us that didn't they they did  and then somebody is posted a  Dolly image of quote Renaissance style painting of a Choco Taco rising like he did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He promised that the logo would be made by Dolly in the next week. That's a pretty darn good logo

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm loving it  Although what is that inside my Choco Taco is that chocolate Phoenix kind of looks like it's alive. I don't think that one works

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the green that doesn't work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's roll down. That's not so big. So it's pretty good. Yeah  He says a hundred percent of our future marketing artwork will be generated by AI  This delicious treat from our childhood will see a new day where it will get the treatment it deserves  I feel like this is it pulling an Elon Musk on the Choco Taco  Crowd it's just pulling  He wants to get all the bots out of the Choco Taco  and he's  Willing to put his money where his mouth is  What about the story the sad tragic tale of a seven-year-old whose finger was broken  Because he was moving too fast  Yeah, I booked mark this one  This is course in Russia where they don't have the same OSHA standards for chess playing robots  There's a video, but I don't want to watch it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Robot has been other places has it's been many exhibitions for years. I thought even outside of Russia. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sergey smuggin vice president of Russia chess Federation  Told the Baza Telegram channel robot appears to pounce after it took one of the boys pieces  Rather than waiting for machine to complete move boy opted for a quick riposte  There are certain safety rules and child apparently violated them when he made his move  He did not realize he had first to wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is an extremely rare case

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wait a minute they put it on the child  They're saying the kid was moving too fast and the robot grabbed him held him for several seconds  Before people rushed to help and pulled the finger of the young player from the robot, but the fracture could not be avoided

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Saw the video, but I didn't know they were Soviet Russia

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I didn't know Stacey had an accent  Good Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We need a Russia off here by the way child continued to play the very next day finished the tournament  But but parents have reportedly contacted the public prosecutors office  Could be the end of the line  for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  robot I  Think Stacey should do the next story in her accent. Okay. Okay  We could do the the International Space Station Stacey over to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wait, where are Russia says?  Don't worry  They're gonna keep the ISS alive, right? No, they're gonna do their own ISS. No more international Russia's space station  Russia's dropping out they're gonna can it's gonna take a couple of years  They're gonna continue to fly astronauts up and down because they have an agreement to do so  But and I'm sure we'll talk about this with Rod pylon this week in space  But they said and this is all due to  Pressure the US has put on Russia over the Ukraine situation invasion  The space the US and ESA and Russia had announced they were gonna take the space station down  But but now they're keeping it running they had hoped to keep it running until 2030  Russia  By the way, the space agency is run by a political appointee in this case Yuri Borisov, which is a great Russian name  What is Borisov?  He said during meeting with President Vladimir Putin

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The decision to leave the station has been made. I  Think by that time we will start forming a Russian orbiting station, right Vladimir

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So  Why not it's been a you know, this has been a little bit of a problem a couple of Russian astronauts  Were up there several weeks ago spouting pro-russian anti-ukrainian propaganda  So this has been a little bit of a hot potato went out a nice neighborhood these days. Not a good it's going downhill

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you're stuck in space, you know, you really there's not a lot of politics can't be I think a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Beyond an elevator with a jerk, you know imagine being in space

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But yeah a lot of experts including Scott Kelly who I think holds the record for the longest time aboard the ISS  Agree that this is kind of political  Could be more bluster than real  They said after 2024 where that's kind of vague. So  Can we do the international space station without Russia? It's hard. They a lot of those  support launches come from

Transcript:  The internet is not happy about the leap second

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know about the leap second? I know I skimmed over this headline. So I can't wait to hear about this. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It turns out  Turns out  That the earth is not as consistent as our atomic clocks  Which are very accurate. But what they're measuring is aren't they is the  Amount of time takes the earth to rotate the amount of time the earth takes to revolve around the Sun  That's a day and a year respectively  And every once in a while because the earth isn't all that consistent  They have to add or subtract. I think sometimes a second usually it's adding a leap second  So that the clocks that they're changing the clocks the earth is right  There is always right but so that the clocks match the actual rotation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of the earth. It's like when we change the actual measurement of a kilogram. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Remember, which has gone through several changes, right? Yeah  I remember seeing the official kilogram. I think it was kept in Paris for a long time  I don't know if you saw it when you were there, but they replaced it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you gonna go back in the French accent now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm actually looks like I'm wearing Barney. I don't know what this is in the green hat. Yeah  I have I'm in stuck in my office and I have one of the things I have in my office is hundreds of hats  Since 1972 the world's timekeeping authorities have added a leap second  27 times to the International Atomic Time  The way they do it you may remember this at midnight on New Year's Eve  Instead of going to 23 59 59  They jump to 23 59 60 and then to zero zero zero  But the computers think of the computers it screws the hell out of them  It makes it because they're not set up to allow for this and it's not predictable. That's part of the problem  So computer wizards like  Research scientist Ahmed  Bayagawi of  Facebook parent company meta said we are predicting  That if we don't modify the atomic clock  We should be good for at least 2,000 years before it starts to be weird  Maybe at that point we have to consider a kind of correction  By the way the US National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST and the French equivalent  Bipham the Bureau International de Produs Mésure  Kind of agree  Because they're the ones who have to do it. They're in charge of the global clock system in  2012 the leap second change triggered a massive reddit out outage according to CNET as well as related problems at Mozilla LinkedIn Yelp and  Airline booking service Amadeus help me Amadeus in 2017 a leap second glitch at cloudflare  Knocked out some network  infrastructure servers  Cloud flares software comparing two clocks calculated the time had gone backwards. I  Couldn't figure out what to do  As a result

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We're going backwards

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this is a human thing humans do to make our clocks match to the the planets and  Not good not good  Google has an idea of course Google has a fix  They call it the leap smear  Not the smear go leap smear  It makes the leap second changes in many tiny steps over the course of a day  So instead of a whole second  You're taking nanosecond you're taking out nanoseconds still problematic  That this is a post from Google the Google blog in 2011  Talking about the leap smear

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Know who would have thought it but of course if you think about it  Yeah, having the clocks arbitrarily add a second every once in a while. It's very confusing  Your computer yeah, usually when the leap second is almost due the NTP protocol the time server protocol  Says a server must indicate this to its clients by setting the leap indicator field in its response  This is saying you know the last minute of the day I'll have 61 seconds or 59 seconds  In theory although not in practice leap seconds can go backwards as well as forwards  So when they designed the NTP protocol they added that capability  So instead Google says we applied a patch to the NTP server software on an internal servers not  To set a leap indicator, but to tell a small lie  about the time  Modulating this lie. Oh now it's getting bad. You know you one you tell one lie and then suddenly  Count election balance. Yeah pretty soon. You know the election was fixed  What this did was make sure the lie we were telling our servers about the time wouldn't trigger any undesirable behavior  So I guess Google's been  Been doing this  For a while in  The expo though maybe they just tried it in this experiment we perform two smears one negative and then one positive and  Tested it using about 10,000 servers it worked  It worked. Oh, no, so they have been doing this ever since  The leap smear rules up to up to speed. I think Google says everybody should just do a leap smear instead of a leap year  happily smear oh

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love this almost sounds so made up and it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New technology drives it makes us deliver it makes us develop more precision about our world  So think about like the railroads were the reason why we had to figure out time zones, right?  So if you think about you know  That because we're computing everything we just have to figure out even more granular measures of how to tell time and so it's kind  Of cool true until we blow everything up. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here is  The kibble balance  Which is used to measure the kilogram

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, but they stop that now. It's just a bright constant, right?  Yeah, but I couldn't have seen plank like the facts mr. Max playing max max link to his friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So there was there used to be a cylinder of platinum iridium

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which was the standard triple locked in a vault though, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it was the standard or main so until 2019 and then they used physics instead  This you want to see the old one you could go see it and I think you can go see it in France now  this is the old and notice they seal it because you don't want any any palladium to  Come on a bit decay off of it the international prototype of the kilogram  I guess once in a while they take it out and measure it or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you could use that to tell time actually based on its level and amount of decay. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are very sophisticated you smear the killa ground

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have you used be real do you want to talk about it you care you talked about last week didn't you oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talked about a Sunday Sunday. Oh on Twitter. That's right. Yeah, you're right. Don't want to talk. I've been using it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I saw that I keep missing just so this is it with his light  This is the new social app where you you only take a picture when the you get a notification, okay  It's time and I keep missing my  Time I notice you do too aunt and  So you yeah, cuz it says he was one minute late. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, cuz I'm thinking dang. I thought I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, maybe not today. I did one yesterday was six minutes late

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So the idea is when the thing goes you take a picture uses your front camera and your back camera  You could show can you show this John? It's my over-the-shoulder shot. You get the front camera in the back camera  Here's Mike Elgin and so it gets a selfie and then what you're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't Mike's doing this I'll bet just perfectly  You would

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  John can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has a very interesting life though. Oh, you don't have it done us in

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There we go. Here's the ant taking a picture. Is he one minute late? See it

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Tattles on you the tattles on you. No, he was just he was a leap second ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mike Elgin's in jail now, so that's kind of interesting. Look at that. Yeah, so those are those are my friends and

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Then you can also see what other people are doing you can just the idea is to eliminate the FOMO

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right because you see how crappy people's real lives are except that that's of course. Yeah, not what happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You just get people are very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What is he talking about?  So that's when you can comment on it. You can I'll give you a little a little thumbs up on your real moji

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can do live oh I have to do a real thumbs up. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Okay, you are Trump  I know he's ruined the thumbs up has ruled the thumbs up  Yeah, so I put a real thumb up on there. I'll do that for Mike or maybe I'll do that for someone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was on wait. I want you to do the laughing crying laughing  Okay, yeah, dude  Someone get some onions  Anyway be real I don't know you know what every five minutes somebody comes up with the next big thing in social

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, there's always an effort. You know, but I'm glad there's an effort. It was fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, someone in Twitter mentioned, you know, they don't like the fact that it uses both cameras  It uses their selfie camera in addition to the rear camera and I'm thinking well  Why is it because you're shy or what?  Why is it because you're shy or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There is a potential either you for revealing things you didn't wish to reveal there's some privacy possible  privacy issues because you know your camera is getting  Yeah, you know, you're not controlling exactly the so you really you don't it doesn't post right away  You get to review it, but I still think things might leak through so I understand I  understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Idea that not necessarily being all all about the numbers. I agree. This is I agree  Starting out the way like path did right, you know, yeah, I loved math again. How long will that last?  Yeah, I was sad that they sold paths and it died

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Google has surprised the world with a bid for  NFL  Sunday ticket  This is a these are very expensive rights to Sunday games out-of-market games  Direct TV has them right now. The NFL wants to sell it for more than two and a half billion dollars a year  It was widely that was supposed to be over in June. It was widely rumored that Apple got it, right?  Cuz that you know, this is the problem is that broadcast networks can no longer compete with big techs deep pockets  of course, so Apple Amazon Google all trying to get into sports and  The Sunday ticket is the prime package. Although I suspect, you know, there will be others formula  One is coming on strong in the US. That would be a good one to get  Right now ESPN has the rights to that. So  It was thought that Apple had kind of outbid everybody else Google with a last-minute bid from YouTube  For the rights this would happen next year in 2023 Apple's got to be grinding their teeth  Sports accounts for 95% of the most viewed programs on TV. It's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Important Bob. I was before TV got sucky though. I  Mean like oh, yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have not been a former TV critic as you all know  a former TV guide TV critic I  For the first time in ages just decided the other night to see what's on ABC NBC CBS. Oh my lord. What track?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's not only that vision track interrupted by you know, eight-minute commercial chunks  So there's no continuity. I mean, it's very hard  we've been spoiled frankly by the fact that we can watch stuff on Netflix and on HBO Max and Hulu and so forth and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last last week aunt schooled me  Because I was complained that I have HBO and Showtime and I only watched two show one show on each and he said well  Get rid of them Jarvis until you come back

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now the interesting thing is this is probably just an interim thing because ultimately  NFL  Probably wants to do the streaming themselves and own all rights  Although it's hard to turn down two and a half billion a year for some I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not own it I mean he has their own app NHL does NFL announced their new app this week so they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But it's ridiculous, it's hard to turn away that service they announced that packet of money, right? That's a lot of money

He's gonna be there creator liaison  Which is a good job  Anyway, we'll see what happens Apple is a put courted in the New York Times has the inside  track for the  NFL red zone  Or I'm sorry Sunday ticket red zones different Sunday ticket. Yeah  I'm Amazon ESPN plus YouTube on the hunt  This was delayed apparently because there were negotiations over a concurrent sale of NFL media assets including red zone  NFL Network and NFL plus which is a new subscription service that provides access to live games on mobile only I  Have to think it's a big crock. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you want the big screen you want to see on the big screen?  All right  But II believe it II believe it II believe I think we're good  I think we should move on anything that I missed. Oh, I did miss a big one. Holy crum and um, Lee  Did you talk about this Amazon buying one medical? We did not talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sunday

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a big story. So Amazon story, but Amazon created their own kind of  Healthcare solution which they said oh, don't worry. It's just for our employees  Now with a three point nine billion dollar acquisition of a primary care provider  One medical I think it's pretty clear, you know, they bought pill packs. So they have Amazon pharmacy a sponsor  They have  You know, I mean this is a big deal this if they can fix do something to fix health care. Hallelujah  Well, do you think they would fix it or would they just make it expensive or worse or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in a  Practice here on these because the largest one of the East Coast and it's a factory now. It's just awful. You can't get anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's what they've all turned into  Totally what they've all turned into and that's the that's the insurance problem, right?  You know insurance is cutting back on the amount of money that they can  Collect a scale scale. It's everything. Yeah, in fact because of that  I've I've considered as a lot of people with deep pockets have  maybe paying out of pocket for concierge medical and  I was told oh one medicals the one  Huh, they're out of San Francisco. They're in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, LA, New York  Washington DC  They're a this is according to the Washington Post a subscription based primary care provider  That leans into technology to build what it calls quote a seamless combination of in-person  Digital and virtual care services that are convenient to where people workshop and live  You pay a this is most insurance is accepted well, but you pay an additional fee an annual fee of $199  Oh, well, which isn't bad  I  Think we're rapidly headed. I mean we got a mess. This is privilege also coming in  It's pretty little rich people can so that's the question does Amazon Amazon is a for-profit entity  They're not interested in making health care more universal more affordable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're interested might be interested in making it more accessible to their workers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a way that might be kind of coercive or you would worry that could be course instead of a union

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  either instead of a union or you know get treated by our doctors, but their doctors may be  Interested if you've got an RSI from working at the Amazon warehouse, maybe they're like do this  Yeah, we have all this data on do the company. We have all this data on how to improve this  Yeah, this first and then if that doesn't work, maybe they fire you and then you lose your health care. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Amazon also though has kind of acted like it wants to get into the health care business it built Amazon care  Which was in it as I said initially for employees only  They bought health navigator. They bought pill pack  And now one medical I feel like  They may be more than just employees, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they have a total interest in this space one because they're a huge employer, but two I don't think they're like  The US health care system allows middlemen to profit exorbitantly  And it would be silly not to take advantage of that the king of the middlemen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon right? Yeah, right. It says here  We're an employee benefit for 8,000 companies including Airbnb all birds NASDAQ and Google. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Interesting wouldn't it be funny if Amazon ran Google's health care a lot of information in there. What does HIPAA protect?  I mean if you're if you own one medical  Do you have access to the medical information of all the customers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On an individual basis, I don't think so. No, I mean aren't you protected there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You obviously know have the data because you're serving the people but what you do with it is the question, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you would have data like X number like and it could be  De-anonymized kind of like you would have like X percentage of people have this kind of cost associate have C sections every year  So in your practice, you've got 20 C sections  You know and the rarer your treatment the more likely you are to be  De-anonymized.
