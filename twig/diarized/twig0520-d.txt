Transcript:  It's time for Twig! This week in Google we're just off Samsung's Note 10 announcement.  Actually, Samsung announced a few things. We'll break it all down for you,  talk about Elizabeth Warren's plan for world broadband,  and Google's little trick, it's pulling on the European Commission.  It's all coming up next. Plus a surprise appearance from Ant Pro.  It's all coming up next on Twig!  Netcasts you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just fill and chill.  Check out Epson.com slash EcotankLeo to learn more.  It's time for Twig! This week in Google, the show where we cover the latest in the Googleverse.  That includes Facebook, Twitter, journalism, chips, IoT, whatever.  Whatever our expert panel wants to talk about.  Starting with Stacey Higginbotham of Stacey on IoT.com.  Hello y'all!  Hello Stacey! How are you?  Yay!  Stacey's already broken in because we just covered the Samsung event.  And we will talk about that in just a little bit, the new Note 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if I care for the idea of being broken in.  Like a good shoe, Stacey. Like a fun, cool shoe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's Jeff Jarvis. He is on the road again.  He's in Palo Alto, BuzzMachine.com.  The hardest working man in journalism school, J-School.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Full disclosure is I'm here for tomorrow, a one day thing on the Facebook oversight board.  They're paying for the hotel, but I haven't received anything else from Facebook personally in any way or any platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is part of that journalism initiative that they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, this is the oversight board about how they do content moderation.  Oh! You're on that board?  I'm taking a lot more interest. No, no, I'm not on the board, but they have these meetings where they're trying to get input.  They did a big report about it.  And I'm getting more and more involved, whether I like it or not, in policy.  So that's my disclosure.  But we have another important test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our newest twit.  Ant Pruitt is in the house.  We love Ant, Tech Republic writer.  He's got his own YouTube channel and he's been on many of our shows, including this show, many times the last few years.  Somehow, I don't know how, Lisa convinced Ant and the family to move out from North Carolina.  They're going to be coming to Petaluma and being part of the twit family.  I'm so thrilled. That's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so excited. More Ant!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ant was sitting over there studying.  I guess he's getting ready to take over.  And I said, well, come on onto the show. Get on this show.  As long as you're here, let's do it.  But full disclosure, you didn't know and you weren't prepared.  You're going to do this off the cuff with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Neither are we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Neither are we.  So Jeff and Stacey were both here.  Actually, you were here too watching the Samsung Unpacked 2019 event where they announced a surprisingly large number of products.  We knew they were going to announce a Note 10 and a Note 10 Plus.  And there really were no surprises there.  It's a pretty nice looking phablet, if you can still use that phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was the phone even the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a little bit.  I mean, that was the sensible part for the 6.3 inch, 6.8 inch Note with the stylus.  What do you think the story was, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the idea of the tablets, you know, because it seems like we already knew what the phone was going to be about.  There was no surprises there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true. That had all been leaked.  The S6 had actually been announced, but they gave us more details on that.  Really, the big surprise was to see Microsoft CEO Sachin Nadella stride on stage.  Even after there was already a Microsoft VP demonstrating.  There's an app called Your Phone in Windows that lets you pair a Samsung or other Android phone with your Windows machine so you can see the Samsung screen, get text, make phone calls.  There's going to be, I guess, a tighter integration.  They'll also be part of the Samsung Dex.  That's their desktop environment where you dock your phone or connect it with a USB-C cable to a monitor, a keyboard and mouse.  And suddenly you've got a PC.  It'll also work with Windows PCs now so that you'll, in effect, you were confused by that, Stacey, and I don't blame you.  It looked like you had a Samsung on top of your Windows, kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I still, I mean, I get the utility of having, bringing things from my phone to my computer very easily because you're like, oh, I'm working on an email.  Then you're like, oh, I got to take this out. But I was really, other than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's kind of what Apple does, which is continuity, which is the idea that you can be working on a phone and then it will automatically just do a handoff to the Mac or vice versa.  By the way, they did say PC or Mac, ScooterXRChatmod is saying.  So it wasn't that they're excluding the Macintosh.  It wasn't that Microsoft has some special relationship.  And frankly, I would guess it goes both ways.  That Microsoft isn't going to say, well, we're only going to work with Samsung.  Microsoft's current strategy is to work everywhere their users are.  Mac, PC, Android, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For this Dex to continue to be a feature, I'd like to know what are the numbers on use.  Adoption. Who's using that?  Because they went from the dock to now just a regular dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Although you've been able.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like just a cord. Was it just a USB cord?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's what's unclear.  You can buy for, well, this is a little pricey.  Samsung makes a Dex USB-C cable.  But I was able to buy it.  Let me see if I can find it here.  A cheap like, yeah, here's a $25 Dex adapter that comes with what you really need.  Extra ports.  Yeah. Well, it's not extra in a sense because remember you're connecting a keyboard, mouse and monitor to it.  But I guess there's one extra. There's a type-C.  That's 45 bucks. I paid, or I'm sorry, 25 bucks.  I paid, I think, $15 for one. They all work about the same.  You don't need to buy Samsung's expensive Dex puck to do this.  Actually, this looks like a really good one. I might order another one.  You can never have to take out the USB-C power in.  Since I never use it. Oh yeah. That's what the USB-C for. You're absolutely right.  That's power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm using that right now. I'm using a J5 Create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah. On what? On your?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now. So that way I can put the headset in and I'm using ethernet and it's powered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm using my Dell external monitor with USB-C, which has been my new favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm using my Surface Studio for the very last time.  You don't want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm giving it to Ant.  My precious. Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to be his desktop at work.  And then I have ordered a new Lenovo. It's kind of equivalent, but more modern, more up to date and about a thousand bucks less than the Surface.  And it has a pen just like, you know, everybody's got a pen now.  That was actually one of the things I was curious about with the Note. I have the Samsung Galaxy S10. Love it.  It's a nice phone. Does everything I want. Is an 855 Snapdragon in here.  I thought, what am I going to need the Note 10 for?  But they kind of won me over with the pen because a pen looks like you can make gestures.  You can write and it will convert your text to your handwriting to text, which is not new, but it's.  Yeah, Tulsi's my handwriting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of people that really dig that style is, you know, you and I, we talked about Mrs.  Pruitt and her affinity for the note until she got a hold of vanilla Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was an interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, tell me that. Got a hold of vanilla Android.  Got a pixel, right?  Yeah, I got her a pixel a couple of years ago and the Note 8, I believe, came out and I remember her loving the Note.  So I said, I'll just get her to Note 8. Got her to Note 8.  She was like, what is all of this stuff?  Yeah.  You know, so she was like, can I just have a pixel again?  And I got her a pixel and we came to the conclusion she really loved the stylus with the Note because she does a whole lot of note taking and keeping her day squared away.  So does she miss the note? Does she want to go back?  If only it was clean like vanilla Android.  She's made that very clear.  Yeah.  Yeah. Why doesn't Google pop a stylus in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That might actually be kind of nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also interesting and ScooterX reminds me that they talked, Samsung talked about gaming and how gaming, especially on a big phone like that 6.8 inch phone.  Plenty of horsepower.  Yeah, and lots of horsepower is really now moving to mobile.  They said they're building Discord, the chat client, into their Samsung phones.  So they have a partnership with Discord, which is a little discordant, if you'll forgive me.  I wonder if...  Worm shot.  You know, first of all, you can easily add a Discord app to your phone.  I don't know why you need to have it built in, but I guess because it can be used while you're gaming.  But who wants to do that? I mean, you're gaming.  How are you gaming and chatting at the same time?  They said you could say GG now.  I don't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The millennials can figure that out, I guess.  I guess that's who it's for.  Yeah, we're out of that league.  I'm too old for this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I actually had that feeling watching because they brought in a bunch of influencers, travel bloggers.  Basically, it was a bunch of Instagram and YouTube stars, right, to demonstrate the features of it.  And it really did feel like it was more for that crowd.  I thought it really interesting instead of using pre-built Snapchat style filters with Instagram or Snapchat or whatever platform you're using,  You can actually use the pen to draw a new filter that would just like the Snapchat filters sync up with the face, move with the face.  You could create 3D images in real time of something sitting in front of you.  That was impressive.  Animate it with your motions.  That was impressive.  But isn't this the same processor we've seen all year, Stacey, the Snapdragon 855?  I mean, it's a pretty cool processor.  I mean, why anybody could do this, right?  Oh, wait, what?  Isn't this the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855?  We lost her at Snapchat.  No, no.  Sorry, I was just influencing.  I apologize.  I was reading ship stats.  That's what I want you to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm going to you for.  I knew it was coming.  I was like, hurry up, Stacey.  Well, OK, I apologize because we just got all this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did announce a new Exynos, which according to a non-tech, and this, of course, will be for the international version of the note,  according to a non-tech is not a big difference from the existing Exynos, the 9825.  No, it is.  It's 7 nanometers.  I was going to say the only difference is, it's actually a really big difference.  And it could be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's their first 7 nanometer chip.  It's their first 7 nanometer chip built using EUV, which is extreme ultraviolet lithography, which is a way to deal with leakage on the chips.  But it's a brand new manufacturing process.  You know what that means.  It could be good.  It could be bad.  But yeah, it might be dicey.  So I was going to say it is just a smaller version.  So they moved down of the 8 nanometer.  It's also a different.  Yeah, it's the same chip.  Made it 7 nanometers.  So I don't know.  I mean, who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No one knows.  It's new.  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They kept the cores like the frequencies.  They kept those mostly the same.  So it's not like you're going to see a sudden power boost here.  I think.  What did they change?  Yeah, it's basically the same except at the middle course.  They're going to go from 2.1 to 3.5.  From 3.1 gigahertz to 2.4 gigahertz for those of you guys who are accounting all your hertz here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think they're going to put in a dedicated AI or DSP kind of like Google does with their Pixel phones for photography?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now they have the Mali, the ARM Mali-Core.  They've built their own GPU, which is probably good enough.  I mean, even though Google's got their dedicated processor,  I don't think we know the workloads yet on the phones that are going to need this.  Like some of the things they're showing might benefit from a slightly different chip design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they're just not that new, really.  I mean, we've seen Adobe was able to do this with an iPhone, do the 3D mapping three or four years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm thinking about things like handling the zoom in on the mic.  I'm trying to think about like, and you've got the fingerprint recognition.  I don't know how like, do you train it and then that model just gets executed?  Are you training it all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One thing that is new is there is a time of flight sensor on the back of the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does the iPhone have a time of flight sensor for tracking your face or do they use a different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they paint your face with red dots.  The infrared dot projection to give you.  So the both have kind of the same purpose, which is to get depth information.  Time of flight measures the time it takes to bounce stuff off of you as opposed to.  Sonar.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, it's what was in your lighthouse camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  It was a time of flight sensor.  Yeah.  So the North America, China and Japan will get the Snapdragon 855 Europe and the rest of the world is Exynos 9825.  I do have to say people have been complaining about the Exynos version of the Galaxy S10.  That it has it's got issues and sluggish at times.  Yeah.  And I'm trying to remember what some of the other issues were.  People were not happy with the camera in the Exynos version.  It couldn't it couldn't do as good a job as the camera in the Qualcomm version.  Six point three and six point eight inches, twelve hundred nits brightness.  That's a nice bright. That's a very bright screen.  HDR plus.  The Samsung makes the best screens ever.  Eight gigs of RAM in the small version.  The plus will have twelve gigs of RAM.  Internal storage, 256 gigs or five, twelve gigs on the plus if you want to pay for it.  Plus, it looks like no micro SD card in the note 10 only in the note 10 plus.  So for a lot of people, you're going to want to go with a hoax.  Hoax 10 plus because they also mentioned 45 watt charging.  That's note 10 plus only.  Oh, really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why screw us people with smaller hands over or people with pockets that are not small hands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People are not good people.  Hey, I didn't say that.  We should get rid of all the small hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People with tiny hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not allowed to run for office. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, look at the size of that man's hands.  They're huge.  I just if you just show your hands, everybody, I have the smallest hands.  I bet I'm even smaller than you, Stacey.  Show me.  Show. I have deep. Look at that.  Look at that. She's got monster hands.  So I'm a small hand. I admit it.  Stacey, you're OK.  I have a quarter octave reach on the piano, but I like a big phone.  I cannot lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do not like big phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love them.  Just I love the larger screen.  You're a big guy, though.  You're six to well, but still even when I'm dealing with my creative stuff, I love the extra.  Well, that's what they're putting in.  Would you ever edit video on that?  I just edited one while watching the live stream.  So he's the young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, yes, I am not the young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still like the idea that they were trying to have the influences out there and pushing it and whatnot.  But I think someone can still team up with them like Adobe to bring out all of this extra horsepower.  Rush on this would look great.  Rush would look good.  But I was thinking more along Adobe Capture, because I've used Capture to capture.  That's the one that has the 3D.  You can pick up textures and things like that, but use that to scan a laptop or whatever and pull it into Dimension.  Isn't it interesting that Samsung is building in that capability and video editing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to come with a phone, a Samsung tool to cut.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At least it's trying to give me a thousand dollars worth of tool.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good point.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The biggest battery will be in the 10 plus 43 milliamp hours.  4300 milliamp hours.  That's a lot.  43 amp hours.  A 10 megapixel dual pixel front camera, F2.2 with 4K video.  That's the front camera, though.  Of course, the rear cameras, well, there will be three of them.  Effective angle of shooting will be 77, 123, and 45 will be the telephoto.  So you have a very wide angle, 123 degree wide angle.  A telephoto 45 degree, and the middle will be a 77 degree.  The middle camera is the one with all of the features, the big size pixels, the tri-stack CMOS sensor, the adjustable aperture.  It could go down to F1.5, which I think is very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's nice, but if you don't know how to focus, that's no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't you love, though, that you can have bokeh in both stills and video?  Real-time bokeh?  I did not know what bokeh was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you don't know how to focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to give you a bokeh.  It's the blurry background.  Skype does that.  Skype does it now, but Skype does a terrible job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, theirs really looks unnatural.  It looks so bad.  Some people can use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The point is you can do it in software now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the story with this phone.  Look at all the cool crap you can do with software.  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It will use, as I said, the time of flight sensor, and that's how it's going to do.  See, we were able to do that Adobe scanning without that depth sensor.  I imagine it will be better if you have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems like it would be a lot better now.  Additional information.  And there's such a high demand for designers today with 3D objects, whether it's gaming or whether it's for marketing.  Even if you kind of get a rough image, you at least get an image you can show and share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's going to be very interesting.  I really do want to play with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember that the naked mirror, which does a 3D scan of your body and then talks to you about weight loss and that sort of thing?  Do you guys remember that, or am I the only one who...  I'm trying to forget.  I don't remember that.  The point is having that on your phone is pretty powerful for things like, hey, will this furniture fit in my room?  Will these clothes fit me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just use my phone to measure me for shirts.  Yeah.  Is that wild? You put it on the ground and then you stand in front of it.  They give you an outline and you stand and you do a profile and you do a phone.  I ordered the shirt. We'll see how well it does.  It's pretty cool.  If it actually gives me a custom tailored shirt, I'll be blown away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sort of thing, making that commonplace in the models that are generated by that accessible, that's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially for people with long arms like me, that would really make my day because I hate shopping just for that reason right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There will be 5G variants of both phones, $100 extra for the Note 10, $200 extra for the Note 10 Plus.  But Stacey, you don't think somebody should run out and get a 5G phone today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. We don't know how it's going to handle battery life, the antennas.  This is the first iteration of the technology. It's not going to be awesome in your phone.  And there's really not a compelling reason for most people to do this because you're going to hit a bandwidth cap or you're going to be, you know,  throttled down. So they'll do it. Wait till next year's devices come out with 5G. They'll be cheaper. They'll be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's no point in doing it if your carrier doesn't offer 5G in your neck of the woods at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, there's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many markets is it in yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how many markets. And it depends on where you are in the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. You could say Providence, which is supposedly a 5G market.  But I bet you my mom just out, you know, just outside of town limits, she's not going to get it. You probably have to be downtown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And again, I don't think you need it.  Somebody I was talking to said something really smart, which is I really wish the carriers would stop focusing on, you know,  getting the fastest speeds in just a few places and bring every place that sucks up to like a middle level.  So why not just have consistency?  Yeah, consistently good service as opposed to like these pockets of like, I can download an entire season of Game of Thrones in 20 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a wireless, but unwired. Elizabeth Warren put out an initial proposal today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I loved her proposal. I think we bookmarked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So I want to read the actual proposal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, OK. We'll talk. Let's defer that till we finish the Note 10 because I do want to talk about it.  I read it and I thought, yeah, but maybe not.  And so we'll talk about it. And again, it's a proposal from a presidential candidate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And even if she got elected, she might not even be able to make it happen because presidential candidates promise many things, often few of them.  Really?  Materialize. Really?  True that.  Really? Really? You can explain this to your kids later.  So don't get all excited about the 5G model unless you really know you're in a 5G neighborhood and you've already got it.  Verizon says they're going to do it in 50 cities by the end of this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We said the same thing about 4G on the first iteration.  Don't get your hopes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also the antennas are not ready yet. So this generation is not going to be kind to your phone, your battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not the one you want. It's not the 5G phone you want.  They're sticking with what I consider a subpar ultrasonic fingerprint sensor through the screen.  I don't like it on the S10+. It doesn't work very reliably.  I've seen now the future of under-screen fingerprint readers on the OnePlus 7 Pro.  I've talked about this before. It's fast. It's accurate.  It is not ultrasonic. It's optical. And it works really, really well.  So I'm a little disappointed. I guess Samsung probably is committed to these sensors and it's going to take them a while to change.  Heart rate sensor. Their face unlock is built in. I use that actually as much on my S10+.  Qualcomm QC 2.0 fast charging on the Qualcomm processors.  USB PD power delivery.  Wireless charging. Reverse charging, which is the weird thing that Samsung does.  Where you could charge stuff on the back of your Samsung phone like your earbuds.  It's expensive. Starting price $949 for the low-end Note 10.  $1099 for the Note 10 Plus with 256GB storage.  If you want to max it out, 512GB storage will cost you $1199.  But I'll probably do that because...  Just had a heart attack.  It does come in, Stacey was very pleased to learn, iridescent, shimmery color.  As well as pink.  Mother of Pearl.  I think we should call it shimmer.  Shimmer is good. Shimmer is good.  Comes in shimmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shimmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Shimmer.  It's the first time Samsung has gone for a non-central camera positioning.  I'll show you. I have the S10 and the camera is horizontal across the top.  Now it's going to be more like an iPhone where it's over on the side.  But they had to probably to make room for these extra sensors like the time of flight sensor.  Which apparently is not available on the Note 10, just the Note 10 Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It won't make a difference in your composition.  No.  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're looking at the biggest sensor.  The screen is a great viewfinder.  It's the best viewfinder possible.  Aura Glow is that color. That's what they call it.  Aura White and Aura Black. Those will all be available August 23rd.  I think pre-orders start tomorrow.  So get your finger ready. Get your credit card warmed up.  If you're going to buy one of these.  I guess I will and Jason Howell will because it's our job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's our job.  You say that with such pain.  Oh, it hurts me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what, Ant? This is a very expensive time of year for me.  I have to buy this, I have to buy the Apple phone, the Pixel phone.  I'm going to have to buy that Samsung notebook.  I hope we grow both Pixel soon.  Yeah, no, we're waiting to hear though.  Maybe we will. I know we're due for a Pixel.  I honestly think you should watch because Samsung also announced the Samsung laptop, the S.  And that actually looks kind of interesting.  It's very thin. It's a little heavier than it ought to be. 2.11 pounds.  But the thing that is most interesting is 23 hours battery life because it's on an ARM chip.  I presume it's on what we talked about it, didn't we?  The new Qualcomm CX part.  Tell us about that, Stacey. You're an expert on these chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the Qualcomm, the eight. What is it? The eight?  You keep surprising me. I'm reading about the broadband.  Stacey, wake up. Stop reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stop reading.  No, I know. You believe in preparation.  That's my problem and I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's OK. I thought we were done with that.  Were we? Maybe we were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just I want to know if that's going to be a desktop class processor.  That's really my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're comparing it. The benchmarking I've seen is against the Intel Core i5, which is an additional chip, but it's not like a high end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but it's a good enough chip. I'd be very happy if it's i5 speed.  Yeah, I take that.  So I'm like a 64 bit. Its clock rate is 2.8 gigahertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's it. It's got an integrated Qualcomm GPU in it.  So it's an Adreno 680.  And I'll tell you why I'm nervous because I did buy one of the very first ARM Windows machines, the HP Nvx2, and it was literally unusable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, really sluggishly slow.  I like the form factor. Love the form factor.  Oh, you know what might be the issue though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Is did how many Windows apps when yours was out were configured for the ARM 64?  That may be part of the problem, right?  You've got to get an ARM, not only an ARM OS, but ARM apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Otherwise you're running an emulation.  Well, but so they weren't the ARM Windows apps were for 32 bit cores for the longest time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're just doing the 64 bit when they.  I mean, the 64 bit ARM cores have only been out for a couple of years.  So what you're saying is I should fire that sucker up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should buy one and see how it works.  Because this could be easy for you to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only $999.  Only $1,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In a way, I'm glad Samsung decided to not lowball it because you can't get a 64 bit ARM.  You can't get a good laptop for less than a thousand bucks.  That's a reasonable price for something like this.  Unless you just want a Netflix machine.  Right.  I'll be very interested to see if this processor, the 8CX, will.  It is seven nanometers.  It is designed for computers.  It's not a mobile part.  And it doesn't require a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  23 hours of battery life.  Now, a lot of people said, oh yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.  But actually, that's the whole point of ARM, isn't it?  All day battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll say I'll believe it when I see it because, first of all, are they basing it on it just sitting around idle?  They're saying continuous video playback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not the most challenging thing.  But it is.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Netflix, I mean even this.  A browser and a bunch of other windows that would use more.  Even this beast of a machine right here from MSI.  I believe it's out at 16 hours of battery life.  It is?  That's what they tout it for.  That's a joke.  I'm getting nowhere near that.  I can tell you that just looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, like why would you feel the heat right here?  I don't.  Yeah.  But see, this is, and it has LTE, gigabit LTE built into it.  So this is really a mobile.  This is to compete with the MacBook Air basically.  Which is, which has pretty good battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which Apple just refreshed.  And it wasn't awesome.  I'll be honest.  I actually returned my MacBook Air for a MacBook Pro.  Because it was just, I was like, why am I spending so much money on this?  So underpowered.  All right.  And I should say the Qualcomm 8 whatever is using the Arm 76 core.  Which is actually a really powerful.  A76 is a really powerful core.  That they actually use in server class, servers and even some like gateway equipment.  So this is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Samsung said 40% faster CPU, 80% better graphics performance and improve memory bandwidth.  I'm reading the Verge's piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Memory bandwidth.  Yeah.  That's how fast your data gets through.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's all about the IOS bus.  13.3 inch display, 10 point multi-touch.  Comes with 256 gigs or 512 gigs of storage.  But you could go all the way up to one terabyte.  But most importantly to me, it will come in pink and gray.  Is the pink for everyone?  It's for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I thought it was only for certain markets.  Certain specs too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's for certain people and certain markets.  But I would get it in pink.  Gray is boring.  Gray is boring.  I need something to distinguish from my other computers.  It's not bright pink.  It's not like your fingernail polish.  It's kind of a rosy glow.  Is it rose gold?  It's rose rose.  Pretty close to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the name of the Pixel 3A color?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mostly pink, nearly pink sort of pink.  Nearly purple?  Nearly.  Not quite pink.  It's kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This looks really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Call me when it comes in shimmer.  Shimmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do like the shimmer.  Stacey, you deserve shimmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The abalone shell shimmer.  Nothing less than shimmer for Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Green buttons is at best.  Blush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said on stage, this is an interesting quote.  It looks like a laptop but has the essence of a smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's foldable too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's very Markley-speak.  Does that mean it's super portable and you just take it with you all the time?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's our age-old complaint as content creators.  Sometimes you want something you can just fling out like a smartphone.  And since it's always connected, you don't have to mess with things,  but you could type in and have it be connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the one journalists, the press, take to events like this, frankly.  Yeah.  Something light enough.  If it's good.  If you can type on it.  It's not laden with ports.  It's got a headphone jack and a Type-C port on one side,  Type-C port on the other side, and that's it.  So it's kind of like the Pixelbook with the dual-sided type-C.  I wish we had a card reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  I bought my...  I now have three or four card reader dongles that I stick in,  but I have an on-card one that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Type-C is...  The good news is everything's going Type-C, so this is a reasonable investment now.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So just buy a whole bunch of dongles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I even bought...  I'm so in on it.  I even bought a Type-C YubiKey.  Wow.  Yeah, this is the future.  So why get a Type-A YubiKey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not far behind on these, so I had to...  This is so small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Look at the size of the YubiKey that's got this headset today.  Look what I have tethered to it.  It's tethered as a little adapter so I could still use it.  Nice.  Isn't that cute?  I lost the first one, so I got one with a leash.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw a Type-C in a outlet.  You know how you can stick USB into outlets now?  Yeah.  So they've got Type-C as part of outlets so you can change out in your house.  That's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody who bought the Type-A outlets, really sad.  Now I need a dongle for my outlet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  So, okay, I think we've said everything there is to be said about the Samsung event.  It came off fairly well.  There were no dancers, no sing...  It was a little bit of singing.  Oh, no, that was Stacey.  That was me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not going to ask me about chips again because I'm going to go back to the broadband  plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go read the broadband plan.  Go read up on Elizabeth Warren's broadband plan because that's our next topic of conversation.  And again, even though Satya Nadella was there, it was a typical Satya Nadella speech, which  is just kind of airy-fairy and didn't really say anything.  But I have a feeling...  He spoke in circles.  It's significant that he's there.  It's like you got the CEO of Microsoft on stage at a Samsung event.  That's Microsoft saying, you know, we're really, we're working on something.  We're serious about this.  We're serious about this.  Yeah.  And kudos to Mary Jo and Paul, who had heard rumors Microsoft would be there and they heard  that it would be a really big executive, but both of them said, oh, there's no way it couldn't  be Satya Nadella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think you know that during the live stream saying this is Microsoft saying, you  know, we're done with phones.  We got bigger and better things such as services to worry about, and we can really blow up  with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think that's what Nadella's been doing since he came in.  And I think very, very smart.  All right.  Let's take a little break.  When we come back, we're going to take a secret peek.  Thanks to Fast Company inside Google's top secret design lab.  We'll hear Elizabeth Warren's proposal for a broadband plan.  You know, whether you agree with it or disagree with it, the fact that any presidential candidate  even brought this up makes me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Joe Biden did bring it up.  So has your buddy Amy Klobuchar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My buddy.  I wish you were my buddy.  She seems like she'd be.  She's Minnesota nice.  She'd be fun to hang out with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She'd bring you a hot dish and talk about broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Honestly, I think that's what America needs is a hot dish and broadband.  A hot dish and broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Open the door.  Yeah, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by my printer.  I love my Epson EcoTank printer.  I love it.  I love it.  For several reasons.  You know, you've been a photographer a long time and maybe you remember, I remember very well,  Epson's always been the best photographic printers.  I remember going on a Lightroom adventure.  We had a bunch of Epson printers and I knew photographers that would take their black  and white Epson printers.  They're the only printers really for monochrome prints and they would have big tanks on the  side of them.  And I think that was an aftermarket thing, although maybe Epson eventually did offer it.  But it just made sense.  If you're making prints, the last thing in the middle of the print, you want to have  happen is the ink cartridge to run out.  That prints ruined.  Bad streaks.  And that paper is expensive.  So they were using tanks way back when.  Well, now Epson's brought that home.  And I think this is huge because what they're really doing is they're saying, you know what?  We care more about our customers than our bottom line here.  You can kiss expensive ink cartridges goodbye.  No more trips to the store in the middle of a print job.  Epson's amazing EcoTank wireless color all in one super tank printers come with a ridiculous  amount of ink in the box.  Thousands of pages worth.  Probably won't have to go get more ink for a year or two.  We've had our EcoTank for a couple of years now.  I actually have not yet bought a second load of ink.  The supersized, easy to fill tanks mean fewer trips to the store, less frustration to you.  And you know what?  Epson wants your printing experience to be stress free and easy.  And by the way, look at those bottles.  They're uniquely keyed so you can't use the wrong one.  They're auto stop.  So it's really easy.  I've already, because we have two EcoTank printers at home, filled two of them.  And it's simple.  I was a little nervous.  Nope.  No must, no fuss.  EcoTank is changing the way people print.  Get the compact EcoTank printer for your home or office so you can just fill and chill.  There's a model for everybody.  7,500 black pages, 6,000 color pages with that ink.  That's incredible.  I use it to scan.  I use it to print.  It supports Google Print.  Really a good printer.  Check out epson.com slash EcoTank Leo today to transform the way your home or office prints.  No more.  Look, look, Shaq says just fill and chill.  You're going to do which, you know, I got to say, Shaq's making that printer look awfully small.  But remember, he's got a three foot wide hand.  So I'm just saying, check out epson.com slash EcoTank Leo to get your, you're going to love it, your Epson EcoTank printer.  In fact, just in time for back to school through September 30th, you can get it right now.  Free overnight shipping.  But you have to use the promo code EcoTank Leo at checkout.

Because that's the best photo producer.  It's the standard.  Yeah.  All right.  Have you had time to read the proposal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can't find the proposal.  So what I found is people talking about the proposal.  Oh, so I don't know where she has issued the proposal.  It's not on our website yet.  All right.  So interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One thing I have to admire about her and I wish every candidate would do.  She's been very clear about her policies.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know how you could vote for somebody who didn't have a very clearly spelled out  so you know what you're getting.  Right.  Admitting that, I got to point out you can propose this till the cows come home.  Even if you get elected doesn't mean it's going to happen.  Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all expensive and there's lots of spots.  But what it does though, it enters things into the debate.  And I liked the idea that the internet should be a right.  She proposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me just say what she's proposing to earmark 85 billion in federal funding to expand broadband  networks in rural areas.  Now, this isn't new.  I think the FCC has a rural broadband plan.  I don't know how much work they just announced a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In fact, they right now have 4.6 billion a year to fund rural broadband and the rural  utility service, according to Engadget, doles out 800 million a year in grants and loans.  But this is significantly more.  The five billion dollar funding for expanded broadband on Native American lands alone would  surpass what the FCC currently offers in total each year.  About half of Native Americans on reservations or other tribal lands don't have broadband  access.  I think this acknowledges broadband now needs to be a right.  A standard.  In fact, the United Nations says broadband's a right.  It needs to be a right in this country though.  Because it's not a privilege.  It's how you interact with government, if nothing else.  Right.  She wants to see how you can apply for jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's all these studies like only 30 percent of jobs aren't sorry.  Let me read you that.  Seventy percent of jobs are only available and you can only apply to them online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So did you finish talking about the plan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not yet.  And apparently her plan is on medium.  So go to the Team Warren medium post.  My plan for rural America.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry guys.  It should be on the website.  I guess eventually it will.  It's kind of ironic.  Maybe it's maybe there's something to be said.  She's digitally literate.  But put it on your website too please Ms. Warren.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll say having I spent like half the time scrolling down the website because she's  got all of her plans there and there.  She does.  Comprehensive.  There are a lot of plans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She this is there's quite a bit of stuff in here.  Yeah she acknowledges that these communities the rural communities in America feed our  nation.  They're leading the country in sustainable energy.  They generate 99 percent of the wind energy and their pioneering efforts to harness solar  energy.  We need to give them broadband.  She says corporate and government leaders have turned their backs on people in rural  communities.  And this is something she wants to fix.  I applaud that.  I have to say she wants to set up an office of broadband access that'll be part of the  Department of Economic Development that would oversee the not exist.  What the Department of Economic Development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have the U.S. Economic Development Administration which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce  which I think is what she's talking about.  Yeah.  I like looking through.  I'm like where is she putting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  D.E.D.  It would oversee the funding.  Funding would not go to ISPs but to electricity and telephone cooperatives nonprofits tribes.  And this is where I really get behind her cities counties and other state subdivisions.  She would require she would use federal law to require local governments and state governments  that have made laws against municipal Wi-Fi to to reverse those laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way just just to stay on there for one second.  I should pine with the same route with the opposite end of it.  Yes.  He said you can't today.  Well where he's also trying to tell them not to you can't regulate.  Yeah.  You can't regulate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't have C.C. saying we're not going to regulate.  And by the way you better not either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is today.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was actually two days ago.  Yeah.  Are we talking about the franchise tag.  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It had to do with cable companies but it's the same basically the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to finish the plan because I've been waiting to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK.  So federal law would ensure local governments can build their own networks.  That's that's going to be a big part of this.  And I think that's great because it's banned in many states now thanks to heavy lobbying  by the telecom industry.  More accurate broadband maps because right now there is a lie in broadband coverage maps  provided by the FCC.  They they are wrong.  They're wrong.  We can talk more about that too.  Yeah.  So Joe Biden also did as you pointed out Jeff has a proposal.  Twenty billion dollars.  But I have to say eighty five billion sounds good to me.  Stacey Higginbotham the floor is yours.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need to get my popcorn.  Hold on.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a couple of things with this plan.  One I don't want to see a new department created.  I know that I'm not 100 percent.  I think she is talking about the U.S.  Economic Development Administration which is part of the Commerce Department.  But we actually have two departments handling broadband fund dispersal right now.  We have the NTIA and we have the Department of our U.S.  Rural West something.  So hard to say.  Yeah.  So it's.  Rural jurors.  Rural jurors.  Anyway so we've already got places where this can be handled.  So I'd like one to see this plan administered for some from one of those already existing departments just for simple simple reasons to the idea that there she is.  She wants to say that the big ISPs can't participate.  I think that's going to be a problem not just because it will be make her plan politically unfeasible but also because I don't know if there is enough expertise for setting up rural networks.  Her point though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Her point is we have she says we've funneled money into these ISPs who promised they would do this and never delivered.  So then hold them accountable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hold on.  Yes. So then we need to hold them accountable because we also funneled a lot billions and billions of dollars into no name rural ISPs and those guys have taken the money and run.  Look at the scandals in life.  So I want to say that the knee jerk no big corporate entities is wrong.  I think from a policy perspective some things she has right.  Making it possible and easy for municipalities to set up networks.  I think there should be a policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's have competition and it's OK if the city wants to compete.  Let's have competition.  Right. So yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you use these funds I think you probably should have some sort of rules about letting other people into the network.  Ah.  Or maybe building maybe there should be instead of.  And here's it.  Here's a crazy plan using this money.  If you get this money instead of just putting in your lines you put in your lines with conduit and then other people can do their own lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And our British version.  What about the British version where where that is not an optimal version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The BT version.  That's why I was asking.  That is we did something similar with telephone lines back in like the I don't know what it was late 90s.  Tell me what the BT plan is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tell me what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's their network has been forced to be opened.  How about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of municipal experts propose that the infrastructure be owned by the municipalities by the local authorities who then are required to offer it just as you described to any company that wants to run over those lines or wants to run more lines through the conduit.  Guaranteeing that you have proper infrastructure that's maintained by the municipality which has a right of eminent domain.  So it's frankly easier for them to put this stuff in on the leg works done all the leg works done admittedly at a great expense.  But she's proposing a significant amount of money for these municipalities and then say hey Comcast come on in.  But also Cox and Spectrum come on in Frontier.  Come on in AT&T.  Get them all on there.  That's real competition competition.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now if there is real money for municipalities to set this up that will work.  But I will say Google actually for a while talked about doing that with their own Google broadband and it didn't happen.  And in some cases it's because there's no demand in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why the government has to do it because the government is not driven by demand.  No no no no no there's no demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comcast doesn't want to use this.  Then the municipality does it.  Right and then the municipality does it.  But that's fine.  I am worried that in addition to money for this you're going to have to also make sure there's funds for expertise and accountability.  I agree.  Because while Chattanooga is awesome not everybody is a Chattanooga.  Right.  The other thing is if we decide that this is an actual right and she compares it to putting out electricity across the nation in the 30s.  It's very much like the rural electrification project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then we have to say that these municipalities are offering a service that may not ultimately be profitable.  And that's really hard for us to do right now.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there is a perfect analog to the rural electrification projects of the 30s because.  And the phone lines too.  And we deemed it vital that there be electricity everywhere in the country that rural people should not be disadvantaged by not having access to electricity.  So we made it so even at a deficit.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the Telecommunications Act plus our flippable flopping over net neutrality have made that legally questionable.  So that's something else we're going to have to her problem and has to deal with that.  And I think Elizabeth Warren's smart enough to dig into all these and be like, yeah, the other things that I think are really important here.  I would like to see I would really like to see her talk about bringing wireless to rural areas because it's more economical.  But B, the current way we allocate and value spectrum is at odds with the value that that spectrum can actually provide.  So we do it based on a per pop person per pop.  And we need to start thinking about with IOT and things like that, that our spectrum, we should be thinking about it for devices, not just people.  So because of things like agriculture and telemedicine, which she's talked about in her plans as well.  And then the other thing is she wants to appoint FCC commissioners who were restored neutrality.  I think that's great.  But basically, we just went through this where we had an FCC commissioner who was like, yeah, neutrality.  And then we had one who was like and that was Jenikowski.  And then we had Wheeler and we were all like, what's he going to do with neutrality?  At first, he was like, and then he was like, yeah.  And then we got Ajit Pai and he's like, so I would like to see actually instead of an FCC commissioner, I would like to see her push for laws that can actually entrain this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the FCC only can do what it does at the with the consent of Congress.  It's Congress mandates and gives the FCC the privileges and rights to do whatever it does.  So ultimately, Congress supersedes the FCC.  So you're exactly right. Make it a law.  Get it through Congress. That's better anyway.  That's more democratic anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so that's that's the plan. I think it's great.  I'm excited that people are talking broadly about broadband and I'm excited.  They're talking about the lack of rural connectivity.  And as a former broadband reporter, I am just like, make it sexy.  Oh, did I talk about broadband maps?  The FCC actually did a good thing a couple of days ago when it changed its plan for broadband mapping.  And I was really shocked because, again, Ajit Pai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the past, they were letting ISPs say.  So what happened is in 2010, they said, hey, we're going to make a national broadband map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we were all like, yeah.  And then they were like, we're going to count broadband based on census block.  So if one house in an entire census block has broadband, then that area is fully covered.  And we were like, no, that's a bad idea.  But that's what we went with.  The new rules say that you can actually you they will still count by census block.  But ISPs now have to create their like polygons of no service zones.  So they're going to actually have to confess where they don't have service in a census block.  So that could make it marginally more useful.  So I'm really hopeful there.  Yay. OK. And that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry. I got so excited. I'm like, I'm not a single issue voter, but I have to say if I were, that's the issue.  That is the issue. I mean, there's a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It drives us toward Internet as a right. Yeah.  That's that's an important principle. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I might have to trade in my Amy hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she has a plan. I just don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what it is either.  That's the problem. As much as I like Klobuchar, you can't really deduce your policies from our website yet.  But that's just a matter. Somebody's got to type them in.  Good. I'm glad you're right. I'm glad that that discussion is in the open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, and I I love this is this is a super complicated issue.  And I think I love that Warren is tackling it with actual like, hey, we're not just going to throw money, but she's actually trying to figure out where you can put the department.  How are it? So I think there's a lot of good stuff.  She's a wonk. She's a wank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And sometimes we need I would love to have a policy.  Yeah. Well, remember, though, that was Bill Clinton was a reputedly a policy wonk to know he wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was he was charming. That was Bill Clinton's big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what he was. His wife was a wonk. She was a wonk and spades.  Yeah. Google's going to pause listening to EU voice recordings while regulators investigate.  I suspect that'll end up being in the US as well, because already Apple and Amazon have said, OK, OK, we won't listen unless you say it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the right thing to do. Opt in. Google actually, they they don't opt in, but they do let you opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They always have. Yeah. Well, I think they all let you opt out.  I don't know about Apple. No, Amazon does. Amazon lets you opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple did not. Amazon didn't disclose what the people I think the big issue is people are like, what?  There are actual people listening to this. Well, now we know everybody that changes everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody has people listening. In fact, what did I just see?  There's people Cortana Cortana probably Skype Skype has people listening to a translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, Skype. Hi. How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you bored? It's only for the translation features to make sure the translations are accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the thing. You need people for this stuff to be accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Get the fallout. And you're not even surprised.  Really? Think about it. It's got to be. Get ready. Get ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just more moral panic. Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Press the button. Press the moral panic button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Amy. Amy Klobuchar wants to roll out high speed Internet to every household by 2022.  But if it's going if she's going by the FCC high speed Internet goals right now, that's 25 megabits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll take that. But the question is, is she going to pay for it?  Because it's one thing to say it. It's another thing to say.  And it's going to cost eighty five billion dollars in the government's going to pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when we did the phones, when rural telephone notification, right, to this day, you pay a fee on top of your phone bill if you still have it.  Yes. For that purpose. Yes. To subsidize the the unprofitable lines in rural areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why isn't that a model? It is a model. That's the thing. We've solved this not once, but twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of those funds, though, well, in the FCC and the phone world have been not used for their intended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, there's that. There's always that. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm just I'm just like these have weaknesses and there's so many anyway. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's doing a fun a fun thing.  So there's now going to be this is a response to the EU, a browser ballot.  When you set up your Android phone in Europe, you get to choose your browser and you get to choose your service provider, except.  Apparently, Google's going to auction off the right to be one of the choices because they're kind of forced into it by the regulation, as I recall.  In each country, there'll be an auction.  Search providers will state the price that they're willing to pay each time a user selects them from the choice screen.  Each country will have a minimum bid threshold.  The three highest bidders that meet or exceed the bid threshold will appear on the choice screen.  I don't know if that's really the spirit of the requirement.  It's a profit thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How long will this last?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, I think that's probably was not the intent of the EU commissioners.  They did, according to the verge, leave the means of compliance up to Google.  But the European Commission continues to monitor.  So I wonder if Google's just thinking, well, let's see if we could sneak this by them.  Eric Leandre, who's the CEO of a privacy focused search engine in France, quant.  Called it a total abuse to the dominant position to ask for cash just for showing a proposal of alternatives.  Duck Duck Go CEO Gabriel Weinberg said a ballot box screen could be an excellent way to increase meaningful consumer choice if designed properly.  Unfortunately, Google's announcement today will not meaningfully deliver choice.  A pay to play auction with only four slots means consumers won't get all the choices they deserve and Google will profit at the expense of competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But isn't that what it's all about? Google's profits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, for Google.  I can't imagine that you will let this stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's story I didn't put up in the rundown today.  It's so funny to us that it goes both ways.  The EU governments are planning to monitor your travel, not only in planes, but on trains and roads.  So you have GDPR on the one hand and the government on the other hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, government always wants to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's all of these technologies can be used for surveillance.  And it's just will the government decide not to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why wouldn't the government do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And balloons over our heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's the Pentagon using aerial and satellite surveillance to monitor.  This is just a test.  Getting ready for getting ready for the terrorist invasion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hesitate to bring this up, but I think it's important.  Report, I think in Politico, put on the rundown under government that the White House is circulating a plan to an executive order to go after so-called censorship of the right on social platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this has been a drumbeat that's been going and going and going ever since we played that clip of President Trump on.  Was it Maria Bartiromo show?  Trump says, I got my eye on you, Google.  And yeah, I'm not surprised that this is this has been coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, Sundar Pichai. Trump has actually this week.  So I said, I said my office and praised me instead of one one doing wonderful work, which is something that Sundar Pichai can't possibly deny.  He's stuck with it. Right.  He can't do anything. So he's really playing games on the platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Trump has actually accused Google of very quote, very illegal and quote acts, but doesn't specify what.  No backup. Yeah. Distorting results for political purposes would harm our business, says Google and go against our mission of providing helpful content to all our users.  I just I'd be stunned if there is an executive action against Google.  And I can't imagine what it would be. What do you what do you order?  What can Trump what can Trump do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, obviously, they're going to win against the First Amendment case because what is he going to say?  Someone to say something is as bad as telling them what they can't say.  Right. But but I think there'll be some ridiculous language about some requirement of neutrality, which is BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So does political does political have any?  They say the White House is circling drafts of a proposed executive order that would address allegations of anti-conservative bias by social media companies.  This is a source within the White House, a White House official and two other people familiar with the matter.  A month after President Trump planned a pledge to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions on the issue.  No one, none of the three would describe the contents of the order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it was a problem. I there's no. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to come after you. I would be I would be amazed if anything came out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's the age of amazement. It is, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think I don't think even Stephen Miller would know what to write in such an executive order.  Let's build a wall around the Googleplex. I mean, I don't there's nothing.  What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It all just makes my head hurt to think about it.  And I wonder if if our president even knows what he's talking about.  No, he doesn't. No, this is all this is stagecraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He saw some Fox and Friends hosts say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he's just just stoking a fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yeah, but if he's looking for a template, look no farther than Turkey.  Turkey, Turkey has now so and I don't I embrace this working in broadcast media, television and radio.  Because broadcast uses a public public resource, the airwaves, they are subject to FCC licensing.  You have to get an FCC license. You have lots of community requirements.  They can't say the seven deadly words.  There's just rules and every broadcaster understands that and knows it.  And frankly, I think embraces it.  But online content has never been regulated by the FCC because we don't use public airwaves,  podcasts, blogs, streaming media is unregulated as it should be.  And in fact, it's a very important place for free speech, just as newspapers are.  They don't use public resources either, except maybe the streets to deliver them.  Turkey has decided that its radio and television watchdog, which is called our tuck,  will have the right to oversee online content, including streaming platforms like Netflix and online news outlets  you will now have to get a license to broadcast on the Internet.  I presume that's podcasts and blogs as well. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think anything we get our hands on. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And of course, one of the things they're going to be watching for is anything that is negative about the government.  So what we just talked about, that would be illegal in Turkey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was about our government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, if we were talking about the Turkish government in Turkey,  replace Trump with Erdogan and then continue, we would, I guess, be taken off the air.  We would have issues, yes.  A human rights lawyer in Turkey said this is the biggest step in Turkish censorship history.  All outlets producing opposition news would be effective.  Everyone who produces alternative news and broadcasts will be impacted by this regulation.  Every news report that can be against the government will be taken under control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never hear about Turkey in the news in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we've been talking about it a lot because of the encroaching authoritarianism.  So that explains it.  Erdogan, who was a democratically elected president,  has slowly been moving to control all negative comments to control the press, shut down protests.  And the people I know who live in Turkey, where Turkish people are very upset about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems like this is the way of the world now.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are definitely seeing a, oh, as America is falling back on its commitment to, let's call it free speech everywhere,  we're seeing other people in nations say, oh, wow, America is not going to get upset about this. Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we've got to hold the line. I still think this is the shining beacon of freedom to the rest of the world.  And we've got to hold the line. And we've got to stand up for the values that made this country unique.  The thing that always strikes me about America, there are only a few countries in the world, I could think of three,  that became countries not because of their geography, or country because people live here, but because of an idea.  One was Israel, Liberia, the state where slaves moved was one, and America has been for 200 years,  a country that people came to from all over the world because we espoused freedom of speech, freedom of religion.  Some different ideals and opinions.  Initially came here because they wanted the freedom to worship as they chose.  Religious freedoms.  And this is what's so unusual about this country.  This is a country of ideas that people came here from all over the world because we all agreed this is the right way to be.  This is how a society should be organized. We cannot give that up. We cannot give that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but what I think is happening is not so much an attack on the First Amendment, but it's an effort to chill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it will have that effect, but it's not going to chill us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not right now.  Not yet.  Not today. Not here. Not today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the other end of this. Is A-chan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a really interesting conversation I've been reluctant to have.  So A-chan has now for the third time been the place where a shooter's manifesto has been posted before he participated in a mass killing, El Paso, the most recent.  The Christchurch killings. And what was the other? Was the mosque shooting? I can't remember.  But A-chan is clearly a place for people.  Or the synagogue.  Maybe it was the synagogue shootings, but it was clearly a place. Well, I don't know. What is it? It was created because 4chan was too restrictive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's where the people who are kicked off of 4chan go. And we can all understand.  And there will always be an A-chan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem. So CloudFlare. And by the way, I'm a fan of CloudFlare.  Matthew Prince's CEO said we discussed this all day. CloudFlare was providing DDoS protection for 8chan as it does for many, many sites.  Yeah, they're the DDoS protector.  They, in fact, the host is still is right now and I think debating whether they should.  2cows, which did the registrar, is debating whether they should allow that.  So this is a big debate. CloudFlare and Matthew Prince is a real free speech advocate who says,  I don't want to get in the position of deciding which speech is okay, which is not.  But he finally, and I think he was right, said this goes over the line and he terminated 8chan's support on CloudFlare.  I think, I don't know what 2cows is going to end up doing.  Good move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can always fire them as a customer. You can always fire people as a customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good move. You can. Yeah, okay.  But you also understand the reluctance to do that because you don't want to get in the business of choosing winners and losers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can, like, let's take McDonald's. Or let's take Walmart. Walmart's probably a good, actually, good use case.  Walmart wants as many people as possible in its stores. They love you, right?  I can walk into a Walmart in Texas and there will be, like, an open carry nut running around.  There will be, like, some sort of crazy person screaming at their kids at top volume and maybe even hitting them, right?  These are not people that I'm like, yeah, top of humanity, right?  Right. But they still have a place.  They can go into Walmart at a certain point.  Like, if the open carry guy pulls out his gun and starts, like, pointing it at those kids who are misbehaving, Walmart's going to say, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have the right. Yeah. Nobody questions that.  By the way, I should just say Two Cows did drop a chance domain registration two days ago.  You're Canadian. I can see that.  Yeah. I should also make the disclaimer. Two Cows Owns Hover, which is our sponsor.  It may even have been Hover. I don't know. But Two Cows has its own domain registration.  So, this happened to the Daily Sturmr. This happened.  Exactly. This has happened before.  It's an appropriate conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And just like you can always find a place to get your underwear and toilet paper from Walmart, you can find it somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the real point. There'll be a 16 Chan or a 32 Chan. There'll be some other Chan tomorrow, right?  Yeah. Somebody's already got it in works.  But you don't have to do business with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And you can fire them when they start behaving beyond the social norms.  And I'd say walking into a place and shooting people and then publicizing your message, because all of this is about publicizing the message associated with killing so many people.  I think that's a pretty, that's an okay place to draw a line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I think you're right. You make it very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. I agree.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thanks, Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What else do we? Do you want to do the change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because we're going to wrap up in a few minutes here. Let's get to, I think, the highlight of the show.  We get to hear the song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello, everybody. This is Leo Laporte, your Google change log reporter.  This week, Google announced made by Google products will start using recycled materials and will be carbon neutral by 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whoop-de-doo.  Thank you very much.  They're still going to charge you a thousand dollars for recycled material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whoop-de-doo. And that really bothers me when I buy something.  Yeah, it always bothers me when I buy something and Apple's the worst at this and it's just this beautiful.  You don't even want to throw the box away. It's airtight. It's perfect.  And you can't break it down and recycle it very easily. There's no, it doesn't collapse. You have to cut it apart.  Cut it.  I just, you know, it's fine to do what Amazon did with the frustration free packaging.  Put it in something that's brown paper, clearly recycled. I don't mind.  It's beautiful.  The product's going to be just as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was in San Francisco last week also, right?  And the last night I'm there, I walk up to City Lights Books and I stop.  I'm hungry and I've got an early flight the next morning.  So I stop and I get some nice dumplings, chadda-tap.  And I decided to get some soup to her. I'm going to take it back to the hotel and have a little wine.  And I say to the nice lady, can I have a spoon?  Oh, no. She said that's now against the law in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  San Francisco, right on.  Can't give you spoons.  Bring your own spoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, but what is the soup or what are the dumplings served in?  Three millimeters of plastic dishes.  Of course, plastic, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you go to San Francisco, be sure to wear a spoon in your hair.  Only when you overthink something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a perfect example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to wrap this in eight layers of plastic, but we can't give you a spoon.  We're not going to give you a spoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and we're going to have some recycled paper labels in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Fit will now track your sleeping, whether you want to or not.  No, I'm just spreading fun.  Just spreading fun.  That's the Ariana Huffington app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't actually want to go to sleep with Google Fit, so thanks for doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't want to put my phone in my bed.  Search Engine Land had this story about Google launching a new algorithm to better understand useful and timely information.  Featured snippets don't have to be new necessarily.  I don't understand this.  It could just be timely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If all you do is go with currency, then that's gameable, and it may not be the most important and most relevant thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  More accurate, more relevant, better than more recent.  Yes.  I always use the tools when I use Google Search, which I haven't been lately, and I kind of miss.  Actually, no, it's built in the start page automatically.  The tools that say, I only want to see results in last week, last year, last five years.  That's often useful if I'm searching for a bug or something like that.  Google is going to add, I think this is a really good thing, automated text to speech for emergency calls made via the Pixel.  So often when you make an emergency call, you can't speak.  You're having a heart attack.  You were shot.  You just fell over.  That's awesome.  So the system is simple.  When on an emergency call, the phone app will now offer three additional buttons.  You don't have to say anything.  Just press medical, fire, or police.  Tapping the button will activate a text to speech feature that will read out a message informing the operator that the caller is using an automated service describing the kind of help.  So in this case, this is the text.  You're being contacted by an automated voice service initiated by the caller.  The caller may be unable to speak or hear.  My location is, and the plus code for my location is, I require medical assistance.  That's fantastic.  God, what if they only give the plus code?  I'm at 849-VCW-C7-plus-AQ.  Oh, thanks.  Is the plus code must be like three words where like it's a GPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So years ago I had to call 911 only once in my life.  I had a conflict with a contractor.  But he left, so I hung up the phone.  They come anyway, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They come anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  They come anyway.  I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then what is the other thing you're supposed to do if the person is in the room with you?  Pretend you're ordering a pizza.  And the operator knows, oh, he can't talk.  And you order the pizza and you say, please deliver it to this address.  Does that work?  I did not.  I don't think that was actually a thing.  I think it's a thing.  Maybe I dreamed it.  No, I've heard some other.  I could have dreamed it, but I think it's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I dreamed last night?  What?  There'll be no paper on Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?  But there will be tardigrades on the moon.  What about paper on the Mars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just realized there'll be no trees.  There'll be no paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, so so Fox News says, thanks Gutenberg.  Fox News says that pepperoni pizza 911 code is a myth.  Oh, so I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Documents, though, of police or a pizza delivery people helping.  That's actually true.  Like people like in a hostage situation or like a dicey situation, pizza people have  called the police after delivering a pizza to a home and seeing someone in distress or  mouthing things like call the police behind the person answering the door.  So there there have been situations where that has actually happened.  So maybe that's where that myth arises from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The LAPD posted this tweet last year.  The LAPD has seen this graphic circulating on social media channels.  It's false.  Text to 911 is a much better option.  Your exact location and the nature of the emergency is what's needed to send the right  resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what do I suspect it if you called and went through?  Can you send the paper?  I think that would work.  I think you'd figure it out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But anyway, I apologize for spreading false news, fake news.  Shame on you.  I think what Google is doing, though, is actually a great solution, right?  It is.  Just dial 911, press a button, you put the phone down faster than texting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still think that really needs to be communicated to the to the responders because you hear  a robot talking in your ear.  You know what kid has done this now.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm sure Google's doing that.  Google's Advanced Protection Program can now block risky downloads also in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you didn't need that in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so this whole idea and by the way, this one reason using Gmail is a good idea.  Gmail will filter out known ransomware and other threats from your email will block it.  But this is also attackers are shifting their strategies, says Google to threaten advanced  protection users outside of email.  So Google announced the Advanced Protection Program was coming to the G Suite and cloud  accounts as well as Chrome linked malware and drive by downloads of the new threats  with attackers trying to get users to unknowingly download harmful harmful software into the  devices.  So you'll see this is an example of what you might see on your screen.  File dot exe was blocked by advanced protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was the incognito update was that last week?  Yes, it was.  Chrome 76.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that was the issue of where you went to the New York Times in incognito hoping to  bypass the paywall.  All right.  The New York Times say, you're in incognito mode.  You can't can't use the Times.  So now you can, which we shouldn't tell anybody because Jeff's going to be pissed off.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, Mr. Jarvis.  I subscribe to the Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the Post.  And the Wall Street Journal.  And Wired.  And Wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's our job.  And by the way, we rely on these to make the show.  So I think it's a fair trade.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's let's wrap her up.  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Karsten.  Oh, that's the Google change law.  Geez.  There was a lot more to talk about.  I didn't run out of I mean, we didn't even come close to going through those stories.  So that was it.  Thank you for listening.  I hope you enjoyed.  I hope you enjoyed.  I hope you enjoyed.  If you did, let me know in the comments below.  If anybody cares, if you want to get your Marvel movies, guess what?  They won't be on Netflix.  They won't be on HBO.  You'll have to pay six ninety nine for Disney plus, which is less than Netflix to be fair.  That'll launch November 12th.  And there's a special version, a bundle for Disney plus Hulu and ESPN plus.  That will be a scant, a mere twelve dollars and ninety nine cents.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Twelve ninety nine.  Stacey, do you have a pick of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're better when you're prepared.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did have one.  Let me remember what it is.  Her blood sugar is depleted.  Depleted.  How about you, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The number of the week.  There can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There can be no other number this week than 30 to 50.  30 to 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mean the age group of women that I'll date?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  30 to 50 feral hogs took over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all we got to say.  This is why you need long guns and bump stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because what if you got a.  Because in three to five minutes, 30 to 50 feral hogs come into the playground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, in fact, there are issues in some areas with feral hogs, but it was just the perfect  Twitter meme.  I live in one of those areas.  30 to 50 feral hogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have seen feral hogs and they are not to be messed with.  No, not even if you have an automatic weapon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would stay away from the feral hogs.  Although those little feral hog babies, man, they look cute.  Adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I couldn't find it again.  I saw a video of a feral hog trap.  It was a phenomenal.  I couldn't find the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's wrong with feral hogs?  They're just pigs with a little extra fur.  With teeth.  And with teeth.  Well, if you don't bug them, they won't bug you.  OK.  By the way, bullets don't stop feral hogs.  You need one of them boar stickers.  And I'm not going to put you in the spot because you just didn't even know you were going to be on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We dragged you into this.  I found something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man, this guy's good.  Well, and of course, it's just a plug to me, too.  OK.  Even better.  Back in June.  We're going to call it Aunt Jitsu.  Of course.  I believe it was back in June.  The CTA invited me to CES Asia.  And while I was there, I was able to cover the event and so forth.  And I sat down with one of their executives, Ms. Karen Chupka.  And it wasn't an interview.  I wanted to treat it like a conversation.  And it was a really, really, really good time sitting down and talking to her about being with the CTA for 30 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Consumer Technology Association, is that what that stands for?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  The people that do CES.  Right.  And she's been at the job for 30 years.  And she's a female.  And she's dealing with consumer technology and dealing with other cultures all around the world that look at things differently far as, you know,  gender rights, gender equality and things of that nature.  And she was really, really candid about that.  As well as just talking about some of the old stories of, you know, CES of your registration days in the mail and things getting lost and things like that.  So where is that?  We can find that.  It's on Tech Republic right now.  I put it in our...  There it is.  We got it up on the screen there.  But yeah, it was a lot of fun.  She was fun to talk to.  And, you know, she believes in AI and still believes that it still has a ways to go.  But the CTA is really pushing for a quality they've made about, I think it was about $10 million in investments for giving opportunities to minorities and women to get into entrepreneurship.  The CTA itself has like 71% of its executive team is female.  That's awesome.  You know, it's just a little stuff like that.  It was a really, really cool conversation.  So just hop over to that link over on Tech Republic.  Give that a read and let me know your thoughts on it.  I had a lot of fun with that one.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I found my thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. Her thing has emerged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I knew I had it.  I just was like, what was it?  It is CAM-X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  CAM-X?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is CAM-X.  You're like, what is this?  What is that?  It's a smart home.  It's a smart home project that allows you to connect your smart home cameras.  Any of them, a wide variety, including Nest, Arlo, Wwise, et cetera.  And you can basically link them all together.  It's a networked DVR that is for all sorts of smart homes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't have to pay that monthly fee to Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Although there is a monthly fee to remotely access your feed for Nest.  So I will say that.  That always is going to be the case.  I'm not going to take the camera data from, but you could keep it all local on this drive if you wanted to not pay the fee.  And if you're on the same network, you'll still be able to see it.  But this is an interesting device.  It's supposed to ship in December.  I don't know if it will.  But I thought it's already met its goal.  So I thought this was actually kind of a neat product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think a lot of NASs will let you do this, too.  I may be wrong.  I don't know how are these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of them are not user friendly and you have to have them with the right.  They have to have the right codecs and software.  And this seems to do that part for you.  But you're not wrong.  A lot of NASs will do that for you.  It's just not user friendly.  So, yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yay, Stacey and her thing.  Nice.  Stacey Higginbotham is the host of Stacey on IoT with Kevin Toffle.  Actually, Stacey on IoT is the website.  The IoT podcast with Kevin Toffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a scoop today and I didn't tell you about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's your scoop?  Do we have to listen to the show to find out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I actually posted it on the site.  Walmart is doing a program like Amazon Key, which we knew.  But it has filed with the FCC for a wireless device that will be Walmart's hub in the smart home.  And it will use that as a Z-Wave to Wi-Fi hub to open your garage door.  And eventually, probably a door lock.  So, there's a little hub.  Ooh, so fancy.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't mention that the FedEx folks have decided to cut all ties with Amazon.  They've now cut ground.  They've cut air a while ago.  So, expect more of those nondescript sedans pulling up to your house and throwing boxes out the window at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Getting more blue trucks in the Charlotte area now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we've got a lot of prime trucks now.  There used to be a lot of unmarked cars, but finally there are prime trucks.  Although a lot of people on Reddit say that they're the worst drivers ever.  They are. They are.  Thank you so much, Stacey. Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.

Be well.  We love Jason.  Jason Howell will be in the chair. We'll move the table up a little bit for him because he's a tall guy.  The Giants.  Speaking of Giants, we are so glad to welcome Ant Pruitt to the Twig family.  Yay, Ant.  Ants and his family are great and he will be a great addition. I can't wait to see the stuff you're going to do.  And of course, you'll see a lot of Ant. He'll probably be the first person to fill in on this show starting as soon as you get...  Actually, you're not even an employee yet.  No, not yet.  Since you actually start getting a paycheck.  But Ant, you've already got a house and the family, you're going to get in a U-Haul and drive out from Charlotte when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We shall be here by the end of the month.  I can't give you an hour.
