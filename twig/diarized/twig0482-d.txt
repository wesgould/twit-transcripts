Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IoT. Hi, Stace.  Hello.  Also here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis. He is, wait a minute, I have that piece of paper here somewhere.  Grab the book.  The Tao Knight Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at Craig Newmont Graduate  School of Journalism at the City University of New York and the director of the Tao Knight Center.  For Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmont Graduate School of Journalism at the  City University of New York. The largest, now it really is a lower third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really would like to see Jeff like take his little hands and just kind of peek up over the  lower third. I think it would be adorable. Oh, God, you're breaking something. Something's  wet going. Oh, there it comes. There it comes. This is all for the visual audience.  Here comes Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ow, she's hurting my knees. Oh, shit. I'm enjoying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need our standing desk where you can just move it up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. See for me.  Or I do the Leo desk. I can just move up.  You're welcome to that, Leo. I know you've enjoyed doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where do you want to start today?  Oh, I think Stacey has an idea.  There's so many different things we can talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, technically this is This Week in Google. So if we want to start with Google, I'm cool with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's start with Google. It says it will make arbitration optional, in other words, not required  for individual sexual harassment claims, provide more info about investigations,  expand training and more. This is in response, of course, to the walkout last week of Google  employees. Sundar Pichai sent this as an email to Google employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is kind of like the very least they could do.  What would be the most they could do?  Well, I would say the most would be diversifying its board further. I would say maybe putting in  some, well, let's see, of like, what else? Putting in some goals around hiring, maybe.  Maybe not goals, but maybe advanced recruitment efforts at, you know, different places, universities  that it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it make sense that sexual harassment is less of a problem in a workplace that is 50% women?  I would bet that's true.  The more women in the workplace.  Well, it's also a question of the management, Leo.  Well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. It's mostly the culture. Because you can get a lot of harassment in places with  more women. It's just women have to be in charge or in management positions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, or in the board. Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because, I mean, like, look at schools. There's a lot of female teachers and there's still lots  of sexual harassment happening there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is, by the way, the reaction of the organizers of the walkout. They're happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they should be proud that they accomplished the first step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  What they showed is collective action works and we work together, we can make a change.  However, here's what they wanted more. The response ignored several of the core demands,  like elevating the diversity officer and employee representation on the board.  And troublingly erased those focused on racism, discrimination and structural inequality,  which is, they said, built into the class system that separates full-time employees from contract  workers. This is actually going to be a larger problem for not only Google, but Silicon Valley  in general. Contract workers make up more than half of Google's workforce, but receive few of  the benefits associated with employment. And it is true. They are largely people of color,  immigrants and people from working class backgrounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, yeah, I mean, that's, and those are like overarching kind of labor issues. I mean,  the fact that arbitration grew so much in companies and you look at like non-compete  kind of efforts that have been dismantled over the last few years in Silicon Valley,  what's happening is we're seeing workers, employees start to take some of the same sort of things that  happened back in the days when they started unions. So I don't know if we're ever going to get to like  actual unions, but it's good to see this kind of shift back to worker rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you could say there's a balance of power between employers and employees,  except that there's no power at all among employees in many cases. Most states,  including California, are at-will states. California is not a right to work state,  but it's close to it. Although California law has been tilting in the direction of employees over  the last few years. So the state at least is trying to make it a little bit more favorable  to employees. I mentioned that we have a forced arbitration clause in our contracts with twit  employees. And the reason we do that, I'm told, is that because of California state law, it's very  easy for an employee to sue us with no consequences to themselves, that basically to harass us back  whether there's merit in the case or not. And so arbitration kind of flattens that out a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bit. I would say the cost to bring a lawsuit and the effort to bring a lawsuit flattens that out.  That's a very common argument for forced arbitration, but it also ignores that most people  are not going to file those types of suits. There's a significant barrier in finding someone to pursue

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  those types of suits. Yeah, but many lawyers will do it and do it for contingency. But most people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  don't actually want to sue. Well, even that means you're relying on the kindness of your employees  rather than- Well, not necessarily. I mean, usually when someone is in that situation and they're  stuck in arbitration, they're unhappy and they feel wronged and aggrieved. But I could tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  from personal experience, employees are unhappy if they're terminated for any reason.  That's not true. Well, many, many employees- Sorry, they are unhappy but they're not going to come-  Are unhappy at being terminated and some of them decide that they want to get exact revenge whether

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's merit or not in their case. Well, why shouldn't that go through the courts? That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what the courts are for. Because it's extremely expensive for the business at no cost for the  employee. There can be a cost for you. Minor cost. Trust me, I know. Minor cost to the employee.  So if any, the cost is finding a lawyer who'll do it on a contingency basis and then you just sit  back and enjoy while the employer twists in the wind. Look, believe me, I've considered suing  and employers and I never have and often, you're right, there's a lot of reasons not to.  It's not merely trouble. You don't want to get a bad reputation in the business you work in  and most people just aren't litigious. But there are some people who are litigious and they can  cost a company a lot of money and time. That is true. So I've seen a case-  Unless you think arbitration is unfair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think arbitration tends to benefit the employer and it tends to hide issues,  larger cultural issues that can be a problem for a larger class of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, I'll grant you, if you feel like arbitration is an unfair process,  forcing employees to go through arbitration is inherently unfair. I don't think it's an  unfair process. I think it's often in front of a judge. It's an extrajudicial  proceeding but there are rules and it's designed to be fair. If you say it is unfair, then okay,  then you might have a case. But I'm not sure I agree with you that arbitration is a terrible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think arbitration, like any system, like the legal system we're talking about, can be abused  and if you are the company who's paying for the mediator, you are in a position of power  and can either use it to extract settlements for people and not have some of your problems  see the light of day. So that's the first issue. You can use it to hide continuing issues in your  company. And then the second issue is that it can be unfair to employees. It's not always unfair.  But the company does pay for it and most people who, unless it's egregious,  they might not want to bite the hand that feeds them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is doing what Google does, which is making it not force arbitration in the case of sexual harassment,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a good step? Yes, because sexual harassment is one of the most common ways that people have used  arbitration in the past to hide those problems. Look at Fox News or Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, that's fair. Sorry, go ahead. Jeff, I didn't mean to interrupt you.  No, I wasn't saying anything. Well, you did say something. I just, I just was,  I forget what it was. Yeah, I'm sorry. That's why I guess I was, no, I was to Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's expensive for both sides to do suits and risky for both sides to do suits. I wonder if  having some opening to do them itself has an impact on settlements, the fear that you can do  the suit, right? So does that, so here's my experience has been almost always the opening

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  assault is a lawsuit is going to cost you a hundred thousand dollars. Give us 10.  Right. And almost always a company faced with that will do the, it's the same thing as patent  trolls. Patent, right. Almost always a company faced with that will say, okay, here's 10.  And employees know this and these lawyers know this and they've, and they push very strongly  to get you to settle because they don't want to go to court either. They don't want to waste time.  They just want to write a bunch of letters and hope that you will say, well, it's cheaper just  to give you 10 bucks to shut up or whatever it is. Right. And so I wonder what the middle ground is.  It's really hard to find. Yeah. I don't, what are they doing in Canada? I'm sure it's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just all apologize all the time. That's fine. See, I'm sorry, whatever it is, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Got to be some middle ground. Cause I understand that there's very frequently, oh, it's trial  lawyers and we should get them because they're just making, you know, but I also think the ability  to sue is kind of critical. And suing has taken on such a pejorative meaning. It merely says going  to the court to get an opinion, a fair opinion on the situation, you know, some sort of judgment  and settlement on the situation. So it's, it's actually, I don't, I don't think suing is a bad  thing, but it has gotten very expensive and it can be very expensive to defend this suit.  And there are plenty of frivolous lawsuits out there floating around. Maybe you could do something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  where the person filing the complaint gets to hire and find the mediator to listen to the arbitration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. I think one thing that would, that would be very handy, but it is not the case in these  kinds of employment suits is the ability to counter sue for, for damages or, or legal fees.  So if you win, I think, I think this is what they do in Canada. If, if, if you file suit and lose,  you have to pay the defendant, the plaintiff, the defendant's legal fees. It's like, well,  your suit better have merit. Otherwise it's not going to be without consequence that you file suit.  That's a good way to do it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. This is not something we're probably going to solve today, although it'd be awesome if we did,  but I think, I mean, I think you did a good job articulating the other side. And I think,  I mean, that's a really important thing to think about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want to imply that we're getting lawsuits out the door.  No, but I mean, as a business, it is a legitimate,  something you have to think about. I don't have to think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've seen cases where someone with a grudge and with a problem uses the courts to go after  a, to harass someone they don't like at length.  We know, we all know litigious people. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like I don't, I'm okay with that. Oh, you do. Oh, you do. His name is Peter Teal.  Oh, well, okay. Yeah. And you argued vivociferously that going after Gawker was intended to  shut them down. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. All right. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's two sides and it's a difficult one. And we really, I think we do have a little bit of a  problem in this country with lawsuits. And yet at the same time, I think the right to sue is a very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  very important part of our system. Well, and we don't have a lot of worker protections.  I mean, if we're just thinking about employees, right? We don't have, I mean, there's,  and there's not even a lot of consumer protections yet, you know, even in like the  software we buy and devices we have, those are all forced arbitration. So you're kind of like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love Google CEO, Ruth Porats, CFO, CFO, Chief Financial Officer, Ruth Porats question.  Why can't we solve this? We should do better. Well, the full, the full line is if we can make

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a car that drives itself, why can't we do better? It occurs to me that if, if we can make a car  drive itself is the new, if we can go to the moon. It is, isn't it? But we haven't made a car drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  itself, at least not properly yet. No, in fact, that's a very good point as well. Although Google's  Waymo division has the CEO said we are about ready to launch a service this fall or whatever. This is  fall. It can't be this fall. Soon, starting where they're already putting Waymos in the next few  months, you'll be, you'll be getting a driverless car service. Now when they say driverless,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is there no safety driver? Oh, I bet you look that up. That's right. That was my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because that's a scary thing. Wait, this is the Wall Street Journal. I think so. Waymo plans to  launch paid driverless car service. This is John Krafchick talking at the WSJD Tech Conference in  Laguna Beach. He says they're going to launch it soon. They're already doing it in Phoenix area,  right? And but not for pay. So that's the difference is they want to do basically a  driverless Uber. They would be beating Uber, Lyft and everybody else to the, to the table on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  one. Yeah. Would you get in that car? I would. Yeah, I would. I might sit in the passenger seat  and be ready to dive over and grab the wheel, the non-existent wheel. The non-existent,  there's got to be a brake pedal, right? No. Or a button. Well, it's got to be something. These look

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like the Chrysler Pacificas that they, they bought, which I think do have steering wheels, brake  pedals and all of that. Only vestigially, because there isn't anybody in the front seat. They  already do this in Phoenix. Some cars it says will contain backup drivers who can take control, but  some cars is not all cars and the prices will be competitive with Uber and Lyft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what I will say, having ridden in self-driving cars, they are slow. You can get stuck places for  a while. So in some ways I'm like, oh, that sounds great. But then you're like, if I really need to  get somewhere, I would not necessarily hop into one of those. There would be humans in the remote

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  operations center who could take control of the car by remote control, but that sounds worse.  Dial in. With a joystick and a trailer going. I'd be, that doesn't bother me. I mean, having

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  remote control of the car is fine. Car drone. Yeah. I'm fine with that because then I could be like,  hey, this car cannot turn left. Could you please help it out here?  Just let me out. Now I've got ice cream melting in the car here. Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the complaint. We've, remember we talked about this. That was a complaint from some of the  residents of Phoenix is that it's not so much that they're driving erratically, that they're  driving way over cautiously these self-driving cars. And so you get stuck behind them because  they don't pick him. It's like a, you know, when you're driving behind somebody learning to drive  and they just can't make that left turn. And my daughter, I don't want to humiliate her,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but she doesn't watch the show. She believes in the speed limit. Oh, that drives people crazy.  I drive the speed limit. No, she doesn't do that. No, but she drives the speed limit. She is following  the law, but I just imagine I get scared because of the people who are going to be going crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  around her. Tell her it's okay to drive seven miles over the speed limit. That's what I try to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  say. Tell her to come to Austin. You know what? In Austin, everyone drives the speed limit or below  and they drive in the left-hand lane. These people are terrible. It sounds like you're in Florida.  So just tell her to come to Austin. She'll be fine. Turn signal just blinking the whole way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my goodness. These people. Isn't it funny? What is the point of the speed limit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If nobody drives it. In Austin, they do. You'd be in Germany and man, I've been in cars in Germany  with drivers. I'm not driving. I get pretty freaked at how fast they can go on the Autobahn.  There's no speed limit. No speed limit. Yep. And it's freaky. So remember when the volcano  came to Iceland and stopped flights? Yeah. Oh, yes. And so I made it. I was supposed to get a  flight out of Berlin from Republic of that day. The flights were all canceled out of there. There  was still a flight out of Munich. There was a location scouting company in line with me.  They had a friend who got the last rental car was going to drive to Munich. The guy said,  oh, this is my old friend, Jeff. I didn't know me at all, but you can take him to Munich.  So these two women took me to Munich. I'm in the back seat. God bless them. And she's hauling,  but which also God bless because I was going to make the flight. But I'm forgetting the conversion  from kilometers to miles. And I turn on Google Maps and see the speed and I freak to turn it off.  And I made the flight. I think I think it was the last flight out of Europe, but I made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, this is good. I had apparently two of the kids, I took a carpool with some people  and the kids that I carpooled, they told my daughter that they were afraid to ride in the  car with me because I drove too quickly. See, I thought so. As soon as somebody says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  oh, I don't like it here in Austin, everybody's driving the speed limit. I start to worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm apparently I drive too quickly. Keeps me on my toes. Otherwise I get bored and then  I'm not paying attention. That's the problem. You're too smart. You're too smart. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's the problem. No, you are. You're bored and you're trying to make things interesting.  You want it to be more like a roller coaster. There we go. I'm trying to get, I'll tell the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  kids that when they're crying in the back, no, no, keep it interesting guys. Don't forget,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  she's got a Tesla. So not only can she go fast, she can pin the kids' heads against the seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can go fast at the speed of thought. Okay. So. Oh, Lordy, Lordy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see. All right. I'm going to take a break because if I don't start doing ads now,  I may never do them. But we have lots more to talk about. We're going to do some stuff.  Stuff. There's going to be lots of stuff. I like this article about the woman who's helping

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Google design. I do too, especially because I don't love the design. So we'll talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's design. Yeah. Ivy Ross. Yeah. We will talk about other things too. Oh, and I added,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I added this just for you, Jeff. Google's NHS kidney data. They brought it in house and people  are upset. So you can take a look at that. Yep. Yep. Yep. Especially in England. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's their data. It's their data. It's their data. And we've got a fairly,  fairly beefy changelog, I believe this week. Yeah. I even added something to it. Yeah. Yeah.

So Ivy, I didn't even know about Ivy Ross until they mentioned her  at the Pixel 3 announcement, but she is the vice president of design at Google. She was responsible,  I think, for material design, but really her specialty, she's the Johnny Ive of Google.  Her specialty is hardware. She was responsible. She was a jewelry designer, still is, and was  brought in to help fix Google Glass. Never could make that one look good. That succeeded there.  No, but that was after, this was in 2014, Glass was already out. She was kind of stuck with that  one. She's the one who put the orange button on the Pixel 2, which I really like, the Panda.  Oh, I did like that.  Yeah. That's a designer, right? No engineers are going to say, you know what would be cool is you  had a black and white phone with an orange button. Nobody's going to say that. But that's what she  did. The Pixel 3, I think, is very good looking. The Google Home Hub, very good looking. I think  it's better looking than, say, Amazon's Echo Show, which everybody widely criticized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's a very low bar. It's better looking than the dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She was the one that put fabric on everything. She's the one that came up with mint.  The fabric is nice.  Mint color, right? The pink one that looks like a donut.  I think they needed somebody to give it some human scale. Otherwise, it's like the Facebook  portal, which by the way, is on its way. Yesterday we had a meeting and Anthony said,  when's the portal coming? I said, oh, let me check. And there was no evidence that I'd purchased it.  I said, I think I'm okay. I think I escaped. No, they just charged my card. God dang it.  We can review. That is an ugly thing, the Facebook portal. I mean, that's one of those things where  Facebook must really be, let's get this thing off our books because it's not going anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been seeing the ads because we've been watching some network TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the NFL, they're buying some hefty, expensive ads.  Really? I've seen the ads on the streets.  On the Good Place. Does this look at all appealing? I mean, look at the design on this thing. It's  hideous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not pretty, but the advertising is very effective. I mean, it's people basically  dancing around and standing on their heads. It's very cute. It's what I think of as,  it's the same sort of things you see in all of the tech companies. It's cutesy people trying to be  fun and mostly human with technology. It's the exact opposite of what it looks like when you're  actually playing with the technology. And it's private by design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except it's not. I was reading the headline folks on this page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, oh no. No, they say that because they got a clip you could put up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the camera. I guess, you know, I suppose I can review this and then say, oh, it doesn't meet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  my needs and send it right back. Yes. Or you could not review it and you could just tell people,  I'm not reviewing this because this isn't something you should buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to do that. And then I found out I accidentally purchased one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did you accidentally purchase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, chef, I do that all the time. I've got jewelry gadgets.  That's your excuse. Yeah.  A click of the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a knee-jerk reaction to new products from big companies that we should have them  and review them. And I bought it really without thinking, gosh, really do we need to review this?  Is there anybody who is actually seriously considering this? And then once I, you know,  cooler heads prevailed, I realized there's no one in the world considering to buying this, right?  Once Stacey yelled at you.  Well, even before, I mean, there's nobody saying, gosh, should I buy this? Let's see the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter view. Nobody is doing that. What do they think it's going to do uniquely versus  the similar products elsewhere? It's so clear. They developed it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they got to ship it. That's it. That's the only thing that's out there is that it follows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, there's cameras that follow you. That's not a new technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that live in your home like that from the big vendors? No, there's nothing like that right  now that you can easily communicate with someone. Logitech's done that for years. I'm convinced of  it. Oh, okay. Like for video conferencing, but not in the home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this was in the home. Remember the Orbit camera? It was stood on a stalk. It was a ball.  It would follow you around. This isn't hard to do. The Mevo camera, which is really, you're right,  not a consumer product. It's designed for Facebook live streamers does this. It's actually easier to  do now. The Orbit actually had to move, but nowadays with a 4K sensor, you just can say,  okay, I got 4K, I got wide angle, I'm covering this room and all I have to do is zoom in on that  part of it and it'll be high enough resolution. I'm pretty sure that's, I don't think the camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  moves. I also mean the back end integration that allows you to just say who you want to talk to.  It's easy like a phone. The Logitech camera, did that have like a tie in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, yeah, it was Skype. You had to use Skype or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Okay. Well, Skype's pretty big. All right. I'll give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. The Kinect camera on the  Xbox apparently followed you. I don't remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, but that's not for talking to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you tell me. So I went to portal.facebook.com and I actually, in order to do this, had to log in  as me, which I don't do because remember I deactivate my Facebook account so I had to reactivate it.  Oh, we know. And this is what I get. Your portal  orders will show up here. Big blank white space. I thought, oh, hallelujah. I got no portal orders  till they charged my credit card. 600 some bucks because I bought two.  What did you order? I bought two.  Why? Well, you can't.  Why? Okay. Again, I must have been drunk.  I thought, well, you have to have one on both ends. It turns out you don't. You could call  somebody who has Facebook Messenger, but I just thought, well, if we're going to test this,  we've got to have two. We have one on both ends. Yeah. I mean, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Thank you. You can be my editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Wait, do I get a raise with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you do not get a raise. I'll send you, but here's the good news.  You'll send me a portal. I'm going to decline gracefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want that. You know, you can't talk to me because I don't have Facebook Messenger.  I don't even exist for the portal. It's like, you want to talk to who? I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That means I can't talk to my mom either. By the way, I just saw a stat. 44% of people 18 to 25  deleted, I think we mentioned this last week, deleted their Facebook on their phone. I think  it's going to get harder and harder. I think this portal is going to be,  I'll only be able to call other people's family members.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Other people's family? Your high school boyfriend's grandmother.  Exactly. Precisely.  People you may want to call. Really? Nana?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nana. I want to call Nana.  Bob's Nana?  Yeah. I haven't seen Nana in 45 years.  She might be dead.  Google's AI is helping the New York Times. This is actually...  This is cool.  This is happy, right?  This is cool.  New York Times has 5 million photos. When I say photos, I mean physical photos, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So those are all in the basement of the building where I'm talking to you from right now.  What?  We are next to the New York Times in the old headquarters of the New York Herald Tribune  and the basement, the old real room... Sorry.  Lights. I'm alive. I'm alive, lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm alive.  So the old real room was where the big huge reels of paper were going up into the press room,  right? Up under the docks. And so the real room is a big gigantic cavernous basement,  and the New York Times uses that to store their photos, their old photo morgue.  Now, as the story mentions, there was a leaky pipe about two, two and a half years ago,  and that was through our very space here.  Oh, where's the sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is not the morgue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There he is in the basement.  Do you want to see it again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, in the name of God, now I know it feels like a demon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. So it's alive in the basement of the morgue.  Yes.  So they are... They're prints, right? They're not... Are they negatives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had a leak. We had a leak up above me that  massacred our two floors of the school, and it got down to the basement, and there was a little bit  of damage. Thankfully, not very much, but it could have just absolutely been disastrous for all that  history. And so I think that's part of the reason that they hurried up digitizing more and now use,  once it's digitized, guess what? Google Photos can do all kinds of neat things for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but it's more than just the front. So here's the back of a photo from the  New York Times archive. And so this has notes, it has received December 25th, 1942,  art department files, Thursday early run, and then there is, for some reason, glued to it  clips from the paper, Penn Station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they want to show when it ran, where it ran.  Context. Yeah.  Context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was published in New York Times, Long Island, February 28th, 1988. So every time it's published,  they have a stamp, and it's been used many times. I mean, this is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to have my photo wheel. Look at that. It's three and 15, 16th by something else, right?  And you'd have to get these plastic things. This is what I did with grease pens.  It's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is before you had your media files that are up in WordPress, where you go to the media library  and you're like, Google, and now you can Google for these things and find these old photos.  And I mean, I remember, and I was very young, Jeff is going to be way better at this, but  we had a physical-  Because I'm old.  But I am alive.  You are alive. But I remember, like, my first journalism job, I was telling people about Google,  because it was new, but I didn't understand how they did. My first journalism job was in 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  2000. At least you're in this millennium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did work in 1999 at Businessweek.  But yeah, so they brought me into the morgue, which is a physical place with all these papers.  And it was, I mean, it was like a card catalog, only like times a million.  And just all the photos, like all the papers, and this is where I went to research stories.  And I was like, are you kidding me?  I was like, there will be no context for my stories for the first few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They didn't even have microfiche? It wasn't even in microfiche?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of the publications had microfiche. Some just had morgues.  Morgues.  Full of papers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Newspapers.  Morgues were great. They folded them in a certain way, and they were basically business-sized  envelopes. All these clips in there. Yeah, and they were folded up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they're not the whole newspaper? It's a clipping collection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's clippings. Oh yeah, no, it's clippings. And you had three or four people whose job it was  every day to take multiple copies of the paper against multiple tags. So this story is about  five politicians. It's got to be in five folders, so it's five copies of the paper cut out and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  marked. It's basically like if you printed Google. I mean, like,  that is the idea. And someone physically would do that. We actually used ours as a  nursing room too, which was a little awkward, but yeah.  Oh, the morgue. I don't think papers have those anymore, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, they don't.  New York Times has one. Five to seven million photos going back to the 1970s,  including prints and contact sheets. And they want to digitize it all. Jeff, you've got to  get us in there. I would like to see what they're digitizing it with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that'd be a good idea. If you visit, if you let me know when you're coming to New York,  you tell the Microsoft people come into New York, you don't tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're coming December 4th, 5th and 6th.  Or what?  We're going to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Bruce Springsteen on Broadway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh wow, you got tickets.  There was a lottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're a fancy man, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a fancy man. It's the last week of his performances, so we had to go. And then I really,  everybody who's seen Harry Potter and the Cursed Child said this is the most amazing  theatrical experience since Angels in America. It's that long as well.  You go to a matinee, then you escape for dinner and a nap, and then you come back for the evening  show and see the rest of it. But if I have time, maybe we could figure this out. I'd love to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're here on the 3rd, we'll have Alan Rusberger being interviewed by Margaret Sullivan  here at the school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh wow. You do some nice stuff at that school of journalism of yours.  At that little school of yours.  Be Craig Newmark, graduate school of journalism.  You do some very nice stuff.  Thank you.  Yes, you do.  Google open sources AI algorithms its researchers can say can distinguish between voices with 92%  accuracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't buy this because it still doesn't know who the heck I am, but that's just me.  Well, you hope it doesn't.  Well, no, my Google Home, I've trained it. It still doesn't know who I am.  Oh, it doesn't. So see, we talk a lot about face recognition, but if you think about it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google and Apple too have been collecting samples of people's voices for years now as you train  these devices. I presume they live somewhere, not in the basement of the Harold Tribune building.  And that they can be used. And they are presumably what's part of been training all this stuff.  Google's AI research division has, according to Kyle Wiggers writing in VentureBeat,  made promising progress toward a performant model.  What the hell does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this story. So I read it thinking it was going to help me understand what was happening,  but it didn't. But it has lots of pretty pictures.  It has pretty pictures. It has some nice things. It doesn't, it's talking about an unsupervised  learning. No, it's a supervised learning model that helps understand different strings of language  together. And I don't understand how that helps identify people. So there was a lot about the  story that I was like, I felt like maybe the writer didn't understand what Google was telling  him. So just put that in there. Because I really, I wanted to understand it, but I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the library, as everyone knows, for the unbounded interleaved state recurrent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  neural network algorithm. Well, I understand how recurrent neural networks work. So  I felt like I'd get there, but maybe I'll just look up the original paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was originally proposed in a paper called Fully Supervised Speaker Diorization.  Is it on archive? It is Cornell University Library.  There.  I don't know if you could download the full text of it.  Here, let's see.  Yes, you can. In this paper, we propose a fully supervised speaker diorization approach named  Unbounded Interleaved State Recurrent Neural Networks, given extracted speaker discriminative  embeddings from input utterances, in other words, your speech. Each individual speaker is  moderate modeled by a parameter sharing RNN while the RNN is. So yeah, it sounds like they are  distinguishing academics. This RNN is naturally integrated with a distance dependent Chinese  restaurant process or DDCRP to accommodate an unknown number of speakers.  I don't know, really, should it be called the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process?  Yeah, I don't get that. Why is that?  It's apparently the name.  That is what it is.  That is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's like a problem set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's noisy in Chinese restaurants. I don't know if you've ever been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it's... I'm trying to think of what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, it is open source. We were looking at the GitHub, but the GitHub does not contain  the data code or model because that's Google proprietary. So you can run a demo, but you  won't have the key value to this, which is the data from Google.  Yeah, I think this is speech recognition walks would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think one of the big deals was that it was going to be done on a device. So it could be done  at the edge, I think was one of the important things here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's certainly something we would like. It's written in Python, so I imagine it's not too  resource demanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want the paper. Give me the paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cornell has it. You have to go to the GitHub and then from the GitHub you can get to the paper.  Registration for .dev begins in January. Do you want stacy.dev?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do not. Doesn't Google already own this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do, but they're going to let you to... What was the one we were talking about?  .new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They use that to make your life easier. This one they're using to let devs do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you can let people you know you're a dev.  Awesome.  Corbin Davenport writing for Android police says many developers, including yours truly,  prefer to use IO domains for personal sites and projects because of course IO is the abbreviation  for, besides being Indian Ocean, input output. But now Google is working on a new ending  specifically for developers, .dev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want all the IO for the hot startups. You're either .io or .ai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now .app, which Google has, is now being... is also available and you know,  it'll be in the changelog, but I can give it to you a little early.  Squoosh.app is the first use I've seen of that.  I think Kevin owns one of those.  I think it's intended to be PWA apps, right? Progressive web apps.  There's web apps.  This is a progressive web app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Kevin has smarthome.app or smarthouse.app or something.  Yeah. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you spell squoosh?  I'll talk about it in the changelog.  Oh, okay.  S-Q-U-O-S-H. But you know what's funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had all the other domains they could have used.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a word autocorrect new.  Squoosh.  S-Q-U-O-S-H.  What is a squoosh?  Well, you'll find out. Stay tuned.  Is it a verb?  It is a verb.  Okay.  To squish something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've been squooshed.  Does that mean to flatten it out? Like smooshing?  Squish it.  Squish it. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be squoosh.app, but maybe that was taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google. Okay. So we all heard that Amazon's moving to...  Now see, I read one place it was Queens and one place it was New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Queens is in New York City, damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But isn't it in LIC?  I think of New York City as Manhattan.  No.  Queens is a borough outside of Manhattan.  We have five of them, fella.  Staten Island is not New York City.  The Bronx isn't New York City.  New York City is Manhattan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Bronx is probably the most of all the boroughs of New York City, I would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. Manhattan is the most.  Okay. Fine. Right.  Brooklyn. So those are all boroughs.  In fact, I think we've now gone through all five of them.  Have we left anything out?  But that's all greater New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's New York City.  Okay. I'm just checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You live there. I'm going to defer to you.  You live in Austin. I don't want to hear from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, if you talk to... I used to live in New York.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Oh, all right. Okay.  And if you talk to someone who lives in New York, they'll tell you they live in New York.  And then if they live in Manhattan, they won't say they live in New York.  They say they live in Manhattan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if you live in Queens, you say, I live in Queens.  You don't say, I live in New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. We see I live in New Jersey and I say, I live in New York.  Yeah. See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You do not live in New York.  Okay. How many people at this table were born in New York City?  Okay. Just let's get that straight. You're just a bunch of newcomers.  New Jersey is not New York.  You don't sound like it.  All right. So, but I think if you live in Staten Island, you don't say I live in New York.  Well, you might to somebody, hey, I say I live in San Francisco when I'm in Spain.  It depends on how far away you are.  Yeah.  Well, bingo. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, anyway, man. So, Long Island City...  Chicken capital of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Long Island City doesn't sound like New York City. It's on an island, not Manhattan.  But that's where Amazon's going to be. HQ2 and Nova, North Virginia. Right?  A controversial move, actually.  They're splitting it. Arlington and this is from the Google Day One blog.  National Landing in Arlington, Virginia.  How many employees are there in the company?  National Landing in Arlington, Virginia. How many employees in each of those venues?  A lot. I forget.  How many are they adding to New York? Like 50,000?  Let me see what Google says.  Because they're getting huge tax breaks here. Right?  Oh, yeah.  50,000 across the two headquarters. So I don't know how in New York it'll be.  People are having a fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because, you know, does this rich company need all these tax breaks?  And the L subway is already a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But wait, there's more. Google the next day announced,  and we're going to double our employees in New York City.  So if I were you, I'd get ready for the San Franciscoization of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would never happen. New York is too resilient.  I'm serious. You could bring in, I mean, they've already got finance bros.  Like they can't handle some tech bros. Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right. And what are we going to have?  Are we going to have special subway, you know, Google bus subway cars?  Yep.  No, you're on the subway with the rest of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Elon's going to bore holes underneath the subway for a special sub subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right through the bedrock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say.  Rent will go up. That's 25,000 plus.  I think Google's doubling. So that's another 7,000, 32,000 new people.  Most of them will want to live in Brooklyn. So get ready, Brooklyn.  Yeah.  I mean, don't you, I guess, I mean, when you have a city of 8 million people, I guess another 32,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, San Francisco is seven miles by seven miles.  It's tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it can't grow. So, okay.  Are people excited in Manhattan? No, it's just another, it's another company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in Queens.  It's in Queens.  That's where we get snobby.  Yes.  That's where we get snobby.  You can't say it because you're in California. I can say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's in Queens. It's not in New York. It's in Long Island City.  Okay. And I bet you in Arlington, people are saying it's not in Washington, DC. It's in Arlington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a friend, a startup guy, a founder who lives in Queens now with his wife and kid.  And he was, he's ready now as he was getting ready to, he likes living there and he wanted  to buy a place, but now the prices are going to go berserk. He knows it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't Arlington, I'm not as familiar with this area, but Arlington is just over the Potomac from  DC. So isn't this really going to affect DC a little bit too, right?  Oh yeah.  Yeah. And there's Amazon, New York and just over the East River from Midtown. So it's,  it's pretty much New York, right?  Right. So that's a, that's a, that's a, is this, is it, are these cities, all the little cities  that put on the dog and pony show for Jeff Bezos, are they pissed? Well, if you're going to do New

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  York at DC, you should have just told us. Yeah. Yeah. But I don't, there's a lot of anger that it  was, it was this bait and switch and they're getting data. I don't understand that really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the bait and switches, they thought they were going for a headquarters, a second headquarters,  as it were. And then Amazon basically cut that in half and then through their operations facility  thing in Tennessee. And as I think Dan Prumack put it really well in one of his newsletter,  he's like, I'm just going to call these large satellite offices because you can only have  one headquarters. So I think that's the truth. Amazon was doing a,  a marketing sell for massive operations basically. And people are like, yeah, I'll buy into that.  We'll call it the second headquarters. It'll sound good. But then when Amazon split it,  suddenly it looked a lot less appealing. So then everyone who tried for it looks kind of stupid,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right? You know, who's got it? Who has a good job is the person who finds and builds facilities  for Google. I think I used to know that guy. Yeah. I really, yeah. They just bought the spruce  goose hanger, which is where Howard Hughes built his giant airplane that only flew once.  It was the largest plane ever built in and it was built out of wood. And the hanger itself  is a beautiful wooden beam structure. And that's going to be the new Los Angeles office for Google.  Pretty amazing, huh? Pretty sweet. This is a, a drawing. This is the architect's design because  it's not built yet, but that is sweet. And it's beautiful. Isn't that? I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it looks just like my office, right? Yeah. What I love is there's a building inside the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. There's this huge hanger. You gotta respect the hanger. Yeah. Yeah. The integrity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'd be a monstrosity to keep the hanger. Yeah. Look, I mean, these walls are intact. This is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is really a building inside of hanger. That's why. The actual plane is up where now? Oregon,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Evergreen Aviation Museum. Oh, I thought it was in the Museum of Flight. I don't know why  I thought that. It should be. Yeah. Bring that sucker up to Seattle. Yeah. Which by the way,  best museum in the world. Maybe not in the world. Okay. But it's really an awesome museum. You

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  haven't even moved yet and already you're becoming a booster. Oh, hush, hush. I don't need, I've liked  that museum for almost a decade. Anything else great about Seattle you want to tell us? Yes.  The coffee. I'll go for that. And I think the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's happening to you already, Stacey. Geez. I have to love something. I'm so relentlessly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  positive and sincere about things. Come on. I'm going to have to find something I love  and talk about it. She's here. It's barbecue. It's y'all. Queso. Queso. Will you still say y'all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course I will. Okay. It's the best word. It is the really good word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Back to the goog. Is Portlandia South? Or North? North. North. North. Okay.  I thought you were talking about Austin. Petaluma is Portlandia South. We are kind of like Portlandia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Yeah, that's true. So let's talk about the,  so this is, people are very upset about this. Especially in the UK. Google bought a company  called DeepMind. DeepMind is an AI company and apparently had a deal with the National Health  Service in the UK and had promised, the DeepMind Health Division has promised that the data that  they had from the British Health Service would be kept private, would, you know, would, but once they  were acquired by Google, all bets are off. The health app developed by DeepMind is going to be  taken over by Google. It's called Streams. It was first used to send alerts in the London hospital,  but you may remember the headlines. It had gathered data on 1.6 million patients without telling them.  DeepMind now wants the app to become an AI assistant for nurses and doctors.  One expert, according to the BBC, described the move as trust demolition.  Stacey, you posted the story. Actually, I'll give you Julia Pol's tweet. This is totally unacceptable.  DeepMind repeatedly, unconditionally promised to never connect people's intimate identifiable  health data to Google. Now it is announced exactly that. This isn't transparency, it's trust demolition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in this, I put this on here because Jeff and I had such a different reaction to the news in the  first place. I was, Jeff, you were very like, hey, this data could be used for good. You know, who  needs consent? Because the big debate was over the lack of consent. I don't know if you recall this,  Jeff. So this is what I was worried about is the idea that once that data is in there, you don't  control where it goes. And in this case, it's going back to Google. It's so important because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you may even feel trust with the company that has the data, but it often happens that these  companies get sold and the policies change and they've got the data. You gave them the data and  they're not bound often by the promises the previous owners made to you. Now under GDPR,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you could actually get that data, strike the permissions from that data. So yes, but in this  case, no, I'm curious how GDPR plays into this if it does at all. And I don't know. I was trying  to figure that out before the show. I don't know either. But that's one of the questions. But I  mean, this is the problem. And I don't know how we solve for that because absent legislation,  because companies have a vested interest in taking this and bringing this in-house.  And we've seen it happen again and again and again. It's not a question of Google's intentions,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well no, we promise we're going to be good with your data. It's just that the promise was made  this data wouldn't be connected to Google and it has been. Right. And Google, once it's connected,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they have a fiduciary duty to make the best use of their data that benefits their shareholders.  Not to me as the person who maybe provided that data. Now, according to the BBC,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  once this came out last year, the UK's information commissioner ruled the UK Hospital Trust,  which was involved in the initial trial, had broken UK privacy law for failing to tell patients  about the way their data was being used. The information commissioner told the BBC had  expected that all the measures set out in its audit to remain in place after the DeepMind  Health moves to Google, an independent review panel set up to scrutinize DeepMind's relationship  to the NHS was unlikely to continue in its current form given the US takeover of the health division.  In other words, they're deciding, ah, it doesn't matter anymore because Google's a American company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But hold on here. So the DeepMind response to the BBC, patient data remains under our NHS  partner's strict control and all decisions about its use will continue to lie with them.  The move to Google does not affect this. So basically what they're complaining about is  now that data is next to a company with cooties in their view. The issue here is what's the use  and what's the harm. And just because it happens to be, then the issue is the terms of the use  of the data, the issue isn't that, oh, it's near Google. That's what I'm not, I'm not going to  I'm not understanding this story. I'm not understanding where the where the break of trust is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't get it. The breach of trust is that this data wasn't supposed to go to Google,  the DeepMind data. And also it's unclear what inferences were made from that data that could

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  then be put back under Google. Where did Jeff, where did you see them say, well, it's still not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going to be the BBC story, which you have under the embedded tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, in response, DeepMind told the BBC patient data is under our control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, the issue here is not, I mean, listen, DeepMind could have been bought by  anybody, bought by Amazon, bought by anybody. Right. It's not, it's not that, you know,  bought by Rupert Murdoch and I'd be screaming. Right. But the issue is not the ownership of  the company. The issue is the terms on the data. And just because Google owns the company doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mean that evil has now occurred. But they're using that data in plan to do like they're planning to  take the information and the inferences derived from that information and put it into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. And what's the harm of that? And what's the harm of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's unclear when you take those inferences, it's unclear how divorced those really are from  individuals data. I got to do a timeout. Some people don't want their individual data in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at all. And that should be their right. This is the same argument we had it before, Stacey.  Right. But this is, this is knowledge. This is, this is knowledge gained from information.  Okay. And that in a, in a, in a, in a modern society, you do not control and own knowledge.  And if I looked at that data with my eyes or with AI, no difference. I said, Oh, wow. People who  use heavy water bottles are 10% more likely to get kidney disease. So now you're saying up,  you can't know that Jeff. No, no, no, no, no. You're not going to warn people using  hippie water bottles that they, they might be in danger here. No, no, no. Because my data was in  that pool and I don't want you to use it for that. So you can't save anybody from getting kidney  disease who uses hippie water bottles. And for those of you on audio, I reached for the nearest  prop. He has a hippie water bottle. It's not a hippie water bottle. It's just not a plastic water bottle.  I think it'd be a little different. I think I understand what you're saying, Jeff. It'd be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a little different if the initial breach of trust hasn't occurred. In other words, the NSH  had without permission handed over all this data in the first place to DeepMind. And DeepMind was  now has already been told that that was illegal and they're already being under supervision.  And so there is kind of this built in, well, we're not sure we trust you. You already breached our  trust once, although you might say it's the NHS's fault, not the NSH's fault. But you can also flip

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  your argument. Right. You could also flip your argument though, instead of saving people from  getting cancer from hippie water bottles, what if we say we're charging people who have the following  characteristics, 100% more for insurance. And then people might be like, well, I don't want to  contribute to that. That's terrible. So there's also- There's always that argument that this will be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  used in a malign way as opposed to a good way. Yes. I'm just pointing out that Jeff, your argument was made in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  most, you know, I was just flipping your argument so people had to be honest. Yeah, I'm still going to stay on my side, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. I'm still staying on my side of the fence. I'm over here. I'm over here. It's going to make a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  difference in the lives of millions of patients around the world. Google said that. And you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what? I do believe that this kind of data is really useful. And that's why I'm so glad that  there are a lot of people who are creating like data donation, like medical data donation kind of  programs where like I can say, hey, this is my information. I want to share this with the program  and make the world a better place. This is kind of the continuation of my continued

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  complaint about Google, which is that nobody would have- This complaint wouldn't be as vigorous if it  weren't that Google is also using data to sell advertising. And so if it were a different company  that had, you know, that wasn't trying to use data to sell advertising, it would be easier. But  it's the same reason I don't like Google going buying YouTube because they do search. And so  there's this potential for them favoring people who use YouTube as opposed to people who don't.  And that's the kind of- That's where this- Google gets into this position by being so big and all  encompassing. And people get nervous about them. Jeff, don't you? I mean, that's not an unreasonable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing to- But again, Leo, but nervousness is not- Gee, I don't like big companies. I don't like  American companies. No, it's not that I don't like big companies. That's not sufficient. It's that I don't like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  company that makes a living selling personal data to advertisers to be the one steward of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  medical information. Give me the actual harm. And balance that with the potential benefit. We can't just say-  And I'm trying to protect- I'm trying to protect the notion of knowledge. I grant you there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  potential benefit. I'd be a lot more sanguine about it though if it weren't a company that's  selling our data for advertising purposes, that that's not their primary business. If it were some  other company buying this, if it were IBM buying this- NHS has control of the use of data. NHS

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ain't going to allow it to be used to sell you- I would not- I would not- No, those people in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hospitals, I mean, look at what's happening with Memorial Sloan Kettering and the way they sell

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  their name to pharmaceutical companies. Well, and it's the fact that the National Health Service  in England gave this data without asking patients, just gave this data. And I'm going to come back to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to come back- I'm sorry folks, but I'm going to defend the enlightenment, knowledge,  the fact that if you start cutting off conclusions from information, and if you let everyone who has  any part in producing any bit of data, you cut off the ability of conclusions to be made from  that data, you're cutting off education, science, and the friggin enlightenment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not that we're against that, Jeff. It's we're against Google being the sole one doing  this. It's not emotional. Google's business is selling data. And I would also argue it is our job

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to think about as we bring this- as we bring ton activity and scalability to like searches  and digitize everybody's records, it is incumbent upon us to think about the harms that can come  from that, not just the benefits. Because if we don't, someone else will and we will find ourselves  in the way that we have found ourselves with like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. That is exactly  why Facebook is on trial right now in public opinion, not in the actual legal systems.  So I'm just saying that we have to- I mean, it may sound like techno panic, which I'm very proud of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you that you have not said that once. But- Thank you for saying it for me, because it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, I know. And it- but we have to, Jeff. That's our job. We can't- we can't look at this  without- But we also have to balance that conversation with-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do, and that's why I put this on here. And B, rather than going to an emotional argument,  I don't like Google, I don't trust Google, which is what Leo's saying, instead,  then deal with the actual harm and the actual cures for that.  So the potential for harm is- What are you trying to prevent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you- The potential for harm is that this data can be traced back to individuals in ways  we don't understand now. There's also the potential for harm in that data being used to  disadvantage certain classes of individuals just as much as it helps them. So those are the two  largest potential harms I see. There's also potential for harm if it's not secured correctly  and that sort of thing, but hopefully the NHS- Fair, I absolutely agree. But what I am saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is the fact that this ends up in an app used in a hospital to help diagnose sick people,  I have- I'm sorry, but I'm going to defend that. And that doesn't mean that the data that was  contributed six steps back the line of an AI is at risk or is it jeopardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could argue though that the Tuskegee experiments helped diagnose and cure sick  people, but those were morally reprehensible. And you could argue that when you start looking at  data, hold on, when you start looking at data and pulling data in aggregate into something,  it can be used in ways that are just as morally reprehensible. And that's what we have a duty

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to consider. So the problem there is, as Leo said, it's, you know, who Tuskegee  or NHS, it's at that point. And there are- I'm not arguing at all there aren't protections needed.  I'm not arguing at all that there are- I mean, why do we have the systems we now have  in universities and hospitals and around medicine around how experiments are done?  Absolutely agreed. Those are issues. So maybe we need like an IRB for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think this case is showing us-  Upgrades under. Right. Which we should actually have  updated IRBs and understand the implications from this. And that's why we're talking about it.  What's an IRB? Internal Review Board. So if you're doing  experiments on people or- Human research.  Human research. Thank you. You may have to do it for animals too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to have it reviewed for impact and standards.  So why do you think Google bought DeepMind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they want unsupervised learning. Because DeepMind was the best at-  I mean, did they buy it because they wanted to save the world? Did they buy it because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they're a profit-making institution that knows that data is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can keep both thoughts in your head at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think Google wants to save the world. Google's a business. It's a profit-making enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders that they will maximize profits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think Google does anything because they want to save the world. I think Larry and Sergey  might have some projects they think will save the world. But honestly, the company-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think organizing the world's knowledge and making it accessible is a version of saving the world.  It is a good thing.  That damn Gutenberg, all he wanted to do was make money. Geez.  You can do both. You can do something that's good for the world and you can make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is true. But you can also find those at odds in certain situations. And when they're at odds,  do you go for profit-making or do you go for saving the world? In a company,  you tend to go for profit-making, which might be a good time to talk about Google in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you were going to say, our fine advertiser, ExpressVPN. And then we'll talk  about Google in China. I'm going to make the money. I make the money.  Speaking of profits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see what took my word here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  What did you want to talk about Stacey? What was the China, Google in China? Mr. Page, you're muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry. I didn't do it. I swear I didn't do it. I know. No one. There's no remote. No remote mute.  No, I was just, it was the justification for Google in China. I was just, you know,  going with our theme, but we can also talk about other things like the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's time. Thank you for mentioning. It's so much. There's so much. We better get to the Google  change log. The log that's so big. It even leaked out into the other parts of the show. For instance,  this was a story not in the change log. Android will automatically turn on your lights when you  turn off your alarm. Two new features for the Google assistant on your Android device.  So the latest version of the clock app by Google has this, the latest version of the Google search  app. And if you have of course, Google assistant, you can program the assistant to report  on your commute. When you turn off the alarm, turn up the temperature, you can ask you to play a  podcast when your alarm goes off, some music, lights, thermostat, coffee maker, whatever it is,  all of this from sub menus within the clock app. So look in the clock app and you'll see  all of those. And if you have a pixel three phone, you know, you can set, do not disturb,  to mute incoming calls or alerts. I actually have it set by schedule. So, you know, 10 PM to 7 AM,  I don't want any calls, but soon you'll be able to tell your assistant, Hey, you know who silence  my phone and do not disturb will be turned on, but this is not in all pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I thought my phone was broken. And of course, a little bit of me was looking for an excuse to  buy a pixel three because I really decided not to, but I thought, Oh, no, my phone is broken.  How disturbing because it wouldn't ring for like two weeks. And I somehow I had turned on, do not  disturb. I don't even know how I turned it on. I finally just, just as I was ready to hit the buy  button. Oh crap. It's not broken. I've actually not disturbed was on experimented with leaving,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do not disturb on 24 seven. It was kind of nice that all the time. Cause you can say, I only want  people in my context to call or I only want people in my favorites to call. And that's really the  only calls you want to get. Right. So my wife was not happy with me. Yeah. So you need to add her  to that. She can, well, I'm just, oh yeah. Yeah. Or turn off, do not disturb. But I think that  that's an interesting way to run. Then your phone doesn't bother you. Yeah. I used to have mine on,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  do not disturb. Oh no, nevermind. Ignore me. Just ignore me. I leave it on, do not disturb all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  time. Yeah. Mine's on, do not disturb right now. Yeah. Is Higginbotham is not available for comment.  Yes. Files by Google is being updated. The file management app for Android.  Files Go came up, came last out last year and they're now renaming it to just files.  So files go is now files. They've redesigned the user interface and there's a little celebration  when you clear out files. Should I, should I try it? I don't know if I have the newest one on here.  Let's see if it's called files instead of files go. Yeah. I guess I have the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, is this it? So when you delete things, you're going to celebrate it? Because Google hates to let me  delete stuff. I'm always like, please Google, I want to get rid of this. It's this files. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Junk files, select and free up three or four hundred and thirty four. Shall I just delete? Let's  just delete these all, delete these junk files, clear them all out. Let's see the celebration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that wasn't much. Well, that was very exciting. Let's do more. Let's do more. Let's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do more duplicate files. It was on audio. It didn't do jack. Didn't do nothing. There's a little guy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a little thumb came out. A little thumb. That was even more exciting. I can't stand the excitement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's exciting. Hey, look, this is the change log. It doesn't have to be exciting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to leading. It's got to be worthy of trumpets for God's sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll now celebrate how much you saved by telling you what you freed up room for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't know what that means, but I need that in my calorie accounting apps or my exercise.  Lost weight. Congratulations. Now you can eat a piece of cake. Oh, that would be good.  You've just earned a piece of cake. I think there used to be something like that out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Project Fi is getting smart. You're a Project Fi customer, Jeff. Yes, I am. Are you Stacy as well?  No. One of the things they're doing, we just did an ExpressVPN ad, but if you're a Fi subscriber,  you'll have access now to 2 million Wi-Fi hotspots that have VPN built in.  And they're extending VPN now to all your connections, which is very cool. So  I'm not sure how you turn that on. When you're on the go, you're likely connecting to new networks  and the security of all the networks isn't made equal. Ah, when you enable our enhanced network,  all of your mobile and Wi-Fi traffic will be encrypted and securely sent through our virtual  private network on every network you connect to. That's a good thing. Faster connections now. In  fact, I always assumed the way Fi worked was it went to the strongest signal, but apparently that  wasn't how it worked or it's something they're going to do that's a little bit differently,  but they are now going to switch carriers based on the strength of your connection.  I thought they were already doing that, but now they're going to do that. So there are some  updates to Project Fi, which by the way will not be called Project Fi in the future. It'll just be  Google Fi. No more project. It's not a project anymore. It's a thing. It's a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Excellent thing Fi. It's alive. It's alive. Actually, Chrome 71 is practically alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It will warn you about unclear billing charges and subscription signups.  It will show a warning before pages that don't provide sufficient clarity to the end user about  a transaction. They've quantified best practices for making a visible and clearly explainable  billing process. This is especially true on Chrome on mobile.  Well, don't people realize when they have to give their credit card information that they're buying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  something? Here's, you might get this warning. The page ahead may try to charge you money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The page ahead may try to charge you money. If you don't want this, go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Wow. Something like that would be really effective for privacy policies or data,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  non-encrypted data notifications. They kind of do that now, right? Where they warn you if you're on  a page that's not necessarily fully encrypted. I think Leo needs that for every page he goes to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need that. Facebook portals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, your IRC is not secure according to Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It isn't. Is there some reason you want it to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm just saying that they do that. It would be interesting if they scanned all of the ULAs for  devices or something and if I were going to go buy something or Googling a Nest thermostat.  It said, by the way, Nest does not follow traditional encryption practices. They do,  by the way. But they gave you a basic warning in plain English about something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lots of reviews this morning of Google's new night site feature. It's finally rolling out to  phones. This was something Google touted with the Anasda Pixel 3, but didn't make available when  you first got it. I haven't received the update yet, but apparently it just does an amazing job.  All the reviewers are just blown away by how good stuff looks. Yes, I still want to keep going  to looking. It is taking 15 images, some of them as slow as one quarter of a second shutter speed.  Obviously with motion, it's not going to be able to use that one if something's moving,  but it can tell if you're on a tripod. It can get very low frame rates to get very high quality  images late at night. Look at the difference there. So keep your eye peeled.  That's awesome.  Yeah. If you have a Pixel 3, it'll work best, but they are going to migrate this to the camera apps  on both Pixel 2, Jeff and Pixel. But Pixel 3 is the one that is the smartest about this. It's got the  extra juice in there, the extra processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So to say the dedicated processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Well, but remember the Pixel 2 had that too. I guess it's just a better one.  That's pretty amazing what it's doing.  It is.  Yeah. Lots of posts about this. And I think this is for Stacy. Create your smart home assistant  for the holidays. I don't know, making a great meal. I don't know. This is maybe just ad copy.  Setting up daily habits as a family.  Yeah. This is ad copy.  Yeah. Turn your living room into a... You do all this already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do this and it's not even my birthday, my holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tomorrow, Stacy, the guys are coming to our house to put up the lights. I'm very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, congratulations. Do you have your outdoor smart things or did you say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the timer?  I bought that one you from i whatever that you mentioned.  Oh good. iDevices.  I got six of them.  So they're all over the place. And then I guess I gather,  I'll be able to with my phone or my voice say, turn on quadrant one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. So here's my pro tip for you and anyone else doing this. When you label your outlets,  I label mine with tape because if you move, you want to remove it,  but label it whatever you call it in your Google or Madam A app. So I have upper balcony,  lower balcony, roof, snow globe, and whatever else I've got, Christmas tree.  And that way you only have to add them once. And then when you take them out next year,  you just plug them in and they work.  Put them in the right spot.  Yeah. I was like, but plug them in the right spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I got my brother label maker ready to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just don't know yet what those will be. And then I also haven't yet paired them with my phones,  but I can go, they're Bluetooth. So I go next to it and it'll pair, go next to it.  And so I can name them at that time and do the label maker and all that.  And then I'll know what those like. We have a giant Santa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have a Merry Christmas for the garage.  Test it. I forgot that they're Bluetooth because they work with HomeKit.  Right. Yeah. So test it first to make sure the range isn't going to be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like they're too close to each other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they're too far away to be remote controlled.  Oh, I don't know how big your yard is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be annoying if I had to go around the house to turn them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that would defeat the entire purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they're not wifi too. They're just Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess so. I don't know.  That's a bummer.  I have Z-Wave ones, but I don't recommend those to normal people because nobody wants to buy a hub,  which I totally get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says I can do Siri, Echo or Google Assistant, but I guess it's Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then they're wifi.  Well, I don't know.  It's wifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wifi, good. So I was thinking it's Bluetooth when you pair, right?  But then you give it a name, you configure it.  Yes. Wifi Outdoor SmartBlog.  Oh, thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was like, ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bought $300 of them, Stacey. On your recommendation, I was about to be very disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, now I was like, wait, I tried these like a year and a half ago.  So they worked a year and a half ago at my house.  But I'm like, when you said Bluetooth, I'm like, wait, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to say, hey, Echo, light up the garage.  Light up the portico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, what you're going to do is you're going to group all of them.  So then you're going to create a group.  Yeah.  And then turn on lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I say it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is it particularly twigish with twiddish?  Twitmas.  Twitmas.  It's twitmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can I?  Twitmas.  Can I? Well, so I don't know why we're doing this.  We've never decorated the house before, but I got the plans out for the house so I could figure out  how much roof line I had, 413 feet.  And then I doubled it just in case.  And then Lisa, then she said, and I want it to go up the side of that thing and down the thing  and around the bushes and over the river and through the woods.  And so we got more and we got big balls.  We got stars.  We got a sign.  We got a Santa that goes ho, ho, ho.  And then all of, can I have all of that tied to one action where I say turn off?  Turn on the celebration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they're all, if they're all talk to Echo, all the devices can talk to Echo, then yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're all on those switches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. So then all of those switches, you'll label them.  You'll group each one into a room or into, yeah, I would group it into a room.  And if you group it into a room and the room's called like Christmas or twitmas,  then you just say turn on twitmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Turn on twitmas.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You might want to test twitmas to make sure she understands that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are you saying?  What are you saying here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just, I'm just offering.  I have, I have some poorly named things that I'm like, oh, I need to read.  Cause I, we have something called the Nano Leaves and I call it Nano Art.  And she hates it.  She keeps giving me definitions for fart.  I swear to God.  I'm like, please.  So I need, I need to reach, I need to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Google Chrome Labs has released its open source browser based image optimization tool.  Squoosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be a figure, a minute to figure it out, but it's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Supports a wide variety of formats.  It can, it can show you the original.  And if you've, so the key to go to install this is, and this is kind of new too.  It's you go to a website, Squoosh.  App.  And if you go on a mobile device, depends on the device.  If you go on a mobile device, you can actually put this on your screen as if it were an app.  The idea is you, you drag and drop or select an image.  You can take a photo of you and look at the quality.  And it'll squish it.  And then once it squishes it, it'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So over on the right, over on the right Leo, go to quality and move that far to the left.  Oh, you can degrade it.  That's degrade the quality.  Wait a minute.  So it does it.  Yeah.  It's now you'll see a degraded quality.  Not so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let's turn it all the way down.  Zero quality.  Squoosh.  It's 94% smaller.  But see, this is why Squoosh is so good.  Yes, it degraded.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put a picture up.  Can you see the degree?  Look at the whiskers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The there's this more blocky, but still that's pretty good.  Right?  It's pretty good.  So you can choose different compression.  You could have WebP, browser ping.  You can eat.  You can.  This is a good tool to learn what's going to do what.  I'm going to do browser ping, resize, reduce palette.  Oh, it's big.  Browser ping is big.  Mo's JPEG was really small.  How about browser JPEG?  Now I can really let's get it down there.  317K.  That's pretty good.  And then you could save the image out.  So this is a really handy way to have an app on your mobile.  This is completely cross platform or on your desktop to do this, which is cool.  You like?  This is Squoosh.app.  Squoosh.app.  It'll also do S.  It'll do this is an SVG.  I could do OptiPing.  Oh, it's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then I also went into the resize and I resized it down.  I'm trying to understand why the quality went down so much.  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you make it smaller, you can't make a tiny little icon 20 by 28.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I made it into a very small image.  Yeah.  And then it would vector image.  That's kind of basically also teach you a little.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to teach you a little bit about images and image formats and quality and stuff.  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is this mainly just a demo of dot app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would say it's a demo of progressive web apps because I saved it out as a icon on my iPhone  and Android phone.  It works on both.  It's pretty cool.  Squoosh.  And that I think unless what else, Carson, you put a lot of things in here.  I'm not going to do them all because there's.  Which one do you like?  Any of them?  She hates them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the change lock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, we put a lot in there just to make sure that we covered everything.  But I think a lot of this, we don't have to.  I think you got it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you don't care about emojis on the G board, do you?  No.  May we give you a suggestion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nope.  You got it.  Got it.  Cue the music, Carson.  Cue the music.  It's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gosh, we came close to doing emojis.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dodged a bullet right there.  Hey, we mentioned that the Times is digitizing, but you know, I have to give  kudos to the Art Institute of Chicago.  They have put a big chunk of their collection online at their website, 50,000 images and high res.  I mean, you can see brushstrokes.  Oh, that's what we should have squooshed.  We should have squooshed those, huh?  This is really, really cool.  So this is part of a new website for the Art Institute of Chicago, but if you like images,  this is a good article actually at their website.  It's aartic.edu, Art Institute of Chicago.  And one of the things they're doing is highlighting lesser known.  Everybody knows about American Gothic, right?  But they're also highlighting some lesser known.  Oh, actually, I clicked the wrong one.  I don't care about American Gothic.  Let's get The Bedroom by Vincent van Gogh because, you know, every time I see a van  goo go, I want to zoom in and really see it and really kind of get out those brushstrokes.  Check out those brushstrokes, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is really interesting.  They talk about it for, you know, just putting as your desktop, but at,  and this is a trend in the high end, like, CDA home, home space, base home,  electronic space is televisions that act as picture screens or devices like the mural.  And so having access to this because a lot of those have proprietary art that you subscribe to.  But if you could just point your frame device, your digital frame device at,  you know, a rotating image of from the Chicago Museum of Art,  that's actually really kind of a neat thing to have in your house.  It turns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think some of the, I mean, some museums are loath to do this because they don't want  people to steal their imagery, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think most museums are there for education and there is something very different  when you go in person to see art than just seeing a reproduction of it.  And this is still a reproduction of it.  So I don't think this, but it is nice.  If you've not, everybody can get to Chicago and really see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I love seeing, you know, Monet's brushstrokes.  I mean, I just love this stuff.  And when I go to a museum, it's one of the things I immediately do is walk as close to  the picture as they'll or sculpture.  And really kind of like scope it out and try to imagine standing there next to Toulouse-Lautrec  as he paints it.  I mean, that's part of the fun of it.  You can kind of almost do that with these.  You really can zoom in.  It's really neat.  I wish you could zoom in a little bit more.  Obviously, they used probably a pretty high quality camera, but I would love to go in  two or three times more than this even.  But still, very nice.  50,000 images, arctic.edu, Art Institute of Chicago.  I'm a little nervous.  I don't know whether I should be nervous about this.  Pandora, you know, got started.  Tim Westergren started Pandora because he did the Music Genome Project in which he tried  to categorize music by the, you know, not just by the instruments in it, but by the  feel, the style.  And that's how Pandora got started with its music recommendation engine.  If you like this song, you'll probably like this because they're in the same music genome.  Now they want to do the same thing with podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, hey, I'm one of those.  The Internet of Things podcast is one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like, I'm part of the beta group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  So what genome are you in?  The awesome genome.  Do you think we're in the same genome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so.  We're tech news shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's in beta today.  Select Pandora users and iOS and Android devices.  It'll expand to wider public in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you sign up for the beta, you should expect to see it sometime in December.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know all about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The genome wasn't as important as they thought it was.  And it was really kind of a different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, anybody who's listening to a Pandora channel for any length of time  might think that the genome is not exactly perfect.  For some reason, I always get a Beatles song, no matter what I'm listening to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is very good.  Well, so Spotify and Netflix are the next generation of recommendation engines.  And they use a different criteria.  So I think what you may be referring to, Jeff, is just the idea that  it's basically an older way of suggesting music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  According to Pandora, the podcast genome project can evaluate content over 1,500 attributes,  MPAA ratings, production style, content type, host profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did ask about that.  Yes, they did.  Hello.  They asked what type of like we put that we were tech news.  We're news focused.  We're focused on tech.  We had improv slash witty banter, which may be giving Kevin and I too much credit,  but it's the style and other styles include scripted interviews, storytelling.  We are not those.  So there were about 10 categories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then it will use listener signals like thumbs, skips, replays to continue to refine  their recommendations.  This will be interesting, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll let you know if I start seeing a rush of new listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anything that improves discovery is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see the article?  I talked about this on Twitter a little bit, but I wanted to do your thoughts as well.  In the New York Times about Yuval Noah Harari.  He wrote a couple of really good books, I thought.  Sapiens, Homo Deus.  And he's got a new one about lessons that the tech industry should learn.  But basically, according to the Times, he's the principal doomsayer of Silicon Valley.  He says that by creating powerful influence machines to control billions of minds,  the big tech companies are destroying the idea of a sovereign individual with free will.  He believes Silicon Valley is creating a tiny ruling class  above a teeming furious useless class, as he calls it.  And he says in previous eras, autocrats needed the peasants because they grew all the food,  but Silicon Valley doesn't really need the useless class.  So they're much less likely to keep them around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One might argue that their entire business model is based on monetizing the useless class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would say they need us to buy their crap.  But yeah, he's embraced apparently by everybody from Google X to  Reed Hastings of Netflix.  When he came out to Silicon Valley, he was invited to dinner parties and everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My husband's read all of his books.  I started sapiens, but I was kind of like, oh, it's one of those.  It's a slog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't think so.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was a slog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to like books like Freakonomics and the Malcolm Gladwell books.  A little pet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  He's a little slogger than Malcolm Gladwell.  And I don't particularly love I'm kind of like, oh, how nice that your data that you selected  lined up so appropriately for you.  A little pet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pack me some more insights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He writes in an essay he wrote for The Guardian, if humans are hackable animals,  and if our choices and opinions don't reflect our free will, what should the point of politics be?  How do you live when you realize that your heart might be a government agent,  that your amygdala might be working for Putin, that the next thought that emerges in your mind  might well be the result of some algorithm that knows you better than you know yourselves?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in some ways that last bit is probably true.  However, the rest, I'm kind of like, eh, way to use your dramatic license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But see, he's trying to make it less of a slog for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  I read AI research.  Loggy.  I mean, I'll slog if I think it's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the DeepMind paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm not going to slog for that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then this article from the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Sweden,  why Sweden's cashless society is no longer a utopia.  He points out that when people use private businesses to exchange value,  as they have apparently in Sweden, the outstanding value of cash circulation in Sweden  is 1%, about a tenth of other developed nations, because no one has cash.  And furthermore, they mostly use an app called Swish.  And yeah.  And so as a result, he says, this is problematic for governments.  This development raises some crucial issues regarding the state's role in the payment  market for hundreds of years.  The public has been offered central bank notes and coins.  If cash stops working, it would leave all individuals to rely on the private sector alone  to get access to money and payment methods.  This would be a historical change without precedent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is actually so I actually read about this a couple of years ago.  It was brought up in relation to Sweden, actually.  And there's going to be a regulating body either will have a crisis that's precipitated  because of this.  So like somebody will go out of business or somebody will hack the private intermediary  and change the value of money in a way that people are like, holy cow.  So we're going to have either a reckoning or we're going to prevent the reckoning by  recognizing that it's coming and build up some sort of governmental body to manage that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is interesting because really, in most cases, the way you deal with money is all  through private institutions, a bank, apps, whatever.  But the fundamental money you're dealing with is printed by the government and backed by  the government.  What if the government had no role in this at all?  What would that look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it looks like, you know what?  What?  Well, that also looks like-  What?  Don't leave me hanging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Bitcoin.  Well, that's I think probably the point.  In fact, this guy's solution is to have an E currency that's from the federal government.  He wants to call them E-Krona.  But I don't see that that's any different than any other-  What's the difference between E-Krona and Krona?  Because it's all imaginary.  It's a fiat currency.  It's a fiat currency.  So you still have to pay your taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yes, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you still have to exchange your virtual non-governmental currency for governmental  currency at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the fear is that if something happens in this case, that the currency suddenly,  you've got worthless currency basically because there's this private company.  So yes, I mean, you still pay the government in something that is converted back to Krona,  Krona, whatever.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to Stockholm tomorrow night?  Ask them, will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't actually.  This was really sad.  When I was in Sweden, I could not download Swish.  I was so excited to try it, but my credit cards are all tied to the US.  Oh, interesting.  They were like, nope.  You have to ask Swedish credit.  You have to be one of the-  There are four banks, I think, that back Swish in that.  So if your bank doesn't participate in the Swish banking network-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Imagine in this country, if everything you did, you had to either use Apple Pay or Android Pay  or Samsung Pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, but Swish is actually created by the banks.  So the app was created by the banks who didn't want to get disintermediated by those things.  We have that here too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's called Zelle and it's horrible.  Nobody wants to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Swish is not as bad, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody uses Venmo or cash.me, which is from Square Venmos from PayPal.  I mean, really, we're moving in that direction into a cashless society that's entirely  exchanging-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in Sweden is very cashless.  There's no place to use cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can actually put up a sign in your store that says cash not accepted here.  There are tons of places that don't accept cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are tons of-  Yeah, well-  The thing that's taken over New York, every city in America is the same, but it's just  right around me, there's like 25 places where the food comes in bowls.  Like we've lost the ability to use plates.  Pretty soon, you won't get utensils either.  We got to take everything.  Yeah, just slurp it up.  Plates are too flat.  Bowls are protective, right?  So every one of those-  A lot of those places, a couple of those places, I go up and I try to give them a $20 bill.  Oh, sorry, sir.  We don't take cash.  You fool you.  You idiot.  Why would you do that?  How long have you been asleep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've worked so hard to protect you with our bowls and you try to use this dirty piece of paper?  Shame on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's beneficial to a vendor, like a company, especially a small one,  because they don't have to worry so much about embezzlement and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take 3% of every transaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's worth it to them to deal with, to eliminate the register person and all of  this other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really, this is like the thing now is everything comes in bowls.  Did Chipotle start that?  Bowls have been hot for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus the salad places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's kind of a fix of the salad and grain places that just dump all this stuff  in there, like the Buddha bowls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that true? Are we both focused here in Petaluma?  I think we still use plates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's bowls here.  We're here, you're behind a couple of years.  We have good salad places here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even the salad places are on plates.  Or no, they're in those plastic boxes.  Styrofoam?  We do a lot of boxes.  No, clear plastic or paper if they're hip, they're boxes.  We're back in the box here.  Whole Foods does boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we're bold here.  And man, you can get everything in bowls, right?  And you're going to, there's the places, I hate beets, I can't stand beets.  I just can't abide them.  And there's a restaurant named something like The Beat.  I'm not going in there.  The Beat.  I'm not doing it.  How about The Beat Bowl?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's all go to The Beat Bowl.  Come on, Jeff.  We can come to New York.  I'm buying.  Beat Bowl for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're going to, I think I'll have a little kale and some betamami and some beets and,  oh yeah, some Brussels sprouts too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, we're too old for this world.  I knew this would happen someday.  I just didn't think it would happen today.  I have my poke today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poke in the bowl.  Poke Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, poke bowls are a thing.  That's like how you serve someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, New York, everything that's a thing is a thing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It starts in New York.  And I don't mean Long Island City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It started in Hawaii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's where they're from, not Japan.  Poke bowls are from Hawaii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Poke bowls are from Hawaii.  Hawaii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got Mexican bowls.  We got salad bowls.  We got barbecue bowls.  We have poke bowls.  It is kind of the infantilization of food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you get sippy cups with your bowls?  This is very important too.  Did you see the trailer for the new Toy Story?  No.  Oh no, I missed it.  I hope.  There's a new character.  And I think it's a controversy.  The spork.  Ball man?  Well, they call it-  No, the spork.  They don't call it-  You ruined the punchline.  Thank you very much, Stacey.  Sorry.  Stacey.  Stacey.  Put her back on mute, will you?  This is Toy Story 4, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Forky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They call the character Forky, which you're about to see.  All right, watch this.  Watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From Disney.  The people who gave you Walt.  Is that Judy Collins?  I'm going to get taken down because of Judy Collins.  You can put it on.  It's not adding anything to the overall.  No, it's not.  So you see all the buzz and-  I was all happy in the sky.  Cowgirl, Mr. Potato Head, the Cowboy.  I don't even know their names.  I think you'll see the new character.  And then the dinosaur that used to be Don Rickles, right?  But he's passed away.  The pig, little pig, little rubber.  There's the alien with the three eyes.  After the dog.  After the dog.  The spring winter dog.  And it says, next summer-  You can turn the sound up.  Next summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They call the character Forky, but it's not a fork.  It is a spork.  So it should be called Sporky.  Sporky is a better name.  It is.  I'm having a fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's got pipe cleaner hands.  I don't even get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He doesn't identify as a toy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And other people misidentify him as a fork.  Yeah.  Okay, Kevin, who is an expert on juvenileia here, has come in to explain.  There's another teaser trailer.  It's a Key and Peel teaser trailer for this?  They're voicing Key and Peel are part of the toy collection.  How exciting.  Here's some serious news.  And I'm really happy.  Just in case you're thinking of swatting anybody.  This guy, Tyler Barris, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to making a swat call.  He made many, but one that actually caused the death of an innocent Kansas man.  It was a dispute between two online gamers over a buck 50 bet in a Call of Duty video game.  He pled guilty.  He'll be going to jail for between 20 and 25 years.  51 charges, including federal charges, initially filed in California,  the District of Columbia related to other fake calls and threats.  He's going to jail, folks, for 25 years.  Followed is a deadly weapon.  That is not okay.  Not okay.  He'll be sentenced in January.  We'll find out.  Also charged as co-conspirators, an 18-year-old from Ohio and a 20-year-old from Kansas.  They've pled not guilty.  There are trials coming up in January.  We reported on this when it happened.  A police officer responding to the phony swat call, fatally shot,  went to a house that wasn't the right house and fatally shot a 20-year-old man.  Okay.  I didn't mean to bring you down from sporky and all that stuff,  but I think it was time to get serious.  So let's take a break.  And when we come back, your picks of the week, because we're almost done.  Okay.  Woohoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Don't be so happy, Higginbotham.  I'm so hungry.  And my husband just was like, hey, we're going to go out tonight  because there's no water in our neighborhood.  So I was like, okay, so.  Still no water in your...  Okay.  This is just right now.  Okay.  This is not still leftover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not leftover from boiling the water in Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, I'm excited because I'm getting queso.  Tell them, shout out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Andrew, I'm coming for queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to have queso every night before you go to Seattle.  You got to...  Last chance for queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am very concerned about the queso situation.  Oh, you can imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to put kale in it up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't know queso existed until I went to Austin a few years ago.  Here I am, a grown man, a gourmet, a man of the world.  I thought I knew everything.  And then I went to Austin and they served me up this delicious, warm, cheesy substance.  My life changed.  Do you know why queso is so good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's melted cheese.  Oh, because it has opiate mixes.  Cassine.  It's an opiate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  We now know that there's an ingredient in cheese called cassine  Cassine that apparently attaches to the same brain...  Receptors.  Receptors as opiates.  Cassine is actually dairy, cheese particularly, contains cassine, also contains cassine fragments  called, get this, casomorphins.  It's actually pronounced queso-morphines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my God, a queso-morphine.  It's a morphine-like compound, opiate molecules.  There's a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So basically I'm high all the time.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, not when you move to Seattle.  You're going to be depressed all the time.  It's always raining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they have other cheese up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do.

Transcript:  Our show today is quite literally brought to you by Cashfly.  Cashfly is our content distribution network.  When you download a show, whether your podcast app downloads it or you go to our website and  download it, you're connecting directly to Cashfly.  And I'll tell you what, we've been on Cashfly practically since the beginning  and I have not once received that 3 a.m. phone call.  Oh, the content distribution, the CDN is down.  No, if you're in podcasting, if you're in software,  in any business that relies on having your content available  readily at any time to your consumers, you need a CDN.  But here's the problem for a lot of us with CDNs.  You can't always predict your bandwidth consumption.  Twit's very spiky.  We don't know from one day to the next how much bandwidth we're going to use.  Fortunately, Cashfly makes it easy.  They eliminate CDN outages.  They help you reach new markets because they have servers all over the world.  So no matter where our listeners are, they download it just as fast.  And you control costs with Cashfly.  I love the Cashfly team.  Easy to talk to, smart, agile techs.  They can answer your questions the first time.  They won't put you on hold.  They won't fend you off to somebody else.  They're really good because Cashfly empowers them.  100% availability with their bulletproof 100% SLA.  That's right.  I said 100%.  So you don't get angry emails or hundreds of letters from users  because you're the CDNs down and you don't get that 3M phone call.  I could tell you we deliver petabytes of data every month without a hiccup ever  thanks to Cashfly.  And I don't worry about costs.  I don't log in multiple times a week or try to track my CDN usage  because Cashfly will tailor the plan to your yearly usage trends.  So those spikes, they get all smoothed out.  In fact, we save a lot of money.  On average, customers who switch to Cashfly save more than 20%.  Here's what ours Technica says.  We use it, but ours Technica says,  Cashfly has exceeded our expectations on every level  from the technical operation to the actual service  to the top-notch support staff and their responsiveness.  We literally would not exist if it weren't for Cashfly.  Let Cashfly give you some sanity back too.  And we have a new deal just for Twit listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  This is a fun one for anybody who's in the Amazon Echo ecosystem.  So someone had asked us and we talked about it on the podcast.  So if you listen to both of us, you've already heard this  and you can feel superior to everyone else.  This is a skill called notify me on the Echo.  And so the links I put in here are for the skill itself.  And then an article that Kevin wrote on how to use this.  It's a little bit more involved, but what it does is you can take any device in your house.  We did it with IFTTT so that talks to IFTTT and we basically made it so Amazon's,  when a motion was triggered by my wise camera,  my Echo would turn yellow and it would, if I asked it to play my notifications,  I would get the notification.  I would say, hey, play my notifications.  And it would say your wise cam saw movement.  So it's a little, it's less useful than it automatically going,  Bing Stacey, I saw movement, but that also might get annoying.  So I understand why they did it this way.  And it was just kind of a fun thing to do.  You could use it for anything that's on IFTTT.  So I actually thought it might be kind of cool if you are waiting for a certain email.  You could get, you type that in for your email thing.  So if I get an email from this person, notify me on Echo would be kind of the recipe,  what it looks like.  And then if that email comes in, your Echo turns yellow and it's like,  hey, so-and-so sent you the email.  Nice.  So have fun with this.  It was actually kind of, I thought this was fun and it's actually somewhat useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Awesome.  And where should we go to read about this?  Your blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, there's a link on Stacey on IoT, how to trigger custom Madam A notifications.  And I bet in the chat room, ScooterX has already found it.  Has he?  Yes, he has.  Oh, I was like, oh, he's moving slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's already scrolled off the page.  There we go.  That's how fast he is.  That's how fast he is.  Stacey on IoT.com.  That's actually a good place to sign up for the newsletter and the podcast too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, a number.  Stacey said such a high bar, somewhat useful.  It's a very high bar.  Let's see if I can patch that one.  I don't know.  Maybe tough because I'm pretty much useless.  There's two here.  One is that people have raised more than a billion dollars on Facebook since 2015  and their charities.  And there's other Facebook news today, which we didn't get to, but let's put that aside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not really, you know what, I feel guilty because we talked about it before the show and  then I realized I didn't get to it in the show.  It isn't really news.  It's one of those great Times pieces about behind the scenes at Facebook.  Yes, what's behind the scenes is all the problems.  Oh, it's good.  Delay, deny, and deflect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The worst of it is they hired a conservative company and they were trying to tie people  who were criticizing Facebook with George Soros.  Not a good thing.  He's to blame for it.  The rest of it is mainly just a TikTok and the personalities and the actions and what not.  So anyway, you can read that news in the New York Times, really about Facebook,  but also on the good news side, full disclosure, of course, I raised money for the Craig Newark  Graduate School of Journalism from Facebook, but I am independent of them and none of it  goes into my pocket.  Right.  That is a closure.  So, a billion dollars and so on Giving Tuesday, Facebook will match a total of up to $7 million.  Facebook and PayPal will match donations of up to $250,000 per non-profit.  Up to $20,000 per donor, which is kind of cool when you think about it.  If you could get all your friends to give $250,000, you can turn that into $500,000  if you get in in time quickly.  It's a little gamification.  You should do your disclosure.  I did it.  I did it.  I did it so fast you couldn't hear it.  You didn't hear his disclosure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking about KSO.  I'm sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your endorphins were blocked.  I'm sorry.  The other one is the Pixelbook is going to be $699 at Best Buy for Black Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Awesome.  That is awesome.  Leo, do you have something?  Because if you don't, I have a great story that everyone should read because it was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will just quickly say this and I'll throw it to you.  And I don't know who put this link in the show notes, but I did want to make sure you saw it.  It's from the Mozilla Foundation.  It is a list of...  Yes.  It's just right for people who are about to buy, say, oh, I don't know, a Facebook portal.  It is devices that you might not want to buy this holiday season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or that I might happen to want to buy.  Or that Jeff might love.  Because I want to live dangerously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't tell you how many of these I own and use every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Me too.  Well, I will say it's nice if you dig in on them.  They explain what makes them bad.  Right.  For the Innova Suvide, one of the issues is encryption.  Right.  Do you care if your Suvide Cooker does that?  I don't know.  It's good.  But things like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the bike that I ride to stay in shape, the Peloton bike.  And why is it creepy?  Well, because I don't know.  Company, I don't know.  You actually can weigh into how creepy you think this is.  You can vote.  There's a scale on here that says...  I don't think it's creepy.  But I guess I'm all alone because, according to voters...  Anyway.  So what is the creepiest thing?  I think it's the Facebook portal.  It's not even on here yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, what about the Parker teddy bear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a good one.  No, it's actually not that creepy.  It's a classic teddy bear.  No built-in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  No batteries.  But there is an app.  And when you point the app to its tummy, it starts to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only reason it's a problem is because its privacy policy is written for people who...  It's difficult to understand privacy policy.  Right.  That is really the only reason it's on here, which is why I'm kind of like,  Mozilla, I love you, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's things that are...  Technopanic, perhaps?  From a little creepy to somewhat creepy to...  Good Lord, you don't want that in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Wyze Cam, which we all know and love, it's on here because its privacy level is difficult.  So it's grade 13 privacy.  It's EULA, basically.  But it also shares your information with third parties for unexpected reasons.  And I have read the Wyze Cam privacy policy and I do not actually...  I've read them and I don't recall that in there.  So now I've got to go back and I'm like, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is for the tin foil hat crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  I mean, in a grade 13 privacy policy, it's possible I missed it.  Yeah.  Because, you know...  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Little techno panic going on.  Yeah.  Same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like I said, I have pretty much all of this stuff, so...  I'm like, I have nine out of ten of those devices in my home right now.  It has toys, it has smart home, it has entertainment, wearables, health and exercise.  It's pretty much everything that phones home.  And some things that don't, like that teddy bear.  Ladies and gentlemen...  Was that the story you wanted to bring up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, my story is the Verge's story on the kilogram being dead, long lived the kilogram.  Wasn't that fascinating?  That's just...  Everyone should go read it because it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So until...  That is all.  Actually, today, the term kilogram is defined by an actual piece of metal  in a triple sealed vacuum dome in Paris.  But there's a problem.  Every time they bring it out to weigh it, which is like every 10 years,  it's a little bit less.  It actually, it's the last physical object that defines these key measurements.  The meter is now defined by how long it takes light to travel a certain amount of time.  This is the last one that's actually physical and they're going to change it  based on physics instead of an actual thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is very cool.  And it gives the history of why we have the metric system.  It's a really great article.  And I feel like you guys who listen to the show are probably the type of people who would be like,  yeah, this is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and interestingly, even in the US where we don't use kilos,  we still use this measurement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because physics, because science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because there are people who do use the metric system in the US.  Strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All the right thinking people of the world.  Strange though it may be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on, Stacey.  When you hear the weather, you don't say, well, what is that in Celsius?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but I would be a proponent of moving to the metric system.  I really would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Any sensible person would be.  It ain't going to happen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  Wouldn't that be funny if, how would you guys react if like President Trump said,  you know, we're going to move to the metric system and everybody moved.  And it was like, that was his, that like, would you change your tune?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, so he actually talked about reducing the number of guns out there.  And I was like, you know what?  That that actually might be his Nixon in China kind of moment for me.  I'd be like, yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's just crazy enough that, you know, he can propose anything.  You don't know.  He could end daylight saving time.  That would be nice.  Right.  Right.  I'd have to change my tune.  Ladies and gentlemen.  I just do that to rile Jeff.  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this portion of the program.  You may now go consume case.  Oh, morphine's Stacey Higgins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get cracking, Jeff.  Cracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm doing my research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been reading lots of stuff.  It must be a good life being a professor.  What do you think?  I grew up, my dad's a professor.  I grew up my whole life in academia.
