Talking about the Google in the cloud and the Googleverse.  Joining us as always, now from his home, not from his office,  Jeff Jarvis.  Hi, Jeff.  You stayed at home today.  Yes.  You stayed at home to download OS X Lion.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wanted to hear first from you, Leo, how it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  It's different.  We'll talk about it in a bit.  Joining us also, Neelai Patel, who has some big  announcements to make about what really is his next.  Neelai, former editor from Engadget magazine, author at  thisisminext.com, and soon to be The Verge.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  The Verge.  We're very excited about it.  He's on The Verge.  Actually, I just came from the office because I'm worried  that everybody there is downloading Lion, and it would  have killed this connection.  I actually love this shot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I came home to do this.  I love this.  You've got the red clock in the corner.  You've got the map of Chicago.  Did you plan that?

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  No, this is my little twit set that I have in the  corner of our house.  I adore it.  The only thing you can't see is the bar over here, which I  can just reach to surreptitiously while the

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  show's on.  I, too, have a bar in my desk.  And it's always a good idea.  Also, for the first time joining us, really glad to  have him, Ed Dumble.  Ed is from O'Reilly Media.  He chairs OSCON, which is O'Reilly's open source  convention coming.  Is that next week?

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  That's next week in Portland.  And thanks for having me.  It's great to see the cottage before it disappears.  It's kind of the last time.  It's kind of a poignant moment.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's also a big data guy.  He is the conference chair of the Stratoconference that  O'Reilly does.  And you'll find him on O'Reilly at radar.oreilly.com.  In fact, one of the reasons you're here, besides the fact  that you're so close by, I had to have you come over  before it's over.  You wrote a great book, a book's length article on Google  Plus and why it's not just another Facebook.  And we'll talk about that in a bit as well.  But as you mentioned, this is the last Twig show  from the cottage.  We will be moving next door to the red brick house.  And yeah, you're waving bye.  Bye, bye, bye.  On Sunday for Twig.  And then by the time we reconvene this show on  Wednesday of next week, all the bugs will be worked out.  OK, we'll see.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We shall see.  We'll be coming in on dial up, I know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You won't believe it.  You've got to come out, Jeff, and see it.  I have an amazing team.  I posted, actually.  John, you don't mind that I posted your email on Google  Plus publicly to a million people, do you?  OK.  John Slanina, who's our studio manager, has been writing  daily emails about what happened today in the new  studio, and he wrote me one this morning.  I got his email.  And it was just so cool with pictures.  And these guys are working till midnight and after.  He said, we should be paying you to have this much fun  playing with all this new gear.  We're getting training and all sorts of stuff.  It's really exciting.  But anyway, I don't want to go on and on about that, but  this is a lot of fun.  So let us, I guess we should tip of the hat to the other  guys.  Apple had a busy day.  Actually, yesterday, a very busy day with a big earnings  call.  Huge amount of profit.  They've got $79 billion in the bank.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah, they're doing all right, that Apple.  They're not a lot of problems.  No, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Technology's been very, very good to them.  They're shipping new MacBook Airs, which looks sweet.  The new Mac Minis, which looks sweet.  They're killing the plastic MacBook except for everybody  in education.  But most importantly, I think for most of us,  they're doing lion.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  I asked them actually about that white plastic MacBook and  what they were going to do for back to school.  And they're pretty high on the idea that people don't  actually need that much storage and that the 64 gig  MacBook Air would be kind of fine for most people.  Most people only really take a handful of pictures.  They only download so much music.  I think that's crazy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, once iCloud, I mean, really what it is,  is they're saying you do have data,  but you don't have it on your computer, right?  I mean, once iCloud comes out, we'll all store it on iCloud.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Right, or on Google Plus or something.  I'm trying to stay relevant.  Well, it is relevant.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This show is not just Google.  It's the cloud.  And I think that this is a cloudy operating system.  There's no doubt about it.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  So they're going to put pressure on Comcast not to cut people  off when they upload all their stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there's that guy in Seattle, isn't there,  who used Carbonite to back up everything.  He has two roommates, but they're using Netflix.  They're using iTunes.  He said a minute, a little bit of BitTorrent on the side.  But the thing that killed him finally  was that he uploaded all his music to Amazon's cloud.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Right, and he didn't get that upstream actually counted  for his bandwidth limit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  250 gigs he used one month, and then the second month,  and the third month, Comcast said,  you're out, no more internet for you for a year.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah, that's insane, I have to say.  That's super crazy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, get ready, because I think this is the war.  The war begins now.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Well, it's funny, especially on a Google show,  for the longest time, Google would argue that bandwidth,  and even mobile bandwidth, should be regulated  as an essential utility, which is  what Andre, who's the guy in Seattle,  I mean, that's what he's arguing as well.  That's what I would argue.  And ever since Google really started promoting Android,  and being in bed with Verizon,  I think that's when a lot of their changes came,  they've kind of backed off of that.  And I think they still make that argument  for wired broadband, but they don't make it  as emphatically for mobile.  And I think mobile is where the real action's gonna be.  I mean, I have friends here in Brooklyn,  and we only have Time Warner for most people  here in Brooklyn, and they all wanna get LTE modems,  but the five gig cap kills them.  It kills that idea dead.  It's because Verizon wants them to clamor  for FIOS installations.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can I be a devil's advocate here?  Right.  Because I agree with you.  In fact, I think it's even better than you say, Neelay.  It's not even a utility, because water and electricity  have to be created, but bits are infinite,  do not have to be created,  they flow freely without any constraint.  Wow.  It's not a, no, it is a bottomless pit.  I have a good friend who's an RISP  at the new Brickhouse, SonicNet,  and his attitude is use all you want, we'll make more.  He says, and I talked about this with him,  because it's my opinion, the expense of it, of course,  is the switchers, the routers.  It's a one-time only capitals expense.  But at that point, bandwidth is very cheap.  And buying more-  Let me put it this way, Leo.  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me try this on you.  It's our speech.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  And-  They're information fundamentally.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And at some point, you know,  we have to come to a view in society that's a right,  not a privilege.  And yes, there's an issue of paying for them.  Same way there is paying for, you know,  a newspaper or whatever,  but the notion that you could cut somebody off,  slow them down such that you cut them off,  becomes, in the view of many now,  a violation of a human right.  And, you know, if you read too much, we're gonna stop you?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, good point.  But there is economics in this.  And this is the point Neelay was making.  And I agree that there is economics in it.  I don't think there's-  The economics are not a big issue in land, internet.  And absolutely, in that case,  I think free speech should trump  whatever economics there are.  But I hate putting myself in this position.  But to play devil's advocate, it is true-  You're dancing with the devil, Leo.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can tell.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is true that wireless is a little different, you know,  because-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  For now, for now.  But also-  For now.  Strategically important,  if Finland came around and said,  everyone in the country  is gonna have broadband wireless tomorrow,  because they're gonna have a right to have  broadband connections,  they're gonna advance farther and faster than we are,  and make up for that Nokia problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So who should pay for the fact that Verizon,  it's expensive for ATT and Verizon and so forth,  to backhaul data to each and every cell site,  because that's what they have to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You come back to the argument about interstate highways.  And you know, another model here is that,  and this is not gonna happen  in the current political environment,  but the government would pay for this to be done,  and hire private enterprise to do it,  but that the government would then have a role  in saying how it operates.  That's okay with me,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but you have to have an economic solution,  because, and this is my only point,  is that it's very expensive.  It's cheap to get landline data.  It's very expensive to get data to these cell sites.  You don't just like the dark fiber.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  The economics are inverted,  because the last mile is very expensive for landline.  It's very cheap for mobile, right?  So there's a balance.  You know, I would say, have you read,  if you talked to Tim Wu, he wrote the Master Switch.  I mean, he makes these arguments a lot.  Everybody should read it.  It's a great book.  But you know, instead of saying the government  will pay for it, you know,  one of the things you can do is say,  well, you have a de facto monopoly, right?  You're AT&T, so that's fine.  You know, we're not gonna regulate your monopoly,  and so you can't have it.  But because you do have a monopoly,  we can say you have to act  according to certain conditions that we set.  And that's actually one of the reasons  why I'm very like cynically in favor  of the T-Mobile acquisition,  because once you do have two enormous companies  that own 80% of the subscribers,  wireless subscribers in the US,  the government is empowered to say,  well, at this point, the market has failed, right?  The free market has failed.  Verizon, you're gonna buy Sprint,  that's your next move, we all know it.  Let's cut to the chase.  AT&T and Verizon, you have to interoperate,  and you have to establish network neutrality,  or whatever you wanna call it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Look how well that's worked  with the monopoly called cable.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  But I think that's actually the real argument, right?  Because the cable monopolies  have failed the consumer over and over again.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right, so it's time to re-regulate cable,  and I agree with you, and regulate the wireless.  But that doesn't seem like the direction we're heading.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or find ways to truly have competition.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  The truth is-  But see, I think the question is,  where do you want the competition, right?  Because you can only have it in so many places.  If you have it at the access layer,  you have to let the competitors monetize the access layer  any way they want,  which includes controlling what goes through the pipe.  They have to be able to tax the pipe.  I think for us, what we want is,  I mean, I'm a content creator, right?  I publish on the internet,  so take my bias for what it is.  But I want competition at the content layer.  I want access to be ubiquitous,  cheap, free, good, whatever.  And so I can go out there,  and I can compete against Leo on video,  and I can compete against MSNBC on news,  and all this other stuff.  Because that's where I want,  I think that's where the competition is vital.  At the access layer, there's only a handful of companies  that will ever be able to effectively compete.  And the barriers of entry are so high there,  that I think we need to-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you can use the British model, Eli.  The British model is the-  Yeah, it's unbundling, right.  There's pipes in, and you have a right to access  all those pipes to offer better services.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the government does the pipes?  Who does the infrastructure?  BT, BT does the infrastructure.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  British Telecom.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's a government entity?  I'm waiting to go to the chat room  and see what kind of Marx has to-

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  It's my friend, Chad Mumm, who is our video producer  at This Is My Next and SB Nation and The Verge,  who went and made that documentary with Rick Carr in England.  It was actually on Engadget, it was on PBS.  It's really great, you can go watch it.  It's all about unbundling and how the British model  and the European model is different,  and has resulted in faster speeds, lower prices,  all this stuff.  And what they came back, one of the lessons  when I was talking about it, they're like,  well, people there are more willing to let the government  go and regulate things and say to private companies,  this isn't working, here's what you have to do.  And I think you're right, I think the political climate  in the United States is not ready for that.  They can't raise the debt limit.  I don't think they can go and tell AT&T  they have to open up their pipes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, if they can do that, they're gonna pay for it.  Right. Go ahead, Dan.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  So AT&T have just about ducked out of the race anyway,  their CEO saying their DSL infrastructure  was obsolete the other day.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, yeah, of course, because they and Verizon  and all these other guys would like to go to  the un-net neutrality wireless and abandon landlines,  which actually is an opening.  This was the argument that, oh, what's his name made?  This is an opportunity really, because as these companies  abandon their copper for fiber and mostly for wireless,  it's an opportunity for civil governments,  civic governments to come in and take them over  and do exactly what you're talking about.  And it is in the societal interest.  There's no question about that.  I just don't know where the money is gonna come from.  We can't fill potholes in Petaluma,  let alone wire every house or take over the property.  It was a huge culture shock coming over.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Was it?  Well, yeah, because I left behind my fast DSL for a start.  No 20 megabits anymore.  And the roads?  Incredible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And our taxes are so much lower.  No, they're not.  I think it's about the same.  It is exactly the same.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Overall tax burden's about the same in the US  as it was in the UK.  That's the irony.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Can I just say the political climate  in the Twitter IRC chat room is super hilarious too.  People don't trust our government.  That's very American.  That's a big problem.  The government is just us.  At the end of the day, right?  I'm with you.  This is America.  It's us.  It exists to solve problems of collective action.  And whether or not it's effective at doing that  is the problem.  But the idea of the government  solving collective action problems  is in and of itself why we have a government.  So I completely hijacked the show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I love it.  Go ahead, Jack.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The libertarians will come storming us any second.  But I think that's part of what we've seen  with the Murdoch situation is that there is  an institutional coziness  that has gone to an extreme now.  That government and media and police  and large corporations, you know,  I don't mean to sound like I'm moving to the Kremlin  because I'm not,  but no, the government isn't us right now.  The government is even open with us.  No, actually you have a good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So now what do we do?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it's, I-  We throw the bastards out?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that the solution?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, if you can,  but I think that there are some solutions  in transparency and technology.  They aren't full solutions.  And no, I'm not doing my, you know,  little right riding hood  going through the woods routine here.  But I think that the more transparency we have,  the more government is accountable  and more corporations are accountable.  And I think in terms of this discussion alone on technology,  you know, this is where you get to things  like unregulated white space in broadcast,  which Google fought for,  which would create competition  to wired and wireless broadband.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does our future rely on benign corporations like Google?

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  That's the big question.  I think what you're really asking is how benign is Google?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we don't know.  That's the problem.  I'm not sure I would trust benign corporations  over our government.  I don't know.  Who do we trust now?  Maybe we have to be,  what do we have to be freedom fighters, Jeff?  We have to take to the streets?  I agree.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We are the government.  We just aren't acting like it as a people.  Right.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  And I think, you know,  I think structurally the problem is that as Americans,  we are, you know, taught, conditioned,  encouraged to distrust and fear our government, right?  And that's like the grandest American tradition  is throw the bastards out there, I'll corrupt.  I'm fine with that.  But at some point you have to be like,  well, we have to solve problems.  You need to trust some bastards.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Somebody in there.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  It's not Google.  You're the bastard.  That's not the answer to every problem.  Because anybody,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but I wouldn't do it.  Nobody who has a brain would serve.  Or is that true?  Go ahead, Ed.  I could see you want to jump in.  I think the most worrying thing about politics

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  is the people who want to become politicians.  It's true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So should we have compulsory political service  like they have compulsory military service?

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  At the age of five.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Even I, man of the people,  stopped the line at the kid in the Burger King  becoming my my ruler.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What happened?  I think ultimately you have to have  professional politicians.  I don't.  Go ahead.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I would run, but I have birth certificate issues.  So really.  Oh, easy for you to get off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a non-citizen.  This is terrible.  It's not our fault.  Just can't see it.  We'll just migrate if it gets too tough.  Well, let's talk about a pie in the face.  As you mentioned the Rupert Murdoch word, Jeff Jarvis.  It's kind of a shame that the pie in the face happened.  You have to wonder what kind of security  that a guy who was carrying a shaving cream pie  could walk right up to Rupert Murdoch and hit him.  I love my country.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I mean,  I love the fact that people can still throw pies  in the face of wrongdoers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's good.  It did kind of distract, unfortunately.  I think the case could be made that maybe it'd be better  if the testimony had continued.  And maybe it was Rebecca.  What's her name?  Rebecca Baker.  Maybe it was her.  No, Rebecca.  Who's the woman?  Wendy?  The redhead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, Rebecca Brooks.  Brooks. Rebecca Brooks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe it was Rebecca Brooks who paid for the pie throw  because then it put off her testimony,  gave her a little extra time maybe.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  You never know.  But I mean, we do huff and puff and make scandals and so on,  but we also don't take ourselves too seriously.  So, I'll take the pie for that.  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is your take, Jeff, so far on the scandal?  Did you watch with rapt attention yesterday?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Absolutely. Hard not to.  Absolutely.  It was just an amazing show.  And I think Rupert is as dotty as they get now.  And they were trying to put him on that,  or that was a show,  or it was Rupert trying to go for sympathy.  And if that was the humblest day of his life,  then it shows how humble he is,  which is not to say not at all.  I agree with that.  I find it interesting that the nation  that invented much of our government  got rid of all this notion of talking about  my honorable friend, the gentleman from Georgia,  and they just say things.  They just talk.  And it has less formality and less BS.  But that show part aside,  I think that,  I come back to what I said earlier.  I think that there's an incest  among the institutions and society,  which sounds awfully broad, but it is.  But we really saw it in a shocking way  that how close the newspaper company was  to the highest seat of power,  how close they were to the police,  how the police hired the newspaper people to go  deal with the newspaper people.  It really is pretty shocking.  It is so cozy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was so cozy, wasn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which is also, pardon me, Ed, Britain.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I mean, not to be too cynical,  but I'm pretty sure it's always been that way.  And what's happened now is that we get a glimpse  and they really let it slide.  But I don't see that over the last 50 years  that we've worked any differently.  Interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I kind of got off track.  I mean, it's not really our beat,  but I just thought we've got a Brit here.  We've got Jeff Jarvis here.  We ought to really talk a little bit about it.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, I keep on throwing out the speculation  that News Corp will have to get professional management  when that happens, like rid of the newspapers  and it will become an entertainment company,  which is what it really is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And actually, you've been really outspoken.  In fact, I thought that you've been very quite cranky  on Google Plus lately, Jeff.  You got me mad, yeah.  Google Plus has been a great place to follow that story,  oddly enough.  Well, I disagree there, Leo.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No?  I think, well, at least for a take during the hearing.  Twitter was, I think, a much better way to follow it  because the chronology was safe, you didn't know who to follow,  whereas in Google Plus, the breaking of the chronology.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You get an animated GIF, then news,  then animated GIF, then news,  and then an animated GIF of the pie.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Kitty cat, kitty cat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I agree with you, you're right, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the lack of a hashtag, again.  We've talked about that before,  and we don't want to go into a full Google Plus show again,  but I think that one thing that Twitter sees  is the need to create the infrastructure  for people to gather around topics, places, times,  memes, things like that.  In Google Plus, our YMP doesn't have that.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  We know there are different things that are happening here.  On Twitter, you're getting real live  reportage and comment.  On Google Plus, I'm finding I'm getting thoughtful debate.  Conversation, engagement.  Yeah, the op-eds, the considered stuff.  I can't necessarily make sense of the tweet stream.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And of course, if you create a circle  that's just people who are writing about this,  you could follow that circle quite effectively.  I think actually most of the complaints I hear about Google Plus  are from people who aren't using,  who are just following everything,  who aren't using circles.  They're not doing it right.  You're doing it, you're doing it wrong.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  It's a user error.  Yeah, don't you understand?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Make circles, use them.  No, actually, I'm not surprised  because it's such a pain in the ass to make circles,  but that is, there is a solution.  You think it's a pain in the ass?  Well, it's easier than other circles,  you know, other list-making tools, but yeah.  Yeah.  Let's talk about Ed's article, actually.  I think this is an interesting piece.  Why Google Plus isn't just another social network?  Can you synopsize for us, Ed?

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Sure. I mean, I've been thinking about this a bit over the last week  and feeling that casting Google Plus just against Facebook  and as a competitive service  was a very narrow view of what's actually going on.  One of the unique things about Google  is they don't need to make money out of the social graph.  No ads on it at all now.  Right now, their business does not depend on it  in a way that Twitter and Facebook can't say that.  Well, Twitter can.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Only because they have enough VC, they can keep going.  But ultimately, you know, they're right,  that's got to be a business.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Right, that puts them in a very interesting position  to be able to commoditize what they're actually offering with,  you know, creating circles and sharing a notification  and really opening it up.  We haven't seen the API yet, of course,  but I have high hopes from the kind of signals that they're giving out  that it'll be pretty open.  And suddenly, they can make these notification sharing  friending services available to anyone who wants to incorporate them  without feeling they have to own them.  Without having to say, like Facebook,  well, you can have this, but only as long as it serves our purposes.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It strikes me that also Google Plus, Twitter really,  and this is what you were talking about a little bit, Jeff,  with following this trial, Twitter really is a signal.  It's a information signal.  It's almost a nervous system of content flowing over a signal.  Whereas Google Plus really is much more like email,  much more like a communications medium.  Yeah, or discussion medium.  Yeah, but I mean, in fact, I think it can, as some have done,  including Mike Elgin, incredibly replace email.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I think, you know, Mike, I come from the point of view  that computers are here to serve us.  And particularly with the social systems,  the more they model what we like to do in real life,  which is not stand at the top of a building yelling at people in 140 characters.  It's getting in groups, having conversations.  Then that's a platform where we can fit computers  into really helping us make sense of the world.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But Ed, I'm finding already, I'm fearing for the scaling of Google Plus,  because even though they have the latest number is 18 million users or whatever,  it ain't 750 million.  And how many threads?  I finally installed Comment Plus as an extension,  so I could cut down all the comment threads,  because a 200 comment thread is not a conversation.  It's useless. It gets back to, oh, I'm going to say it,  the problems I had with Buzz.  Yeah. It went on and on and on and on.  People say, oh, you're not back here talking with us.  Well, no, because I can't even deal with 200 comments.  I had something to say.  People said something interesting back.  You repeat yourselves like millions of times.  I still like Google Plus, but I see a real problem there  that's only going to get worse.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Well, this is kind of the power user problem, isn't it?  You know, for 99 percent of Google Plus users,  they're probably not going to suffer too much of this.  But it really matters because people who shape opinion  are the ones who suffer from it.  The whole Scoble issue.  Oh, God.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  It's a whole bundle of issues.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to I want to block Scoble.  And I love Robert and he's an old friend, but I want to block him  because it's too meta for me.  I want to actually use Google Plus.  I make a point now of not saying anything about Google Plus on Google Plus.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know who I just blocked?  It's like Fight Club. Who?  I just blocked Calacanis.  He did the worst  comment bait I've ever seen.  He's giving away a Sonos to anyone who at random,  who anyone who leaves a comment.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you surprised? No.  I never circled him in the first place for that very reason.  I am terrified.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  What happens though?  We know when the brand's coming.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Is that the verb to circle someone?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, well, we can't decide.  Some people have been saying to circle them size.  No, that's when you take them out.  I think I think to circle them.  Yeah, you circle them to put them in or in circle size.  How about in encircled?  That just sounds very German.  You have been uncircled.  You will enjoy it.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  I will say this about my experience in Google Plus so far.  I think the reason that we're all busy talking about how good it is  and engagement and how interesting it is and how you have these great  conversations is because Google was smart enough to open it up to a bunch  of journalists and Google employees to begin with.  So our early experiences were it was us.  It was it was these conversations we have amongst each other.  And I think when when you begin to scale it,  I think that's going to begin to deteriorate.  You know, and I'm curious to see how that takes place because I think it's cool.  It's right now. It's a cocktail party.  And cocktail parties are interesting and fun no matter what form you have them in.  And what you're going to go to a cocktail party to Lollapalooza, then things change.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, what I think you're saying is you're heading to a point where where  you don't control the discussion that happens because.  Sorry, I'm pixelating badly trying to stay very.  Subtractive, though, I like it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do not move.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Roar jock test to heck with it.  I have bad skin today.  So you can put out something and you don't have any control  over how many people can comment on it.  So it's not your cocktail party anymore.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Well, let me put something to you, right?  When the web started, we could list every web page on an index on Yahoo.  Right. And people were saying, oh, my.  This is going to get how's this going to scale?  I can't read it anymore.  And Google, another search engines came along and made sense of that.  If we're engaged with this, I got to have some kind of faith  that Google are looking at this problem and probably more than anybody else  have got tools to figure out how to solve it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Absolutely agree.  I think what we're doing is as having the hubris to to try to do the job for them.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Right. Just relax and, you know, float downstream on the

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  on the surface of things. Right.  Now, I mean, it's curious.  And, you know, I think it's good that Facebook has a serious competitor  in social now.  And, you know, I think Facebook will respond in some interesting way as well.  I'm happy to see them going at it directly.  And I know I know that your argument is that it's not it's not it's not Facebook.  But, you know, I think this will push Facebook to want to be that social layer  that they already were.  And I think that's what Facebook perceived itself as.  And I think they're going to realise now that they have to be much broader  in terms of allowing access to the graph and in terms of spreading,  you know, their friend relationships across the web than they had ever anticipated.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Right. I mean, being open is one very good way to undermine  your competitors.  You don't have to go far in the land of Google to look on Android.  And that kind of all embracing welcoming attitude  has pretty much helped them eclipse iOS.  And I think if they apply the same kind of strategy here, then  because the friending or the following model is much more fluid,  much more versatile, and they don't have the same kind of brand associations  as Facebook, they're in a great position to open up  and have the kind of services that Google Plus provides,  you know, flow through many kinds of web applications.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's as you say, it's infrastructure. Right.  And I think we just haven't seen where it's going because we haven't seen an API yet.  We're it's I think it's such early days  that there aren't tools attached to it for comment control.  There's all sorts of things missing.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  They've got to do one thing first.  They've got to they've got to do the job better than Facebook  or as good as Facebook in the first place before they can take it further.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they learn that from Buzz because Buzz had I mean, this could have  Buzz could have been just as important of an announcement,  but by launching it in a wonky fashion, they killed it basically.  And and so they need to learn from that.  You're right. It has to launch in a way  that doesn't kill it before it gets to its maturity.  But I just think there's so much more.  And it becomes infrastructure when you have an API.  You have it become background to a lot of other things.  And then and then it can really be valuable, I think.  And that deals with all the problems you have, Jeff,  because it's not it's no longer something you go to the plus page to look at.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I think once the API comes, what was really fascinating here  is when the API comes out and to see what happens with it, then  what gets fixed by the community.  I mean, part of I remember in this and the irony of this is Fred  Wilson said this about Twitter when I complained about some things  I wanted on Twitter and he said, that's not Twitter's job.  That's developers job. Well, not so much anymore.  Yeah. But I think that Google will.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google will do it that way, though.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, they will. And I think that that they have this basis.  And you know, when you build into that, things like the profile  become incredibly important and they're putting value into that.  That becomes part of the infrastructure of this.  But I think developers could do amazing things with this.  And that's what will have them eclipse Twitter.  And I think Twitter is the more important.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it could eclipse email.  I think it could eclipse a lot of things.  I think it could be a new form of communication.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  And what is very interesting, you say email, because despite,  you know, repeated rumors of its death, email still hasn't gone.  Well, I wish it tortures us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's I just wish it would go. Yeah.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Why? Why? You love email.  I run my business on email. Why? Why do you think I love email?  But do you want to run your business on email?  I can't imagine what else I would run it.  I mean, what are kind of distributed, secure, only I can see it system.  Are you going to trust?

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  So here's why email works is because it best models  what we want to do in real life and society.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What being bugged by all kinds of people who tuck it by my coat  and tell me things when I don't want them to tell it to me.  It's like going on the subway and having everybody.  They are the trappings of fame.  Just five minutes from trappings of fame.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  It's pointing out again that he doesn't have a normal experience.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I mean, my job as a journalist is to distribute  information to people and, you know, part of that means  I have to filter through information.  Google getting rid of Jeff is just ranting at me in silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know who to go ahead.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Can we hear you? I didn't.  I hear him. Don't you hear him?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can hear him. Oh, I can make myself heard.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  All right. I didn't mean to talk over you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll take a Chipotle break and then and we'll come back.  Fighters go to their corners and we will continue in a moment.  Nely Patel is here from This is my next dot com soon to be the verge  dot com.  Will that change the beat that you cover?  No, not any more than gadgets.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah, it will be gadgets.  We're going to do I mean, I think we recognize things  that Google Plus and Facebook and Twitter are.  They're an important part of what you do with gadgets.  And I think, you know, the reason we're not called like, you know, web tech dot com  is because we want to be about culture and society as well as,  you know, megabytes and display resolution.  So we're going to get a little bigger.  It's going to be more than three posts a day.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, but but you know, I was reading Gizmodo and they had an article  about a woman who has a nipple on her foot.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Now, we will not have any nipple foot article.  Thank you. I'll tell you that right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Brian Lamb leaves in one week later.  They've got nipple foot.  And it's like, I don't want this is not why I go to Gizmodo.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  They're ready to step into the breach that the news of the world is left behind.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is a huge gap, a nipple foot gap.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But now, you know, one more thing, Leo, how did it get there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't put it there.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Somebody emailed it to them.  Just shut it down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nipple. I don't care.  I don't understand why I'm scrolling through.  And by the way, it's on my portable, my mobile, my Android,  which means that it's like taking over my phone with his nipple foot.  And I don't want to see it.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  I don't want to see it.  Well, I will promise you right now that there will be no nipple.  This is my next nipple. Good.  I can make you that watermark.  Nipple foot on the verge, please.  No, that sounds like the worst album name of all time.  But it's a good band name.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nipple foot, nipple foot on the very heard of Nickelback.  No, we're nipple foot.  It's terrible. It's awful.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I'm sorry to go by a brick from nipple foot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just saying, I'm just saying, please, there's a better way.  And I know that Neely and company, by the way, Joshua,  is he's very good on Jimmy Fallon.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  He is very good.  I was in the audience that day live. They ate it up.  I've never seen anything when he gave all those Chromebooks away.  I have never seen a frenzy like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How did that did you guys get something from Google to do that?  Or how did that work?

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, you have to ask him.  But the backstory that he told me was he was going to demo the Chromebook.  He thinks it's a really cool idea. And we all do. Right.  And he said, well, you know, I've always wanted to know for giveaway.  Can we do it? And Google is super into it.  They sure it was great.  They had it was when we were leaving the audience.  They had a huge pallet of them stacked up in the lobby.  People like running towards them and like to crowd control.  It was it was like wild.  The woman in front of me when they you know,  I was in the audience with Ross from from the verge and my fiance.  And we were sitting there, you know, we knew it was going to happen.  But the people in front of us just freaked out.  You know, they were like it was like some people.  And the mom leaned over to the daughter and said,  this is just the most perfect day I've ever had.  Oh, my God.  And I was like, it's like a three hundred fifty dollar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That justifies your belief in the Chromebook, which I personally I don't get.  So maybe you were you guys are right.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  You know, I have it. It's here.  We were playing with the last night.  I put it after 20 minutes.  I put it down and opened up my real computer.  So there's you know, you can't run Skype on it.  I can do this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of my point is like if I just want a browser,  I'll just launch the browser.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah. But people I've never seen any people.  There is like people like falling out in the audience.  They were like it was the rapture had descended on them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's just some people who go to TV shows.  That's who that is.  It was cool.  Hey, we're in New York.  How about free tickets to see Jimmy Fallon?  But but but more to the point, you got to announce the verge  on like network television.  That's pretty freaking great.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  It was really cool.  I mean, you know, I've never been a part of any of that before.  And it was it was cool.  I was humbling.  And thank you, Jimmy, for letting us do it and for having Josh  for putting up with Josh.  Josh's 10th appearance.  You think you would have worn out his welcome by now?  That's amazing.  I would. I mean, I'm about to quit.  Actually, I can't stand it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is also with us.  He's cranky, but he's happy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hey, hey, who's cranky?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you were. You've been cranky this week.  I thought, gosh, I hope Jeff's all right.  He's awfully cranky on Google+.  Maybe it's Google+.  Maybe he's making you cranky.  Maybe. Am I wrong?  Am I? Yeah, yeah.  You don't think you're you don't think you're you're a little cranky.  Is the weather hot?  Yeah. Is it like hot weather that's making you a little?  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We lie down on the couch, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Get some Chipotle.  Also, Ed Dumble is with us from O'Reilly Media.  We're talking right now, though, about Squarespace.com.  The secret behind exceptional websites and a great place to go for your first  website or your this is my next website dot com.  I actually, you know, I just got my ham license last week.  And so I've immediately.  Thank you. You know, I've been a ham for my whole life,  but finally I have a piece of paper that proves it.  That boy, it's so fun. The gear you get, I just got my radios.  Oh, I'm so excited.  But first thing I do is go to Squarespace dot com.  I click this big try it free button.  Put my call letters in.  I said, I've got a new website and I set it up and it's so fast.  I'm not showing it to you yet because the call letters aren't official yet.  So I can't show it to you.  Oh, I've got this stupid upside down scrolling.  It's going to drive me crazy.  The mouse goes up, the page goes down.  Everything's all around around.  See that? I'm OK. Look, I'm scrolling the mouse up.  But the website goes.  I'm going to have to change that.  It makes sense on it.  For some reason, it makes sense on it.  First thing I did, turn it off.  Turn it off. Yeah.  I'm sorry, I got distracted.  This is this is this is the secret of exceptional websites,  no matter how you scroll it.  And what you do, what you'll do there is set up the site.  You get to use all the features.  You got two weeks free.  Try the templates, the social integration, you know,  the little widgets that let you put your Twitter or your Facebook or.  And as soon as there's an API, I'm sure Google Plus in there.  Actually, because there's Google Plus RSS,  you could actually just put the RSS feeds in there.  The widgets support any kind of RSS point and click, drag and drop.  You don't have to be a  HTML guru to do this.  You're going to get a great site and great hosting, too.  And that's really important because, you know, it's one thing to have software.  It's nothing entirely to have a great host.  People often ask me, who's the best host? Squarespace  for your photo blog, for your business, for your nonprofit, for your  ham radio station, whatever you want to do.  This is a great place. Price very affordable.  Remember, you're getting hosting and software.  The longer you sign up for, of course, the less it costs.  It starts twelve dollars a month.  You can even get down to ten dollars a month.  But let me tell you this.  If you use the offer code Twig7, you'll get 10 percent off  for the first six months.  And that's a good deal. Squarespace.com.  Sign up for the free site. Play with it.  If you decide you want to buy it, use the offer code Twig7.  For 10 percent off for the first six months.  It's a secret behind exceptional.  Websites. Why are you laughing?  This is my next website.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm laughing because the people in the chat room are.  I have our little Mac mini review unit here.  Oh, yelling at me to go open it and review it live.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have the new Mac mini, huh?

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah, we it's over in the corner.  But I've done by would show to you what I've done boxing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, oh, it's kind of skinny and pretty.  And you can add you can add ram now without a butter knife, which is nice.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah, the whole the whole bottom.  That was the old one. This is just new processors.  And it's it's a really nice computer.  I mean, it's cheaper. I think 600 starting. Yeah.  And Joanna Stern has our review unit of the new air.  So that'll be I think she's hard at work on that review right now.  She get that assignment.  She's she's our reviews editor.  She's it's what she does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She assigned it to herself is what she did.  It's pretty much exactly.  I'll be doing that assignment.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  First of the door. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Google just announced this one.  This is kind of a shocker.  I like the name of the title of this blog post.  More wood behind fewer arrows.  Google is shutting down Google Labs.  Wow. While we've learned a huge amount,  writes Bill Cogren, SVP for Research and Systems Infrastructure,  by launching very early prototypes and labs, we believe that greater focus  is crucial if we're to make the most of the extraordinary opportunities ahead.  So they're going to either save labs,  experiments are going on right now into product areas or shut them down.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  If they take multiple inbox away from me, I will.  I will throw a gigantic fit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll say that this kind of surprises me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It does me too. It shocks me.  I think, you know, what's next to go? The 20 percent rule.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is it is a big shift.  They say, well, continue to push speed and innovation.  But not through the labs website.  So there are so many cool things in here.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, there's something going on, isn't there?  Because is this Larry?  Well, the labs are really cool and there's nifty stuff.  But for a while, particularly last year, I felt that the pace of change  in Google Apps and so on had kind of stalled that is pretty much the same.  You know, Gmail wasn't doing anything more for me,  despite the fact that I got more email. Right.  So on. That seems to have picked up now.  And I wonder this that this is just kind of like a continuation.  The realization that they can't let their main product lines linger  and they might need to be a bit more focused about improving stuff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it is about about I think it's Larry and focus.  I think that's you know, that's the word they use.  And but what that means to me is more control from the top.  Even more of what comes out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'd really like to I'd really like to know what's going on in there.  It's it feels like there's a culture shift in this company.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  So Giga has an update on their story.  Google spokesman says Gmail Labs, Calendar Labs and other labs  will not be shut down.  Just the lab program that brought us Google Goggles and Google Reader,  which sounds terrible.  So it sounds like they're just diversifying these efforts back  into their main product categories instead of having this one  kind of cohesive website.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you just said two things, two great things, which came out of the labs.  Reader and goggles. Right.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  I mean, I depend on Reader. I don't add me to.  I mean, I don't think they're going to do anything serious with that.  No, but I guess the question is, but it's the point is this is make these

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  these labs are it's like it's like AT&T shutting down Bell Labs.  This is where good stuff comes from.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They did. And they did.  I guess the question is, would Reader still be able to come out of a division  or would Reader was just something wholly new that wouldn't be exist?  They must have a plan.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I think this is a combination of Larry  and Sergey, right, because Larry is in charge of execution.  Sergey is in charge of new products.  I think they're trying to really divide up the roles.  And, you know, you've got to focus on making new products better  in order to execute your long term plans. Right.  That's what this feels like.  They're just trying to streamline instead of being the chaotic playground  that is Google, whether I don't know that's good or bad.  That's what this feels like to me. It's so much.  They take. But I will say this now.  Hear me now, Google.  If you take away multiple inboxes, I will come over there.  Oh, says they won't. I will come over there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't make me hurt you.  Don't make me pull this podcast over.  So I do feel like there is a shift, though, going on at Google.  I mean, I think G plus in a way is kind of as a new Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I already I get a message right now when I when I did a search  through my Chrome bar for the other port,  it says on the search results page, the top, the experiment  you're trying to access is no longer available.  I don't know what experiment it was.  That's a problem.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Does it only come up for Leo?  It's the Leo LePorte experiment.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's it's.  But that's it. I don't know.  It's like those moments on Google plus where you see a post  that says the post is no longer here.  That's the only time you really want to wish you could read it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'm using this lab thing, which is the the voice search.  We're using voice search is still working for me.  Jeff Hoops. Let's do another one.  Jeff Jarvis.  I just want to see if it understands.  Yeah. And it said, yeah, Java it or yeah, yeah, bit.  I'm feeling lucky.  Instead of Jeff Jarvis, I get me.  Bipple twice. Nicely done.  Yeah. Yeah. That's I guess it knew what I wanted.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  I mean, don't you you really just want yourself?  I mean, fundamentally, you're always just Googling yourself.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Could they go wrong if they just replaced all searches with ego searches?  Just they couldn't go wrong. It would just be a natural.  One thing Google did, I have to I really have to praise.  Well, actually, OK, I won't say anything.  I'll let you guys weigh in on this.  But if you did a Google search, I don't know if it's still going on,  but if you did a Google search yesterday from Google dot com  and you had malware on your machine, it would tell you. Yeah.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Right. Because that's good.  They knew it because of some  the malware was sending all the requests to a certain proxy. Right.  So if you came from the IP address of that proxy, they could figure out  that you were infected. But I very public spirited.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Nothing more than that.  I saw Matt Cutts at Google a week ago when I was out there.  And he swore me to secrecy.  I was already sworn to secrecy by being in the facility.  But now that they've done it, you know, what's interesting here  is that it's also a form of crowdsourcing in the way.  It's a way to expose the depth of the malware problem.  What they're saying in part here is people are running malware  and they have no way to know it.  So this now surfaces that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and I think it is public spirited if Google knows it  and doesn't say anything about it, that would be wrong. Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it gives you it's like we're all getting, you know, hemorrhoid checks.  Thanks to Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Free colonoscopies today.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Is that really the right comparison?  You can't be like, we're all getting a flu shot.  You're going to write for the emerald.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's not a probe. It's going to be renamed cough.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nice. Jeff and I are just giving you a little preview of your future as you age.  Terrible. A little something to look forward to.  Nothing like a colonoscopy on a summer day.  So by the way, summer day, July 20th on this day in 1969.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Come on. I saw it on the chat room already.  Well, do you tell us then?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. Oh, he did.  That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for man.  And then Michael Bay blew it up.  And then they blew it up immediately after.  It's Monday.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And tomorrow is Marshall McLuhan's 100th birthday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And in neither case has Google celebrated.  But no, but they do have peas on their front page  because this is also Gregor Mendel's, what is it, 89th, 189th birthday.  That's pretty good. That's obscure.  It could have had a moonwalk on there.  But I do like the illustration.  The Google doodles kind of cool.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Yes. Kind of strange role that Google's playing as the social  as a socialist state that America doesn't have, you know,  warning us of infections that we need to get vaccinated against,  educating us into scientific history.  It is. Stay calm and get infected.  A socialist overlord.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hmm. Is that a bad thing?  Speaking as a somebody from a socialist nation.  Is this something to look forward to?

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I they managed to keep the tone so it doesn't annoy me.  But it's just an interesting phenomenon that they're the ones doing this first.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is a meme going around of this, that British stay calm.  And I guess it's from World War Two.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Stay calm and carry on and carry on.  Make a cup of tea. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And there's now those signs everywhere with everything on them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The latest version is stay common plus one.  Stay common plus one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Somebody made a stay calm and buy a brick for me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, good. I like that.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  And my favorite one is stay calm and eat cupcakes. Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Keep calm and carry on.  It's better than let's put it this way,  it's better than any animated cat gif you can think of.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can someone please come up with an extension that is.  That's why you're cranky. I knew it.  It is. It is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just keep calm and carry on.  There's the original.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Somebody's going to make an animated gif out of that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure they have.  Just go to Google Plus now, everybody, and make your put your animated gifs up.  Let me just see if there's any animated gifs.  I think that, you know, we talked about this on Twitter and Jenny Jardin,  who is admittedly one of the one of the offenders.  She puts a lot of animated cat gifs up there.  But I love Jenny. I mean, she's a boing, boing contributor.  She's got a great sensibility.  I don't mind the animated gifs because you're a nice guy, Leo.  I said, in fact, that we may look back and say it was the animated gif  that put Google Plus on the map.  Let me see if there's any in my.  Oh, see, I'm scrolling the wrong way again.  See if there's any.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  That's really confusing when you use the mobile app  because they don't animate. They don't.  I'm like all these very strange pictures, which are the first frame  and make no sense at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're very right.  One thing Google did do well, and it kind of surprised me,  I put an IMDB link in and it rendered it beautifully.  And the Google guys say, oh, yeah, if if the XML or HTML is properly formatted,  when you put a link in, we'll always do the right thing.  So you're seeing a lot of links from a lot of sources  that do format out very well.  And I think, you know, obviously, the animated gif was an intentional thing.  But I think they're doing a really good job with interpreting  URLs and making it a very rich stream.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm surprised no one has done an animated gif of the pie plate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, because I don't think anybody saw it.  It's just from behind, right? Yeah.  There should be an animated gif.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  TV was loopy that like it was an animated gif. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, of Mrs. Murdoch leaping.  Yes. To defend her husband,  which is a good argument for marrying a younger woman, I think.  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  From a volleyball team.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Is she from a volleyball team?  Yes, she is. She spiked that guy.  She did.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Have you followed Trey Ratcliffe?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I'm a huge.  Now, Trey, we know Trey because I've known him for a long time.  He's a regular on many of our shows.  He does amazing HDR photography.  And I would say that more than anyone, he has benefited from Google Plus.  It has become the Trey Ratcliffe site.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's really used it brilliantly.  He's put up just the right number of photos.  They're striking. People love them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But can I point out something?  He's been doing this on Facebook and other social sites for a long time.  He was a big buzz user.  It's not merely that Trey is brilliant.  It's that this is the right medium for him.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's as I've been saying, this is about sharing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And when you and Google did another brilliant thing,  this lightbox is simply the best lightbox.  Yep. For photographs, photographs I've ever seen.  I mean, this is better than this is better than Flickr.  The comments are there.  Other pictures are there.  The number of comments.  I mean, this is a really great way to look at pictures.  And I think a photographer like Trey, a lot of photographers, in fact,  have really benefited from this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what becomes interesting about that, Leo, is is  if you're you know, does it become better at some point than  than YouTube to show your best video if you'd use it well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see a lot of YouTube videos on here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Look at this, you know, see a lot of these.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I think the key thing is that it's in the conversation when it's on Google Plus.  It's not out in a silo that's dedicated to you just walking into the room  and showing people what you've done.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Is Google Plus the world's biggest BBS?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's it is. It's a forum, isn't it?  It's really just a huge forum. Yeah.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  And they're trying to build the forum layer over the top.  It's it's an interesting way to look at it.  But if I'm just so curious  how they're going to actually use my personal data. Right.  I mean, this is  this feels like a theme of our show is, do you trust you better serve?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why would they? Yeah. Why would they?  What would they do? Come on, Eli.  First of all, they already know everything about you.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Just give in. Just shut up.  Just give it a shut up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Stay calm and shut up.  Relax and float down downstream. Yeah.  By the way, they have now banned the brands.  Dan Patterson of ABC News just posted on Google Plus that they have, in fact,  killed the ABC News radio page.  This is something they said they did not want brands to do this.  And, you know, I applied for the brand page on there.  I didn't jump the gun like Mashable, ABC, a lot of organizations.  And because I just thought, well, I'm going to honor their request not to do that.  It's interesting, though, that they've actually clobbered them.  They're gone.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Right. I mean, they had to, right?  Because if you did the right thing, they couldn't say, well, there's the right.  Right. I felt bad.  Some people are too big to fail. Yeah.  It's a good socialist kind of way to run things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, probably Mashable is the one who screwed it up for everybody else,  because they were like now the number four most followed  page on there. Let me see. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting that it was.  So imagine if Twitter had done that at the beginning, if Twitter had created  people space and brand space.  Right. And then it could have monetized brand space.  I think I think what we're going to see here is not advertising as we know it.  I think we're going to see brands using it.  And we have Michael Dell, who I'm sure followed our advice from the show  three weeks ago, and he's looking at how to use  plus for customer service and hangouts for customer service.  So if you really look at, you know, I was talking to a whole  bunch of hyper local people and I said that they should look at the merchants  in their towns as members of their community.  And finding ways to serve their benefits and make money from that.  And I wonder whether that was where Google goes,  whereas Twitter still is failing out there with no damn business plan.  Matthew Ingram wrote on Giga Home today, according to Costello, saying  they're going to become a real time commerce company.  What?  Sorry. What?  Meanwhile, you saw one of these stories in the list is Twitter  just is supposedly closing an 800 million dollar round,  400 million of which will go to investors and employees.  Oh, that's interesting.  And somebody said in taking money off the table now,  somebody and Google Plus said uncharitably it was a Ponzi scheme.  That's a little strong, but, you know, one should worry about a company that  that starts taking money off the table.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a group on did with their most recent round.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But on the other hand, you know, what's happening is there are private markets  now that are doing it anyway.  And I think it was Costello who said or some one of them said  some event last week that the private market  exchanges are causing them big problems because employees are trying to cash out.  And so, you know, we really need a new structure for earlier markets.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's a very interesting.  What a world we live in.  Google, while it's shutting down,  Google Labs is apparently spending millions of dollars, according  to the New York Times, to find the next Google.  Claire Kane Miller is better.  It says that writing in the New York Times says Google is betting  200 million dollars  as a venture capital company looking for.  Google Investments, I guess that makes sense.  200 million isn't a huge fund, is it?  No, it's not. Well, not for that.  No, they got 39 billion in the bank.  Google put in a billion or two.  Put some money in there.  What are you doing with all that money in the bank?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, well, another thing to do, I think, if you look at the early days,  it didn't didn't Kleiner Perkins start a Twitter fund.  Yes, a mobile fund.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They did. They twirled his Twitter fund for Twitter apps, I think.  Yeah, I think so.  Wonder how that's going for him.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly. That's more the story.  Hey, reporters, I thought that's for the story.  So why wouldn't Google why shouldn't Google when they go to the API  start a plus fund?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google Ventures says it's invested as much money in the first half of 2011  as it did in all of 2010.  Larry Page says they're going to continue at that rate.  They are pumping money out there.  I think that's smart.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Yeah, it hedges, doesn't it?  I mean, you can't achieve all the innovation you want inside your company.  Close the labs and start to venture fund.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not a bad idea.  Google spent at least a million dollars on G.C.O.  This is the new domain I immediately checked.  And Twitter.co and Leo.co are already gone.  Didn't take any time at all.  I can't get my name there ever anywhere.  But apparently, according to the.co folks, Co is Colombia.  You know, the single letter domains T.co is Twitter's shortening.  Google just bought G.C.O.  The the.co guy who runs the.co  registrar Juan Diego Calle said that it's north of one and a half million dollars  to get a single letter.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  They're making big money.  I mean, that's a good deal.  Those guys have been sponsoring the WebExpo conferences in Moscone  for some years now.  Really? That's you know.  Yeah, like big time spending.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is it?  Is it Colombian drug lords laundering their cash?

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I'm not authorized to tell you.  I have no idea.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Do you? Yeah, that's why, because I couldn't get.com  because nobody the person refuses to respond.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How much did you pay for the.co?

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  I paid whatever GoDaddy charged me.  It was like 10 bucks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's only like those special one letter ones.  Like if you wanted P.co.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be expensive.  It's the URL shorter.  But here's the question.  Post Twitter, not that I'm predicting any demise here,  but but in a plus world, do you need shorter is anymore?  I don't think so.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I would be so glad when they die.  Yeah. Yeah. Needless.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Who wants G.C.O.  Although, please can Google, can you bring back their name in the profile?  I don't want to be a six, four, three, seven, nine, nine, four, one, one, three, nine, nine, four, one, one.  That's silly.  I don't want to do that.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  So you're saying that you know what you are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am who I am.  I am not a number.  I am a free man.  But it used to work profiles.Google.com slash Leo Laporte doesn't anymore.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I don't know if they have some privacy issues to nail down there before they can bring that back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you used to have a switch, right?  So on your profile, you could say I want my name or not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, here's a very interesting one.  That line is is the question of verification.  And one of the stories in the list is Google's strategy for celebrity acquisition.  And part of the question for there is how do you verify?  And one speculation was that you would fax your driver's license in.  Sir, I am what I am.  Well, they have it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They kicked Bill Shatner off.  William Shatner said, hey, Google.  And by the way, it's not Google.  I don't think it's Google who does this.  I think it's the users who say, report this.  This isn't William Shatner. Report it.  And he got booted off.  And then I'm sure somebody at Google said, whoops, because he got brought back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We'll have his new gatekeepers.  You'll have agents and publishers and studio.  People like that become the gatekeepers to identity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think Google is so wise to defer celebrities and brands.  Yes. Right. As long as they can.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, they should have.  You know what? Here's here's my here's my sob to Robert Scoble.  Robert, you're a celebrity. You should have waited.  Yeah. You're a star.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's not allowed. Yeah.  And then if he gets off, then I could be like number five. Yeah.  Mashable, by the way, is still on there.  Mashable did not get booted.  I thought they might have, but they still have their.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Maybe they'll just do the right thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am holding back.  So what will happen? Will it be like a special brands area or?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know either.  And you know, I just have to set up the thinking about with this notion of ads  on Twitter is and I asked, I suggested Bill Gross should do this  because they have these clients.  I've long wanted to know what's the proportion of tweets that are read  or just simply displayed on a screen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We will never know, because I don't think Twitter wants us to know that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, but Twitter is not the one who probably knows it.  Well, they know from the web is a is a client.  Right. And so if you're going to put an ad in a stream,  you have this problem of how much of your audience isn't seeing. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How many impressions do you get?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Whereas so that's going to be a problem that Twitter has to have architecturally.  Whereas if you look at Google, look at what Google's done in the past.  Google completely reinvented advertising.  This is critical in old media.  The advertiser took the risk.  You know, with this ad worker, that was your problem in Google land.  When they sold by the click, Google took the risk  and Google aligned its interests with the marketer. Right.  And that changed the economics of all advertising and all media right there.  That was the key thing that happened.  That's what really changed everything, as they offered a better deal to advertisers.  Well, so come along with Plus.  First, they're going to prove that people are there.  It's very active. It's a beautiful place.  And we're in charge. It's our space.  Kind of. And so then if you're going to enter in brands,  I think I'm just I'm just betting and I don't know anything about that at all.  But I'm betting Google's going to invent something that's as new.  And how do you want to interact with Dell?  Right. And how does Dell want to be interacted with people?  You know, you go to things like my Starbucks idea and and the Dell forms  where people solve each other's problems and those kinds of things.  You can imagine morphing those functions to a world like this.  Much higher value, much higher relevance to the user, much better experience.  You know, I think we're not going to see plain old ads in streams here.  I could be wrong, but I'm going to bet they're going to invent  something new for the brands and it'll be worth it for the brands to wait.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I think you're right.  And one of the character, one of the things that strikes me about Google  Plus right now is that it's actually earned the word social in social network.  Right. It's not kind of a half in half out broadcast platform.  Twitter. Right.  Twitter is really not social.  No, it's not the same.  For many, anyway.  And for me, it is does that because it more accurately models  the way I relate to people, the whole circles thing.  If they can accurately model the useful way to relate to brands.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But how would that I'm trying to think what that would look like.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I think Jeff's got something with, you know, more like take the support forums.  You know, you write you like get satisfaction kind of you walk into a store,  you take it to somebody says isn't working. What's going on?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But a brand doesn't intrude on my stream necessarily.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. You if you seek out the brand or the brand is recommended to you,  that becomes incredibly valuable.  You know, I even look at Blippi, where my favorite story out of Blippi,  and they've pivoted a bit to after I finished.  Are they still around?  They are. They are.  I got a whole damn chapter on Kaplan in there.  So you better not die.  His company, I mean.  But my favorite story from what he tells me is that when Matt Cutts,  we told before the show, bought the Wi-Fi scale.  Right. And they credit that over you, Leo, which may be wrong.  But in any case, a hundred people bought it immediately. Right.  And if you look at that, that's the future market.  And now they're a review site.  Right. That's pretty much they want content.  They've gone to review and they use the credit card  only to be a gateway to reviews.  Whatever.  I think if you look at changing the relationship of a company to its.  Public on Google, plus, that's possible.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Well, the thing is, nobody wants to listen to companies talk about themselves, right?  It's they'll tell people when they, you know, companies speak at conferences.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I even am starting to revolt at the self-promotion that I see on here.  I almost want to see people use Google Plus as a selfless tool.  Why are you laughing at me?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  You want to get speaks up people, human beings, the ability to broadcast  information, but you don't want it to be about themselves. Yeah.  You are crazy. I don't know what.  I don't know if it's about themselves, but if it's it,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  if it could be about their unique point of view, but it like  you know, an article, but there's so much self-promotion.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  It's like a dinner party.  You don't want to be talking about yourself all the time.  And you wouldn't be revealing enough to be interested.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's actually how it should be.  But how do you enforce that structurally or this?

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  This goes right back.  This is why they open it up to journalists who always want to talk about things.  And we we find ourselves fascinating.  But, you know, because we're peers and colleagues and egotists.  But when you open it up to the huge scale,  it is going to be endless self-promotion.  Yeah. And I mean, that that's just the nature.  And that's so isn't that isn't that a big this?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a in a bigger way.  The challenge of Google faces with brands.  How do you keep something like this compelling and content rich?  Not just in the face of brand promotion, but in the face of humans.  This ties in.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  It ties in a bit with what Tim O'Reilly says about privacy, that,  you know, all the data is out there.  The only chance you've got of regulating it is by building social mores  into the system.  So if somehow the system punishes  people who incessantly talk about themselves, if it's easy to get rid of them  or that's frowned on, then that's the best.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We need a new drop down.  It doesn't just say report abuse or block this person, but like  this person's too self-promotional.  Ha. That'd be good.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  You know, I was when I was in college and I threw a lot of parties.  I would always say that I knew I was having a good party.  When there was somebody there that I didn't like and who didn't like me,  because that meant my party was so good that it transcended our personal relationship.  And that's like that Google Plus is right on that cusp.  My party is starting to get full of a lot of people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know. Well, I'm seeing an interesting trend on Google Plus  to people using this report abuse button against people.  In fact, Jenny Jardin just said, how come Mashable is still in here  when ABC is gone?  And the first comment is report is fake profile now, you know,  people should people will start using vigilante tools.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  I used it this morning.  I woke up and somebody had shared something to me.  They were having a competition or something.  And was it a footnipple?  It was not.  Was it Jason Kelly?  I don't think I'd know a footnipple if I saw it was probably Jason.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was actually really what you were talking about.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  He's giving away and our fake profile go away.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Yeah, we're you know, we're building all this new stuff  for the verge and we're talking about comments and communities and  it's a huge challenge.  Huh? It's a huge challenge.  It is. And, you know, one of the things we took away  at Engadget was we took away the downrank buttons and we said,  you know what, people are abused.  There's no we want people to to to go after the good things.  They did on dig. They misused it on dig. Right.  So we want people to to to spend their energy promoting good things  and spend their energy in a positive way.  And we'll we'll go through and moderate the bad stuff.  That's we'll take on that role.  That's that's our responsibility.  We want readers to go organically find the good stuff.  And maybe it worked and maybe it didn't.  But that was I mean, that's our thinking.  It still kind of is.  There's all those buttons that let you do something vengeful.  They're ripe for abuse.  I mean, that the first thing that's going to happen is people are going to use them  the wrong way instead of saying this is really good.  It's hard. It's a hard thing to do. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Eli, let me ask a question.  Could you imagine with an API out there, right?  So you have more control over what you do.  Could you imagine building Verge not on a website, but on plus?  What would that look like?

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  So if I was if I was just me,  if I was the guy and I wanted to be a publisher, you're just a guy.  And if I didn't have any resources and I wasn't part of a company  that is actually a technology company, then, yeah, I would say, well, I could.  There's a way for me to focus my energies on specific platforms,  you know, because what we think at SB Nation and the Verge is that you're  you know, you we can write a WordPress blog, which what we're doing now.  And it's interesting.  And, you know, we're getting traffic and people like it.  But what makes it what makes our the Verge will make that better  and good and vital and interesting is how we're going to leverage  the technology of the web to make our content new. Right.  So we're not taking a print magazine and shoving it on the web and saying,  well, we're online.  And so I think the technology informs the publication.  So if I'm just me and I say, well, I don't have the ability  to build proprietary technology like I like I do now. Right.  Because I'm part of a company.  Well, yeah. Then I could say, well, I want to use Twitter and Facebook  and Google Plus and all these other things in lieu of installing WordPress.  You could do it.  I don't know what that would look like.  But if it was just me and I was driven to do it that way, I could.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The question. It probably wouldn't be your first choice for a comment  content delivery system, but it sure is valuable for brand building.  Look what Ray Radcliffe has gained out of it.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  So let me ask. Let me ask Jeff one question back.  So let's say I do that. How do I get paid?  Right. Because that's the ultimate question is fine.  I can build an audience. I can build an audience anywhere.  You know, I can take my pants off on the Internet and somebody will look at it.  Right. But how do I get paid for that?  I mean, this is what I'm assuming.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is where I'm assuming there's an API that lets you draw out your best  and present it how you wish, but draw people along by using Plus.  Maybe Plus isn't maybe plus is a CMS.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Getting paid, though, is a different problem.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  It's not. Well, I disagree.  I think I disagree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think we do everything we do is free and we get paid by advertising.  So you solve you have to solve that getting paid problem.  I know I don't disagree with that, but I think that no matter what you're doing  to make money, you also have to generate an audience in a community.  And sometimes platforms like this are valuable.  And then worry.  Then you can figure out how to get paid is a separate problem.  It's not the same. There's marketing.  And there's how to get paid.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  You know, one of the things that I'm very precious about is our editorial integrity.  Right. And I, you know,  you look at like mommy blogs or some other phenomenon of people  becoming massive content producers that didn't have a rich  journalistic tradition behind it. Right.  And it's good. I support that.  But then you read some of them and they're sponsored  by all kinds of companies and their coverage is informed by direct  advertiser and advertorial control.  And that makes me uncomfortable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I agree with you, but that's that will out also. Right.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  But so what I'm saying is if you build a huge audience, right.  But the way you get paid is by saying things that audience  and you can either say them directly through me.  I can say, well, Sony sponsored me today, you know, like drink this diet coke.  It's delicious.  Which is that's one way to do it. That makes me uncomfortable.  The other way is to say, well, I'll take this much space on the page  and you can have this stuff around it and I'll have a sales guy  and we'll develop a relationship to actually sell that stuff at a premium  instead of I'll paste in Google's code or whatever.  And you're not going far enough.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Both those examples are old models of messaging.  And if you look at Leo, yes, is Leo messaging? Yes.  But we know that Leo only advertises things he trusts,  except Chipotle, which has not been smart enough.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't trust them, but I'm hungry.  I don't either.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But again, I go back to Google and look what Google did.  Google didn't go for messaging. Google went for relevance in search.  I think it goes back to what Ed was saying earlier, which I liked a lot, too,  about the notion of the norms that Google separated out ads from search.  Now, the companies are still in search,  but there is a norm about how you're supposed to be there.  And I watched Matt Cutts video today, one of his developer videos,  and somebody asked him and said,  if I'm selling the same products on three different sites,  but with three different business models and sales models and pricing,  are you in a condition to that spam?  And Matt said, well, that's interesting.  Three, if they're different enough, probably not.  Three thousand, yes.  With three thousand, you don't pay any attention to the one thing that matters.  So Google is making people do things by the law is code. Right.  So that's part of what Ed is saying.  I think, too, is that there's we got to watch here and see what are the norms  and what are the laws that we're seeing emergent here  and where do brands fit into that?  And I don't think it's messaging anymore.  I think it's relationships and I guess data.  That's the clue train.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Get on the clue train.  That's exactly what the clue train says.  It says markets are conversations.  And I think there's an opportunity.  There's an opportunity for Google,  it's because it's created a conversation platform to invent a new way of  communicating with customers.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  But I think what's important to me as somebody who creates content  is to make sure that what I'm communicating to people is under my control.  Right. And not directly.  I don't want to go approve the ads that we run on our site,  but I want to make sure that they're, you know, they're as classy and beautiful  and meaningful to people as the content that we actually have.  Well, that's one approach.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or you keep it at arm's length is the other approach.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  When you do that, you run into immediate problems.  So the best example I can think of is the one tiny trip  or one tiny trick to lose your belly fat.  Oh, I hate that ad.  But those are federated network ads and they're everywhere.  And that's what happens at arm's length. Right.  You develop an exchange that happens far away from the content producer.  And then you and this has happened to me personally.  You wake up one day.  No, you're right.  You're a beautiful website that you work for.  And there's a belly fat ad on it.  And you have to say to yourself, well, that's the deal.  That's the bargain.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think we just need new models.  I know. I think that we haven't solved these problems yet.  But I think that they are soluble.  We got to run.  So but we have to do a little quick commercial before we run.  But I also want to say the Google Plus message of the week from Jeff Jarvis.  Felicia Day does not want you to go to Comic Con without your deodorant, kids.  Please. And thank you, Jeff, for finding that.  Yes. If you're at Comic Con, Felicia says, if you're at Comic Con this weekend,  by the way, we are we'll be covering it.  Sarah and Tom are down there right now.  We've got coverage.  When does the coverage start tomorrow? Friday.  Friday, four to six.  Saturday, two to four.  And I'm sure they'll be wearing their deodorant.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's there's great comments in there about geek stink.

Speaker: Neelai Patel
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, I have a question for you.  And that's a hijack again.  So let's say you you do you somehow manage to monetize the conversation.  How do you verify the identities within the conversation?  How do you say, well, that person isn't being directly paid by Sony to keep controls out?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Basically, you know, 100 percent answer at all.  I think one thing you do is you control Sony and you hold some weapon over Sony.  What I wish Google would do, for example, is when spammers come out selling products,  Google should go after the ones who make money, including the products themselves.  I think make stop this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think Google Plus does a good job by having a loose, not a not a force,  but a loose relationship between your actual persona  using Google profiles and what you post on there.  And really strongly encouraged not to use a handle on here.  I think that's good.  I think that's one way to do that. Right.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  And there's the wisdom of crowds.  People can spot a shill in my life. Exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And trust, trust the audience. I agree.  I agree. We know immediately, don't we?  We know it in our guts. Yeah.  All right. I do have to take a break and be a shill for a moment,  but only briefly to remind everybody.  Look, it's easy to sell Netflix.  Just go to Netflix.  I don't have to sell this.  You know what I watched last night, which I really liked?  I never heard of this guy, Bill Hicks.  Really? What? Yeah, I know.  I'm shocked. Well, he died in 94.  Somehow I missed his career.  But many people say he was the greatest comedian or one of the greatest comedians of his time.  So there's a great documentary on here made by his family, which I really love.  Now, this is an example of something I would never have seen.  I would not have ordered the DVD.  I would not have found it at a movie store.  But on Netflix, watch instantly. It's so cool.  You browse around and, you know, I had an hour or two to kill last night.  And as usual, I found something really thought provoking and interesting.  I also watched Chuck Barris's Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.  That is just weird.  Lots of great stuff here. $7.99 a month for Unlimited.  This is the future, I'm telling you.  And yeah, you know, I mean, there's movies, there's TV shows.  I was watching Star Trek, the original series.  Man, does that look good now?  This new high def version of it that they've created just for for this.  I love it. That's all I have to say.  Netflix dot com slash twit.  OK, you're already a member. OK, that's not going to do me any good.  Tell your mom, your dad, your friends, your non tech savvy folks in your life.  What a great thing Netflix is.  They will thank you for it.  And if you send them to Netflix dot com slash twit,  I will personally come to your home and smooch you  on the lips or not, you get to choose Netflix dot com.  There's a there's something I can't really live up to, actually.  Does that make it a lie?  No, because you know better. Netflix dot com slash  twit at Dumbbell.  I want to I really want to thank you for being here today.  It's really nice to be great fun. Thank you.  O'Reilly Media Media dot O'Reilly dot com slash.  Yeah, you're right.  I don't know. I'm sorry, Rodney.  See, I did that again. Yeah.  And Oscar, tell us about Oscar's coming up next weekend.

Speaker: Ed Dumble
Transcript:  It's coming up next week in Portland.  We'll be there for five days in the convention center.  Over 400, I don't know, 500, 600 speakers.  It's the it's the open gathering of the tribes.  It really is the open.  So great function.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My number of the week is  fifty four dollars and 91 cents.  A site called WordStream trying to figure out the 20 most valuable  ad words on Google.  Oh, that's interesting.  And ran a whole bunch of words against it.  And one of the methodology is on their site.  But they said the number one word is insurance.  Oh, yeah.  Followed by other illogical words like loans, mortgage and so on.  The top 20 is all they list.  The bottom three don't speak well for America.  Rehab, treatment and cord blood.

Speaker: Leo Laporte

And number two, I just saw right before we went on,  Harvey Levin from TMZ is on here and he's already saying, wow,  people are following me like crazy.  So everybody go find Harvey Levin and shock him with how much  bring him the power of Leo and say you're there because Leo sent you.  Is he worth is he worth following?
