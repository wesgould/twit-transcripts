Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the point it was so nice being in the center of the universe and all the attention now nobody wants me anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we have a wonderful listener I've known for some time  Captain Sam she's a merchant was a merchant vessel  captain and mate for a long time and  She sent me a note saying  First there was much gnashing of teeth first she says it's bow not prow and and you're right  I said prow but the bat  But it's a bulbous bow because below the waterline and that's what you and Pruitt thought but you were too polite to say anything  She also okay. She also so she says subject is bow not prow  Imagine the gnashing of teeth the ship wasn't stuck so long my ship was stuck over a month in  Tabletop Bay she sent me the article from 2007. I wish I didn't watch on delay  So I could have put my two cents in with great hyperbole. Okay. It's funny listening to non-mariners  Make statements about ships. Thank you, Sam  Captain Pertle  Wait till she hears us talk about Google  You know even less about Google so there  So there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will we talk about you read anything about about how it was freed in detail the Guardian had a great story  They shifted the captain Sam. I'm sorry. I'm gonna mess this up  You landlubber you  Of course, it was that it was that it was the supermoon tide which made a big difference higher big time when it went out  That created a certain force. They put ballast in the back to force  it up the nose bow prow up, yes, and  And then and then freed it at the right moment and it was it was quite amazing  It was no simple they were they were all kinds of  Mathematical calculations to figure out how much to shift the ballast and all kinds of see kids stay be cool stay in school learn your math

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you might need it someday to free your ship. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just love the fact that there was  There was well, I don't love the fact that there was a lot of economic downside, but they're gonna be ton of lawsuits  Oh, yeah, putting putting the Sioux in the Suez Canal

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now you can catch more of that great humor and Mike's new sub stack

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mike Algan sub stack calm so you take a take a prow Mike Algan

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So  You've always had Elgin's list, but you never charged for it. So you decided maybe nice to try money on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what I'm doing is Mike's this is a  bunch of frivolous  Tom foolery I  Basically call it brilliantly bad ideas. It's basically people who are complete geniuses who pour enormous engineering  Knowledge into some stupid thing and I just love those kind of stories and that's what Mike's has been about  Mostly and I've always loved you know some practical things. Yes, it's and but now what I'm doing is I'm adding an actual opinion column  I'm charging for that. So  Mike's list is free everything that I've always published for free is still free  And then if you want to read the opinion column you can you can give me money and I will show it to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's really working great actually and in fact, you have a whole piece on  Piloting a tanker through the Suez Canal. This is a game

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a thing. I believe CNN organized, but it's it's basically a game. Yeah you  The wind changes and you're trying to pilot it and of course, there's inertia  So you could going in some direction and then you know, you realize how hard it is actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the pilot is a ship. In fact, I think really part of the problem is that ship is just too damn big  So actually there is sub stack news they're raising 65 million dollars they are probably the king of the paid newsletters  and  You know, there's been we've talked on previous episodes about some criticism about sub stack  the so-called  Substack professionals who get paid and like well, who is it because nobody a sub stack won't say  Nevertheless, I think sub stacks. Why did you choose sub stack? There are lots of choices out there now including review at Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I think you you probably know that I used to use MailChimp  MailChimp is just has always been really about marketing emails and had become even more so over time  It was pretty complicated to use the thing that I like most about sub stack two things I like about it one is that  it's  Super easy to put together a newsletter. I mean it's super easy if you want to reference for example a tweet  You just put the link to the tweet in there and it'll show you the whole tweet the picture of the video  Whatever like that. It'll just throws in there. It's the car the heading and all you don't have to do your own formatting and it's kind of a  Standard right?  Everybody's accepted all the standards around sub stack one of which is that when I link from social to one of my posts  Substack does the money-grubbing business for me. It jumps in there's like hey, we want to pay, right?  I'll pay for this you want it for free  And so that has already been accepted if I try to do that kind of stuff on my own it feel you know  It kind of feels like oh this guy's always trying to get money from me  But because it's a sub stack standard everybody's used to it and expects it it goes down a little bit easier  Yeah, so it's a little little things like that that I like about it  It's really I don't really don't want a format or a service or any of that stuff to get in the way  I just want to get my ideas out there in a clear  Friendly way and have everything else managed and they basically do a good job of that. It's open like a true content

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tenderizing meat by  I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're downtown Oaxaca, so there's like, you know, there's craftsmen building stuff  I think I think it's a religious holiday. I think they're they're crucifying somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just looking at review which is  Review dot get review doc co REV UE  This is the new Twitter thing and you know as you're talking I'm looking at it and they're selling exactly  What you just described the it seems people choose this stuff for the ease of the CMS  How easy it is to put content in and then I do I agree with you  You don't want to be shilling all the time. Let them do the shilling. Yeah, I want I want shilling to take place

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just do it myself. Yes, and that's how you survive  Shilling let me use the bumper sticker says yes, right. Let me tease the end of the show though  So later in the show, I'm gonna tell everybody an even easier way to publish a newsletter. All right, and so  Stick around because it's it's even easy. It's pretty cool. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There also is so so that's one big movement which is the paid newsletter movement and then there's the clubhouse movement and we have  multiple stories this week  And in fact, I thought clubhouse had kind of peaked that it was kind of over but  There are multiple stories about new clink. LinkedIn is gonna do a clubhouse  Spotify is bought something called locker room locker room, which is a live social media  audio app  From Betty labs, which is by the way a great name for a company

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Betty labs is a great name for a company but locker room is a horrible name for social network

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People are naked in locker room. Yeah, and it's like it's it and the things they say in locker rooms are the kind of things  Yeah, you might say before I'd name it the sauna the sauna

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Origins wasn't the origin of locker room based on sports sports, but now they're gonna go wider. So I hope Spotify

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Names it something else. This is this is my rule that now all social networks do everything that all social networks do. Oh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, yeah, right which is what which is great news for I think Twitter  I mean, you know LinkedIn is having one etc. Everybody's got a  Clubhouse clone. I think the the company that's gonna come out worse in all this is clubhouse itself  Because people already like their social networks they're on think about spaces for example Twitter spaces  Yeah, yeah, every social network is gonna have a clubhouse and a Twitter component roughly, right?  Except for clubhouse clubhouse is the only one that doesn't have a Twitter  Clubhouse doesn't have a Twitter. I'm gonna argue with I disagree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that do one thing and do one thing well  And so people will go with the thing that is most native to the platform. And in fact, historically there's some you know  Twitter's created reels  to compete with just as as you say Jeff to compete with  Snapchat and  Instagram's story eats and fleets and reels  Fleets is that what is what's reels? That's it reels is Instagram's  Do you understand my confusion?  But I think you're gonna go to tick-tock if you want to do tick-tock you're gonna go to clubhouse if you want to do  I feel like people will want to use what's native to the medium not one social network that does it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, but whether there's one with one issue with that though there there  Twitter does something really badly, which is that  It has only 280 characters, right? So people want to express anything that's longer than that  They do Twitter threads, which is complete failure. It's such a bad clue. Everybody hates them and nobody follows them  Whereas with spaces I think that if somebody's has something important to talk about they want to have a conversation  They can just go directly from a tweet into spaces. Yeah, and have a longer conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you have the advantage of Twitter being a great promotional medium so it could say yes  This is you do with your sub stack you say go to my spaces and talk Jeff  Do you think that because I think Jeff's always been a fan of the thread on Twitter. Will you defend threads?  Yeah, I will Mike. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But  What is yeah, I think it has the advantage to that well one thing I've always wanted Dave Weiner has talked about this for a long time  On his blog  Every paragraph is has a permanent. Yes. Yeah, right  So in essence, this is the same kind to do that because we designed the platform that was a feature designed in and and it's very good  Yeah, so so in this sense a thread means that it's fought in the middle is directly linkable  I like that about it. I can share just that sometimes it takes people to get a little  Engine revving to get to their point or there's something really neat in the middle or I want to respond to just that point in the middle  So I think that the you know threaded  forum conversations were a pain  Reply reply reply reply reply reply reply reply reply, right?  We never figured out threading there Twitter hasn't figured out threading in the other way  But it added some value to it that has architecturally something that I think does have have import for other discussions

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  That's a good point. I just I just think that it's really gonna be interesting when Twitter gets  Spaces in the browser as opposed to just a mobile feature  I think that could really kick it in a high gear  And I also think they have the capacity to do higher volume than other ones  But I don't think any of these are gonna I don't think social audio is going to be the main way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most people do social media at all. So explain spaces to me. Is that really worth their effort?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it could be so  Twitter spaces is basically they're rapidly building it out started out on iOS only now it's on Android  Essentially what you do is from the mobile device if you're a you know, if you want to launch a space you basically just  Hit you know start a space and then the people who follow you  Can see from their mobile app only they can't see it from the browser yet  All the spaces of the people that they follow and then you can just tap to join it then you do kind of a  An audience member unless you're promoted to a speaker by what do you do in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but but but what I'm saying is they put this on mobile because that's clearly the priority  Everybody's walking around with those phones in their hands and it cannot put them down for whatever reason even if it's just to go to the bathroom  So why would they even bother with a browser?  Version of this when mobile is the way to go because that's just what people want to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well, I think I think that the there are ton of people who use Twitter in the browser and they  You know spaces doesn't even exist in the browser  I mean if you're working and you have Twitter, you know going back and forth to Twitter  Of course, I'm talking about journalists. This is what we do all day  We're back and forth between doing our actual work and wasting time on Twitter  You know that that's that it you need to know what who's talking about what?  You know on this other medium because if it's just the phone people, you know  the people who primarily use the phones on Twitter is one kind of group of people and  Then the people who use a browser or some third-party thing or tweet deck or whatever. That's a different type of well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I go back and forth is this  Does it does it yes when I name it is it's my is that that's it forever or is it just it for the moment?  Did I do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's ephemeral for now, but they've they've made noises to say that they're gonna allow you to record them essentially  I'm asking something to my podcast. That's one of the things in clubhouse. One of the things with clubhouse is it is ephemeral

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't record it  So I think there's a certain freedom people feel with clubhouse. It's kind of interesting  because as a  Professional broadcaster slash podcaster. I would get very tired of hosting events on my phone. Yeah  Hold it. I get tired fart you but I get very tired  Clearly it's the most convenient easiest way to do it. You got a microphone there. You have a headset  Yeah, you're ready to go. But as you and I think this is happening already as people get more  Serious about it and have regular clubhouses and stuff. They they move to the desktop  They find ways to you know, you know clubhouses from so if you started a space right now, Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would happen Mike? I would see it  I would see on my Twitter feed people who follow me would see it up at the top there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So at the top there you'd see you'd see that, you know, it's a terrible interface right now  And hopefully they'll fix it you see that there's a space and you see who the host is and you by tapping on it  You get the option then to join it or not join it. You can we do a space now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can't because I don't have spaces so you long press and compose and I don't get the spaces as an option  These are reels though, right these circles at the top fleet to put some up there with wheels, which is terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are fleets or fleets. These are fleets. So these are fleets the past participle of fart

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know as much about about Twitter as we do about ships, right? Yeah, it's a bow or is it a prow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So where so then I see these I see these  Fleets, where would the club where with the space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, I this is now saying oh do you want to create one of these no I don't so yeah, okay got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so use the first three icons there  Those would be spaces if I see you follow our have so live spaces

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is and this is you're exactly right. This is why as you keep adding these features  This is why I say, you know stick to one thing and become the you know  The standard because you add these features now you got to figure out how to jam that in between fleets and tweets  And which means they shouldn't instead of call it spaces. It should call it speeds, but that's another  Mean and you said you don't care for marketing if you're gonna go with tweets and fleets you might as well do speeds  Yeah, you know I feel like  Two thing it's hard. Yeah, it's hard to succeed  Because it feels like it's a me two thing for one thing, but everybody's doing that exactly. Yeah, I know  It's ridiculous to discord just announced it which is hysterical that they're gonna do clubhouse like features  Even though as far as I know discord really  Started this because you could do audio  Discords, right? Isn't that just the same?  They're calling it stage channels, I guess really it's additional moderation features

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that that's what it is. And I think that this is the thing that clubhouse has demonstrated is the power of moderation features  So they've in clubhouse you can as a moderator you can invite other  moderators who then can promote people and and there's a there's a good and by the way if you get tired of being a moderator you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can hand it off and say okay. I'm done  I'm leaving which it means a room continue on without you having to be the one and only host, right?  Right, there's you know, they get a lot of things right at clubhouse that they actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they absolutely did the thing we learned on Google Plus because Google Plus, you know many years ago had  Hangouts right back in the day hangouts where it was a feature of Google Plus where you could have video  And what we learned there is what we're gonna learn with social audio  there's a minority of people who prefer that medium and  They'll form their own little group and it'll be like two social networks on one  So so on the hangouts people on Google Plus were like that was a small group of people  It's the same thing with with the spaces people the space of people on Twitter already this like  Sort of little group that is not fully integrated with the larger Twitter social network, and I think that's it forever  you know, I'm talking like five percent seven percent ten percent maybe of  Twitter users of LinkedIn users, whatever we'll use this feature and everybody else will probably completely ignore it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do think on this court it might take off because it's essentially something people are already doing  But now in fact, if you look at it, it looks just like clubhouse. You have the stage with the speakers  You have an audience you can raise your hand  So that you can say I'd like to speak and look you can even instead of leave quietly exit quietly  Of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  an Irish goodbye

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I first started using clubhouse, it was like leave quietly  I don't understand is there a way to leave noisily it can I slam the door on the way out?  Just like you slide into somebody's DMS you're sliding out of their clubhouse is like, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is in it for the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Social media influencers to jump on clubhouse or toward I think it's another platform you can build a following on right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And right now the way it's working some way to monetize those. There's no monetization right now, right? That's why I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think I think influencers will want to build their brands and stuff like that  But what one of the things we've we've we've learned is that really clubhouse?  Clubhouse is really for the talkers. There's some people who just love the sound of their own voice  Well, also they're on spaces to believe me  But but it's it's this is this is one of the you know, so I think that the few in the future people will innovate right now  There's not a whole lot of innovation, but I think like a one-on-one cuts for example when  the information  When clubhouse, you know a couple months ago when the information revealed app new details about Apple's upcoming headset or whatever  I grabbed the the the guy who wrote that thing and I said let's go to a clubhouse and you know within  Within a half an hour after that story broke we were chatting about it. That's great  I think that's great and we didn't let anybody else talk. That was the key  So it was just it was just me grilling him about his story and then we're done 30 minutes. We're out  You know a lot of these spaces go on I did a space  We had MC Hammer and a bunch of other people on the space and and it's like I  Couldn't get out of it. It was eight hours later  I'm still I'm still the only thing holding it there as the moderator, right?  Because if I leave the whole thing closes, yeah, and that's a problem  But I think with some innovation and a little bit of vision  I think some people could really use it to build whatever their brand if somebody was specializing and you know  Something or other you get 10 or 20 other people listening to you and you have small groups  I think there's a there's a place for that, but it's never gonna be a mass broadcast medium

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't if I were gonna pick a winner  I would say discourse because a they already have the user base  They're already pretty close to that model and you could for instance tie it to your twitch stream where you can monetize  I just think this is a smart thing for discord to do because they're adding the features that make clubhouse work  To an existing platform that everybody understands effective Microsoft buys them and yeah, by the way  Apparently that's heating up at first. We read about it. It was like discord said yeah, but we talked but we're not talking now  Apparently there is now that is later  I think you're gonna hear from Amazon on this because as they run twitch  And I think discord and twitch are a very natural partnership and I think Amazon is gonna be in the bidding  Maybe they'll be too cheap to compete with Microsoft 10 billion is the current  Amount of money they're bandying around I like discord. I really do  I hope in a way I hope Microsoft doesn't buy them and I could see us doing a clubhouse  Like on discord, I wouldn't do it on clubhouse because it's ephemeral  And you have to know when it's gonna be at the right time and stuff  But I think like having a stage and doing an event on clubhouse would be a really naturally  It's kind of like doing this show, you know be a very natural easy thing to do  You can I presume you can record it if you can't yet. I'm sure you will  Yeah, that's one difference I mean clubhouse really is trying to be a fem you know, just you know, you have to be there  It's it's at the time and place. Otherwise  Fomo yeah, this is a moda that's part of it. Isn't it is the FOMO? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I also have used half of the stories about it  Include Jason Calacanis and a quarter of them. Yeah, even the Scoble pokes pokes back. Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a sure sign that it's a flop. Oh

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really that's in Scobel in a long time if they mentioned Gary Vaynerchuk Robert Scobel

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mark Cuban throw him in there too. He's got his own go. What is a fireside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a great a great thread of I had on the rundown. We didn't do but it but a guy it's funny rundown  What's gonna happen to?  Clubhouse and he did one of his one of his tweets in the thread, which I loved so much  I could you see Mike I could point to that particular tweet about how much I loved it was Gary Vaynerchuk found a new place  to yell at people  And he told he told 24 year olds to move back in at home and sell all their parents stuff on eBay  Oh great. I tell you rich. That's like soupy sales, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Baseball cards. Well, I got a Gary Vaynerchuk story. I went to I went to  Armenia  Last year year year before last must have been and  There was a local tech conference night that well  I'll just go to this tech conference and see what an Armenian tech conference guess who was speaking there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my Chuck Gary Vee a little later on  Edward Snowden is gonna join us for it on stage  It's gonna be great. It's gonna be great. Well, you know what? This is good  This is a shine the sign that the internet has matured. We now have D list celebrities on the internet, too  So  I'm probably one of them as a matter of fact  Well, actually there did you see this funny cameo story I put it in the rundown  Cameo is is is the pandemics been very very good to cameo cameo is the place where you go to buy  Celebrities  Say a little messages. Yeah, but it's mostly if you look at the Wall Street Journal has a scrolling list. It's mostly  It's mostly D lists.

He's the CEO and co-founder of cameo said my D list celebrity might be your favorite person in the world  We're tapping into this the definition of fame

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's Scott Rogowski and he can get him to do a little yeah little thing for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he you know, that's the oldest that's the oldest trick in the book is D list celebrities that are treated as if they're still  Mainstreams, you know the Hollywood Squares Dancing with the Stars  Yeah  In fact, you should have a show Leo that brings on D list celebrities to talk about technology  twid

Transcript:  Okay  This is this is beneath us to to mock  For really not for it really not do you now? Okay, here we are. How many years ago is Google Plus killed?  It's been a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it was a slow painful death. Yeah, but looking back now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Given all the things that have happened  Over the years all the other social networks that have tried to take its place  I still think Google Plus should have made it. It really was a much better spot than anywhere else that's out there. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus circa 2014

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah was killer. It was shut down for reals in 2019, but they continued for a while on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a shell of its former self by then so no it was a really really cool thing it  What's not clear is to what extent was it cool for the same reason?  Clubhouse is cool for the same reason that a lot of new ish social networks when there's a good social network  there's a lot of people who jumped to go to it and and the  spammers and all the you know  Various types of people who can ruin a social network to haven't discovered it yet. So how much of it was just that part?  That's really true  people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd recent Horowitz and company could bring in all of their  Venture stars into it and Google didn't really understand celebrity. I don't think well, that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also repellent for some people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a there is a certain something to hear an unexpurgated Mark Zuckerberg or an  Unexpurgated Elon Musk every time I'd go in those it was a deathly doll though. It wasn't you know, you were hoping for fireworks

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's a point at which Leo you were the top user on Twitter. Yeah, that was right  But but but see this is what happens to social networks  It was the same thing Google Plus, you know in the first three or four years the top people were geeks  Yes, and then the people with with who have who have people then Ashton Kutcher showed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the with that was a turning point at Lady Gaga  Yeah, you've never forgiven it. I still hold it against him whenever I see an Ashton Kutcher movie on TV. I I flipped the channel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this the room full of overachievers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a BS story, but I'm gonna report on it research we from professor  Douglas Leith of Trinity College at the University of Dublin and the headline and I saw it everywhere  says  Apple and  Google devices collect  Data from your phone all the time. Well, yeah  Uh  Duh  Apple  only a  What was I mean? This is I found us the story is from the record dot media  I don't know what this is and and this the Caitlin Katalin Nick Chapao Chippano found a unique  Slant of this Google collects 20 times more telemetry from Android devices than Apple from iOS still bogus still ridiculous  So accurate yes  Yeah, because well do you use maps do you have location services turned on every time you join a cell tower it has to send out  the  MAC address and the IMEI and it just I'm of course it does  So professor Leith who apparently had no clue that this was happening  During the first 10 minutes of startup the pixel handset sends about one megabyte of data to Google  With the iPhone sending about 42 kilobits of data to Apple  With Apple already knows more about you. Well  Yeah, I mean  When the handsets are sitting idle  The pixel sends roughly a megabyte of data to Google every 12 hours compared with the iPhone sending 52 kilobits to Apple kilobytes to Apple  On and then the headline others reported was iOS and Android shared data on average of every four and a half minutes  Is there am I am I wrong to dismiss this or is this just yeah, duh  Do you surf the web or using the internet? Are you using your phone at all? It's it's it's the demonization of data

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're also they're both Google and Apple said this is BS  I mean you would think that Apple go. Yeah, see how much better we are, but even Apple said you don't know what you're doing  About the research  You don't know how all this works  When I saw you know one little tidbit in the story is that yes, there's a lot more data  There's a lot more actual data in terms of the size of the data  But they said that Apple actually collects a larger variety of things. So there you go  And so my first thought was yeah Apple's really good at like  streamlining things and  You know  But you know, it's again it's it's really there's  It's it's it's important for people to know  What's happening? So when you open your settings and you flipping through your settings get data about what you're doing is being sent back to  Apple and or Google right when you when that when the phone is just sitting there and it's been sitting on the table for an hour  That data is sent back to Apple and Google says hey this phone this phone has been sitting there for an hour now  There isn't a there isn't a team of people going  Oh my god, Jeff Jarvis's phone has been sitting on his table for an hour  This is just you know, they're constantly logging how things work and so on  Yeah, I know that's unrealist

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For now, do you have email on your smartphone? Well, guess what when you open the email and your emails there guess how it got there  It downloaded it from the internet. This is if you had a smartphone and you could make this go away you just disable  Your broadband connection and disable your cell connection and no data would be transmitted or you get a 300 baud modem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you just dial in every time you want to connect and otherwise you won't yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's just I'm sorry, but that's why we have smartphones is to connect to the network

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a crap story  But it I appreciate you bringing this up because people need to know the truth of this matter  I just recently had a conversation with  Someone in the family that got a message about a particular app having access to their emails and  What it what I'm not gonna say what the service was but it needed to have that access because it was just a way to  Particular how it works and I had to explain to them look  There's not some kid named Chris sitting here reading every single email that you have is that's because that's how they perceived it  You know these messages pop up they perceive it as oh my goodness  The world is the tech world is spying on me and yeah, there there is a little bit of that  But not like oh, I saw that you had  corned beef hash the other day for dinner

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I log everything I eat every single thing I eat in an app and it gets transmitted. Guess what again, Professor?  Leith it's getting transmitted back to the home office  That's how I use it that's how I want to use it anyway  This goes back to moral panic, which I kind of admit Jeff. There is a little bit of that going on and  You know, we I really think people  We really have to think more seriously about  What we want technology to do and and if you don't want it to do any of those things, that's fine  But then don't complain that it's useful useless  If you if you want to use it you're gonna be sending data back  And I don't know there's a harm to that frankly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's a perfect transition to to a really interesting story, which is Google's memory  And I'm sorry if I'm changing the subject. No, please. I'm done with it. What's Google's memory?  But Google's testing memory, which is a which is an assistant add-on that's currently being dog-fooded within Google  but basically it's a it's a  repository associated with its  Assistant where you can just dump everything you can say here are all my meetings. Here's the books  I'm reading here's the so this is the opposite of a moral panic about the data that Google's collecting  This is where you thank you Google out of your way to give gate good  And and what's interesting about this is they don't use the L word at all  They don't say life logging, but that's exactly what this I would do this  I would too and this is a you know, this is a diary on steroids, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly because you're keeping it but it's also keeping information that other information we talked about this years and years ago when yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rather than hyper local it was hyper personal, right and then it should know your schedule  It should know your stuff. It should be able to predict things for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is interesting because it means Google understands that while there are many of us who are  Upset and say I don't want you know, if you go I follow a privacy  Subreddit privacy tools subreddit and it like these people just want to make sure nobody knows anything about what they're doing  Which is fine and you should have the right to do that power to you and you do  I don't care about doing anything about but I don't yeah, but I personally want stuff like memory  I want I want Google to know more about me  So I'm glad and I suspect by the way  I suspect the vast majority of users don't really pay attention to this stuff that this is  There's that you know, the geeks care maybe or at least they're aware enough to care  But the vast majority of users want the convenience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't this pretty much the premise of Google now when they brought that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I was disappointed because they kind of oh I was so sad to get rid of that  Yeah, they really cut it back. You just kill everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a new feature for assistant  it's a  according to the verge a combination of a to-do list and notes app a  Pocket like reading list a Pinterest style collection board into a single overarching digital locker  Integrated into the broader broader Google assistant app. So it's not it's not out yet. As you said Mike  It's being dog-footed at Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, I would I they also have Google stack that's somewhere in the rundown. I put it in there  What's I would like to see stack combined with the memory stack is you take your your your old-fashioned papers, right?  And and you put it in there and it will it will wisely know where to put stuff. That's a receipt  That's a business card. That's a this that's a that that's that's not work. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually really if anything that Google's disappointed us because it you know in theory if you take a picture with Google Photos  It'll know receipts and it could categorize it  It doesn't seem to do what it's as much of it as it could or should do  Do you think people are scared? It's it's they're scared of the appearance of being over

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they will be at some point because somebody you know on some somebody in Congress reporter will  That would that's what we'll next say then they'll next say how did they'll put a stories of how to know memory?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How did it know I get out but and that makes me say I would like to I will I will acknowledge your right to  Insist on privacy more power to you, but don't let your adamant  Search for privacy  Impinge on my interest in giving them more information that should also be possible without right Google being castigated

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vegans picking on me for eating meat. Yeah, don't pick on me

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, exactly comes off yeah  Well, they're the problem the problem for Google though is that you could categorize people into three camps, right?  There's the there's the general public which doesn't care enough to make any effort to capture this information for their lives  There are the privacy advocates who were somewhat technology technology oriented who?  Who opposed it because it feels like a privacy  Invasion and then the remainder should be the market for this kind of thing  Unfortunately, those people are all too aware of the fact that Google gives up on things and closes them  Well, that's and so you wouldn't want to use them to life log if they're gonna give up in a couple of years personally  I am Charlie Brown. I will kick that football  But but most people are not like that so I wonder about the market for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike I thought of you today. There was there was a post I wrote some time ago  I can't what was about but the discussion continued on Google Plus and I have links to the discussion there and all these were saying  Of course, it's gone now  It's one thing we have to do as a society. I was working on this for the Gutenberg book is  Decide what to remember?  Yeah, and there's a there's a great book called do I have it here?  No, it's not it is a great book called this is not the end of the book  in which Umberto echo and two other people have a dialogue and  Echo says that culture is about deciding what to remember what to forget. Oh, that's good, which novels we remember culture decides  right and and we need that decision about this because we're losing so much of our of our current heritage  because it's in the noise all ephemeral and  So what do we choose to keep it not keep with privacy considered with  You know your own future history considered with these issues considered but but there's there's such value  In in in recognizing what our lives are about that we're losing so the society

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly the life-locking life-locking vision which is advanced by a whole bunch of people since the 50s  Was he would capture everything you read everything you you know, Gordon Bell used to Gordon Bell from Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He used to wear a and he was then a Microsoft fellow  We swear caught camera around his neck and would shoot a picture every 10 seconds or so and he had the idea was and he  Was inspired by the way to do this because his wife Gwen Bell  Who died of Alzheimer's was forgetting everything? Yes, and he wanted a way to remember everything  And I think that that was inspired the problem is you know, I you're exactly right Mike. I I'm not Charlie Brown  I'm not kicking this football the the last thing you want to do is is choose any  companies  Repository for this I  Would look for and I think there are good open source solutions that you can store yourself in a format that you can read even if  That dies you should be looking for things that you do, you know  Yeah, you know the people in Emacs lovers use org mode  There are no taking apps that are very good  I really fell in love with Rome at Rome research calm  But when I realized that it's really hosted on their servers  I started looking for alternatives that are I host I'm using a note-taking app called obsidian now  Which does it markdown has many of the same features is really designed for this kind of life logging  Very easy data entry you could put anything in it. I can look into that you hosted obsidian MD

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Com well, let me tell you about the last and to emphasize your point  The last football I kicked was Google Plus itself. So we're talking about Google Plus  I actually I actually used Google Plus as a life logging  service what I did was with Google Plus you could you could  determine the  Public or private nature of every post and so I was using Google Glass and I was taking pictures of everything  and then I would go through photos and things that I was capturing and about  60% of them I kept a hundred percent private  I was the only person who could look at them because they were you know  The kinds of things I wanted to remember in this linear thing remember search on Google Plus is great  So you could search what was that thing two years ago?  You could search and find it very easily and so I actually use Google Plus as a life log and I think that was  Fantastic because there are things you want to have a single stream where some of it is public some of it is semi-public  Where it's just family members or whatever and some of it is just private for life logging  You want the both the public and the private stuff to be in your life log, right?  Not just the private stuff you want the public and the private stuff. And so I thought that was  Pretty good, you know, that was 70% of what I wanted in a life logging app  This is the combination of these two things and who knows if they'll ever combine them probably not but if they did  how would this would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The  Google keep versus the stack that mr  Jarvis brought up a second ago. It seems like those two could pretty much be one in the same, right? It yeah  This memory is a document sounds like he yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is what I'm using and this is what I would use which is something that is gonna be  This is an open source, but the format it says everything in his markdown so you can always use another tool  It does what it does is which is cool is the knowledge is a map like this. Oh, it does  Internal linking so it's very easy to create a backlink just by putting it in brackets. It's a just like that  This is becomes a link. I think it's really really good. There are lots of community plugins very active community  It's obsidian MD. I've been looking I haven't you know  I've been looking for the right way to do this and I think you need to host the data the data needs to be in  A format that could be read even if the app disappears. I'd prefer it were if it were closed source  I mean open source, but still it is Windows Mac Linux  And it's gonna go on iOS and Android soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is I think the opportunity for this sort of thing is in augmented reality  So the the key is not the capturing of data. That's actually relatively easy  It's how you look at mapping it all that stuff is a little bit harder  And then the ability to quickly recover what you're looking for is the really hard part  So I would love to see some something like this  It's open source that you control the data, but which could be conjured up with your eyeglasses while you're walking around

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you gotta start by recording it. I think it's just a matter of the interface to your glasses

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  But you know a simple the simple thing that they used to talk about with Google class  Which is an app that recognizes people right tells you previous interactions

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where does it get that information you both know if you haven't been storing that it's not gonna know that's right  So maybe memory maybe Google's memory is a precursor to something like that apples needs to do it  They're the ones that are probably good to wear our glasses before anybody at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also not just for your own stuff. I mean watching the tragedy of the George Floyd  Derek Chauvin trial  the last few days have been  about the video evidence and it's  People thank goodness and bravely had the reflex  to record and  Share otherwise we wouldn't have this case

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Otherwise, we wouldn't it be so different and you've made that point before that with she posted it the video first on Facebook  and had it not  Achieve wide notoriety almost instantly. We probably never would have heard about it and there'd be no trial going on right now  So I agree with you Jeff. This is you know  You can't get away with anything now though. There's cameras out everywhere recording everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's the other thing today. They they had on a lieutenant from the police force  they have more than 200 cameras around and that's how the  Dispatcher saw something strange was going on there and tried to call in and all these efforts. It's it's phenomenal  It's just it's I don't listen up the shows about but the utter tragedy of the young people who were bystanders  Or involved the cashier in the store. They were so feel remorse. Yeah. Yeah and wish they could have done more were stopped from doing more  Yeah, it's amazing  But but part of what they did was to document to witness

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well, and imagine their frustration they were they what's becoming clear as you watch the trial is  They were eyewitnesses to a murder. Oh, yes, and everybody agrees  They know everybody agreed they couldn't stop it. There was nothing they could do about it. Thank God. They were able to record it  And now we know they were eyewitnesses to a murder  I mean, it's just it's just no question about it  but otherwise it would have been you know, and it's happened so many times before it would have just  You know like there's an element of empathy. There is question about it, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is question about it like question about what?  If this was actual murder or not, that's why they that's why there's a defense for this person. Oh and you're being very

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Judicious and journalistic and journalistic and you're right. He's accused but I have to say  We all know is a murder come on well the other thing I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think to me one of the most fascinating things that happened last year was that this type of video evidence  Has changed a long-standing thing  Black Americans have been telling everybody for decades and nobody believed that when they get stopped by the police  It's a whole different ball of wax and you know, I think just about everybody else was kind of like yeah, you're exaggerating  That's you know, it's probably see blah blah blah blah, etc  And then all of a sudden we had access to all this video and everybody was like, oh my god  That's just you know, cuz we've all been pulled over the by the police. It's you know, everybody's polite. It's very nice  it's blah blah blah and so the the  ability for  These kinds of technologies to to to offer up empathy for people who live a different experience than you  That you live  Who you are huge. It's enormous. It's enormous. That was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm in around the Chapman's pointing out. It started with Rodney King and this goes back to the camcorder, right?  Somebody had a exact camcorder. Mm-hmm, and we wouldn't have known that story. There wouldn't have been riots. None of that would have come out  If it weren't for that camcorder, so we are it's a new era because of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You also go to this there a lot in Europe and elsewhere. There's a there's a presumption of privacy in public  if if that were a doctrine then  All of the things that were taken would have been why no I know says  The perpetrator I I don't consent to this. I  Demand my privacy in public  Or any one person in a group does that that we all own what occurs in the public  It is the public's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and also also what occurs in semi-private?  I think one of the first cases around this was that some kid years and years ago was arrested for something or other  And he was interrogated and when you're in an interrogation situation  the police have the  Control over whether it's recorded or not recorded. So they interrogated this kid  They basically tried to blackmail him or did some some shady thing  to him  and they went to court and he was looking guilty as sin and  Then the but it turns out that he had a he had a music player. This is years and years ago  He had some mp3 player  That had a recording function. He recorded the entire interrogation Wow, and so they just simply played the recording  Demonstrating that the police had completely lied and in fact had abused him in the interrogation room in the way that they had claimed  the police officer he went free that the cop went to prison and  So this is a case where in a situation where normally one side can control the recording and the other side cannot he?  Sereptitiously had his own recording that he controlled and the truth was revealed  But we're seeing a lot more of that with there's still many many cases where that is not the case where every time there's new  Technology that can record what's happening  The powers to be the you know, the police the government or whoever it is  tries to use that new technology to gain an advantage over over others and  So we have to keep fighting for our right to surveil their surveilers, right?  And and it's it's not gonna be easy, but I think a lot more of those fights are coming. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you've ever wondered if it's a bad thing or a good thing to Google your symptoms  I  Know it's a bad thing to read about symptoms before you have them because you will get them then  Right, so I'm not talking about that  It is amazing right you never read medical books. You will come down with every illness  But there's been a study conducted at the Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard found that people  Were more likely to accurately diagnose a loved one's sickness after searching for symptoms online  Now admittedly that's compared to when they didn't know research  Right, I think you have sausage finger disease  But in other words  The the author of the study who is an internist at Brigham and Women's Hospital said our work suggests  It's okay to tell your patients to Google it  That's good news

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prescription, you know what I mean? Yeah, right. Yeah, but the other part of it too is they found that it did not  The presumption would have been you shouldn't do it and it will increase your anxiety, right?  It appears it doesn't increase the anxiety now. The study does say that this was about  the hypotheticals the  Subjects were given where someone in your family has these symptoms. I'll go look up on Google not you back with yeah  Yeah, the diagnosis and see if it's better than the one you just presumed  It was for you approach with that. Yeah, it might be different like I got it. I know I have it  I of course I do  My mom, you know, she she complains. I yeah, well, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I downloaded that analyzed the smell of  What is it? Don't tell me and well, it's it's common. It's boring. It's a whole bunch of chemicals and stuff  But it will be combination of the paper and a little bit of mold and the dust and the leather and the wooden shelves

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's I guess it's the associations rather than the actual smell. It's the association

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never liked reading books. I just never could get into it for pleasure  And barely read when I had to for school. I absolutely I feel bad for you now  I know you don't like me wrong because you blew my love and you  Even looking at the tweet community  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, I did enjoy and do enjoy reading  Instructional books, you know if how to do so and so I'll read that in a minute for some reason  But I never quite got into reading for just leisure  But I feel glad to have audible and audio. Yeah now I'm hooked on that. So you do looking up the book  I don't care to do that. No, that's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't read anymore because my eyesight's not that good and as soon as I open the book I fall asleep on the page  But yeah, there's that but audiobooks man. I just I just love them. I love them  Although I've been doing more Kindle of late I have to say Google and T-mobile where we saw this yesterday on all about Android  Google and T-mobile announcing a big partnership  The carrier has agreed to showcase a suite of Google services on Android phones they sell  Including and this is what's really interesting Android messages. It will now be the default message app on all T-mobile phones  They're also they've gave given up on their TV service, which they've been slowly phasing out anyway in favor of YouTube TV  Google one will now be the default backup service on T-mobile Android phones and  They're gonna start selling the pixel  Which is very good news because honestly one of the reasons a pixel has become less and less interesting is because nobody was selling it  Except Google I think having it in a carrier store makes a huge difference and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Reading that and was thinking hey, that's great news, but then I thought  People still don't want to buy it because they don't really have a compelling reason  It's not the hotness that the same thing so people go into the if it's not in the phone store

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's at a site out of mind  So I agree with you and it sounds your geek to some to some degree it also depends on the people in the store  Saying oh you should look at this because most people go to the phone store and they know you know they don't have in mind  You and I might say I want to see the Samsung Galaxy s21, please, but I think a lot of them go  Okay, I don't know. What should I get?  So I think having the pixel in there is I remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the last time I went to a physical phone store and it was I was going to get the pixel to excel and  I remember walking in the store and  They had that hole you need to make an appointment bull crap going on. I'm like, I just want to give you  Yeah  You know  Like I just want to give you money and going about my business  So I waited ten minutes and then somebody came to see me and I said I want to get a new phone  And the first thing got their mouth is hey wait. Yeah, we got the new note blah blah blah blah blah blah  Didn't even think about the pixel that was right there next to it is  You know, and I knew I was curious to see what was gonna happen  But I knew I was there to get the pixel to excel  But I was just curious to see what was going to be said if you are a YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  TV subscriber as I am Lisa saw the bill the other day and she said what's the  $65. Yeah, that's what it costs now. She said let's cancel that till football season, but that's what I did. Yeah  Yeah, but the reason we have it is because Lisa wants to come to work and watch the football game  Ah  Yeah, it's nice because you can and you can use the DVR and stuff  Honestly, the more I use it the more likely I am to cancel my cable because I think it's as good as cable  $10 off if you're a T-mobile customer  The other thing that makes this interesting news is the fact that Android messenger will be the default messenger and now that means RCS  Yes, the rich communication services will be finally at least widely used among T-mobile customers  It might be I hope it's just enough to get RCS over the top RCS gives Android users  Kind of a parody with Apple's messages. The problem with Apple messages is it's only on Apple devices  I would I guess that's why people turn to whatsapp and and the like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish we had a swine hardhead left Android and went to iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz his friends had iPhones and he was a he didn't like being a green bubble

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's it, you know that is that is the most genius bit of dark patterns  Because I you know, I for a long time had an Android phone and I was like I had the dreaded like green, you know  Stigmatization and it's awful. Yeah, it just it really motivates you to like want to get an iPhone and and speaking to the pixel  there's one feature of the pixel that I had to  Keep my pixel for even though I moved to iPhone  I don't know about a year ago and that is the ability for it to take photos when people smile and all that kind of stuff  It's built in the AI that decides because because when we do  Experiences we do various things there, you know, I'm involved I'm doing it  So I'll just mount the phone with a tripod somewhere and just leave it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did that one hours last you were in studio more than a year ago, obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, you did that very first time in twitch studios on the big show  Yeah, I was there. Yeah, and that's the idea he put that camera. Yeah cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so easy and it's so high quality that you know, so, you know a lot of times I'm hanging out with people who are you know  you know, they don't smile that often right right and so  It's it's like magical to set up a thing hang out with a bunch of people for three hours and that person who never smiles  You get like 20 pictures of them smiling. Isn't that great? It's so great. It's so great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's fine as mr. Elgin we can't let Google do that Google knows you're smiling I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Still I still need a bedroom because I use hangouts still I know this is I'm hanging by a thread  Because I want hanging out by a thread. Yeah, because it works on Android and iOS  So it is a cross-platform messaging  So I have on my pixel hangouts is my default text messaging  But I know it's just a matter of time and then I guess I'll use Android messages  But then I don't know what I'm gonna do on iOS. So  There there needs an algorithm  Well, I love telegram, but but nobody in my family uses it and I don't think you can make telegram your default  SMS program I should look it's I haven't checked in a while  There's a limit to there's a first and this I don't know who's responsible for this. Is it Google?  Is it is it is it telegram?  But when you look at your default apps, let me just go to my default apps and see what choices I have for them for messages  Yeah, it's signals in there, but not so, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Signals a perfect example signal is fantastic. And again, if you use it nobody else, you know uses it  So there you are by yourself using signal. It's a pointless but you know, this this is one of the frustrating things about Google  That's probably secondary only to the fact that they close everything once you've invested in it  They are the perfect company to have the universal messaging  Platform that everybody uses if Google said, you know what?  we're gonna use Google Messenger and  There's only one thing that this company makes that lets you communicate  Via all these you know different ways and we're gonna support it forever and it's gonna have every feature  It's gonna be like we chat or whatsapp or whatever  It's gonna have all the features and it's gonna be on all the platforms everyone would use it  But no, they have all these different  Platforms nobody knows what's going on with Hangouts. Nobody know nobody  Believes that they're gonna they're gonna stick with any one thing. I did an article  Maybe two years ago about I think I think they had 13  communications platforms and  By the time the article was published they had a different number. I mean it was just  Even even geeks even the people who listen to this show or even people who who who appear on this show  Couldn't literally name all of their messaging platforms and where they are and what they do and all that kind of stuff  Nobody knows it's such a lost opportunity for Google. You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're saying this I  Would assume that the leadership at Google would know those same facts they would know that hey we got this  We had this messaging. We had blah blah blah blah  Why aren't they as leaders saying you know what we need to fix our crap and and and get things more focused  To where we can offer a product to the masses that could be strong and used by everybody pretty regularly and just and keep it rolling  Why isn't your you but shy I know the real company you said it you said the P word

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody says this and I'm known as this but Sundar Pichai is a horrible CEO  He has zero vision and basically Google's Lord of the Flies  Everybody in Google is doing their own thing and there's no visionary leadership to get everybody in lockstep  This is the beauty of Apple that the tone was set by Steve Jobs  This is why Apple has one thing, you know what Apple's messaging platform is everybody knows what it is  There's one thing, you know, they're never gonna abandon it and and and Google is the opposite of that  They every different division and a group and so on has their own thing going on and soon our patch  I doesn't have the leadership to to to to bring it all into one  And so it's it's it's a mess and it's probably gonna remain that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And maybe it's because the shareholders are like we care less our money is coming from elsewhere not because of these apps  Is that the case because there's no real push there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it I don't know. I mean if  Everybody wants to be we chat right in China, right we chat. That's the Chinese  Yeah  Overwhelming in China. You can't take the train. You can't like do anything without we chat  This is the this is the wet dream of every Silicon Valley  Executive because it's a it's a ecommerce platform. It's a social network

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So every you become the default when the government decides you're the default to so absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, no, absolutely  but the the the company that you know Facebook the Facebook's entire thing about buying and  integrating the messaging for  Instagram and and and and Facebook messenger and all these different platforms into one unit is because their goal is to become the we chat of the  Non Chinese world but really imagine if Google had that golf Google had the goal of having a single platform that everybody used for everything  That would be extremely lucrative lucrative for Google's a company  They just don't have the culture that would make that happen  That's the that's the problem or the leadership or the vision or any anything else  I mean, I actually think that like  The if the founders if Larry and Sergey came back to Google and actually ran the company again  I think they could make it happen if they intended to but they're they're off playing with their money and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see, I don't even know about that. Mr. Elgin because while they were there this problem existed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's only gotten worse though. Yeah, you'd think when they when they handed over the reins to Pachai  He could have said let's fix this but you're right it's only gotten worse is it I'm not trying we blame Ruth poor  I know where you're gonna say yeah, we blame the CFO

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he could but that's she works for him. She works for him. Yeah, so I don't I don't think it's fair. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure them, you know, I've never heard anybody say this Mike, but as soon as you say it I have to say yeah, you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep, you're right. This is this is the this is this is why Steve jobs is the most successful  technology leader  I'll give you an example because he was a fascist. There was there is one company

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where the founders gone?  And they brought in a new CEO about five years ago and he has completely changed. Oh, don't tell me you're gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're not gonna say Della. Yeah, my Microsoft Della. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is totally different since he's been in place and  Okay, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the company that Steve was terrible but Bill Gates was the Steve jobs  He was just as ruthless and horrible and Bill Gates never invented anything himself

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He only copied others and made it more successful, which was good business  Well, I admit he was a different person but he was a cutthroat manager

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was a cutthroat manager and did very well for the company bomber was terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now the problem I have with Microsoft is that is that they are  As I've said it on the last three shows are the Eddie Haskell of tech companies Google it if you're too young and  They're throwing the internet overboard right well that's  Australia they're they're saying redo 230. They're they're exciting with the newspapers against Google and Facebook  They're the jerk company and they've always been the jerk company and they're still the jerk company

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I agree at least in that in that regard the not impressive  But I have to say in every other regard when Adela has done with Microsoft is spot-on and his vision  And it well Skype's but he's gonna fold Skype in a team

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put on the throat of sky could have been zoom  I  Know they're focusing on team and as you're in all the other enterprise stuff that's making the money. Yeah, well, that's their future

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where they're going  That's also their windows. Yes, their skill set there  They're there. I think of all the companies out there even better than Google who really should understand this  Realized that the futures in the cloud and they are really positioning themselves to be the cloud  Backbone business  Amazon knows it yeah and  Microsoft doesn't compete at that level but on the other hand Microsoft is more trusted in enterprise than Amazon is  In fact, you know just as an example we talked about this earlier on Windows Weekly  They just did a deal that will be 13 billion dollars to sell  HoloLens headsets to the United States Army  Sending a hundred selling 120,000 HoloLenses to the US Army  I think I think Microsoft does knows what they're doing and I think he's an example of a  Non-founder leader who is in fact improves the company, but there are few and far between he's that he proves  They're pretty easy to follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bomber. Yeah. Yeah, you couldn't do worse than bomber. Yeah. Yeah. He accepted the fact that Microsoft is not gonna be these  Sexy company out there. They just gonna go out here and make this money  On the enterprise side of things and I'd be happy with right right life all to the bank

So many are experiencing globally as you may remember  Last year we made the decision to pause our long-standing Google tradition of celebrating April Fool's Day out of respect for all those  Fighting COVID-19 really really that's why okay with much of the world still grappling with serious challenges  We feel we should again pause the jokes for April Fool's Day this year  Like we did last year  We should continue to find appropriate ways to bring moments of joy to our users throughout the year  eg doodles Easter eggs, etc  By the way, there is an Easter egg if you search Google forever given  It's it's just it's just a little Easter egg little boats floating across  That's the kind of thing we're talking about yeah, I wish I wish  Volkswagen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow nice stuff  Let's let me think what do I have to do here before we wrap up?  One more commercial we I do want to do the change log  Lots more to come with aunt Jeff and Mike  My three buds always look forward to this show  I gotta say our show today brought to you by a new list that I think you're gonna want to check out the enterprise  tech  30 this is a  Piece of seminal research developed by wing venture capital in partnership with NASDAQ  These are the top  30 enterprises  But they're not public they're in the private enterprise tech  Sector that's a that's something that's hard to you know look into you really don't have if they're not public  You don't have any idea which company is doing well or poorly because you know they don't have any reporting requirements  they can be cagey around growth and revenue as sales cycles can be long and arduous and  I have to say unfortunately you may see lists like this in other places, but they're a  They're often dominated by well-known consumer brands or mature b2b startups and B. Frankly, there's credibility issues  Because a lot of these lists are produced by lobbying or even pay-to-play methods  And even if they're not they're absolutely subject to the bias  Based on how much a company can generate hype around itself  That's not the point of the enterprise tech 30 effect if you look at the methodology here on the website  You'll see this is really done  in a very  Responsible way to make sure that you're gonna get a list of the enterprise startups with literally the most potential  To tectonically shift how enterprises operate for the better  Anybody on this list the et30  They're on a fast track of growth  But they're also really changing how business is done  There will be exits absolutely future ipos multi-billion dollar exits  You can't lobby your way onto this list you can only be selected  And and become part of an elite community the enterprise tech 30 focuses on companies with potential at all stages of maturity  Not just companies with mature businesses and existing traction  There's startups in here too a great buying guide for enterprise executives looking to bring more validated and credible digital innovation into their organizations  Who are the disruptors the people who are going to change our world the enterprise tech founders on this list?  should see their inclusion is the highest endorsement of their current and future success and  By the way if you're planning to build a public-trade company getting on this list is a watershed moment in your journey tech executives  And high-performance operators will use the list to help guide the decisions on which companies to join  So there's a lot of interest in this it's now out  The 2021 edition of the enterprise tech 30 brought to you by wing venture capital and nasdaq head over to enterprise tech  30.com to see who made this year's list. Oh, you're showing it  That's okay  Enterprise tech 30  Enterprise tech there's a lot more than just the list lots of information enterprise tech 30.com  We thank the et 30 wing and nasdaq  for their support enterprise tech 30.com  Quissy tegan is quitting  the twitter  She was named by twitter as the mayor the unofficial mayor of twitter  She's certainly popular on twitter 13.7 million followers, but after being beat up blocked by president trump  Attacked by many  She's decided to call it a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's leaving. He'll be back. You think she'll be back. It just happens so often is that  It's not I think they also miss some of the people who they did it right. Yeah  Yeah, jerk so we got to do a better job of de-jerking the place but did did she say she blocked more than a million people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  And that was on january 6th  That was that was all around the capital insurrection  Um, yeah, she said i'm just tired of the two follower punches  For years i've taken so many small two follower account punches to this point. I'm deeply honestly deeply

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh bruised I think if you have that many followers, it's got to be pretty unusable

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  Well, you shouldn't and I think you'll see this on the big on the big accounts like that. They don't follow people  But still there's nothing to keep people from name dropping you that's the problem. And so you can't really get that's a flaw in the in the  It is structural flaw  Yeah, yeah, maybe she'll come back because you're right people like her are hooked on the  Notarizing and I think twitter will keep any new mechanisms to make it better  I hope I see some evidence that they're doing that. I think so. I think they're working hard because they don't want this reputation  Right  It's not it's not a good look for doing a lot any publicly held company. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, sad. Um, facebook also introduced new stuff today. Yes big story

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, I was I was trying to track that down that broke uh, right as we went to press as they say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's line

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I I haven't uh, I haven't read up on this. Let me read. It's very long

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a 21 minute read according to uh, nick nick clag

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You and the algorithms they're changing the news feed, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, they're adding some stuff in there  This is a very long piece where he kind of it's it's it's a bit of an issue  He kind of tries to say and this is a fairly standard facebook schtick is it's not just us. It's you too, right?  We're giving you what you want and you can change it and so on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's actually addressing three things that we've talked about before on the show the atlantic article comparing facebook to the doomsday machine, which you  excoriated  The netflix documentary the social dilemma, which I agree was dopey  Yep, uh shoshana zuboff's surveillance capitalism. You've said I roll my eyes out. Yeah  But I do agree with nick that it isn't just facebook  Uh, you know it is us and facebook is a reflection. It's media and and and so on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got so I agree with  large number of his points, um  I got upset about a couple things. I got upset that he has a line in there asking whether government should decide what conversations  Citizens should have they can't they're not allowed to raise that. Why would you raise that? I you know, and i'm i'm upset that  facebook  Uh has been playing the regulatory capture and saying yeah, go ahead redo 230 regulate us. It's fine. Tell us what to do  We'll do that. That's a cop out  Um, they should they should try to set their own standards of behavior and they're still not doing that  I find that upsetting but nonetheless  I generally agree but any case in there they announced a few new things  There's a kind of a way down this damn thing. Yeah, it's a long article. Holy cow

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's yes  He has to kind of establish why they did the news feed and all that stuff and before he could say what's going to change  So they're going to change  the algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're changing a few things. It's easy. It's easier to go to chronological  Versus hallelujah, you know, I always always been there but now you know, they're gonna yeah, but it would revert

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I would go into facebook set it to chronological and the next time I came back it was back to the algorithmic feed  honestly  Facebook's initial promise which they should have a switch for is I just want to see  Everything posted by the people I follow in chronological order and that's that  And that seems like that's what the facebook promised  This would be  The feed of people you care about that seems like it would be pretty good instagram was that initially?  They went algorithmic even twitter has gone somewhat algorithmic somewhat algorithm. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when I switch on twitter off the algorithmic I actually go back to it  Because I miss things it does it does find things that I would miss, right?  Um, so I just put up the the list of the changes there  Um, so, you know, we'll see if it makes any difference. Uh, my  My argument with facebook constantly is that that  Rather than saying oh government should regulate us  Facebook should come up with a higher order view of what they are or the governance  Board should regulate us. No, okay. So i'm looking at some of the changes you can control who can comment

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On your post, so I think that's good  Before you've been able to say who can see it now you say  Look, you know, maybe this is a public post, but only friends can comment on it. I think that's very good. That's good  Yep, a feature like that would have would have kept uh, chrissey tegan on twitter, right?  Yeah, and it might have saved google plus right because part of the problem with google plus is  The spamming you would get in your in your comment. I think on twitter. Can't you do that mike? I think you can say only

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People I follow can comment only people you can think I think only verified people can do that, but I could be mistaken about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem is I I can do that I could say I only want to see comments from verified people I can control what I see  But that still does not control what somebody says on twitter that everybody else can't do that  Twitter that everybody else can see yes. Yeah, so somebody searches for my name on twitter  They're gonna see stuff. I don't see because it's blocked

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's also true if you if you leave twitter so that it may has no effect to leave twitter. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've left twitter. I don't use it at all, but people can still name tag me actually. I made my account private  So does that mean you can still I think you can't name tag me unless you're a friend now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And twitter, I think you can still type it out, but it doesn't you can type it out, but you can't at leo laporte

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right  I hope that's the case  I don't know. I'm not checking so I don't know. I don't miss it  I love mastodon  Uh, we have now more than a thousand users in our twitter social instance, and it's very nice. It's exactly where I want to be  Because it's it's kind of like what twitter was in the old days. It's geeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had a couple people on there yesterday talking about we need to have a twit  Indy car race  Outing. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a big big yeah, because I mentioned I was suddenly into formula one last week and chris clark said  Oh, you should get an indie car. They come to monterey  You know, you could see them in california once or twice a season. Yeah. All right. I'm willing to go  road trip  Road trip. What else? Let's see. What other changes more control  uh  uh  The new tool is example over control and curate your news feed  By adjusting your commenting audience you can further control how you want to invite conversation on your public posts limit potentially unwanted interactions  I think that's good. If you're a public figure  Creator or brand you can choose to limit your comment coming audience on your public post to help you feel safe. Chrissy  So Chrissy come on over  We're making it easier to sort and browse the news feed giving you more control over what you see  They've launched favorites a new tool where you can control and prioritize posts from the friends and pages you care about most of the news feed  By selecting up to 30 friends and pages to include in favorites their posts will appear  Higher in the ranked news feed. So this is sort of giving me what I was wanted  It's still going to put other heads down that road at least. Yes. Yeah  The feed filter bar is a new menu at the top of the news feed  It offers easier access to most recent the so-called chronological feed  Uh, that's good and the feed filter bar will be visible on the android app when you scroll up on the news feed  It's coming to ios  And they're both in the shortcuts menu

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did I miss there's a why am I seeing this?  Is not on facebook  Say again. She was twitter she quit  No, i'm saying, but I don't know is she on facebook. I wouldn't know that's another place. I don't hang

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, same here  Uh, yeah, I don't even have an account. I kept I kept my twitter account. I kept my instagram account mostly so  During shows I can display tweets, but I really didn't want to have anything to do with facebook  So I just and I don't miss it, you know, it's not like I was addicted and then now I dream about it and wish  I could go back  Yeah, i'm fine without it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're also glowing more too i'm glowing much more

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's because you're on facebook you're glowing thank you you're so right  Understand why as you said, uh, jeff why you see a post it'll because you're a nazi. Yeah  Why am I seeing this? Why does you have weird uncles?  Related engagement related topics location  Okay, so those are the big changes. So if you're facebook user, yeah  Good for them  You'd think they'd be trying this all the time. But yeah, you'd think that this would be yeah  Let's see  Facebook is reopening they've set a date  For reopening their san francisco and bay area offices, but no  Free food and no transit. So stay home  Oh  Wow  Yeah uber's opening its san francisco offices on monday  Facebook will open  May 10th in its menlo park offices  Uh at 10 percent capacity though, so most people won't be  Oh becoming  Uh google has announced its it's it too  Has decided the it's time  To open up the offices sometime in april, you know, I don't I I wish these companies would I guess they can't legally say it  If you're vaccinated, but I think they guess they can't legally say it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well rutgers university is saying students cannot return unless they're vaccinated which I wish my university would do I love that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe a university can do that, but a company can't google is encouraging workers to get vaccinated but is not requiring it  Uh, you won't be required to come into the office until at least september  But they are starting to open up in april. They told workers in an email today  Okay  Microsoft same thing we talked about that earlier on windows weekly  Uh, I get I I would guess that there's some legal  limitation on requiring  Well, I guess i'll have to find out because i'd love to say to our employees  You know more than half of them are getting getting vaccinated now  Uh, you can come back if you're vaccinated

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So i'm looking up shurm, which is the association of hr people. What a fun group  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a perfect name for an hr group

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure, they they went they went in december to lawyers saying is there a basis and in some cases they say yes  If it's a threat to other employees

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you can require a school. It makes sense a school could require it right  but  Somebody in the chat room told me earlier today that it's because it they are not fda approved their emergency usage approved  So  I don't know. I don't I don't know  It makes sense. You couldn't you can demand  Somebody get vaccinated  I wish you could

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be nice if you could

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, actually we're hearing uh mike that mexico, uh vastly under reported its deaths and  It's it's a big number now as it like 60. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mexico is one of those basket case countries like brazil  That is just you know, and and i've known this it's i've been watching it pretty closely for a long time  And bolsonaro has been you know  Lying in brazil. Yeah  Well bolsonaro in brazil and also, uh, what's his name the guy the mexican president  They've all they've all been lying about it. Um under downplaying it just like trump used to and it's it's really a problem  um the difference is that  The united states is very quickly ramping up vaccinations and that's not happening in mexico or brazil  So it's it's going to be a long time for latin america. I think um  Before there's a herd immunity or you know, why do you feel safe down there? You you you and amira have not got covid have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have not and you've been traveling back and forth quite a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wouldn't go to most of mexico. I wouldn't go to mexico city. Um where we have a lot of friends  Um, but ojaca is kind of a unique case because it's very spacious open and  It's amazing  Everyone wears masks here  Oh, that's everyone and and and every and you go to a you know, the restaurants are all open and stuff like that  You go to a restaurant  You have to walk through a puddle of like disinfected water and wipe your feet on the thing and they take your temperature  They spray you down. They give you hand sanitizer. They give you a bag  For your mask because they don't want the mask on the table. So the that wasn't a paper bet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean it's it's universal 100 of the restaurants and not government mandated but just kind of everybody's agreed to do this. That's great  That's right. I was flying there mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, it was great. I mean it was you know, um, the plane was fuller than  When we did it six months ago, whatever  And everybody was masked. Um, it was fine. The airport was fine  I mean, I you know, it's it's uh, you know, I I wouldn't recommend travel  As it used to happen, but like we're coming down here for for the long term basically  and um  But we would travel the way we did until we get vaccinated for sure but but coming to to oaxaca  It's it's a straight shot. And then once you're here, it's just very easy to stay socially distant from everybody and  And stay safe. So that's why we came here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And tequila will kill anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, you don't use the t-word in an oaxaca the oh no you can use this mescal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's the best at buying things and keeping them alive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well the best at buying things  I don't know about the keeping them alive part, but the best at buying things is apple because they always pay  a small amount for  Non-flashy companies that have really good technology. They integrate them into their own products and you never hear from them again  And almost everything that they buy is actually a core part of what they do going forward and that's mass, you know  Distributing a mass level so apple i think adobe is another company like that too and microsoft has done a pretty good job

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they've been some big acquisitions like  linkedin github  nokia  nokia skype  Well, i'm joking nokia didn't work out so i forgot about linkedin  Uh, but for a lot of these companies it's been okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then a subsequent wildfire did and it's gone and here's a here's a pro tip leo for uh that I learned as a  part owner of a winery  Don't  Don't get anything from 2020  That the entire the wine is not going to be everything smoked. Everything is weird  Just you know if if they offer you like a white or a rose or something like that from 2020 just kind of say  Let me think from 2019. Oh golly. Yeah, did not think about that  Yeah, the wineries are trying to  Get through this year. They're they're shipping bottles  It's they're hoping people don't notice and you know, etc, but like  2020 was a horrible year. That was an oaky chardonnay. It's very oaky smoky chardonnay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the I went to the website for the place that we used to go calistoga ranch  And basically  The calistoga ranch is closed indefinitely. There's a picture of a very smoky  Place and a button that says donate save us. That's not a help us. It's not a not encouraging. Yeah  Ouch, yeah, it's it's too bad. It's owned by a very  Successful hotel change though. So it's my hope they'll they'll rebuild it. So we're going to a different place  One that didn't burn down  Uh, so yeah, I won't be I won't be here next week. Yeah, I love calistoga. It's beautiful. I love nappa  And I thank you for that tip. We'll look for wines pre 20 20 20 yikes  so I was thinking but this all came up because you mentioned the  The new google tv chromecast google tv, so if I brought that I should bring that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just plug it into the uh into the into the hdmi cable the port  I will bring it tv. Yeah plug it in and you are you're good to just don't forget  Don't leave it there. Yeah  Exactly. That's the  That's the biggest one, but they're so cheap that is even if you do it's not the end of the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm totally that's person in the room  The the original chromecast that I had umpteen years ago and when I was traveling more regularly  That you plug it in at the hotel and you have to connect to the hotel wi-fi  But the hotel wi-fi had some other it had a capture port. Yeah  Is that still the case nowadays? Because I don't know I hardly ever turn on a tv at hotels

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't stay I don't stay in hotels. So yeah, the rbb is just logging  I don't know. I think the captive portal might not work except that you would do that on the phone  And you could get through the captive portal on the phone and then you'd have the wi-fi  Maybe at that point you could hand it off through a lot of data. I'll yeah, i'll check  You know that that may be your right. Uh, we're staying in a hotel  And here's uh, my next car a fiat 500  It's got the hey logo on it. You're not buying a fiat. No, i'm not you're not buying  But it's but look at the colors on the side I love it I guess when you talk to it it's going to do the google  It's uh the 500 500 l 500 x models inspired  With elements inspired by the google colors on the door and in the interior  You'd really have to be a google fan and has a little button on it. Yeah that says uh, hey  On the side. Sorry. Didn't mean to trigger  trigger you  I get it. I'd like that. Yeah, and I guess you can uh,  You can query the google assistant in the car  But you can also query the google assistant at home to ask about the fuel level see if your car's locked  Switch on the emergency lights. You just say hey, you know who asked my fiat  And uh, that's pretty cool  I think we're gonna see a lot more of that  Obviously, yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  And that  Is the google change?  I  Think we're gonna take a break unless you have something else. I think we've gotten i'm just looking here  Uh, you skipped one of the change logs. I skipped several of the change logs  Is there one you cared about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube I thought the youtube hide and likes things was they test hiding dislikes in response to car targeted campaigns

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this happens all the time where you get people saying uh thumbs the thumbs down this  And I guess it'll hide. I don't know. It's just a test and another teaser at the end of the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  During the pics i'm going to tell you how to do that  On your own hide the hide the likes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hide it all hide the likes  I think this is the end of the show. So  No, okay, let's see what else  uh  I'm just looking to see if we did volkswagen. Uh  I think we've done everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, you've done everything. What is it that you are? Does it matter if zoom is going to have an sdk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that does that make it worse to you guys? No, when when they come out with it and people start using it all  I'll talk about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think you got it boss

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our picks likes thing  Okay, it really can't let go of it  I find value in it. Of course you do you're a creator

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well  Because but you but you know, there have been targeted dislike campaigns, right? I know I know no one would do that to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, well see I I think about this reminds me of um  A this we can take episode from last year  and that video had a bunch of dislikes on it and it  Bugged the crap out of me  and i'm i'm glad that I could see that it had dislikes because I other people can help amplify  That video because it had a great message. It was featuring miss lexi civitis  And she talked about women in tech and people disliked it  Yeah, and i'm like man this this is full crap  And I liked that I was able to see that people were clicking dislike in a trolling effect or whatever to see you could try to  You could push it down so I could fight back. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is an example of what it would look like. There's a 978 thumbs up and doesn't show the dislike  Count the move was made quote in response to creator feedback around well-being

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It hurts my feelings when you have to dislike button  Could you hide dislikes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So but but that's when you should just get rid of both of those buttons likes and dislikes  If that's the case if you're worried about well-being

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just don't have like yeah, because you can you can actually if you're a creator you can still see it  In your private, you know youtube studio area in the step. Yeah in the stats  Yeah, but other other people can't see it. So no one knows that everybody hates you  Nobody yet  This is an experiment that will not be around for long my prediction one of the reasons I skipped it. It's like  Yeah  It's an experiment google experiments with stuff. This is these a b tests all the time all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I predict some things for a couple years

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey if you're on verizon's 3g network  The clock is ticking. Bye. Bye. Bye. The end is near the end is near  Back in january  Verizon said they didn't really have a time frame for decommissioning the network  They've now said december you have some time december 31st 2022  Now it is the case that there are people with phones that only do 3g. They don't do 4g or lte  Or 5g  So there will be people every time this happens. There will be people who  Will say oh my god my you made my phone break  Um of the 94 million customers  Verizon has  They estimate about 1 percent are still using 3g. That's nine. That's almost a million people. That's a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So i'm having a senior moment. Uh, the competitor to cdma was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh gsm gsm  You know  Verizon was cdma  Pretty much one right was gsm. Well, I did and now it's lte and everybody's lte and it neither gsm nor cdma  They're all just using lte. So  You can use gsm over lte, but you know with between volti and lte and just everybody's using lte

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So lte a flavor of gsm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No lte is something else entirely and most people are it's  It's the high speed data and most people are putting voice over lte  Got it. All right  Some people are doing gsm over lte  Um, but that that's I think a transitional technology I bet it's gone by now, but I know people were doing that  lte replaces both cdma and  Gsm ultimately and it pretty much everybody's got lte. Most phones are lte by now  But that's the point of turning off the  3d  3g cdma stuff  I about you miss stacy  Pardon me. Oh, yeah, this is this is where stacy could thinking about miss stacy absolutely come in and  and  Straighten like captain sam she's holding her eyes at us now. Oh you guys just don't grasp how this stuff works  Do you it's not a?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  prow  It's a gsm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a really good post on a blog called stone soup  Uh, I posted more for you guys and but our audience might be interested in it. I like  That the boat is stuck  It's bad that the boat is stuck. It's bad for lots of people and lots of reasons. I know that  Please don't think that me liking the stuck boat is an ideological stance  This is not an opinion. I have about boats or about canals or about things generally being stuck  It's bad that the boat's stuck. It's bad for lots of people and lots of reasons  But I can't deny it. I like that the boat is stuck  I like that so far. We all seem to agree the boat is stuck  There's no debate over whether or not the big boat is stuck. It's a big boat. It's stuck  We're all aware of those facts and even those of us who are currently located in out of space believe  Furthermore most of us share the opinion that it's disagreeable  Logistically for the boat to be stuck  The boat being stuck is inconvenient. It's a big disruption. Nobody can say it's not a big disruption  None of my distant relatives will get into arguments on the facebook about whether or not the stuck boat is making a nuisance for a  Lot of people I like that  Another thing I like we know exactly what the problem is that is making the boat be stuck. It's a big boat and it's stuck  sure  Sure shipping and manufacturing of boats and canals have lots of connections to varied and sundry historical historical and sociological issues  But this immediate problem in front of us is a stuck boat  And we can look at that problem for precisely what it is  It's not stuck for mysterious reasons related to a long history of humans cruelly exploiting other humans  It's not stuck because a politician wanted money from an organization that profits from human suffering  It's not stuck because someone's pretending to be in favor of free speech is trying to promote hateful ideologies. It's stuck because it's big  Bigger than the place where it is and that's why it's stuck  It goes on it's good it's a it's an antidote  And uh, and he and he closes. I hope the boat gets unstuck  I do I hope that nobody gets hurt and I extend that hope all the way through to every kind of hurt that's possible  And selfishly and honestly part of me hopes that nobody gets hurt so I can keep on liking that the big boat was stuck  and maybe  The boat can just stay stuck for a minute so I can keep on  The boat is stuck  That's all that's a wonderful that's a that's a wonderful post. I wish I had written it. I love it respect respect

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but let me just let me just throw one horrible spin on this whole thing. Oh, no  in in the conspiracy  Theory circles. They in fact believe oh crap stuck because  Hillary Clinton was trapped in a boat and she was trapped in a boat and she was trapped in a boat and she was trapped in a boat  Stuck because  Hillary Clinton, no traffic trafficking minors  And there's a whole I don't even there really is of course. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course there is of course there is  Um, I you know what i'm trying to find

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Attribution for this all I can say it's stone-soup.ghost.io and it's written by somebody named gaily  But it's really great really really it's what we needed at a time like this. Yep. Yep  Let's uh, let's start since mike is visiting us  All the way from ojaka, by the way, we were a little worried because you said your bandwidth wasn't great  But it's it's been beautiful. It's been great. Yeah. Yeah  uh mike elgin elgin  Mike elgin dot sub stack dot com  Is his new newsletter, please read it and then when you get it  Say, I love this  I'm going to subscribe  How much is it to subscribe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, I think it's five bucks a month. He doesn't even know because sub stack takes care of it all  Just just sign up for the free thing and you know  You'll love it. I guarantee that everyone listening to this show will absolutely love it and it's free. I'm gonna subscribe

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like it  Mike your pick of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so I have three quick ones  Um  The first one we were talking about newsletters and sub stack and all that kind of stuff  Uh, so i'm a paid uh user of hey.com the the email service. Oh, yeah, you use it, huh?  I do. Uh, I don't use it that much. I I use both it and gmail. It's very complicated and i'm a  Hardcore zero inbox kind of guy. So my inbox is always empty and i've written about that on my newsletter  um, but uh  I'm fascinated by the fact that hey has a service that almost nobody knows about that's really fantastic  So if you're a paid subscriber to hey cost 100 bucks a year  Uh, and you have a you know, hey email address, which I will they'll give you one if you subscribe they have a  newsletter publishing service that is  breathtakingly simple what you do is is you  Write an email to world at hey.com  Oh  And and when you do that, it will publish a public page. It will create a blog basically  And it will offer to anybody who goes to that page the ability to either subscribe via rss or subscribe via  Email and it becomes an email newsletter  Everything subsequently that you post to world at hey.com  Is delivered to anyone who signs up for your newsletter?  Now  One of the things I love about this is that it's so brain dead simple. You just write an email and send it  That's how you post to this thing. That's how you create it. That's how you do everything. That's all you do  um  But back in the day there there used to be many years ago people remember there was a service called posterous  Which innovated? Oh, I loved posters. I'm so sad about posters. You could post a blog post by sending an email

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you did when I was in china because facebook and twitter and everything were blocked back in 2009. I used posters  to blog my trip

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  by email so  so so  squarespace  Also had that feature  Until about six months after I signed up for squarespace  In which case they cancelled it but you used to be able to to post a blog post by email  On squarespace that killed it. It's a rare feature now, but  That but hey world which is what this service is called does that you can just do all your blog posting by email  Anyway, so if you're if you have any interest in hey.com  It's another reason to subscribe to that and you can do a sub stack like newsletter without  That's even simpler than sub stack. Is there an address for your hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Newsletter, do you are you doing this or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because you have some i'm not currently doing this because i'm on sub stack, but but it's just a really cool  It's you know  You could use it to actually publish a newsletter  But it's really for like for example if jeff wants to send a newsletter to like 20 colleagues or whatever  Or just post something for students or something. It's just instantaneous  You literally send one email and you've got this thing done. You've got all this stuff going on  You've got newsletter you have logged you have all the stuff. So it's very cool in that sense  So that so that's my long one. I have two very quick ones. The second one is I know that at twit  Of among the many coffee making things that are there in the office. Oh my god, one of which is the air  One of which is the aero press which is always sort of every day. Yes  All right. So so I am a huge i've become a huge fan on this trip of the aero press go  Which isn't getting enough  press because  It kind of came out right when the you know, everybody stopped traveling  But the aero press go is a travel version of the aero press. It's so ironic because I bought lisa this and then covid

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you can't go anywhere we haven't used it but we have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've had it for months and haven't used it till this trip  But I have to say that now that i'm using it on this trip  It's brilliant  One of the things that people don't talk enough about is that if you're an american  And you want to make coffee and you stay on airbnbs as I do you go anywhere  All the cups in the world are tiny. Yeah, tiny little teacups. You can't use the air press go  The thing that contains it is this pretty large cup  Which you know you oh you make it into that thing  And then you drink out of this I get this this cup is twice as big as any other cup in this house

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's like 30 and it's smaller though than a normal coffee mug  Because one of the things I didn't like about the aero press go is it doesn't have as much capacity  As the full-size aero press but but this is pretty good. It's good enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, size of a large mug, you know, whatever. Yeah, okay  So that's and then the last one is the youtube one  So youtube is addictive they they dangle all this stuff. They have the negative comments. They have all this stuff  There's an extension chrome extension also firefox extension called improved tube  Which you can get on all the places you get extensions  And you can literally turn off anything or anything  Uh, you can change the color you can do all that stuff, but you can turn off the pitches you can turn off the  Likes you can turn off  Everything and anything you can totally control what you see on youtube  uh with this it's been around for a while, but  Everybody loves it because it's really really good. Is it improve youtube or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's oh, yeah, that's okay. This is it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They call it improve youtube and improved tube. Yeah, I don't know. It's a terrible name. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was looking at the new version the beta testing version, but you can install the regular version. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if you have a problem with  YouTube addiction which a lot of people do you you go to the site and you get sucked into all the recommendations and stuff like that  You can turn you can just make all that stuff invisible and you'll never see it again and it makes it a lot less  addictive and  Less of a time sink  So I recommend that anybody who goes to the youtube site on their browser that they install this and customize what you see on youtube  improved tube

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and uh  You know, I saw when hate came out with it. I thought oh I should maybe  Because I I did a trial but I didn't buy hate because it's 100 bucks a year  But now maybe but you find it good for email

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's great for email. It's uh, for those people who are unfamiliar. I can't use my email. I just can't use email  Yeah, it's a mess. Hey is great for that because you basically have to green light  Uh everything that comes in so something comes in  And if they've never emailed you before you have to actually go and say  I want this I don't want this right. I want this to go in this so you only get the mail you want  exactly and so  After using hay for a while you really get control of your inbox and and and then  When you direct things into different folders, you can see the folder as a single long page, right?  So for example, if you I do that for google alerts  So I want to look at those every three four days or whatever and I just go into that folder and it's just one page  I go through all the alerts just quickly  But it's not it's not one thing then I close it and go to a next thing  It's just one long page with all the alerts. So you really save a lot of time and it's a great email service

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really forward your old email addresses into it because now you have an ad hay.com address, which I don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right. So what do you do?  This is the problem that nobody talks about about hate hay because if you send from hay  Then the thing goes into hay, but it doesn't go into good  So you if you're using both if you're on the fence, it's not a good solution  If you want to completely you have to be all in it's a great solution. And if you want your own hay address

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're going to pay more they charge a lot for ultra short email addresses and stuff like that  But you can't use it with anything else but hay.com essentially  Right, and it's that's my problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not for everybody for sure. But if people you know  Most people are have a real problem with email. Yeah, it's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
