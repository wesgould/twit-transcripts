The show where we talk about not just Google but the cloud, the internet, anything really  we damn well please.  That's because we got the two best hosts anywhere.  They know everything and so we just let them go.  And that's of course Gina, I almost called her Jeff Trapani.  Gina Trapani and Jeff Jarvis.  Gina Trapani is the founding editor of Lifehacker.  And of course ever since I started reading Lifehacker I've been thinking how can I get  Gina Trapani to do a show with us?  We're thrilled now.  Here we are at episode 174 of Twig.  She also writes ThinkUp at ThinkUp.com and Todo.Text and just wrote an article, very  interesting article for Marco Armit, the magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, iPad mini publishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of a Lifehacker article, How to Make a Baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it went straight for the Lifehacker tutorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the whole maker thing we've been hearing about.  Gina has to be on top of it.  It's the ultimate of the maker culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone said your title makes it sound as if the regular way to make a baby doesn't  count.  Let's just say it's the unconventional way to make a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not everyone knows how and this is good.  This is good.  You're sharing important vital information.  Also, Jeff Jarvis who shares his public parts with us at all times.  That's the name of his book, Public Parts.  He's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  And also another guy that I just thought if there were any way I could do a show with  this guy it would be so good.  And boy, to have the two of you on a single show is marvelous.  Marvelous, darling.  Actually, an old friend of yours, Gina, is going to be on triangulation later today.  We've got Harper Reed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Harper is great.  That's going to be a good interview.  And he's got great hair and glasses and crazy t-shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Both of us have played Werewolf with him at food camp.  The reason I wanted to get him on is because he headed the team that did the software for  Obama that worked compared to the software for Romney that didn't work.  Both the same thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he was a CTO for Obama for America.  Yeah.  Before that he was CTO at Threadless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, the t-shirt company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I was in a Werewolf game with him and Ben Hove of I Can't Hashtag Cheeseburger.  It was like two in the morning.  There was beer.  Was I there?  Because I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's like being in the Algonquin around you.  I think I was there, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You may have been there.  I think I was there.  It was a memorable Werewolf game.  I was like, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was wow is right.  The screaming, the yelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a lot of screaming and yelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ben Hove was a little inebriated.  It was fabulous.  Anyway, yeah, there's a great article about him in The Atlantic.  There is Harper.  I can't remember what their program was called.  One was called Narwhal.  I can't remember it, but the Romney program was named something that eats narwhals.  I think it was.  Anyway, we'll get the story.  It's interesting.  Romney's on election day crashed and didn't work.  Obama had narwhal and then Orca was, that's right, the Republicans was called Orca because  Orcas eat narwhals.  In this case, didn't quite work out because I think mostly due to testing.  It's a fascinating example of the stuff that we're into, the geekery that we understand.  You don't put a website live without testing it under extreme conditions first.  We all know that, but I guess somebody at the Republican National Committee did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Early in the campaign, Harper handed me a button, a pen that said, get branch for Obama.  I thought, okay.  This is a good sign.  The tech at OFA is going to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get branch for Obama.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He had a really cool team of nerds there.  That's going to be a good interview later.  Yeah, I'm very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, I thought I'd mention that because I know you're a fan.  At least we like his werewolf skills.  Technique for sure.  Excellent technique.  Google I.O. it's coming baby.  Make it this time.  As the geek world calls it, Oprah for nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We packed the bay this year.  Last year was June, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  May 15th through 17th.  And they'll probably have something under your seat.  Metaphorically by then, we may have Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We might have Google Glass.  We might have the touch screen Chromebook.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would you please explain to me, we talked about this last week and then again on Twitter  and I forgot to mention this on Twitter, but there's no Chrome OS doesn't have touch, does  it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe this rumor is confusing Chrome OS with Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is going to be name dropping here, but I was in a meeting yesterday with Klaus Schwab,  who's the head of Davos World Economic Forum, and I showed him the Chromebook.  That's obnoxious.  I am now.  This is important.  You must see this.  He's an evangelist.  What did he do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think you just have to now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I touched my laptop screen at a moment not thinking.  Have you guys done this touch screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do it daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the one thing where Microsoft is ahead to have a touch screen laptop, you know, give  them points.  Apple should have been touch screen ages ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But one thing we do know for sure is you can't graft touch onto an existing OS.  That's what Microsoft did wrong for 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  I'm very curious.  Now remember, this is like a digit times rumor.  This is like out of China.  So that Google is going to do a Chrome.  Maybe wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know, we use browsers on our phones and tablets and we use them touch.  So a browser in touch is not incompatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how is you know, we should explain.  And we also mentioned you on Twitter this week because you're the only person.  Yeah, a little bit.  The only person.  Well, we just said this is a real journalist.  The only person we know who would even consider abandoning everything but Google products.  You're not using Windows OS 10.  You're using a Chromebook, the new Samsung Chromebook, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will use I have to use Skype for you guys.  We're going to test Google.  I do use the Chrome browser on my office laptop, but I only live in Chrome.  I won't I won't do any Microsoft applications right now.  So I live within Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And how's that been going for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's been going well.  Today was the first time I flew down to Palm Beach where I am now.  I'm going to show you the hotel room and Lexus Nexus to Lexus Nexus.  That's why I'm in bad hotel lighting.  And that's why I'm so pink.  You're at a four season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't complain.  I don't want to hear any complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Worse Ritz.  I had the first airplane ride and and it is challenging.  You forget that you've got to set up a mail and docs for offline use.  I plan on to be on the plane and use a certain PowerPoint that I was going to present down  here.  I had had it in docs.  It didn't show up in the docs.  My calendar I couldn't go to.  One very irritating thing about about the Chromebook.  And I don't understand architecturally why this happens is that insists on refreshing  web pages all the time.  So even though that's my regular browser, right, I'll just have the mail.  It sits there until I choose to refresh it.  I go to the Chromebook and I got to wait because it's not a very fast thing.  It's got to refresh the mail.  It's got to refresh this.  Refresh that.  Well, when you're on the plane, it'll immediately say you're offline.  You can have this page and then you can try if you want to.  And you do.  And it's in the cache and it gives you the page.  So it's not super smooth.  Here's the big lesson thus far.  I got to write up this post.  But now that I'm the biggest, biggest lesson thus far, I was in my entrepreneurial class.  Our students are giving their dress rehearsals for their final presentations.  I'm making my notes, my credit on Evernote as a Chrome app.  OK, everything's going fine.  We're four hours into this.  Four hours.  Suddenly the browser page for Evernote refreshes on its own.  I don't think it's the browser's fault.  In this case, I think maybe everything's fault.  I don't know.  And all but the first 20 minutes of notes are gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, oh, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not good.  And and the bottom line here is they don't support Chrome OS so it does not store locally.  So lesson for living in cloud.  Only do things that number one store redundantly locally and number two that are in a format  that you can get to otherwise.  So you know, Google Docs you can make into a Word document or whatever the heck you want.  Evernote not so much.  And Evernote tried and they were helpful, but there's nothing they could do.  It was just gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's.  Web 491, Sidney Charham.  Basically you've created a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, true, true.  But you've got to have local storage.  You've got to have local storage.  You've got to have local storage.  Yeah.  You've got to have local storage and local is what makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you're saying that Google hasn't solved this.  The Chromebook has not solved this.  You have to do it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It solves it for its own apps.  It's solved beautifully for for for for for mail.  Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google Docs and all that.  It's fine.  And it stores locally and it keeps going.  And that's fine.  But Evernote, because it does not have a Chrome OS native app, it's just basically a link.  I think that it's an Evernote app.  It's not.  And if you're on Mac or Windows, you can you can download the Chrome, I mean, the the the  Evernote app and then store locally in Evernote format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's funny because I'm so dependent on Evernote to that would that would be a deal breaker  for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is the main thing I miss.  So I saw, you know, I'll make notes in for as long as this experiment goes on.  I'll make them in Google Docs because I'm more conscious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what they want, obviously.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it doesn't have any things like tags that Evernote has.  So that was a huge that was that was the those are the first two real problems I've had.  Otherwise, my problem was that I was going to write this big post about what it's like  to live in the Google world.  And I had nothing to say.  No big deal.  It's just like anything else.  Yeah, it was.  What's the big?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina, is there a mechanism in HTML five for some sort of local storage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is.  There is.  But but Jeff said that Evernote doesn't doesn't support.  But they could.  But it could.  Right.  That's how Docs and Gmail works offline.  So that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not that's not as it used to be an add on.  But in fact, it's just pure HTML five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, but there's something there's something very comforting to me about local storage,  traditional local storage, meaning like that, like my file system that I can browse through,  like Evernote and Dropbox and even, you know, I'm even crazy.  Like I work exclusively just in Gmail and the Web browser.  But every month I am total nerd.  I know.  But I have this calendar reminder that's like download your Gmail.  You know, I'm actually I pop and I'm at my Gmail just because I just like the idea that  I have a copy, a text copy of my email on my hard drive.  So Google went away.  If I was disconnected, I could search through my email.  There's just something comforting about that, even though I know that I can lose my laptop  or get stolen or like the likelihood that my hard drive is going to fry is a lot higher  than Google's.  And yeah, HTML five has local storage.  But there's just I just I like I'm a nerd.  I like redundancy.  I just like the idea that things are sort of propagating across all my devices, you know,  kind of in the traditional in the traditional way, like that.  I Jeff, I feel your pain losing three and a half hours of note taking.  Oh, that just would have that just would have slayed me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it doesn't help when you're my age and you have a bad memory.  You can't you can't recreate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So how did that happen again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was weird.  The the Evernote page just suddenly on its own.  Not not the way what will happen is something's over.  If I go back up here, so I get it right.  If I'm on a different tab and then I go to my Gmail tab at that moment, it decides it  will refresh the page, even though I know there's no mail since I'm just trying to see  something and I have to wait, you know, 10 seconds for to do it.  And I curse.  And that's that's not what happened in this case.  I was on the Evernote page.  I was taking notes and suddenly on its own, it just decided to refresh and disappear.  And when it came back, it came back having lost three hours.  And and then people said in class, they said, go to history.  And I tried and said, no history because I didn't have the premium.  So I immediately paid the premium, hoping it would be there.  But of course, it wasn't there then.  Oh, do you think if you had a premium account, it wouldn't have happened?  I don't know.  The question is, it says that it saves occasionally.  You don't know when it's saving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the problem, too.  Whereas whereas Google Docs is telling you, I've just saved it.  I'll save that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an implementation issue, but it nevertheless it underscores  the hazard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't live in the cloud.  You cannot live fully in the cloud.  You still need a foot on the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think third party apps really have to catch up to Google's level.  I mean, I would actually feel really comfortable using Google apps in the cloud  entirely, right?  Drive and Gmail and Calendar, all that stuff I feel good about.  But I think I think I think third party apps just need to play catch up with that.  The same sort of great level of auto saving and local  HTML 5 storage and syncing, you know, because that's relatively new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think that you're a little old fashioned.  I think in the long run, if this implemented is implemented properly,  you shouldn't ever have to think about a file system or storage or backup.  That's exactly right.  Yeah, that's the point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  An automated storage, you know, redundancy, because people don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know, the part of it is because people don't do the right thing.  You know how to do the right thing, but most people do not.  It's too much trouble.  So the best the best solution is to do it all  kind of automatically, transparently using HTML 5 and whatever technologies you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wasn't around Sunday afternoon to watch the show, which I do try to do.  So who made fun of me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mike Elgin.  Nobody made fun of you.  No, they were just amazed.  And Mike, you know, is a Google plus.  Mike lives in Google.  He's a huge Google plus guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Am I out Mike Delgan?  Pardon me?  You wouldn't.  If I'm out Mike Delgan, if I outdone him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, he I don't think he would use a Chromebook only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's he's all about Google Plus, right?  But he's not quite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not crazy.  He's in Nairobi, Kenya.  Now he is a little crazy.  You know what Mike has done, which is I so admire he's he's decided  I don't need to be any particular place.  So he and his wife went to Greece for a while and now they're in Nairobi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's nothing pulled them there.  Just nothing held them here.  Right.  So they're just traveling around.  I thought I'd missed a chapter of his story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, he just said, you know, well, he said this on Twitter.  He said the kids are growing out of the house.  There's this window before they have grandkids when we'll probably  want to be back in the U.S.  for us just to be travel.  So for the next few years, it's a lot cheaper.  Nairobi's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was a cover of Money magazine, God, you know, 30 years ago, my heroes,  the horse, I remember their name.  And they said it costs money to earn money.  You got to have cars.  That's right.  You live near work and all this kind of stuff.  And they had, I think, the grand sum of five hundred thousand dollars at the time.  And they looked where in the world they could live best on dollars.  And at the time it was Argentina because there was huge inflation in Argentina.  So they could live best.  And they were this whole story.  I was wondering what happened to them.  And they just lived there and they always they traveled around the world  and they lived beautifully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Vicky and Paul Terhorst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no, you found them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, unfortunately, their page is on GeoCities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long ago was this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's gone.  But I did. I found them.  That was their home page.  Cashing in on the American dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it sort of is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very interesting.  Yeah, Vicky and Paul Terhorst.  I don't know if they're still traveling or not.  As of 2009, they were.  I have always wanted to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina, you're not doing it for 20 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm grounded for a for a little bit.  Yeah, as soon as you have kids, you're out of luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, passport.  The.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twenty three years ago, they retired at the age of 35.  They live as of 2007.  They were in Phuket, Thailand.  They are strolling the beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've done OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know. I like living in America.  I do, too.  I like living in California.  I mean, you've got to be crazy to live in California.  We almost have 10 percent state income tax on top of.  I mean, you got to be so expensive to live here.  But I can't imagine living anywhere else.  They live on $50 a day.  I'm sorry, we got to we got distracted.  Meanwhile, Google Ventures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaking of such. Yes.  Cory Booker, mayor of Newark, is this week living on just food stamps  because of a Twitter challenge to him.  I saw that. I love him.  Is he not the greatest?  He's great. He's a great.  During Sandy, my wife made me follow him on Twitter.  He was magnificent. Just magnificent.  Now, full disclosure, as an advisor to his company, Waywire.  So I haven't met him yet.  Well, I guess I did years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cory Booker has a company called Waywire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, Waywire, very interesting company that it believes that video  is going to be the best way to reach news and literacy with young people.  And so that's right.  Company. So you it's it's in beta right now.  And it's actually hashtag Waywire.  Yes. You make wires of videos that you were recommending  and that you can make videos as well and all kinds of things.  So they're just started up, but it's really very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, this is the second company this week I've heard of with the  they're a hashtag. The name starts with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is the new thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you miss the boat because there was a baby named Hashtag this last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. I heard that.  Hashtag Etta.  Hashtag Etta. That might be it.  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hashtags are at this point.  Well, you know, we were talking about Abby and the fact that she  and actually Abby's my daughter and her and her brother, my son, Henry.  Both you.  I made that more complicated than it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I asked how to have a baby.  Then you explain families to my kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Abby and Henry both use Instagram like crazy, like they just discovered it,  like they're posting all the time.  And when Abby posts, she just posted hashtags.  She does very few.  It's even like the comments, like she showed the Christmas tree  and said, nice job, mom.  But she didn't do nice job, mom.  She did hashtag nice job, mom.  Is that the new thing?  Is that what the kids are doing?  It seems like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so get off by lawn about that. Sorry, Abby.  I've seen people do this on Twitter and I'm just like,  oh, just use the hashtags the correct way.  But I still want to file systems.  I'm clearly like old and gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, get ready for this weird synchrony.  Paul and Vicki Terhorst.  Their nephew is one of our chat moderators.  No. Yes.  Can we bowl, please?  CW.  World. That is weird, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Small world.  Nephew, tell them that they're my hero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rich kids on Instagram.  This is something Abby told me about, too.  There's like a whole meme of rich kids.  Oh, is that the pool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like here's me draped across this amazing car.  Yeah, like, oh, let me go get my Porsche.  Oh, we're out on this yacht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But my favorite, have you seen the college humor video  mocking Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I haven't seen it yet.  I've heard it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, I'll take a break.  We come back. It's a parody of a Nickelback song.  And it is it is quite humorous.  So we'll be playing that in a second.  But first, let me talk about the no BS mobile phone service.  Ting the folks at two cows.  I love the two cows.  They say we're going to look for markets that are ripe for fixing.  They fixed the domain registration market with hover.  And now they say, you know, there's really everybody hates their cell carrier.  Right. Everybody hates their cell carrier.  So why don't we do a better job?  And if you want to find out what they're doing, go to twig.ting.  T I N G dot com.  They're an MVO.  And that means they're resale Sprint service.  So if you've got good Sprint service where you are, this is US only, obviously,  you can get the best cell phone service ever with Ting.  No overage charges, no penalties, no bundling, no ride alongs, no contracts,  no early termination fees.  You pay for what you use, no more, no less.  When you sign up for a plan, it's really kind of more like a serving suggestion.  You pick how it's six dollars per phone.  So this is great for a business or a family.  Six dollars a month per phone.  Ten phones, 60 bucks a month. That's your base.  Then you pick how many minutes you want shared,  you know, shared with those phones, how many text messages you want,  how many gigabytes of data you want shared.  It's always shared.  But this is just like, I think I'm going to use this.  I'm going to pay for this because if you use less, they rebate it.  They give you the money back.  If you if you use more, they they just charge you  what they would have charged for the next plan up.  There's never a penalty.  And it always includes tethering free, hotspot free,  caller ID, three way calling, video messaging, picture messaging, voicemail,  all that stuff free.  If I got let me let me just I said,  let's do a family of four, four phones.  I want 2000 minutes. That's a lot.  I want to do let's let's do a thousand text message.  Well, all right. Is Abby and Henry four thousand text messages  and three gigabytes of data.  All of that, 130 bucks a month for the whole family.  Compare that to your phone plan and then visit Ting.  I want you to go to twig.ting.com.  You'll save fifty dollars on your first device.  They have all the big name phones.  It is really a great service.  Here's how it works.  You're going to purchase your mobile device from Ting.  So look at their phones.  You'll receive it in two to five business days.  Then you activate it.  And at that point, you'll select a new number or report your existing number.  Select minutes, messages and megabytes I just showed you.  And again, it's just kind of like your best guess.  Ting will bill you at the beginning of your payment period,  but you'll be charged or credited in the following pay period  based on what you actually used.  You never pay more.  No penalties, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've even got the Galaxy Note 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually, that's less than I paid to get it from Sprint.  And you get the great Ting service, the S3.  They've got all. I mean, this is awesome.  And 50 bucks off when you go twig.ting.com.  I really love these guys, and I think you will, too.  Ting.  Yes, somebody's pointing out that now Facebook is using phone numbers.  You don't have to have a Facebook account on their messaging app.  Boy, I'd be scared if I were a phone company trying to make money on SMS these days.  The new Facebook Messenger will you could do it to a phone.  So you don't even have to pay for messaging.  All right, here you go. CollegeHumor.com.  This is a Nickelback parody.  I wonder if we're going to get an ad here first.  Yeah, just a little bit of an ad. No, here it is.  Listen to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get jealous that I'm at the beach.  Probably knew I was going there.  You saw my plane swing in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Try seeing them in black and white.  Putting glasses on a cat.  I'm the first one to think of that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, he thinks he's people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I take it every one of these pictures, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No fire.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm a singer, my three other penis.  Every fortune, crookie fortune that I've ever seen is all my feet is guaranteed.  With five likes, five likes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of a depressing song because literally, I swear to God,  I've taken every one of those pictures except for the fingernails.  And my daughter does that.  Coffee foam, pretentious tome, garden gnome.  This would be a good game.  You know, like a check, a bingo, Instagram bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right. It's your bucket list.  Yeah. Your Instagram bucket list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A super close-up of my eye.  Now a selfie looking cute in the same room.  Well, we'll go on with that later.  You should watch the rest of it. It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a great parody.  It's pretty good.  Yeah, you know, when I was deciding where I was going to publish pictures of Etta,  I, you know, for a moment, I thought I would like Instagram.  And then I was just like, you know what?  Pictures of her just too important.  I wanted kind of some privacy setting.  You know, I just I don't want to cut them off at a weird aspect ratio and do some weird.  I just, you know.  So you put them on Facebook.  I do Flickr, actually. I decided not against Facebook.  I put them on Flickr, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's kind of charming the old fashioned of you.  Flickr? What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I know. This is crazy. This is the old fashioned.  It's great because only people who are like really looking for them see them,  because really no one goes on Flickr anymore.  Or in my community, not a lot of people go on Flickr anymore of their own accord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's the polaroid of our generation. Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it's very retro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's good because you wouldn't be able to display those pictures  properly on Twitter anymore if you put them on Instagram.  This is a boy.  So interesting.  I don't know how much this has to do with Facebook.  Of course, Instagram was purchased by Facebook.  And Kevin Systrom, the founder of Instagram, has said repeatedly,  we're not going to be Facebook.  Facebook's going to let us be independent.  But today they disabled the ability for Twitter to display Instagram photos on the website.  They basically turned off Twitter card integration.  So remember now, to recap, if you're just joining us,  Twitter has decided that they want everybody to go to the Twitter web page  and they want all the content on the page.  And so they have this Twitter card API  so that somebody like Instagram will actually have the photo in the tweet on the Twitter web page.  But Instagram has decided, no, we're going to turn that off.  We're going to make you click the link and go to our site.  Which makes sense, because, of course, that's where their revenue is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, except I've talked on the show about Repost.us,  about the new...  I mean, you would think these companies be more sophisticated than media companies  at realizing they have to make themselves embeddable.  And that's the model you've got to flow with here.  And instead, they're going to an old media model and say,  no, you have to come to our site.  We're going to show you stupid ads.  And we're going to piss you off as a user.  Where do they think they are?  Wall Street Journal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently, Kevin Systrom, he's talking today at LeWeb in Paris,  confirmed the company has removed the ability to send pictures to Twitter.  Is that true they removed it from the app?  And plans to completely cut off embedding pictures on the Twitter website.  That is a dangerous thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really is.  It is.  And do you think that that was his response at all,  or was this an order from on high?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've decided, quote, we've decided that right now,  what makes sense is to direct our users to the Instagram website, end quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can't even just tweet the...  I understood it that you could tweet the link,  but it just wouldn't show up the card.  They actually removed the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I'm getting from this quote, which doesn't seem quite right.  I knew that Twittergram, the Twitter cards weren't working,  but I haven't gotten an update for Instagram that doesn't have Twitter in it.  Is that what he's implying?  It sounds like that's what he's implying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think all you get in Twitter is a link to the photo on Instagram, right?  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right, right.  That I understand.  But in the Instagram app is the option to tweet that photo removed.  Do you think even that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be a mistake.  That seems crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not going to happen.  That can't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think this is crazy.  There's some...  For developers who feel worried or slighted by the limitations  that Twitter has been putting on its own API,  there's a little bit of schadenfreude here.  Like, oh, well, you know,  Twitter really wants people to integrate their content in Twitter, right?  They want people to set up those Twitter cards.  And now here's Instagram saying, nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nope.  Not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to give Twitter users a worse experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As of right now, Twitter is in there still,  but I didn't get an update to the app yet.  So that must be a misunderstanding.  I'm reading this from The New York Times.  Nick Bilton's writing.  So Nick knows where he speaks.  And this is the quote.  He says, speaking at Low Web, Kevin Systrom,  who's Instagram CEO and founder,  confirmed the company has removed the ability to send pictures to Twitter.  Maybe that means that they're not going to support Twitter  sucking those pictures.  I don't know.  And plans to completely cut off embedding pictures on the Twitter website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the other thing, before we got on the air,  we were in our lovely chat,  which people should come by for because they're very nice chats.  We have a little pre-show tea we do together.  Anyway, as you were saying then, or we were talking about then,  the problem here is that somebody on Twitter said to me,  it wasn't like a media model.  It's not surprising.  Everybody wants to go to their own pages.  Except that again, it's not their content.  It's our content.  So it's very different, isn't it?  When you pull these control maneuvers,  just look at if Instagram is the new Twitter,  it could soon be the new MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder how much of this is in response to Twitter adding filters.  You know, Twitter is adding filters to their app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just noticed that.  I just use the Twitter picture upload and I saw the filters.  I was like, oh, this looks new.  And this looks familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Filters are what made Instagram, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So who's the good guy and the bad guy in all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ha ha.  There are neither one of them.  But who gets screwed?  I know who gets screwed.  Us.  Yep.  So let me see these filters.  All right, I'm going to save that.  Maybe I don't have filters yet.  Because there's the picture.  Maybe they haven't updated.  Are you an Android or iOS?  Maybe it's only an iOS right now.  Yeah.  Which phone are you using, Leo?  This is the Galaxy Note 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you going to try the 4?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I like the Note.  I'm real happy with the Note.  I like a phablet.  Giant phablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it have Samsung stuff on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, a little bit.  I had the unlocked international, but I wanted LTE,  so I just got the Sprint one,  because Sprint's rolling out LTE and Petaluma  before any I use guys.  So for some reason.  So I just traded in for the Sprint one,  but it's otherwise the same.  And there's not a lot of Sprint stuff on it,  and there's not a lot of Samsung stuff on it.  There has to be some,  because it's got to support the S Pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Which I wish I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I like this.  I love this phone.  I really do love this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My problem right now is,  I actually, this is the first time I've done this in life.  I had some stuff from,  decent stuff from conferences and things  that I didn't use that I sold on eBay.  And I made that into my gadget slush fund.  Now you got some money to spend.  But now the gadgets I already have,  and they're so cheap.  I have my Google phone,  I have my Google tablet,  and I have my Google laptop.  What more does a man need in life?  Hey, the Pope's got Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not the response, not oy.  My mom used to say oy ve Maria,  and I was very confused.  I think my mom used to say that too.  Are you Jewish?  Are you Catholic?  What are you talking here?  She was covering the waterfront.  The Vatican announced Monday  that the 85 year old Pontiff,  Pope Benedict XVI,  would begin posting messages on Twitter December 12th.  The Pope's first tweet lands December 12th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  December 12th.  That's the story.  What, it's taken him a week to write his tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's crafting that 140 characters,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he's crafting that 140 characters the next seven days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has to come from God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His handle is not at, you know,  the real Pope.  That'd be funny though.  His handle is at Pontifex,  which is Latin for Pope,  P-O-N-T-I-F-E-X.  You know, you've heard him called the Pontifex.  Pontifex.  I hope his tweets are in Latin.  That'd be cool.  That would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they're actually gonna have them  in like 10 languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if he's such a Pontifex, you can see.  And they made a point of saying they're not infallible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Though of course mine are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  They had to say,  oh, by the way, while he is normally infallible,  the tweets are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  They did, they did.  Well, why aren't the tweets infallible?  I know, if it's coming from the same guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are, what, he's got his infallibility shoes on?  What is going on?  I don't understand.  So he will be accepting questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't be infallible on the internet, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He will be accepting questions with the hashtag  ask Pontifex.  If you could spell it, then you have the right to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you imagine what that hashtag's gonna be like real fast?  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, let's see.  Will Twitter enable editing of a hashtag?  Oh.  Let's look up right now what's under that hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When they asked the Vatican,  why at Pontifex they said all the other names  have been taken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do you spell Pontifex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you gotta know.  If you don't know, you don't get to ask the pope.  P-O-N-T, Pont-I-F-E-X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This ask Pontifex hashtag is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the Illuminati reel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Father Robert Ballester is helping him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it true that if I push down on your hat  and he's forcing your mouth?  Should we search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll clean this up.  No, I won't even read that one.  No, nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope the pope has some cardinal  who's gonna read this stuff  because I don't want him to see it.  He's an older man.  His eyes could be burning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stick the verb fair, arscht in German is something bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's one.  A question about the faith.  Do you think George Michael could have done a better song  if he'd brought Timberland as the producer?  You gotta have faith, faith, faith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who would win a fight between Jesus Christ and Wolverine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is the one thing that Meatloaf won't do for love?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He would do anything for love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He would do anything for love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the right answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is the right answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is the Illuminati reel?  Now that's a good question.  I doubt he'll answer it.  Is there a war on feminism?  You know what?  Who, oh geez.  I won't read that one either.  Yeah, you saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was the topic of discussion earlier with Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just saw the one you won't read  and I think I'm not gonna read the same one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was trying to clean it up and I thought no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there, so far there is only one question for the pope  that is in any way serious that I've seen.  Is it possible to merge the Novus Ordo calendar  of saints and scripture readings  into the Tridentine Mass calendar in my lifetime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some cardinal put that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, his Twitter handle is speramos,  which means we hope in Latin.  So it's obviously a cardinal.  Wow.  This is really asking for trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, poor priest.  You have to go through these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rage hashtag from Newsweek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are the top two or three rules in the Bible  that you would disregard  because they aren't relevant today?  You're asking the wrong guy.  Wow, okay.  And then compare and contrast.  President Obama is using Twitter  to answer questions about the fiscal cliff.  What's the hashtag for that?  You ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My2k, right?  My2k.  My 2,000 bucks, which I'm gonna get screwed out of  if I'm middle class and we go over the cliff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he tweeted today,  I'll answer some cues on that at 2ET.  He's with it.  He speaks the lingo of the streets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  B-O is how he signs everything.  That poor guy, he must have been rough in high school.  Yeah, those unfortunate initials, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, somebody said, they also think that,  I think it was Comedy Central,  so they always think it's the dog writing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let's see, he started, I guess, 2PM Eastern time.  Let's just search for some hashtag My2k.  I bet he's getting even stupider questions than the Pope.  No, actually he's not.  Now this is interesting.  He's getting actually some good stuff.  These are legitimate questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, and they did a behind the scenes videos  of him actually tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we have that too, of the Pope,  not tweeting, but looking at an iPad from several years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the best they could do.  Wow.  You remember that, Obama,  I actually got a direct message from the, whatever,  whoever it is that's doing this. The campaign.  Well, it was saying, help out or something.  I read this, didn't I use your Twitter clout  to help Obama out?  I can't use the new Twitter client.  I don't even know how to get to DMs.  Where are the DMs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to go to me and then under.  Me? Yeah.  Really? Yeah.  Me. Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an envelope underneath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You barely see it to the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that completely, that meaningless icon  with a blue dot, that's the direct messages?  Yeah. Yes.  Geez Louise.  I don't read them because they may be,  yeah, use your Twitter influence to help turn out the vote.  But he didn't ask me anything to help him  with the fiscal cliff, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So was that from Tech from Obama  or was that from Barack Obama?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From at Barack Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's the campaign, right?  Yeah. But what is it now?  The campaign's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The campaign never ends, Leo.  No, no, you can't, it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't run again.  I know. I know that.  It's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's the president.  We got remedial twig this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Okay, okay, okay, okay.  Enough Twitter, we're gonna move on.  According to the San Francisco Chronicle,  Google is gunning for Amazon.  And you know who's gunning for Google?  Could be the feds.  We're waiting to hear antitrust action against Google.  It's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Liebowitz, our head of the FTC has been meeting  with EU people and trying to figure it out.  The word is, I think we've been mentioning this last week  very briefly, the word is that the FTC kind of can't  figure out how to make a case.  They're huddling.  That won't stop the EU, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're huddling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And-  And Eric Schmidt is basically saying,  I wish they'd make up their mind and do something.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know what he wishes they would do.  Oh yeah.  Go to stamps.com so they don't have to go  to the post office.  That's what he wishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To file those huge documents against me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're mailing a lot of depositions,  court documents, you know, printed emails,  you don't want to go to the post office with those case,  you know, all those banker boxes.  That's just, that's just trouble because there's lots  of people there with their Christmas card list  and the lines are long, the parking's tough.  This is why you use stamps.com.  I bet you Google's lawyers use stamps.com  because with stamps.com you can print your own legal  US postage right from your computer and printer.  You never have to go to the post office.  You get the USB scale so you always know.  And by the, you know, the exact postage.  And by the way, you can print right on the envelopes  for letters and that's great.  It'll take the address book information or QuickBooks.  If you're an Amazon or eBay or Etsy or PayPal seller  or that kind of thing, it takes it right from the webpage.  So it prints it right on the envelope or the packing label.  If you get discounts for priority mail and express mail,  you can't even get at the post office.  And if you're sending with one of these certified mail  systems, it will send an email to your recipient saying  that it's on its way, here's the tracking information.  This is, this is efficient.  This is, this is mail for pros.  If you're, if you're a email professional  or a mail professional, snail mail professional,  if you do a lot of this and you want to do it better,  stamps.com.  Now, when you go to stamps.com,  you're probably going to be tempted right from the beginning  because in the front page it says $80, no risk trial,  but don't, I could do better.  If you click the radio microphone,  it's in the upper right-hand corner there,  where it says, welcome, get started  and enter in the offer code TWIG, T-W-I-G,  $110 bonus value, $55 in postage coupons  to use over the first few months of your stamps account.  You get the digital scales free,  you just pay shipping and handling, it's five bucks.  They make, now, by the way, it's not that digital scale,  they got a nice new one.  They got a brushed aluminum digital scale.  You also get a $5 supply kit and a four week trial.  So go to stamps.com, click the radio microphone,  use our offer code TWIG and become a mailing professional.  This is my pro tip.  For people who do mailing, stamps.com.  You will never go to the post office again,  you will love it, I promise.  And you know what, it's no risk, just try it.  So as you said, the top US and European anti,  there's lots of stuff going on.  This week, they're meeting in Europe.  In Dubai, the International Telecommunications Union  is meeting behind closed doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And already the US and Canada tried to limit  the definition of what they were gonna talk about  to telephone companies.  Good.  And nope, they failed.  And so that means that the likes of Google and Facebook  could, in the ITU's view, be under the ITU's purview.  How's that for sweet?  This is really scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very scary.  So how do we know what's going on?  Are there reporters inside or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but I think the US came out,  US is trying to reveal what they're trying to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the best way to follow what's going on with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I don't know who's doing good reporting on it per se.  I mean, it's kind of all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is Corey Doctorow talking about it?  Cause I know he's, he pays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think Vince, is Vince Cerf there?  Or he's been, he's been.  Well, he's been lobbying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cause he, on behalf of Google, he's a Google fellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Andy Carvin like embedded there or something.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  So there's two things going on.  There's one that is, might be a little bit of a red herring,  which is this petition by Russia and others  to have the United Nations regulate the internet.  Bad idea, obviously.  But apparently the bigger concern is that telecoms,  particularly European telecoms, want to establish,  basically you pay for the internet  the way you pay for telephone service.  They want Google, Facebook, Twitter to pay,  not only for our access to the internet,  but to pay for access to the users on the internet.  Double dip in effect.  Right.  So AT&T would say, oh, well, Leo, yes,  I could see you're putting stuff on the internet,  but if you would like it to reach our customers,  you should give us some money too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which has been going on for ages.  It goes back to the day.  I know that, what's his name?  Milo Medin, I think.  Yeah, love Milo.  Milo's great.  He was at, and he's now in charge  of the Kansas City Google effort.  Yep.  But I remember back in the days when Milo was at-  Is that at home?  Or excite?  Excite, right.  Whatever the, right.  And they were talking about that model back then.  And saying that, well, if you want really good access,  you could come right to our servers,  right to our head end,  but we're gonna charge you for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I understand if you're a business,  that makes sense to you.  It's a toll road.  But that's the interest of those businesses.  It's not the interest of us as the users of internet  for free and open internet.  And it's not that they're not getting paid, believe me.  They're getting paid.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's that they wanna charge twice, basically.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what to, I mean,  is this even a possibility that this could happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think what the problem is,  we're gonna put up the cat signal again and again and again,  and you know, cry wolf,  mix my metaphors of animals here.  But yeah, at some point, one thing is not gonna happen.  And so people will say,  ah, you see, you just call it cried wolf.  But it's an indication of a constant gnawing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're gonna always push for it.  And I just.  Exactly.  And because this is behind closed doors,  we don't really know what the reaction,  the ITU could be laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  We don't know.  What I don't know is what they're,  what I haven't seen is a story that explains,  you know, I get what various parties want to do.  What power does the ITU have to actually do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I don't know is,  what's in the realm of the possible  with what they could actually pull off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, cause we did have this conversation.  I think we also had this conversation on Twitter  and everybody agreed the ITU has no authority  or jurisdiction in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if that were, if nobody were scared,  then you wouldn't have Google wasting political capital  trying to complain about them.  And that's not the case, they are.  And the United States government is saying,  watch out folks.  And the European commission passed a resolution  against all this effort.  So you put all that together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really a treaty.  What it is, is a treaty conference of 150 nations  on how telecom is regulated internationally.  And because it's telecom,  the problem is these rules are written in 88 pre-internet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So,  and in theory, they regulate,  the ITU was formed to regulate telegraph transmissions  in the 1880s.  But in theory, telecom could extend to the internet.  So there's all these different stakeholders.  There's Russia that wants more control over the internet  and the internet content.  There's the telecoms that wanna make more money  on the internet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are various governments that wanna censor  what's on the internet.  There are-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's security issues too.  The American and Canadian delegations  are very interested in protecting against cyber terrorism.  Yes.  Although you could argue that we are the number one exporter  of cyber terrorism in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the larger, I'll take it too far,  which is what I do for a living.  But the larger thing that's happening here  is that the internet disrupts governments.  It disrupts every institution and that includes governments  in all kinds of ways.  And they're gonna defend themselves.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Reuters article that you linked to quotes  ITU Secretary General Hamadou Ntouré saying that  any major changes to the 1988 treaty  would be adopted only with consensus approaching unanimity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's been supposed to,  but then, but again, yes, that's true in that form.  But are there other agreements these people can come to  in terms of how they operate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe they'll agree on one thing or something, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will you find five or six countries get together  and say, yeah, well, I'll pass that law.  You pass that law too.  Yeah, but then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's the other thing,  and this is the treaty process.  So there does has to be ratified,  but it does not have to be ratified necessarily by Congress.  Right.  It could be signed, I gather,  I don't understand international treaty law,  but I gather that in some cases  the president can unilaterally just sign it.  Yes, but I don't-  But I don't know if this is one of those cases.  Danger, danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Danger, stranger danger.  Meanwhile, my friends in Germany, Christoph Käse,  who is the head of policy at Axel Springer,  a big publisher there,  and they're the ones who've been pushing this whole  fair pixel-os-rect cue the reggae,  said today in an interview, it's on German,  it's in German on the site there,  but I just found it amazing  that he likened Google to the Taliban.  What?  This is like a Godwin law brought to Germany  where they can't exactly make the Hitler reference,  so what are they gonna pick that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Taliban?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Taliban.  Now, the great irony of that,  I tweeted back to Käse-  It's time.  And said that if anybody is resistant to change,  which is what he's saying, it's perhaps you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, all right, well, we'll see what happens there.  I was just trying to play the,  what is it, Leitungs-Schutz-Rekt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leitungs-Schutz-Rekt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leit- Leit-  Leit- Leitungs-Schutz-Rekt.  It's a little German lesson in reggae.  I gotta play this every show from now on.  Ha ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's take a break and talk more with Jeff Geena  on This Week in Google.  I think we should just always have reggae music  for all our ads.  Yeah.  The Leitungs-Schutz-Rekt.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Leitungs-Schutz-Rekt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pfft.  I wish we had a sponsor named Leitungs-Schutz-Rekt.  The Leitungs-Schutz-Rekt.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't though.  We do have one called Squarespace.  If you are ready for a new website,  if you have decided the time has come to put your flag,  to place your flag in the sand of the internet  and say, I am here, I exist,  then Squarespace is everything you need.  It's the hosting, it's the software,  it's the incredible uptime, the amazing price.  Squarespace is fantastic.  We love it.  And by the way, it's modern in the sense that for instance,  and this is, we spent, I don't know how many,  actually I do know, I'm just, I'm erasing it from my mind  how much we spent on our Twit website.  And then after we had it all done, they came to us and said,  oh, and you want a mobile site?  That'll be $7,000.  So we said, well yeah, you have to have a mobile site.  Well, little did we know, you don't anymore.  This is something called mobile responsive design.  Your website should look the same.  It should work on all platforms, right?  You shouldn't have a separate site  for people coming from mobile.  That's so 1990s.  So what they do on Squarespace,  and all their templates do this automatically,  all their software does this automatically is  they rearrange, resize, repurpose to make sure  that your site looks great on everything  from a three and a half inch iPhone 3GS  to a 27 inch Dell XPS One and everywhere in between.  Every image processed into seven different sizes  so that there's always just the right image for that device.  The templates you use, and by the way,  you completely control how they look,  which means they reflect well on you.  This is important for artists, photographers,  anybody wants to, let's say, do a portfolio online  or show off their style online,  you get these great templates,  but then you completely customize them  to match your aesthetic.  And they still all are mobile responsive.  Drag and drop functionality, however,  if you are a pro, they also support HTML5, CSS, JavaScript.  They've got a very nice developer platform  that gives you complete code controls,  syntax, coloring, and all that stuff.  There's a new page builder tool called the Layout Engine  that enables you to customize pages by adding blocks of content  like photos, videos, text, social media, Google Maps,  LinkedIn, Facebook, Pinterest.  So it's so great to set up this site.  You can import all your existing content  from your existing site and export it out  so you're never trapped.  I just think, and then, and then, the price is right too.  So here's the deal.  And I always admire, and I think all our sponsors do this,  the idea that they'll give you a free trial  because they believe in what they're doing.  So much, they know, hey, just try it.  No cost to you.  You don't even need to give them any information.  You don't, no credit card or anything,  just an email address, a name of the site, a password,  and you're done.  And you can have it for 14 days, 24-7 support,  the run of the place, if you decide to buy.  If you say after two weeks, yeah, I'm liking what I'm seeing.  The price is right. Amazing.  The basic plan is $8 a month,  but I suggest that when you buy an annual plan,  I suggest the unlimited plan.  $20 a month, although if you pay for the year,  it's only $16 a month,  and I'll tell you how you can save more in a second.  You get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries.  Now imagine you're a photographer.  You want a different gallery for each client,  for instance, no problem.  What if one of the clients happens to be one direction  and it gets tweeted and it blows up?  No problem. Unlimited bandwidth, that's fine.  It's part of the deal. $16 a month.  You got lots and lots of images, no problem.  You have unlimited storage.  Unlimited storage.  You want other people,  maybe you want to do a newspaper site, unlimited contributors.  When you buy an annual plan,  they'll get you the custom domain name and hook it up  so that it goes to my new newspaper.com or whatever it is.  They've got some very nice tools  for integrating to Google apps  and MailChimp, things like that, Chimp.  I think Squarespace is amazing.  I want you to try it free.  It's no obligation.  The only thing I would ask, if you decide to buy,  save 10% by using our offer code TWIG12,  T-W-I-G-1-2, and that way we get credit for it.  Squarespace.com, the secret behind amazing sites  like maybe yours, right?  Has somebody created jeffjarvisrostaman.squarespace.com?  I saw it in the chat room, I wonder.  Maybe it's just a thought.  But that's the beauty of these two-week sites.  I asked Squarespace,  actually Brian Brush would ask Squarespace  because they're always on NSFW saying,  hey, create a site for this.  They said, do you mind that we're doing that?  Getting all these people to create two-week free sites?  No, we love it.  The more people use Squarespace, the happier we are.  So somebody should go there  and create jeffjarvisrostaman.squarespace.com.  Squarespace is so interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They took a lot of the staff of Daylife.  Did they? I didn't know that.  Yeah, they did.  From what I understand,  they have a really neat kind of business model  where they want scale and they want to grow.  So the more people who discover them  in more ways, the better off they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  That's exact opposite, isn't it,  of these people saying, oh no, you've got to come to ours.  No, no, we don't want to share it.  No, no, no.  It's a different mindset.  It's open versus closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a media versus, I wrote a post last week  in which I argued that we keep on looking at media  as if it's content,  when we should look at it as if it's service.  Content is that which fills something.  Service is that which does something.  I like that.  How's that for a bumper sticker for the day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if the something that you do is put out content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but you're not content.  You keep picking your content.  I'm content, damn it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What am I?  You're our group hug.  No, we're, no, we are, I'll tell you, we're a service.  We keep lonely nerds company throughout the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nerdsitters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're nerdsitters.  If you're worried about leaving your nerd at home alone,  don't worry, just put them in front of the computer  or the TV and have twit.tv on,  and they'll feel right at home.  They'll never even miss you.  You'll come back, they'll look up, say, did you leave?  Oh, and they'll go back.  We're the nerdsitters.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you are the Barney for nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So apparently the House took a vote  just in case you were wondering.  The US House has now voted 397 to nothing  to keep the internet out of UN hands.  There's a nonpartisan item they can all agree on.  397 to nothing.  It was a Senate resolution introduced  by Claire McCaskill and Marco Rubio.  Well, good, I'm glad we know.  The House doesn't like it.  Don't they have something more important going on right now?  Seem to just remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they have the fiction of the physical cliff.  That's just so far.  Oh, it's a fiction?  Oh, good, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Made up.  I feel better now.  You mentioned Eric Schmidt saying  I wish they would just make up their mind  whether they're gonna sue us.  Well, that's Apple he's talking about, not the government.  Oh, well, both.  Both, actually, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's flaunting Apple.  He's saying he doesn't understand  why Apple sued their partners and not them.  That's a red flag to the bull, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, maybe he would like them to turn away from their,  Motorola and HTC and Samsung.  You know, it's the-  Come on, come on.  It's that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  What is that?  He's doing the crane and he's going.  I shouldn't have eaten that whole salami  right before the show.  That was a mistake.  How big is an antitrust lawsuit right now,  asked the Wall Street Journal of Mr. Eric Schmidt Happens.  I don't know, says Eric.  We've been in quite continuous communications  with both the Europeans and the Federal Trade Commission.  It's time for them to sort of move  to one resolution or another.  It's not like they don't have a million documents  and so forth.  I remain optimistic.  He, of course, at the In All Things Deconference  said that Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook  were the gang of four companies  that matter most in technology.  They asked, do you still see it that way?  He says, yes.  He says, Eric says, we've never in our industry  seen four network platforms of that scale.  We've seen IBM, we've seen Microsoft,  but now we have four and the resultant competition  is a huge change in the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I loved.  Which is all the reason why you shouldn't be  going after antitrust  because we have all these new platforms,  but you were saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I loved was his assessment  of the Google, Apple rivalry.  And I think it is really right on  and kind of a little bit of a lesson to the tech press.  He says, the press would like to write  a sort of teenage model of competition,  which is I have a gun, you have a gun, who shirts first?  No, that's how teenagers do it,  but the adult way to run a business,  and this actually sounds like exactly what's going on,  is to run it more like a country.  They have disputes, yet they've actually been able  to have huge trade with each other.  They're not sending bombs at each other.  He says, I think both Tim Cook and Larry Page  have an understanding of this model of business  as states, and when they and their teams meet,  they just have a long list of things to talk about.  They negotiate, they work it out.  It's not a war.  So I think that actually makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does make a lot of sense.  I think that's a good way to explain it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that was also negotiation in and of itself.  What, does saying that?  That's him making a statement of negotiation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because maybe Apple is acting like a teenager,  but he's wanting them to act like an adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, he's opening the door  and giving the credit before, perhaps it's due,  and they can live up to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like this also.  They asked, what's the end game  of all this patent litigation?  He says, you know what, it's gonna go on.  Google's gonna do fine, Apple's gonna do fine.  Let me tell you who the loser is here.  There's a young Andy Rubin, the guy who started Android,  trying to form a new version of, let's say, Danger,  which is Rubin's company that he started before Android.  How is he or she gonna be able to get  the patent coverage necessary  to offer version one of their product?  So the real consequence of this  is a complete loss of innovation  because no one's gonna be able to invent anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google and Apple are gonna do fine.  Right, so it's not about big companies  that have to spend money.  It's about young companies  that won't be able to build something interesting, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've been saying that all along, he's absolutely right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So do you think, what's your betting now?  Eric's denying, but you always deny.  Rumors are out again for him and Treasury Secretary.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.  If I were him, I wouldn't take it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but I could see him doing it.  He spends a lot of time in Washington.  I think he's a little enamored of the Beltway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Enamored of and disgusted with at the same time, I think.  Yeah.  So the question is, does he have the hubris  to think that he could actually improve it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't become CEO of Google  unless you have some hubris stuck away in your hip flask.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says, they asked him, I'm glad they did,  well, are you gonna do a wireless network?  Because of course, we talked about this,  the rumor of Google and Dish may be joining together  to do a wireless network.  Schmidt said, I'm sure we'll discuss this,  but at the moment, we're busy working on wireline  in Kansas City, the gigabit ethernet.  He says, the current spectrum shortage is real,  but it's an artifact of a licensing and regulatory error.  New technology allows there to be lots of spectrum,  far more than you could use,  but the regulators are preventing that, I guess.  So he doesn't deny that Dish and Google might do something,  but he says, we're more focused on wireline right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope, I hope.  I know, everybody hopes,  but I think it's the hope that's speaking,  not the actual facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, it's the same with Kansas City.  I want Google services, because I am Google man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, we now know.  I live in the Google world.  Google man.  So Google man, what do you think of the daily dying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so I wrote about that for The Guardian.  I think that it was the result of a few things.  One was, yes, a paywall.  I did the numbers as best I could when it launched,  and I figured that they would need a million subs  to break even on their operating costs.  They supposedly spent $30 million developing it.  I don't understand how.  They had a $500,000 a week run rate at the beginning.  So on that basis, I did some calculations of churn  and the percentage to Apple and all that.  So I said, they just said a million.  Murdoch at the time said they were gonna sell millions.  They sold 100,000.  Not even close.  Not even close.  So that's number one problem.  Number two problem was that it was daily.  How stupid is that?  News doesn't have to be daily anymore.  It's ridiculous.  It's all the time.  It's the number three problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not saying it should be weekly.  You're saying it's 24-7.  It's constant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then the third problem is that though it expanded  past the iPad to iPhones and to Android,  but only if you were on Verizon,  it was this ridiculous thing I see happening  in media business.  We have to have a mobile strategy.  No, you don't.  You have to have a relationship strategy with people  and you serve them well wherever they are,  whatever they're doing.  And if you change that a bit  because they're using a different device, fine.  But this idea that we're gonna do something different  for the iPad is insane.  And I hope it's a lesson that publishers have learned.  So Murdoch treated the paywall as religious zealotry  and there's no God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  John Gruber also said it was just crapily implemented.  It took too long to download.  It was slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was decent looking,  but the problem was that the content was a commodity.  It was news.  There's plenty of news.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing special about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And perhaps it was insufficiently targeted.  It was too generic.  Yeah.  That's how we differentiate by targeting,  by serving a specific niche.  If you're serving the USA Today niche,  that's not much of a niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Larry Kramer, who is the publisher of USA Today  and quite experienced, he started Market Watch  and all kinds of big stuff.  Larry said last week that he cannot,  he was butchering grammar,  but we'll give it to him here because he made a good point.  He said that he could not charge for USA Today online  because it's not unique enough.  Uh-huh.  Exactly.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, that's pretty insightful of Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's Larry, Larry's sport guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jason Kaki did a post on his site,  Trend Alert, about small internet publications  like the magazine and the all just started,  just released Weekend Companion,  which is basically like the other thing in my newsstand.  I'm subscribed to the magazine.  I'm subscribed to Weekend Companion,  which is like a few bucks a month or so.  And I mean, it's interesting.  I mean, I think it is working for some people.  You know, you have these kind of targeted sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How's Marco doing with the magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently really well.  I mean, he just hired an executive editor.  He raised writer's rates  and he's doing more issue, more stories per issue.  So I think that the revenue,  you know, greatly exceeded his expectations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it has many of the flaws The Daily did.  It's a walled garden.  It's iPad only.  It's a newsstand app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a newsstand app, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the other hand, it's not heavy.  It downloads quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Downloads very quickly.  And there's no images. It's not expensive.  It's not a lot of flash.  It's just basically text and links.  But it's done really well.  But you know, Marco has a pretty big audience  of people who love to read long form, stripped down content.  He created Instapaper.  Yeah.  Right, so he had that.  And theall.com, like I don't have time  to read it during the week, honestly,  but I know there's some great writing going on there.  So I subscribed to their iPad app.  It was just Weekend Companion.  And it's like, oh, this is worth it to me.  And I get to see kind of the best articles  from this website that I may have missed during the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But how many of those would you subscribe to?  I guess, actually, that's...  Well, I don't know.  You subscribed to many magazines, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, right, as many magazines  as I'd subscribe to if it were 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what is theall, A-W-L,  besides a thing that punches hole in leather?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a website started by Corey Sika,  formerly of Gawker.  It's kind of, there's a,  it's the sister site to the Wirecutter,  which I'm sure you've heard of.  There's a few, there's the Hairpin, the Wirecutter,  the All, you get them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are all tools for making stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yeah. I love Wirecutter.  This is Brian Lamb's site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site,  lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site,  lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site,  lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site,  jean. Jean is jealous.  She was reggae.  Lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site,  lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If somebody would just put that to a reggae beat,  what the hell's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This happened on, all about Android.  She's okay.  Yeah, Jeana doesn't, I think she's lost all hearing.  Jeana, if you could just plug and unplug your USB,  for us, we're getting like a dubstep remix of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site,  lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site, lamb's site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you can just unplug and re, oh, yeah, that,  I don't know if that's gonna fix it.  That was really unplugging it.  Yeah, I don't know if that's gonna,  she may not be able to hear us now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's take a, well no, she's offline, isn't,  oh no, she's still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, I mean before, when I was talking to her,  her interface may have died.  Let's play a little reggae while we're waiting for the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Lightstone's Schutzracht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Coming up a little later on, Harper Reed,  who is not a werewolf, actually he was President Obama's CTO  in the 2012 election, or a CTO of Threadless.  He helped design and test Narwhal.  Which was the get out the vote application,  many credit, at least partially credit of Obama's religion.  The Lightstone's Schutzracht.  The Lightstone's Schutzracht.  Where's a bong when I need one?  I think there's some blunts in the lower left hand.  There might be.  No.  Tell us, after all.  Thank you, Hannes Schliech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a feeling she rebooted because she left chat  and is offline now.  She's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, I do like the wire cutter.  I've used it a couple times.  The whole idea of the wire cutter is like the best,  so, and it's like in a lot of categories.  So like what's the best water bottle?  What's the best small TV?  What's the best SD card?  And Brian Lamb, who was founder,  or at least editor at Gizmodo,  as far as I know, at least initially this was him alone,  I think it looks like maybe there's others doing it now.  But it's a great idea because I think people just wanna say,  what's the best?  I don't need all the reviews.  There's different approaches to this.  Like Gadget has like, well they aggregate every review  and then they have user reviews and then they make a score.  This is just like, no, no, you don't need all that.  Just buy the MacBook here.  Or the MacBook Pro right now.  And actually, I've gone through this and in most cases,  I think they're absolutely right.  The best big screen TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's okay.  I was just going through the wire cutter.  Cause I love it.  Panasonic ST50.  I actually have a VT50 and I rave about it.  I think actually the GT50 is the best.  No, no, the ST50 is the flagship.  So everybody agrees.  This is the best big screen TV.  So it's stuff like that.  I think it's just great.  You know, what's the best iPhone 5 case?  What's the best wifi hotspot?  What's the best sports camera?  So that's the wire cutter.  And then the hairpin, what is that for?  Is that for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a women's site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I don't want that.  I'm afraid that'll rub off.  Cooties, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cooties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then split insider, split cider.  Is that comedy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a new one on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Split cider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it must be comedy.  Yeah, it's comedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the billfold.  The billfold, is that about money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, cool.  So this is like a network, a blog network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a blog network.  But with some real interesting style.  Yeah, everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cory Cica is a guy with a lot of style.  I like it.  His attitude, he's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's no gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Cory does gossip on the all, on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the all is a bit gossipy.  I don't know, I imagine the all to be  a slightly more evolved gawker.  For what that's worth.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what you want a gawker to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because Cory started a gawker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cory was actually my mentor when I started Lifehacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  15 of our favorite things said on reality TV.  Oh, actually that's an ad.  The best off.  Oh, so some of this is from other stories.  Famous people who were or plan to be in other Hobbit movies.  That's my kind of gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the Weekend Companion is this iPad app  that 29th Street Publishing,  which is David Jacobs' company built.  They have this framework for making iPad newsstand apps  and they license it out to the all.  They also license it out to another company  for this sort of like iPad magazine app.  And it's actually, it's really nicely done.  And it's similar to the magazine,  it costs a little more.  I think it's like four bucks a month or something.  Slightly different approach.  Like the magazine, you get all the back issues for free.  With the Weekend Companion,  you have to pay it to two bucks to read a back issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so funny,  because this is such a forward thinking hipster kind of website.  This seems like such an old model.  It seems like they're gonna,  I want to be the New Yorker.  Right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's what Nick Denton always said to me.  He wanted to be Cy Newhouse.  He went when Cy had 17 magazines, he wanted 17 blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But making them an iPad app,  and basically effectively a walled garden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not a fan of it.  I really, I mean, I love the site.  What is the advantage, Gina, from you as a user,  what is the advantage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, Corey said when he introduced it,  is like, you know, you want to be able to kind of curl up  with a long form article and read it, you know,  not on your computer screen  when you're sitting at your desk at work,  but you know, it's the weekend  and you're flipping through the paper kind of thing.  So it's just kind of a more relaxed,  different reading experience,  particularly for long form content, right?  This is why I send stuff to Instapaper.  This is why I really enjoy  the New York Times iPad app, for example.  I like reading long form stuff on my iPad.  It's a different reading experience.  It's more relaxing.  It's a touchscreen thing.  It's in my hands.  It has that kind of old school, you know,  reading the paper kind of feeling to it.  And for me, it's like, you know,  the all probably publishes, you know, dozens of posts a day.  And I want just the best stuff from the week  in a very readable format.  And that's similar to the magazine.  It's like, you know, just good long stories  that may be published on blogs later  or may have been published on blogs,  but curated and edited.  And I know it's kind of old school, right?  It's very old school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm too ADD.  I want to be able to flip around.  I don't want to live in one thing.  So it's just not for me.  That's all.  Yeah, I agree.  You know what we forgot?  Yes, we did.  Let's play some trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, each week,  Gina Trippani tells us what's new with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Big launch this week.  Gmail for iOS got a huge update.  Have you gotten this Leo?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  While back.  So it's very sparrow-esque.  The update got multiple account support  for those of us with multiple Google accounts.  This is again, Gmail for iOS.  You get an infinitely scrolling inbox.  You don't have to tap load more messages,  which is annoying when you go down.  Search predictions as you type,  very clean white redesign,  and interactive replies to Google Calendar  and Google Plus email notifications  right from your inbox.  So really nice update.  In fact, The Verge did a kind of hands-on with it.  And they said, you know, it's a little stuttery.  It's a lot better than it was.  A little stuttery.  Could use a little work,  but I have to tell you, I really enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When are they going to put it on Android?  That's bizarre to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like Gmail got a recent update on Android.  I think it was just a minor.  I think it was just a minor bug fixy type thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it has all those features and I just didn't notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I've always thought that Gmail on Android  is so much better experience than on iOS.  Yeah, I think it is.  Makes sense, right?  YouTube for iOS also got updated with iPad support,  iPhone 5 support, AirPlay, and performance improvements.  So you can stream videos with AirPlay to your Apple TV  through the YouTube app on iOS.  Nice.  Google Now for Android got an update,  brings boarding passes and song IDs.  So when you're traveling this holiday season,  this is actually straight from the Google Android blog.  Before you leave your house,  Google Now will tell you what the weather will be like  at your destination.  This is when you've got a flight planned.  Just in time to make sure you remember to pack those mittens.  At the airport, your boarding pass will automatically  get pulled up, helping you breeze through the gate.  And this is launching shortly for United Airlines only  with more airlines to come.  And once you've flown and arrived at your destination,  Google Now will help you uncover great activities,  showing you events happening around you.  This is all similar to what it does now,  suggesting websites for you to explore  as you research things to do.  And Google Voice Search now just got,  what's the song, right?  So you guys have seen on Android,  there's that widget now, the what's the song widget.  So if you're listening to a song,  you can just tap it and it'll identify the song.  You can do that in Google Voice Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like Shazam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shazam, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if I do a voice search and I just play a song into it,  it should know the song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  It'll tell you what the song is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Try the lightstone, it should select a song on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, should I go ahead and play the, do you have that?  No, no, no, no, no.  No, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be funny if it found it?  So I don't need the widget anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, no, I don't need Shazam anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Research, yeah.  What's the song?  The Android 4.1 Jelly Bean update is now going out  to AT&T Samsung Galaxy S3 users.  I believe this is over the air.  I don't have one of these, so I couldn't confirm,  but someone on Twitter told me  that it's going out over the air.  So that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I gave mine to Baratunde, so I can't tell either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, is that good?  That's a good gift.  Yeah.  So it's AT&T Mobile and now AT&T all are getting  that update over the air to the Galaxy S3,  still waiting on Verizon, not though on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jelly Bean's awesome, get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the new jelly.  It is, it is.  New flavor of Jelly Bean.  New flavor.  And finally, this is kind of developer specific,  but I thought this was kind of interesting.  Google Play comes to Google Apps.  So Google Apps for your domain,  that's kind of the old name, but I still use it  because it's the only way to kind of help understand.  When you set up your Google Apps behind a certain domain,  you get certain services, Gmail, Docs, Drive,  Drive, Calendar, et cetera.  Now organizations who use Google Apps  can set up a private channel in the Google Play Store  and distribute apps internally  within their organization, right?  So if you work at a company  and there's an internal company-wide,  internal company Android app,  you can upload that app to this private channel  on the Google Play Store and distribute it just to your users,  which is pretty neat.  So this is Google Apps for business, education,  and government domains,  can have a private channel on the Google Play Store.  Administrators allow users, must be on the same domain,  to register with the Android Developer Console,  who can turn published Android apps to the private channel.  This is really neat.  It was neat to me as a developer.  I thought it was interesting just from the Android point of view.  Right now to test iOS apps or to do kind of internal iOS apps  that are just for a certain number of people,  it's a huge pain in the butt.  So I really like the idea that organizations or companies  or whatever would be making kind of...  So if you imagine if you have a conference or a university  that there would be apps specific to that organization,  you can distribute them through the Play Store  without making them public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Neat. That's really cool.  Yeah, I thought so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're going to have to make an intro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The change log.  Sorry, I didn't interrupt you.  Chad did, but I went along with it.  What were you saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say we're going to have to make a Twig host app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. We could do that.  I don't know what we'd put in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Japanie.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shush like and fuck and fuck and touch and touch and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can give you regular host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see, we've got time for our tip, number and tool of the week,  and then we're going to get over to triangulation  and Harper Reed, Gina Trippani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so a little tip this week. This is a new one on me.  Google operating system published this one.  If you've enabled that experiment in Google search results  that includes your Gmail and in your search results,  if you type the words, my flights into Google, no quotes,  you'll get flight tracking information for the flights  that you have booked based on your Gmail messages, right?  And it'll even show reminders like, hey, your flight's taking off  a little late later on in that same notification  that somebody's birthday on Google+.  Yeah, so this is Google integrating all of our stuff  and trying to figure out exactly what we're looking for.  So yeah, just type, before you fly this holiday season,  I actually don't have any flights booked  because the baby's just too little to fly.  But if you have flights booked to travel for the holidays,  just type my flights into Google  and you'll be able to get information about where they're going  and whether or not they're on time right from the search box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess I don't have any flights planned.  I don't have anything in here.  Trippet does that.  I have Trippet scanning through my Gmail for upcoming travel.  But that, you know, is that...  Is that going to freak people out?  Is that what you're worried about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it freaks me out, the Trippet thing.  Even though I think it's a great feature,  but do I really want to open up all my email to anybody else?  Oh, I do it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I...  There was an extension that connected to your Gmail account  and scanned all your messages for names and addresses  and phone numbers and would automatically populate your contacts.  You just cut the idea and I forgot the name of it.  My apologies to the developer.  I just, I can't bring myself to allow...  No, that's the same problem I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just did something, actually, it could be my tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, go ahead.  I know what you mean.  I guess I just, I don't know.  Google's already reading my email, so fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tell me about my flights, thank you.  Yeah.  Already has my Gmail, exactly.  So it's like, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There anyway.  I have no illusion that email is private, but, you know,  I guess, I don't know, maybe I'm just trying to fool myself.  I'll show you something that I just did that's exactly that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But first, Jeff, with the tip of the...  The number of the week.  All right, so I could be mentioning

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that 44 libraries in California now have free use of Chromebooks  for their users, but I won't.  I don't know.  So what I will mention is, what I think is very cool,  is that Google has announced a $23 million set of grants  under Global Impact Awards to bring more technology innovation  to non-profits.  And among the seven winners is Charity Water,  consortium for the bar code of life, Donors Choose,  which is a charity I like a lot, where teachers are able  to get a free free free free free free free free free free free  free free free free free free free free free free free free free  teachers can get people to to give money for things they want  to do, Equal Opportunity Schools, Give Directly,  World Wildlife Fund, and I didn't know this even existed,  the Gina Davis Institute on Gender and Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, she's really into it.  Yeah.  Good for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's kind of cool.  That's a good list.  $23 million bucks went to these various places.  And I thought, you know, good for you, Google.  I wrote a piece for my blog, actually, to start off with.  Maybe it turned into a not bad in this tax fight that's going  on in the UK over Google, Facebook and Google, Starbucks  and Amazon.  They're almost saying, well, you should just give more money,  even though what you do is legal, it's immoral.  And Christian Freeland from Reuters had a piece this week  about from her book about about rich people that they think  that they should decide where to spend their money rather than  taxes and how and how that's basically.  Yes, that's exactly right.  And so here to have is you have Google basically taxing itself  to give charity various things and doing a good job.  So it's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that the same Gina Davis as Earth Girls Are Easy?  That Gina Davis?  The actress.  Tall, will be actress.  Thelma and Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thelma and Louise.  Yeah, I don't know if she did Earth Girls Are Easy.  Yeah, no, she did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She was in a bikini throughout most of the film.  I don't know why I'm printed on my memory.  She was six feet tall.  I ran into her once at an NAB or something.  Yeah, she's very tall.  Hold me right over.  So I this is exactly what it's funny that you should mention  this because I just signed up for this thing called Sane Box.  Have you seen this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that was one of the ones I wanted to sign up for.  And then I pulled back.  It looks neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I did it so you don't have to.  Thank you.  So you get now it works with all I'm at mail.  So you don't have to.  I did it with Gmail, but you could do it with any IMAP mail  system.  And what it does is it goes through all your mail.  They say we don't read your mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They still have access to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I mean, I don't know exactly.  Yeah, you're giving it access with OAuth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So are they just doing a bit?  Are they saying they're doing a better job than Priority  Inbox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess.  So let me go to my Gmail and I'll show you what it did here.  This is always always a thrill when I go to my Gmail.  It created two new folders, Sane Archive and Sane Later.  And I'm not sure why.  But like stuff that's old stuff.  Oh, the later is good because this is and it seems to have  worked all the newslettery things that I don't really want  to have in my main mail.  It moves them over.  So it's kind of like a rule.  Sane Archive is older stuff, as you can see.  So the idea is it cleans up your inbox and the stuff that's  in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I would like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All set.  Yeah.  But you have to give it access to your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you know would you do it?  Yeah, same.  See, and I go to you, you know, what would Steve do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, of course, Steve wouldn't do it.  But Steve's still using Windows XP.  Steve's probably using Pine.  I don't think Steve's a good example.  Steve's using Pine.  We're talking about our security guy.  Our algorithms determine the importance of each email,  move unimportant messages out of the inbox into a separate  folder and summarize them for you.  So you get an email summary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The summary is, boy, you got a lot of crap today.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, my email is out of control.  So anything...  It moves attachments to the cloud.  You connect it to your social networks.  It gets smarter about who you want to hear from or not.  There's a black hole unsubscribe.  Love that.  If you drag something into your black hole folder,  you'll never hear from that sender again.  It goes straight to the trash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is simple.  I have a direct message for Google.  Buy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, probably what their plan is, right?  Follow up reminders.  Notify you when an email you sent was not replied to by a  certain time so you can follow up on it.  Defer an email until you're ready.  So there are other sane boxes.  There's sane tomorrow, sane next week.  So you can just drag a thing over there and it'll let you know.  It's five bucks a month, but you've got it free of charge.  You've got it free for some period of time.  I'm using the free version.  It monitors your spam folder for good mail and moves it back in.  It's an intriguing idea, but you're right.  You have to have some trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I almost did it and then I went...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did it because I don't have any...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Tempting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very tempting.  Tempting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I'll let you know.  It takes a while.  I didn't have any results for a day or two.  And then all of a sudden, as you see,  I started to do some stuff.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a good tool.  It's a tool.  It's a tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ask me in a couple of weeks how I like it.  We will.  All right.  Jeff Jarvis, City University of New York.  Thank you for being here.  We appreciate it.  I know you had a speech and you're in Florida, but it worked great.  We're really pleased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm fuzzy and pink, but happy to be here.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you look great as fuzzy and pink as you are.  Gina Trapani is the creator of a great to-do app called to-do.txt.  You must find out more about it.  It's available on Android.  And it's an iPhone 2.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  iPhone 2.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're just going to love it.  And of course, just think up and read her in the magazine.  Marco Arma, it's the magazine.  Edition 2.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Issue 2.  Great show today.  A lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of fun.
