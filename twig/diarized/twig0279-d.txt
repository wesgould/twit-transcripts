Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best things happen when you don't expect that they're going to happen.  You never know.  You just pull up the app to show it off and suddenly you're talking to Google.  There you go.  It was a lot of fun.  I had such a blast hanging out with everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, what's nice for me is I know that if next time I have a bad clam, I've got somebody who could fill in.  I'm here for you.  Jeff Jarvis is also here, the professor of journalism at CUNY, the City University of New York.  He is the awesomest.  We appreciate all of our hosts.  We have such a great team on this show.  I love this show.  We appreciate being here.  Do you want to see some ads?  Should we kick off with a Moto 360 ahead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're all wearing Moto 360s, aren't we?  Gina, do you wear one?  I know everybody.  I think there's a kind of a consensus in the group among which smartwatch, at least until Apple does theirs.  Here's the new ads that just came out.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, system update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Gina just got a system update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got a system update to which?  Style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This might be the wear update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, charger battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate it when that happens.  So this is the fashion ad, right?  To make you think that this is a fashion forward watch, which I guess of all the watches, it looks the best.  And what's going on here?  Somebody is a few different ads.  Rita, did it pause?  Oh, it paused.  I just thought this was a very slow ad.  That's the same one.  That's the same one.  Let me let me get out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go to the web page.  Go to the web page.  There's most of them.  Yeah, yeah, there's more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You too can wear expensive suits.  Stop.  Sit in coffee shops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is from Creativity Online.  The businessman one.  All right.  What a low time.  There's more down here.  Yes, for all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, too far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No golf.  Moto 360 golf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, fine.  What?  Where?  Show me.  I don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, just just go to the middle of the page.  There's a whole list up a little more.  There.  See the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me get rid of the adage registration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get more from that age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There we go.  Look through the rest of the ads now.  Architect.  We just watched architect, right?  So now businessman.  I thought we were businessmen.  Was that what we watched?  Why does it say burritos?  That's kind of distracting.  Okay, here's architect.  These are Apple worth symmetry.  Symmetry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, as opposed to Apple, they have a sense of humor.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tinder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have a new Tinder match.  That's cool.  I didn't know I could put Tinder on my Tinder and my Moto 360.  Then they should have said your wife.  All right.  This one is couple.  Did you do this to your watch?  Yeah.  Cover it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this is sexy.  Sexy, sexy.  Desire.  Desire.  Mom.  Except my friend request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll send it again.  That's good.  I'm liking these.  Now I'm getting it.  Now I'm getting what's going on here.  Golf.  You want to see golf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, let's make fun of golf and then we can move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm all right.  Power.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Precision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Marriage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  His wife beeps you like for lunch.  Tell me you're close.  Those are great.  Now I'm playing my powerful golf game.  That is nice.  Now is that Lenovo now doing this?  It's not Google anymore, is it?  Their ad agency is Droga5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Motorola.  Oh, I see Lenovo Motorola.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, it's an agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they hired a good agency, obviously.  But that's great.  And they had this good sense of humor to roll with it.  Nice.  So we're getting lollipop everywhere.  I just got lollipop on my Nexus 7.  You don't have it on yours yet, Jeff, because you have LTE,  I gather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As usual, it's like when you're in apps country.  You pay more, you go to the little X version,  and you don't get anything.  Yeah.  You know what I did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I decided to wipe this and just make it pure,  just so I could experience the pure lollipop goodness.  And it really does look nice on this tablet, I have to say.  It's very pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, was it not pure before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pure.  Instead of, well, because you know what?  Because I use a launcher.  I use a Lenovo launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, gotcha, gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I want to just have the Google Now launcher,  no fancy wallpapers.  You know, I customize the heck out of these things.  Yeah, yeah, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're going with the defaults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, all default for now.  It's quite nice.  And I do like, and one of the things I was curious about  and we mentioned before, that the tablet settings,  for instance, use the full space.  Let me go back to the settings here.  They use the full space available.  So you get actually all the settings on one,  or almost all on one page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that.  From the Wi-Fi thing on the,  go back to the pull down settings thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, on this one, it's interesting.  I know where you're going on this.  If I tap it, it opens the settings.  You can't go from there to Wi-Fi.  Oh, no, you can't.  Wrong tap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you tap the actual icon, that turns on or off.  If you tap the word, that takes you to settings.  Yeah, good luck hitting the word.  Oh, you're kidding me.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who the hell knows that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wrong tap doesn't work?  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There we go.  Ask all about Android if you want to know something.  Thank you, Dr. Android.  Tap the word, you get the thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good to know.  All these little hidden secrets that Google is expecting to find.  Lollipop is a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of little stuff in Lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, once you discover it, then you know going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Moto X, this year's 2014 Moto X got its update last week.  What are you getting updated, Gina?  You're signing it, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is my Nexus 7 from 2012.  This is the original Nexus 7.  I really needed to get the new one.  And it just lies to me.  It just tells me my system is up to date when I know it's not.  The thing is, I had this weird bug,  and we were just talking about this last on All About Android.  I got the system update notification like a week ago, week and a half ago.  And I was like, great, go.  And then it went, and then it rebooted.  It was like nothing happened.  It was still...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a different update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, still jelly bean.  You know, so I don't know what's going on.  I think I'm just going to grab the system image and update it myself.  That's risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't recommend that, folks.  Sideloting an image is always a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. It is.  But you know, honestly, this thing is so old and so slow right now.  Like, I don't even think Lollipop can save it.  It's just super stuttery.  And it's the old Nexus 7.  It's the original Nexus 7.  And I've used it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even this one feels a little more sluggish compared to the, you know,  the Snapdragon 805 processor phones I've been using.  This is a little bit slower, but it's fine.  I mean, I really like the Nexus 7, given that it was $250 or whatever, $225.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it was so cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a great deal.  This is 5.0.1 or 5.01.  So it went straight to the updated version of Lollipop 501,  which came out, I think, last week.  Fixing some of the issues with Android.  What do I tap it five times and I can play the game?  Lollipop, Lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is the Flappy Lolly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Flappy Lolly.  Do I hold it?  Yeah, I think you hold on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  Flappy Pop?  It's so hard.  It's way too hard.  It's next to impossible.  The swing from down to up is just so wide.  So you have to get it.  Somebody told me you should always go in low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so hard.  Anyway, it's nice that they built that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's way better than the scattering beans.  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it better?  Is it?  It's driving me freaking nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It certainly required more programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they just want me to break my Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah, nice.  The word is going out that Verizon is doing a soak test  on the Turbo, which was nice.  This is essentially a Moto X Verizon style.  And so that's getting, and it may get voice over LTE,  which it lacked.  This was kind of a weird Verizon phone,  because you couldn't do voice and data at the same time  as you can with, for instance, the iPhone  if you have VOLTE in your area.  Oh, get me started.  Rumor has it.  Verizon and LTE.  I know.  There'll be a Volte update on this when we get Lollipop.  I like Lollipop.  I do.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who doesn't?  The one thing about mine is it's giving me weird alert noises,  and I can't figure out what it's alerting to me.  It doesn't show me anything on the screen,  so I can't figure out what to kill.  But I'll figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you do last week?  Because we did it on Twitter, and I  love this story that Google admits that 50% of all ads  are not ever seen.  They never are on screen for more than a second.  56% of all ads are never even in view.  You pay for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did.  I think we did talk about this, because I remember Jeff saying  that, like with Matt, when you buy an ad in a magazine,  you assume that some people are just going to flip past it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is not a magazine.  On TV as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  I hear you.  This is a very troll-y headline, though.  Advertisers wasted their money on more than half of their ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, if you compare it to a magazine or TV, you're right.  That happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It happens all the time, right?  And the big thing now in advertising is viewability,  and that's what this is about.  And so now, they're expected to have viewability.  The problem is that it immediately  deflates the price of advertising, because all that  even though advertisers do the advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It just says attract 56%, yeah.  Yeah.  From the total cost.  I'll tell you why I like these stories,  because I think our ad view rate is a little higher than that.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  There are some people who skip through our ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you never know when it ends, so you got to be good.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's sort of the nature of the medium,  though, right?  I mean.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you can never guarantee an ad gets heard.  And there's a dirty little secret in podcasting,  which is we count downloads.  We don't know if anybody ever played that show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, I shouldn't say that out loud.  Shh.  Shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the same thing with a magazine.  You know, they count circulation, not how many people read it.  In fact, in magazines, don't they multiply it,  because they say there's a pass around rate?  Readership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they count readership.  When I was a TV guide, our pass around rate,  the alleged number of people who read every issue of TV  Guide was like 2 and 1 half.  But the people, it was eight.  They presumed that eight people read every copy.  That's such a lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's such a lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which means that the copies in doctors offices  were obviously read by 800 people trying to get the money to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what brought the average up.  OK.  Yeah, you don't see TV Guide in the doctor's office that often.  No.  No.  You don't see TV Guide anywhere anymore.  You know, the real truth of this is that all advertising numbers  are lies.  The Arbitron ratings, the people meters, all of it's made up.  Everybody knows this.  Everybody is in cahoots on it.  It always comes down to, did you get your money's worth?  And it's a little harder for brand advertising  because you can't measure sales directly from the ad.  All of our advertisers are, for the most part anyway,  are direct ads.  So they can measure sales.  So all it really comes down to is we try to charge as much as we  possibly can.  As long as they don't lose money on the advertising,  everybody's happy.  They make more money than they lose.  Return on investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has there ever been any sort of initiative in podcasting,  like to ping back when somebody plays or anything?  Nothing's ever caught on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it can't because you'd have to have a special player  and special software.  So in fact, I think it's Nielsen, one of the rating groups,  I think it's Nielsen, is getting into podcast advertising  along with Adobe.  And that's what they're proposed, is there  be an Adobe player that counts.  But I don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it'd have to be some sort of open thing,  where you stuffed a ping back URL and a header,  and every player looked for that URL and hit it,  pinged it when the play button was pressed.  I mean, the chances of that happening seem to have  an extremely wide adoption for really good reason, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an imperfect art.  It always has been.  Right?  Jeff, in magazines and newspapers, same thing.  And it all comes down to, did Coca-Cola feel like when it  bought a million dollar ad on the Super Bowl,  did it feel like it got its money's worth?  And I guess they do research to try to figure out who saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, don't forget, there's a moral hazard in here,  because ad agencies, for a long, long time,  and still to some extent are, paid on how much ad media  they bought.  Right.  So it was in their interest to say to the advertiser,  oh, it was worth spending $100 million,  because we got our cut of the $100 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That actually hurts us, because we're cheaper than a lot  of mainstream advertising.  And so the agencies aren't as incented to place stuff  with podcasting, because when they're podcasting,  they're only doing a million dollar buy, not $100 million buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's backwards.  But if they were representing their customers' interests,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  exactly, they would say, let's take the more efficient lower  spend, but that's not their interest.  Again, we shouldn't talk about any of this.  No, sorry.  Hey, Jeff or Gina, maybe you know,  somebody in the chat room is saying,  but doesn't Google charge per click, not per view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is not about search ads or AdSense.  This is about double click, because don't forget,  the Google serves a huge proportion of the display ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on the internet.  And those are charged per impression, not per click.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I mean, there's various models.  But now the interesting thing happens is,  I don't know if we talked about this in the show,  but Chartbeat, run by Tony Hale, is arguing that the metric we  should move to is attention.  The problem with the old media metrics of reach and frequency  is that's what leads to clickbait and cats, volume,  pure volume.  If you go to attention and how much time is spent exposed  to an ad, then you get rid of that viewability problem,  because you're not exposed to it if you can't see it.  And so the Financial Times and Chartbeat  are going to charge based on attention minutes  for certain demographics, like 10,000 attention minutes  of European CEOs.  Ev Williams at Medium plans to charge on TTR, Total Time Red,  selling it like verifiable TV.  And The Economist is now joining in as well.  So at a higher level end of content,  you're starting to move from pure volume to attention.  I think that's good for everybody,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because then you don't get rid of the buzz feeds  and all the clickbait and the listicles and all of that.  You're really trying to measure what really matters,  which is the viewer's engagement with the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the other thing it gets rid of, I think,  is what I've come to really despise now  is this idea that everybody needs a take.  We need our take on this.  And of course we do that here,  because we just talked before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all we do.  The entire Twitter network is based on our take on that.  Our take on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you go to Google News,  and you see 1,200 versions of the same story  and know that it was reported just once,  the amount of resource that why is that there?  It's there because we want more page views, page views, page views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If that's become a real bane of my existence  is the kind of the rehash article.  And everybody does this now.  And I always, when we do, we report stories,  we try to give credit, by the way, to the originator of the story.  And we try to get the original originator, not the rehash.  There's one exception there, the paywalls.  So when Jessica Lesson does some original reporting on the information,  or the Wall Street Journal does some original reporting,  I often end up quoting the rehash  because you can't get past the paywall to see the original reporting.  So there's a negative on paywalls, by the way.  Not that that matters.  I try to give credit to the information.  If the information breaks the story, I want them to get credit  because I want them to get more subscribers.  What do you, all right, now we're really going to go off our field.  What do you think about what happened at the New Republic, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is going to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, let me just say, I was a subscriber for years to the New Republic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should we recap for folks who aren't media nerds?  This is kind of an insider story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was a 100-year-old magazine founded in Teddy Roosevelt's living room  that represented the progressive,  progressive is kind of an old political term, you'll remember from high school,  but the kind of progressive, left-leaning politics.  But it was very much an insider journal for the Beltway.  I loved it, read it religiously until Martin Peretz came along,  and then I left because I didn't like him.  I was concerned about ownership.  Chris Hughes of Facebook, one of the Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard,  who was hired in his freshman year at Harvard to work at Facebook,  bought it two years ago, right?  Not that.  Three, I think.  Which I thought was, that's a good thing.  Because here's a very, by the way, Chris Hughes very smart,  you know, I mean, has a great pedigree.  Anybody who buys the New Republic presumably understands the value of the New Republic.  Most people never even heard of it.  He worked in the Obama campaign.  That's right, he was the guy credited with his digital,  with Obama's digital success in 2008.  So I thought, oh, good.  This is, you know, I was more excited about that than Jeff Bezos buying the Post.  Ironically, Jeff has done a great job with the Post,  and we, well, we'll see what Chris has done with the New Republic.  So this week, the editor-in-chief, highly regarded editor-in-chief of the New Republic,  I think he was fired.  Some say he left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he had to ask whether or not he was replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the answer was yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So he was fired.  He hired Gabriel Snyder as the digital person.  From Gawker.  He heard about that he was the editor, and he had to call,  Franklin Four had to call Chris Hughes to find out whether he was fired or not,  and the answer was yes.  And then they brought him in, and then the many decades,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  grizzled veteran of reviews quit,  and then about 30 editors and contributors said,  that's it, we're out of here, everybody left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a mass exodus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And partly because they brought in this digital guy,  because what this really is about is something that's happening in every newsroom in the nation,  which is the move to on, you've got to find a way to succeed online.  And, but unfortunately, they brought in a guy from, was he from Yahoo or AOL?  I can't remember.  Yahoo.  Yahoo.  Who was a little tin-eared, tone deaf, he didn't pronounce his name right for one thing,  which kind of shows he doesn't even know what he's doing.  And then, and then he said, well, we're going to do,  we're going to be a vertically integrated digital media property,  and we're going to break stuff.  And everybody just said, oh God, not us.  But I have to say, some of this looks a little bit like old media rejecting digital ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a whole bunch of tribes going on here.  Now, my, I'm not, I, please do not give any publicity to the name,  but I'm now about not to mention,  but I have very much have a dog in this fight because New Republic ran a,  an 8,000 word personal attack on me.  Really?  Oh, I missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to go find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know what that is.  You know what that is.  Okay.  We've not discussed it.  Yeah.  And when I wrote a reply, refused to so much as effing link to it.  Was this in the Chris Hughes era?  Yes.  Okay.  So I hate the sons of bitches.  I think they're irresponsible dorks.  And I think the magazine has been crap for the last three to five years.  Yeah.  And they're, they just tried to become trolls with degrees.  Right.  And so when all this happened, I read a piece,  which I think you're going to do a dramatic reading of in a moment.  And I tweeted that wonderful piece and I said it was brilliant.  And one of my friends came back and said, oh, how could you say that?  What?  So, you know, well, because what you see is you see the defense of the New Republic.  Oh my God.  How could Silicon Valley come into this?  But the truth is, Chris Hughes isn't really Silicon Valley.  He won the lottery at Harvard to end up as Mark's roommate.  And he did these smart guy and did smart things.  That's all wonderful.  But he's not really a Silicon Valley guy.  And hiring sort of Yahoo, what are we going to call Silicon Valley.  So this is not a war of Silicon Valley versus media, which is how it's been presented.  It's kind of a war of New Republicites versus New Republicites.  And there's various difficult tribes within the New Republic world.  The New Republic world is tiny.  There are far more Americans who are saying, what the hell is the New Republic mod  than ever read the New Republic in all this coverage?  And so they cancel their December issue.  They're going to come out next in February.  I think it's a big old yonder.  I don't necessarily condemn the new regime or condemn the new editor.  We'll see how he does.  But I think the magazine has been crapped for quite some time.  And there are those who, just like you, Leo, canceled the prior regime.  Long ago.  Where insurance owned it.  Long ago and said it's been crap ever since then.  So it's one of those magazines.  You know, it's like, I forget, when I went to South by Southwest one year,  I forget who it was, asked on Twitter, how do I act like a veteran?  And my response was, just complain that it's not as good as last year.  I think the same is true of the New Republic.  Is that by acting like a New Republic reader, you're going to complain about  it wasn't as good as the old days.  Whatever.  It's always been tiny.  What is the circulation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can't be more than like 40,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  About that.  And finally, the thing is that what we really see happening here,  which of course I celebrate, as I think you do too,  unless you want to be curmudgeonly today,  is that this idea that we had to have a journal of ideas isn't necessary anymore.  We have something called the internet.  And yes, it's hard to find, you know, the diamonds in the rough.  That's true.  But we'll come up with systems for that.  There's far more voices than ever existed before.  Those efforts wouldn't even so much as link to me.  When I had something to say that they had caused,  that idea that you have the gatekeeper who can be have you don't want to club over folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want to club.  You want to foster you.  You want to have a place where.  So part of the problem is there isn't any money in being this kind of thinker and writer.  There never has been.  So it was nice that something fostered that.  And some rich people came along and said, well, we'll continue to pay you.  But you don't want it to turn into a club.  And so, yeah, I agree with you.  And sometimes I feel like this is just old media going,  oh, these internet people, they're so disgusting.  They're so plebeian.  Where is that?  Where is that piece on Medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's on Medium.  Hold on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was which piece is this?  Oh, I want to read it because it was so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Jeff's response to the no, no, this is a send up.  Oh, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a piece.  Just just search for medium.  I quit New Republic.  I quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, right.  Yeah, I quit.  Peace. Yes.  No, it's funny.  I never read the New Republic.  I've been really interested in Chris Hughes.  He's he's been like the silent founder.  He barely had a role in the social network.  He's like the silent gay founder of Facebook.  I sort of I don't know him personally, but like I have a  couple of close connections and I found this whole thing  really fascinating to witness just sort of as a drama  because it was this this drama going on.  But what was interesting is that they sort of cast the  Silicon Valley side as anti-intellectual like the one  of the lines that got quoted was, you know, one of the  new the new regime said, well, I just stopped even reading  those long form articles.  Right.  Tl.  Dr.  Yeah, Tl.  Dr.  Man, let's disrupt this business.  Like let's let's just move fast and break things like it  was so you know, which I find, you know, really funny because  they were sort of acting just like a stereotype themselves.  I felt like it could have been that that show on HBO.  But it was you know, it was also there were seemed like  there were many lessons in management to be learned from  this the scenario to and the thing that's interesting with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing that's interesting is contrasting this to Jeff Bezos  is stewardship of the Washington Post which one would expect  to be terrible.  And in fact is I think the post has been doing really good  work in the last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but don't build the statue yet.  Okay.  The the the what what he's been doing which has been endearing  him to every editor of the shop is he's been hiring.  He's been throwing money at it.  Okay, but the most the only the only thing we've seen so far  that's been terribly technologically based is oh boy,  you can get the Washington Post on your Kindle fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no revolution in digital there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, none and and my hope for Jeff Bezos at the Washington  Post has long been since he bought it that he would bring  his expertise.  I wrote a certain book about the idea that we are going to  move to a relationship structure in news or should and  and Amazon knows better than anyone.  Jeff Bezos knows better than anyone how to build relationships  of relevance and value for people and I want him to bring  that to the Washington Post.  Yeah, I wouldn't want him just to say I'm going to make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a hobby and I'm just going to fund or a bully pulpit this  year or a bully what makes me nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He hired a there's a brilliant editor there and Marty Baron,  which is great and Marty is is is quite amazing and has has  a great staff and so that's all good in my little world my  little club.  We admire Marty, but then he hired as the new publisher.  The guy basically a political fixer in town guy who doesn't  know anything about Internet.  He's the guy at who killed TBD, which is which was a local  site in Washington that many of us who care about local news  were really putting a lot of hopes on and it on service  ceremoniously got executed and that's the guy who's hired to  run the business side of the post.  I don't see a lot of vision coming there and if there's  not vision on both the editorial and the product side,  that's going to be trouble.  So I so far.  Yes, Bezos has thrown money into the post so far Marty Baron  is doing really good things with that money, but I was hoping  for a lot more experience and vision from Jeff Bezos in the  post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's what I'm hoping for hearing is is that he's he is  quite rightly trying to get everything up to snuff get a  great quality product and and and is willing to because he's  got deep pockets to fur this larger problem of how do you  make this work in a modern digital age?  After he learns and builds time to defer why not defer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think he's going to start experimenting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he will at some point.  Yeah, but I'm glad he didn't just jump in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I thought that's what's going to happen.  I was giving it all the time.  I just see the the other sign.  I see is that the guy he put in charge couldn't be more old  media publishers always though horrible aren't publishers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  publishers in the sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's no because that's that's our hubris in the editorial  side where we should be doing is putting visionaries on the  business side as well and business strategies.  You're you're a business vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you needs to it needs to be viable, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but we got to find some so it has to be modern

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  enough of the I'm sorry.  It's very inside baseball, but I knew I as soon as I read it.  I said I have to ask Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think Chris is how I get in trouble for Gina not getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  enough airtime by the way, this is the washing the Washington  Post opinion piece on this was the New Republic is dead.  Thanks to its owner Chris Hughes.  They blamed him.  What do you think you you said, you know Chris a little bit  or no, no, no, I don't very nice guy very smart guy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean from what I've heard, I you know, I know no  friends who know him.  I mean, I'm interested to see what he does.  I think he's done a lot of interesting things in his career.  And so I think there's a he's got a shot at turning New  Republic into something new and different.  I just think that this was not the most it was an inauspicious  beginning the shake up the shakedown.  I enjoy this time of year.  All these media companies go through these big sort of  shake ups.  So it'll be interesting to see what happens, but I'm definitely  going to watch I think he has a shot at doing something good.  I just don't think this is a good start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're right Gina and I think that that you know, I  didn't necessarily like the product before so maybe it's good  news that the people who ran that product are out and we have  new people in France was no no we're on inside baseball.  So they just happened just before we got on the air this  huge in my world, which is Alan Rusberger the editor of  The Guardian who I think is the best editor newspaper editor  of any newspaper whose language I could possibly read in the  world is stepping down to have the trust that owns The Guardian  and have been replaced next year.  That's that's gigantic news in my field.  And my geeky now and you can do your dramatic reading actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the big news in my field broke last night, which is that HBO  is going to start putting its content on the web this spring.  And that the guy they brought in to run their digital,  you know streaming platform.  Quit in disgust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes speaking of dramatic firing.  Yeah, you know CTO is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because HBO realized after the Game of Thrones  debacle earlier this year that this guy didn't know how to  do anything and that this team he had built was ineffective.  So they're going to Major League Baseball to stream the  content.  They already do it for a sense wrestling a major MLB does  a great job of streaming content, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, why why build it?  If it's right, but there was another argument this week in  my world the the CEO of The Guardian Andrew Miller said  newspaper shouldn't be technology companies.  That's not what's going to save us and then a lot of my  friends got all angry.  I thought that was hot.  I couldn't agree with him more HBO is not I don't go to HBO  because it knows how to do code.  I go to HBO because it knows how to do shows except for the  newsroom, which is junk.  I can't wait for it to end.  That's almost over.  But anyway, HBO's core competence is not how to build  a player and the tech guys who think they always have to  build themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they hired this guy and he brought in a bunch of Microsoft  cronies.  They have a big office auto burkeys or burkus as CTO.  He's been there for a few years.  He brought in people from Microsoft set up a large office  in Seattle 55 engineers laying off a number of longtime  employees in HBO's New York headquarters.  The HCA this is from Fortune magazine, the Seattle office,  which is rumored to cost HBO as much as 100 million dollars  per year has been the source of internal squabbling at the  company insider insiders accused Burks of building a  Napoleonic Empire with an HBO.  He resigned and discussed after being informed that he wasn't  going to be doing the streaming but also I think very  interesting.  The HBO has finally pulled the trigger.  I think we remains to be seen if you'll have to demonstrate  that you have a cable subscription, but they've been  making noise about this for some time.  If they disintermediate the cable companies, that's the  beginning of a big move to it is what but but but Leo we've

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  been saying that'll how many of you said that?  Oh, here comes the here comes the thread to pull the sweater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, this is HBO is a big thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it is and they've got a deadline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've got a public deadline Game of Thrones premieres in  the spring and this and the streaming has to be flawless.  Right.  So I mean, it sounds like this guy just wasn't able to ship  on time.  Well, there's a bug he knew about but didn't do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about a memory leak bug and he's for nine months and and  it he didn't fix it and then that brought down the Game of  Thrones streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, HBO go and this is the thing people pay a lot of money  for HBO.  They expect HBO go to work.  It's you know, that's just sounds like a good decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have some personal news today.  I resigned from the New Republic, but I am excited to  join fusion, which I'm also resigning from effective  immediately to start a new adventure at BuzzFeed and  adventure I might add which ends today because I've been  hired by Vox from which I must summarily tender my resignation  in order to join the amazing crew at the intercept who have  been so kind to me in the single minute that I spent there  before letting them know that I am moving on to fire up my  career as a freelance writer get at me editors and now  please stop getting at me as the life of a freelance writer  has proven too difficult but not as difficult as a decision  to join and then quit from and then again join the Atlantic.  This is a wonderful medium piece by Jason O Gilbert and  I love the illustration of a revolving door at the head of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this inside building outside building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very funny and it goes on and on and on and on and  on.  But I really loved that.  I just had to laugh out loud when I read that.  I don't know who Jason O Gilbert is, but he's got a  fine touch and he should find a job at the New Republic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and he clearly has lots of media time friends who announce  their their new gigs very often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we've all seen these emails haven't we or tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like my tweet stream.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I am beyond thrilled.  However, to announce that I'm launching a new media startup  in collaboration with Tina Brown and the puppet smart from  too many cookies as I leave today due to disagreements  with investors over the direction of the publication as  well as a series of two public arguments over usage of the  office refrigerator with smart.  I can only say I'm so proud of what we might have accomplished  had I not been engaged full-time and searching for  other jobs in media accepting other jobs in media and pouring  through my thesaurus for synonyms to the word thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's news in your old world.  Nick Devin announced the so-called unclenching.  What are you interpret from this?  So Nick is now stepping down as CEO and has a board of like  40 people who are going to make 10 is the founder and publisher

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of Gawker.  We should and my former employer where Tina started life  hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, life.  I was a Gawker site.  I ran the site for five years.  I founded the site.  I own stock and Gawker Gawker's is is I haven't been there for  years five years now and Nick wrote a 15 page essay, which  you know, the short version is he wants to blog again.  He you know, he doesn't want to be the president of the  company and the single point person to run the entire company.  The company is huge now.  And so he's assembled a team of seven executive managers to  run the company and he wants to write more which I'm very  excited about because Nick is actually an extremely smart  and good writer.  So I'm happy to see him him writing again.  But yeah, I thought that the entire the essay is very very  long and probably wouldn't amuse anyone else as much as it  amuse me.  It's very Nick and I mean, it's very transparent which is  kind of what what Gawker does right?  They turn they turn things inside out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Tommy Tommy crags who's at Deadspin is now the executive  editor all over all eight flagship titles.  I like this Nick writes will return to our mission more  linebackers with fictional dying girlfriends less pandering  to the Facebook masses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want to break stories break.  They want to break stories.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they want to speak truth to power and they want to  stay independent.  They've never taken any any sort of funding and you know,  they want to keep growing which that they have been and  Gawker has done done really well and every December January  there's a reckoning there and there's some sort of Reorg  and there's a kind of refocus and this I think this one  sounds good.  I think that Nick is now not running a small company  anymore when I when I started there, you know, it was just  a couple people that he you know, PayPal a couple bucks  a week to write, you know one or two sites and now it's a  giant company with you know HR and all hands meeting $60  million revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know life hackers burden was always that  we that you know, we it's not we anymore, but life hackers  kind of like the nice site in the group.  Yeah, it's not gossip.  It's not snark, right?  It's just helpful.  So we were always like the black sheep tonally anyway,  and I'm really happy to see that the current team is kind  of kept up with that.  But yeah, I like that.  He said beloved life hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he says we haven't been ourselves lately editorial  traffic was lifted but often by viral stories that we would  rather mock we the freest journalists on the planet were  slaves to the Facebook algorithm.  The story of the year the one story where we were truly at  epicenter was one that caused dangerous internal dissension.  We were nowhere on the Edward Snowden affair.  We wrote nothing particularly memorable about NSA surveillance  gadgets felt on exciting celebrity gossip was emptier  than usual boy.  I hope he's sincere and I hope this is the direction they  take.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Nick Nick is Nick is highly self-critical always has  been always always Rose the other way next brilliant.  I mean, he's just he's just amazing.  I was on the board of his last company moreover.  And I once said to him it was the middle of the crash and I  said boy Nick, it's a good thing you raised too much money.  You raised a lot of money.  We know the company surviving through this and he said no  Jarvis worst thing I ever did not to the steel could go off  and go down go down rabbit holes.  That was wrong.  That's just the way Nick is he just all you ever think he's  going to go this way.  He's exactly and that's a good reason to do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope this is the beginning of a lot of these companies kind  of is chewing the clickbait the listicle the Facebook news  algorithm and starting to try to create good content on its  own face and not worry about my reality.  Yeah.  Well, that's always been the problem hasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because all we did was import the old volume metrics, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It ain't about volume.  Nope.  60 million is pretty decent.  I could see it becoming a 60 million dollar company.  Yeah, we're on our way there.

Transcript:  But first a word from fresh books.  If you're a freelancer, you know, the pain of the 31st of  the month and you've got a fire at Microsoft Word and create  invoices stamp them and mail them.  There's a better way.  That's what fresh books did for me.  I was doing that.  Amber MacArthur said you ought to try fresh books.  Nice little company here in Toronto.  It's a cloud accounting solution and it changed my life.  There are now 5 million people who have used fresh books to  run their business.  The easiest way to invoice clients, organize expenses and  track your time.  You'll spend less time on paperwork.  In fact, they've done studies of fresh books customers.  For instance, fresh books users free up average on average of  two days a month that they don't do in the invoicing and  the accounting.  They get paid on average five days faster.  That's because it's easy for your clients to pay with fresh  books.  And here's my favorite on average fresh book customers  double their rent of revenue in the first 24 months.  It's good for business because the more, you know, the less  friction involved in things like invoicing and billing and  and tracking your time.  For instance, the fresh books app on your phone will track  your time and you could take pictures of your receipts.  Keep track of your expenses.  If clients are late paying automated late payment reminders  help you get paid faster and without those nervous making  emails and phone calls.  Are you keeping your receipts in a shoebox?  I was snap photos of receipts right from your phone track  expenses easily and you can connect your fresh books account  Google apps.  So you can stay on top of your small business without breaking  your workflow and be man your accountant will love it come  tax time.  You'll be so feeling so good Bennett Coleman one of their  users.  He's a web designer and developer says I seriously don't  get excited about accounting who does but I love fresh books.  I love setting up requiring hosting invoices.  I do too.  It could not be I really love fresh books.  I want you to try it free 30 days.  No obligation.  Just go to fresh books.com slash twig.  If they ask how'd you hear about it mentioned this week in  Google if you would be nice start your 30 day free trial  today fresh books.  Dot-com slash twig.  I love fresh books.

And out of the years Gita Trabati who's all bundled up in  the winter snow in the snow to bring us this holiday change  log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Got a couple lots of couple little new features here and  there to talk about Google Plus to new things in Google Plus  first.  Now you have the ability to pin a post at the top of your  profile your Google Plus profile.  This used to be only available to I think two brands and  pages but now personal profiles have this so the features  similar to Twitter's pin tweets means anybody who visits  your profile will see the pin post and you can do any kind  of content videos links Etc.  And pin posts are viewable to Android and web Google Plus  users with iOS support coming soon.  So post stay pinned until you manually unpin them.  The other thing that Google Plus got was some expanded gender  identity options.  So used to be when you filled out your Google Plus profile  you chose male female or other the gender field now has four  entries.  It's male female declined to state and custom.  And if you choose custom you can fill in however you want to  identify and you can limit who you can still limit who you  can see your gender just like you can you can do now and that  feature the gender feature is rolling out for all users over  the next few days.  Google brings my maps to Google Drive.  So if you go to Google Drive and you choose that you click  on the red new button and you go to the more you can choose  my maps and this is the custom.

I already have it so you can create maps in Drive and you  can so you can do it but you can also do all the things you  can also do in Drive is organize these maps and folders  search them alongside your other files and share them easily.  The my maps tool also gets a couple of other functional  improvements.  You can add more layers and points of interest to user  generated maps to so nice kind of interesting differentiation  between Google Drive and say, you know, like Office 360  for example, Google Hangouts got a couple of new neat  features.  I really like this one when someone asks you if you're  doing a hangout with someone and someone says to you, where  are you Hangouts will automatically detect that someone  has asked where are you and prompt you with a share your  location button.  So you can just tap share your location and drop a pin on  a map and it'll send the person your your location.  So a nice kind of one-time way to say here I am and Hangouts  automatically kind of detects that someone asked you that  so really really really neat.  Of course, you know, there's location sharing and Hangouts  already, but this is just a little extra prompt in case you  forgot it's there and someone's asking where you are.  There's also a couple of other little features and Hangouts  new stickers a couple of Easter eggs if you tap happy birthday  you get a little a little visual you got applied filters to  video chats like sepia or vignette black and white your  contacts also now show last seen timestamps.  You can see the last time that someone logged in and really  really get creepy on it about keeping track your friends.  Sorry, I said creepy because you know, Jeff.  Sorry Jeff.

Transcript:  That's Canary.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm excited to see that come down once that's down and  stable though.  I'm definitely I'm kind of like I'm going to use my pixel  a little bit more because that's just cool.  Finally Android wear just has an update rolling out.  I think it's Android wear 5.0.  And in fact, I literally just got the notification that I  had a system update.  I tapped it and it said that I have to charge my battery  and my charger is upstairs.  So I'm on the edge of my seat here.  But Android wear 5.0 has a couple of new neat features.  First, it's got the launch of the official watch face API.  This means thank goodness that we'll have custom watch faces  by designers you actually like and things that you know  that you actually want your your watch to look like and  you'll see even in the Play Store.  I think facer is one of them.  A few different apps now are plugging into the official  watch face API to offer new watch faces.  And in fact, I believe the Play Store has a new section.  Thank you Jeff for dropping this into the chain lock change  log just for Android wear watch faces watch face options.  So really good exciting stuff there for people who want to  customize their watch Android wear 5.0 also has a couple  of other new updates.  There's a new navigation feature which gives you the  ability to bring back cars that you may have accidentally  dismissed when you tap on the watch face the list of  actions that you can do is now reordered based on how  recently they were used which is nice little smarter and  it's got new modes including theater and sunlight that  lets you keep the screen dim or boost the brightness.  So for those of you with Android watches look for that  system update card because it'll be coming soon and  that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my friends is the Google change log.  The end the end no JS is forking.  Somebody in the chat room said you think they'll cover  that on this show.  Well, if we don't cover it on this week in Google, what  do you have we covered actually I'm a little concerned  about this because it is our plan to do the front end of  our new website.  I don't know JS so no JS.  I didn't know this.  It's while it is open and open source project is owned  in its entirety by joint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it owned or is it the folks who the folks who lead  it are employed at joint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I don't know you can clarify this for me because  it sounds like there is a group of people who aren't  thrilled about joints influence over no JS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so no, so it sounds like joint is nodes official  sponsor.  Okay, and so and so they're kind of in charge of  stewardship the way that Google is in charge of the  Android.  It's not so bad necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  However, forking no, so we I should explain what no JS  is I guess.  The idea is to use JavaScript to its server side or  client side.  It's a little both right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little both but it's our server side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  JavaScript primarily server side JavaScript to do websites  and it's very modern and all the hot kids cool kids are  doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's true.  It's true.  No, it is the new hot thing.  Everybody loves node.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm worried because if it's forked that means  there will be at least two nodes of node JS actually  joint in the latest.  Well, actually this isn't joint apparently has been  fighting this off for a while.  So they created an advisory board to offer community  input into node JS.  So last week some of the developers contributors not  developers the youth in the open source world.  They're called contributors forked the project creating  IO dot JS.  The schism according to this article at read write by  Lauren or Cini the schism surprised the open source  community as well as its corporate overseer joint.  Isaac shoe leader has put out a statement saying he's  one of the contributors.  He's a nodes former project lead in its number two  contributor says that IO dot JS will not compete with  node.  Oh, yeah, and that once he hopes the two projects will  re will merge back together.  Once the company resolves issues related to its  management of the project.  So it is a little dissatisfaction with joints  involvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you know this this sounds bad.  It's not it's not so bad though.  I mean, I know it has enough momentum behind it.  It really depends on the people who leave and fork off  and you know, maybe this is this is a lot of times a way  that an open source project resolves issues, you know,  right, you know, you vote with enough people vote with  their feet.  If it's IO dot JS does certain things that the community  loves that no JS hasn't done they'll figure out a way  to merge back together.  I mean in some ways it's like hey, you know, this is this  is a way that that innovation happens.  It just seems like it's you know, it feels like a like  a splintering and in this case, it really does seem  like there's there's a genuine conflict here, but I  don't think no JS is going to go away.  Yeah.  It'll be around in some form.  Look if at some point in two years Leo you have to upgrade  from or or laterally grade from no JS to IO at IO dot JS  like that won't be no a big deal.  So I wouldn't be worried about your project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we're going to use angular.  Anyway, it's the new hotness.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  See I come here.  I know when I read these stories, I know that I can come  and I'm Gina will explain this all to me or I read about  the New Republic and I know I can come here and Jeff will  explain it all to me.  That's why you guys are here to help me understand what's  going on.  So thank you.  Eric Schmidt says hey don't worry about the killer AI  robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That has been an amazing story hasn't it?  Everybody's been going berserker on that, you know, even  Elon Musk has been saying that the AI is this huge danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure I disagree.  We've had a number of interviews on triangulation on this  subject including a guy named Barrett who wrote a book our  last invention.  Now he's not a scientist or a computer programmer.  He's a journalist, but he has talked to a bunch of people  in artificial intelligence and he says is a surprising consensus  in the AI community that now is the time to start to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's hubris in the AI community.  Maybe we're going to get really smart machines.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're really dangerous.  We're not nerds anymore.  We could kill everybody.  Watch out.  That's how much show me how far along AI is except trying to  kill two guys on Jeopardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had a guy who Nick Bostrom who is one of these really top  academics in this area.  He's written a book called Superintelligence.  He was on two weeks ago on triangulation.  He's a kind of interesting multi-disciplinary threat.  He's a philosopher and a scientist.  He teaches at Oxford.  And his thesis is it's going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  He says we don't know when it could happen as Ray Kurzweil  says in the next few decades.  It could happen in 200 years, but at some point you're going  to create an intelligent machinery.  And he said the problem is we don't have any kind of fundamental  ethical basis for how this machinery should be designed  so that it doesn't he says for instance, if you created the  ultimate paperclip making machine eventually would turn  the whole world including all humans in the paper clips.  And so the time is now to decide how many paper clips we want  to think about these issues so that when they do get as they  get smarter that we're prepared.  He said we know, you know Asimov's robotic rules are not  right.  They're not sufficient.  They have all sorts of it's almost you almost need somebody  to work on this like a Bertrand Russell.  This is this is kind of this higher order philosophical  ethical scientific thinking that but anyway, Eric Schmidt  says relax.  I trust Eric.  He knows he says these fears are normal.  He was speaking at a Financial Times conference.  They're also to some degree misguided.  Don't fear artificial intelligence.  Welcome our new overlords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the the photo of Schmidt that they chose for the Business  Insider article.  Yeah, what is he pushing up his goal?  What is he doing?  Yeah, it's sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's like it's like a tiny little man.  Schmidt it's mitts sitting shotgun in a self-driving car is  not an altogether happy experience ie terrifying but the  you don't have to worry about about machines stealing our  jobs and taking over the world according to Schmidt people  have been concerned about machines taking over the world  for centuries.  That doesn't make it.  Okay, doesn't make it mean that's wrong.  Go back to the history of the loom.  There was absolute dislocation, but I think all of us are  better off with more mechanized ways of getting clothes made  there's lots of evidence that when computers show up wages  go up.  There's see he's not really addressing these issues and I  think people who are really involved in AI you're right.  There's hubris because there is the underlying assumption that  at some point we will make an intelligent machine.  But you think Jeff that we should pretend that we should  act as if we never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we should we should you're absolutely right.  We should have the discussion but guess where that quickly  goes it quickly goes to a why don't I pack it pick on them  the EU passing laws limiting the technology that's not even  invented yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, none of these AI experts want that this is their this is  their meat and potatoes.  No, they want they they want to have AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm just saying beware.  Yeah, I agree the techno panic that will that will inevitably  emerge and that's I'll be on back on the show in a few months  and we'll see people screaming somewhere in the world.  No, that's right.  Just Europe demanding regulation of artificial intelligence  for God's sakes.  The smartest man on earth says that we're in trouble.  The craziest man on earth.  God bless of Elon Musk says we're in trouble.  We must do something and we're at the point now where as soon  as new technologies come out to get regulated least they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  out regulation won't stop this anyway because this is going  to continue this is you know, Ned Ludd and his and his Luddites  are didn't stop Jacquard looms either.  So I don't think I don't I agree you don't want this whole  techno panic thing to get out of control and of course, you  know what you can also predict that it will Jeff.  But it's not going to stop it.  I don't know.  I you were I don't know.  Well, you and I will be long dead.  Yeah, it doesn't really matter you kids go ahead do whatever  you want.  Make paper clips.  Turn everybody in a paper turn everybody into a paper clip.  I don't care.  Google's Road to virtual reality begins with cardboard.  I love my car Google cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought cardboard was still the garbage amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, apparently Nicole Lee who we know very well.  She worked for us for a long time and she's an engadget.  She says I thought cardboard was dumb, but I was wrong.  Cardboard well, so cardboard is a there's a cardboard SDK not  only for Android but for unity which is a very powerful gaming  platform a lot of games are written in unity.  Maybe we're going to see more for cardboard.  This is Google's response to Oculus Rift in the billions of  dollars at Facebook spent on Oculus Rift.  You just need a little cardboard and a smartphone.  And I'm going to say that's a little bit of a problem.  I'm going to say that's a little bit of a problem.  Just a little cardboard and a smartphone.  It's good.  It's good article Nicole wrote on the history of cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so interesting to me that they named it cardboard because  it's funny like we were talking about the the Samsung gear  VR last night and all about Android and and and our guests  and I was saying, you know putting that thing up on my face.  I just don't want to do it right.  But cardboard looks like a kid's project.  I mean, you know, that's it's a sort of makes fun of itself  by the fact that it's Velcro and stickers and magnets, you know,  and and I just think that Google did the right thing by calling  it cardboard and making it this thing that you fold up, you  know, the thing that you keep on your desk.  So when you come co-workers come over they go and check this  out, you know, whereas the gear VR like kind of takes itself  so seriously that I think it turns off people because it's  just this giant thing strapped to your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and ironically, I think the functionality of Google  cardboard is no less than the functionality of the because  you still need a Samsung phone in the in the Samsung handset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not that much less.  I mean probably technically it's probably very much less, but  it's not less enough for anyone who's a casual user to notice,  you know what I mean?  So I feel like cardboard is going to do more for VR than  something like even Oculus or the or the gear VR.  I just think that this is a brilliant kind of an  uncharacteristically brilliant marketing or naming thing that  Google did here.  I was like, oh yeah, this is this was the right way to do  this and the way they just sort of offhand and joke, you  know, they threw off but then they're in the keynote at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google I O they handed these out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo what Leo my big question is will the Nexus 6 fit?  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a really good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so Jason you have yours.  All right.  We're gonna we're gonna we're gonna find out I have my  cardboard here.  Thanks to by the way, Gina who who brought me this  I know she made it she made it.  Okay in the back seat of a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I refused to look at the directions by the way, just  fumbled with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What kind of fit?  You'd have to just hold it a little differently.  Just make a bigger one.  You need a jumbo cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're gonna have to do some different sizes of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cardboard now and it has NFC in it.  So you could you could you could you know what?  That's the beauty of cardboard.  You can easily cut it.  It doesn't matter.  Oh my cardboard is running women.  So the NFC kicks in and it says put on your viewer.  Now, what do you want to do?  You want to do it?  I got to take off my glasses.  Do you want to do airplane?  Wait a minute.  I got cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a new store for things.  Are there are there new apps up yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't know if there is a cardboard app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paul McCartney concert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The global pull and release ring to click.  That's not working.  This cardboard is a little funkified.  But I mean, maybe because Gina didn't read the rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Possible.  It's because I didn't read the instructions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this used to work, but it's just been lying around.  That's all it may be that this turbo droid  turbo doesn't so I could show you sees a stereo thing.  So there's there's stereo eyepieces in here and then the  phone immediately when you put it in senses, I guess via NFC  that it should launch the cardboard app.  If you have the cardboard app, it'll launch and you could see  it then has can you see that it has a left and right screen?  So this says pull ring to release but when you look at it  through the stereo viewer, you see one image.  It's going to be a 3D image and but at the clicking is not  working.  So I have to work on that.  That might be a droid turbo issue.  But people are making cardboard door.  Dodo case is making a you can buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh really?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that happened almost like the day after Google I O.

Transcript:  to make one for the Nexus 6 just the right size.

Transcript:  Yeah, just the right size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the the the Google Play Store page.  There's apps for cardboard.

Transcript:  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and they do say I thought this was the most encouraging  Jason Cornwell, who's the interaction designer.  Hi Jason.  We know you watch Jason said there's a long list of Gmail  features that will eventually come to inbox in other words  parody with Gmail.  We really want to balance building those features with  building out new features that continue to improve the inbox  product concept undo sends tool.  I don't care about undo send.  Yeah, you use that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now that that there is an undo on delete or archive, which  I really like because I frequently accidentally click  this sweep thing and then I go and undo that is very easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm waiting for Gina's next insight on think up which is  the tweets Jeff Jarvis should have deleted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm working on that one now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a funny and you almost the old Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know how many times I used the F word on Twitter in  this year?  How many times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you guess 273?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nearly merely 39 what and then 40 when I complained about it.  I was amazed what you complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute you complain and you use the F word twice when  you complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, then I said oh F.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there are you doing year end insights on think of we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doing best 2014.  We're doing one best year end insight per day in December,  which have been really really fun.  People love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've been great.  I gotta go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So glad you've been doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina told me how many words I tweeted in the year.  Of course, I had to point out the 29 of them were the F word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The F on Insight was like tailored for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was afraid you did it just for me.  I was afraid it was called the Jarvis Insight.  All right.  Well, let me see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tweeted 10,483 words in 2014.  How many did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good.  That's good.  I think I was like 12 K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be not very long, but that would be a book about  38 pages.  For some reason September was a busy month with 2,641 words.  And then this is the Facebook thing.  I want to know how many of those 10,000 words were F bombs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So click on click on the see more button and the header  there.  It says best 2014.  See more.  Yeah.  And so these are all your best ofs.  Okay.  And then you'll see and if you've never used the F word, you  don't have the insight at all because we're not trying to.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You use the F word zero times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  We don't we don't show that insight.

Transcript:  Now's the time you've been putting it off.  Think up dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this has really been this is the first time that  we've had insights like go viral.  People really talk about it makes a lot of sense.  You know, December is when you kind of look back.  But yeah, we had we've had kind of a gangbusters sign  up day the last few days and it was like, oh, okay, like  people care about this stuff.  But this is the time of year that people care about this  stuff.  Yeah, some of these have landed well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All about ego.  Enough about you.  What about me?  How many times did I use the effort?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we had one called Twitter bestie, which would tell  you the person that you replied to the most and who replied  back to you that the get a room one and so that copy landed  really well and then people will be like, well, what about  mine?  And so it kind of traveled, you know, we'd see people tweet  at one another.  Hey, you're my bestie and then we'd watch that of the person  sign up.  So it was like really it was really fun to see that kind of  trickle through the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, here's here's the one that's really most obnoxious.  In 2014, 28% of Jeff Jarvis's tweets, a grand total of  2,511 contain the words I, me, my mind or myself.  Yeah, sometimes you just got to get personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No judgment.  No judgment.  That's nice.  You used to have a judgment in that one, but you took it  out.  You took it out.  This is I love it.  Little that was a little ad for think up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We just thank you.  Yeah, thank you.  That was unexpected.  I appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, what do you think of these stories?  What do you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I am kind of excited about Android Studio 1.0 going  unstable.  We talked about this on the album Android last night, but  I'm gonna I wanted to bring it up again because it's pretty  it's pretty neat.  I've installed it and played around with it.  It's really neat.  So Android Studio is the IDE, the development tool that  developers use to make Android apps and Android Studio has  been in beta for a while.  We saw a demo of it at Google I O but if it went stable just  this week, which means better than Eclipse.  It's better.  It's definitely better.  It's based on IntelliJ and it's way better than Eclipse and  Google's clearly invested their resources into it and is  using it to kind of guide developers.  So when you create a new project in Android Studio, it'll  say are you you check boxes?  Are you developing for where TV Android Auto, you know at  what screen sizes you can you can as you as you change your  layout, you can see the way that it would look on lots of  different screen sizes.  It's really really nice.  I have to say it's really slick and I'm and and I was kind of  hesitant to use the beta versions.  You know, you really don't want to release a production app  using a beta tool.  But now that it's stable, I feel like developers are really  going to move over to it.  And yeah, it's quite nice.  It's quite nice.  And I think we're going to see a lot more apps with material  design and laid out really nicely and working on all  different screen sizes and form factors and for where and TV  and auto do a lot to to this, you know this tool which is  which is definitely better than Eclipse from what I can see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  IntelliJ was paid.  Is this free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is free.  What's the logic?  I think so.  Yeah, you had to buy it.  It's expensive.  I think yeah, this is this is definitely free.  This is the official the official Android and it runs on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Windows and Mac and Linux, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, nice.  Yeah, you have to install.  I had a little funky news had to install the JDK and I had  to edit one of the plist files on my Mac, but I got it working.  And yeah, it's quite good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do this Apple makes Xcode available for its developers  and it's a very nice IDE and I see you have to compete if  you're going to get developers you got to offer a nice  environment Microsoft has a Visual Studio.  So I think it's something Google had to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  And I think that a lot of developers a job developers feel  like Eclipse is just is really old and clunky and slow.  And so this is kind of the next generation.  It's really really nice.  So I think I think consumers are going to start to see some  of the improvements that Studio improves or makes easier  trickle down and you know starting, you know, really now  and into next year.  It's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I was because it's the hour of code, you know,  and and I like to celebrate that by learning a new language  every year.  By the way, everybody should take advantage of this hour  of code now to learn programming for something.  It's fun.  President did president wrote his first program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's on github.  What he put it on github.  Yeah, he's on github.  What's his github account?  President Obama if I'm not mistaken.  Let me see.  That's a good account.  Yeah, that's a good account, right?  There's some great photos of him coding.  Yeah, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there he is.  And look at he.  He doesn't have any repositories you can view.  But he has activity.  He contributed to a repository for Sunlight Labs called US  laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's opened a few issues there.  Great.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is great.  So I I started looking at go Google's go language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, it's it's they're replacing python python.  I guess really.  Google because Google is a python.  Yeah, and this this is python ish with but not a lot of the  of a lot of the issues people have like the white space issue  are gone on this and they have a very nice tour which I highly  recommend if people want to play with it with an integrated  integrated interactive interpreter so you can actually  walk your straight way through many of the features of go in  this little go playground interactively.  You know what they have that's so cool.  They say just ignore formatting, you know type it how you want  it because they have this button and they have a formatter  that you run it through it will reformat everything to the  kind of standard that everybody adheres to so it doesn't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the white space doesn't use white space now that uses braces

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  more as a result.  But no, I think it's a very nice very interesting language.  Of course, concurrency is built in because really a web  programming language more than python was so I think really  nice and very easy to learn.  There's a lot of resources online, of course, but start  with a tour of go for your if you're a programmer or you'd  like to learn programming.  I think this would be a good choice.  They got what makes a good language for learning in my  opinion a good language.  I think having an interpreter that you can try stuff in is  really important.  That was one of the real advantages python had that you  could just say 2 plus 2 and see what happens and hit return  but then also kind of a cleanliness of syntax and a lot  of a lot of easy to understand good libraries helps.  I think it's nicely done.  I'm very impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always sort of a delicate balance between brevity and  clarity of being able to read being able to read code and  get a sense of what it's doing and having it easy to debug.  I think having code that's easy to debug is really is really  important because most of your time you're not writing code  right like most of your time you're debugging code.  You're figuring out why the code you wrote didn't didn't  work or the code that someone else wrote didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do a lot of round that that's why they have the  formatter.  They have a formatter and a document or that takes you know,  I mean most languages have features like this, but it's  really it's I mean it's even in this tutorial that they have  the format button so they're really emphasizing that I think  this is good.  It's funny though one note that I read was there was a really  strong debate internally in Google.  They use braces a lot and a lot of the Google program  America members.  Can you just use brackets that'll save millions of shift  key presses just use as a braces shift bracket.  Could you just please use bracket but no they decided to  use braces if you've used Python or see it will be very  easily clear to you immediately with the language how the  language works and it's nicely I think it's elegant.  It's very nicely done.  So speaking of code and then run out and download the Android  Studio.  Yeah, start writing your new app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, build Hello World for your Android phone.  Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Start messing with my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, what story did you like in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually I think you did a great job of covering it.  I guess I guess all do is I want to give a plug to that.  I steal your story as always.  No, no, you didn't know you didn't do a thing.  You just did a brilliant job as host as you always do.  Oh, you are too sweet.  You went around you you you found the best berries in the  patch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a berry bearer.  Andrew Carvin you want to plug Andy for something Andy who's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a great new job, a tweeter of tweeters and he's  started something called reportedly as part of PR  Mitty Arrows venture and the idea there is very simple is  to go take journalism to people where they live in Facebook  and Instagram and such like it's very interesting.  So let's go plug to and where do I find reportedly?  Reportedly, it's a medium.  So it's medium.com slash reportedly and they also have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter account.  I'm plugging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes on medium.  Let me mention that I started last week after the last show  putting the entirety of geeks bearing gifts my book up on  medium for free chapter by chapter.  So I go to all be reading.  Em.com slash geeks hyphen bearing hyphen gifts.  You will find the latest chapter on top and I'll be putting  them up bit by bit as we go and it'll all be free there.  I will be reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice URL.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I cannot wait medium did a great job designing it.  Yeah, I was going to say this is really beautiful layout that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  page except for that page.  They did a great job.  But there that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes medium seems to be taking off.  I mean, I'm impressed.  They got Stephen Levy to run their editorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great stuff.  Kate Lee my old agent Kate Lee is getting stars and celebrities  and smart people up on medium to publish.  They really are doing a very good job.  You really are.  Yeah, you know the fact that that that Carmen started a whole  new news venture on medium.  I think is is significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  Well, that's I'm sure would have Williams created medium loves

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to hear and he has Kate Lee and Evan Hansen and Stephen Levy  all working there.  They're they're top notch editors and good things going  to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I I'm sure that and he's going to do a great job.  This is going to be really cool because he does incredible  work, but I have to share with you all a pet peeve of mine,  which is any any startup name particularly one that has to  do with writing that ends in ly because I had line adverbs  kind of like banged into my head.  I was real sad when I see the dot ly but I get it's also just  a domain that name thing.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also you pouring money into Libya.  I don't know if that's a good thing either.  That's who owns dot ly.  That's not a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of our best graduates has has a site called narratively  is what the word called content Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I briefly owned da I dot ly and I let it go.  Yeah, and then I had you I let it go money.  No, I just didn't renew it and then I had geekly for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, the story I picked and I'm hoping that we're  going to cover a little bit of this on Sunday on Twitter.  We're trying to get iJustine on it because she is one of the  people in the new YouTube rewind YouTube started doing  this a few years ago where they'd make a video that  rewinds the year this one out of control.  They shot this in eight look, I think eight locations five  principal shooting days.  They're at all the YouTube spaces, LA, New York, Tokyo,  London, many YouTube stars featured in it.  Great music a few mainstream celebrities as well.  Lutenga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So part of the game is to see how familiar you are with  YouTube memes because all of these people are famous on  YouTube and as an old man, I can tell you I recognize about  five.  Remember that video though, right?  The adamantium Claus.  They did a nice job of transitioning.  That was Jimmy Kimmel, wasn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Suddenly we're in Tokyo and New York City.  That's New York.  Yeah.  A the grounds of a stately a mansion.  I love this guy.  I don't know who he is, but I love him.  This is good too.  I don't know who these people are.  This is good too.  I don't know who these guys are.  That is a neat effect.  There's London.  What does this cost?  Well, I'm trying to think of it.  It's got to be tens of millions.  I don't know.  Maybe not.  But what it tells you I was trying to think why is YouTube  do this?  Partly is to make these people feel like stars, which they  are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it is if you don't know YouTube isn't going to say  anything to you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then of course they had to celebrate the ice bucket  challenges, which took over YouTube for a few months this  summer.  And there's quite a few they really handle this.  Well, the transitions from set to set are really well done.  I think everybody's dumping water on each other.  And you know, so I had Michael our 11 year old.  I sat him down.  I said, do you know these people and he named every one  of them.  Wow.  Every he said, oh yeah, that's and then we know they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doing they do ads YouTube does ads on the subway in Manhattan  here with different YouTube stars and I never know any of  them.  I'm like, oh that channel must be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm kind of fragmented because is that Michelle fan?  It's kind of fragmented because nobody knows.  I wouldn't think anybody would know all of them.  He did kids do I guess.  Or even know all of them.  How does it feel to be old?  Rhett and Link.  I know them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it makes me feel really old.  I thought, you know, I was like I told you the idea in 2015  at least for a couple of months to just do to be Instagram  and Tumblr only because that's clearly where the kids are  and YouTube.  That's Jenna Marbles, right?  Maybe go crazy, but I would be a stranger in a strange land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pretty well done.  I gotta say it's a great epic video.  The rights involved in this, you know, the music of course.  It's not really nicely done.  A lot of these a lot of the sets were from YouTube spaces  in New York, LA, London and Tokyo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  This is really quite well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pause it when we see there's Justine right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey Justine.  Hey, we know one person in this whole dang video.  It's pretty spectacular.  Although, you know, I mean all this stuff is to be done with green  screen and and so forth.  They do what's nice besides putting all of the YouTube channel  stars in here.  They also give them credit at the end.  So there we are in Tokyo.  And you'll see they'll you can if you didn't know there's a guide at the end.  Oh, by the way, here's a hamster eating a YouTube gumdrop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  That's cute.  So yes.  Yeah, is this like is this like the guide for old people?  I don't know what's going on.

Well, these people are all pretty big.  I would say with millions of subscribers in all of those channels.  Kid President.  Love him.  He saws two and three.  Tiny hamster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The hamster still nibbling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tiny hamster.  I just seen.  Enjoy Phoenix.  Bart Baker.  Makeup by Maddie.  There you go.  That is the big YouTube.  They are pretty amazing.  The big YouTube rewind.  Each year they get crazier and crazier.  Remember last year was a parody.  And I wonder what the animated PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is how it should have ended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should have ended.  Watch.  He jumps into the roof and.  Faceplant.  Turn down for 2014.  They have a behind the scenes.  You can go back to the 2013, the 2012, 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Susan Wojcicki is is is.  Investing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it makes sense to me that they would.  Does because you want to keep those stars happy.  So making them bigger stars.  That's good for everybody.  And you know.  I think about my usage of YouTube.  Well, obviously yours too.  We didn't know who any of those people are.  How do we use YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watch Elmo with my kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, or Vi or a viral clip.  Or embedded video from other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's probably how most people use YouTube.  But maybe not the most avid YouTube users who are the people who subscribed all these people's channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, did you see the the news at the bottom of that YouTube block that totally ties into what you're talking about here?  Google offering its top makers bonuses to sign multi-year deals so that they won't be lured away.  Says, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because Yahoo's threatening right to steal some of these people.  Yeah, this article.  I am in the hunt with some big bucks looking to sign some YouTube stars.  Interesting.  They want to lock them in for several years.  Hey, my advice kids get an agent before you sign that deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean the part of me is really just happy to see companies vying for to pay independent content creators, you know.  Lots of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think YouTube tries to shape the kind of content by the money they throw around?  Or do they just say, hey, you're a star.  I'm going to give you money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's I don't think it's in more shape, but there is a quasi approval process to use their space.  And I asked about that when I was at the opening and basically what they're saying is they're saying,  well, we're just trying to save you the hassle of making something and then finding out that it violated some rule or something.  So let us know what you're going to make before you make it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a feeling that if I well if I were Susan, I would definitely want to reward the most lucrative partners because frankly you wouldn't have thought PewDiePie  who basically sits in comments and swears during gameplay videos would be the number one attraction on YouTube.  But he is so you don't want to discourage that.  But at the same time you don't you want to shape YouTube a little bit as to the kind of content I doubt there many crotch shot video guys getting money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's just like medium.  It's I hate I hate this made up word is platisher, but you're a platform and a publisher at the same time any crap can go up there because you're a platisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like the platypus it's something that could never exist in nature, but it's curated user generated content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can you can promote the best you can you can have a brand it makes it possible to have a brand because you can show the best stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think it's fantastic.  I if you think about the transformation YouTube has made it's unbelievable and it's unpredictable in Internet years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, I mean it's been huge and it's unpredictable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You would never predicted it.  YouTube by the way will tell you now if you have copyrighted music how it will affect your video because one of the problems is some record companies will have your video pull  down others will just put an ad on it and you don't know ahead of time.  So now their content ID system will help you figure out if you're using copyrighted music and what the label or the artist will do will it mute the audio will it block the video from being seen or will it monetize.  That's a good feature.  So that's that's something in that's a search feature in the audio library will help you with that.  Most YouTube serious YouTube creators will will know all about that.  But the rest of us with our crotch shot videos.  Hey, you never know what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So my tip this isn't actually my tip but it led me to my tip.  The the Play Store is doing a promo where if you buy a Chromecast they're giving you a twenty dollar Play Store credit.  Before I believe December 21st.  So if you still want to do that you can you can do that.  And in in researching that I saw that you can go to Chromecast dot com slash offers the Play Store put out a lot of offers for Chromecast owners.  As we know I took advantage of the Netflix one when I first got my Chromecast.  But there are other ones and if you don't know what offers are available for your Chromecast whenever you bought it you go to Chromecast dot com slash offers.  The the page will actually prompt you to connect to your Chromecast and then it'll show you if you have any open offers that you can take advantage of associated with your Chromecast.  I had a few which I was totally unaware of.  And you know it was a special offers and time time off or subscription or discounts to various things.  You can check that out if you got a Chromecast Chromecast dot com slash offers.  Do it on the network that your Chromecast is plugged in and you can see what's available.  And if you buy that one between now and the 21st you get 20 bucks in Google Play credit which basically brings the cost of it down to like 15 bucks or something.  I mean it's a no brainer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you have to be on the same network so I can't do it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah yeah sorry about that.  Yeah you have to be on the same network as your Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually what I could do I'm on a network that has some Chromecasts so I can see if no no Chromecasts.  All right.  Oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I launched my photo thing.  OK so I'm going to take a picture.  The one thing that's a piss pisser with Instagram is it has to be square.  So a picture that you would normally take you're not going to I'm going to take a picture of my keyboard.  There we go.  And say my word of the week.  So take a picture of that.  It's good to take it with Instagram but you don't have to.  I uploaded from some other thing.  Word of the week is Excelsior.  Then you apply a filter.  This is what everybody says made Instagram the hit it is because you can take a really ugly picture and make it look much more interesting just applying a filter.  Then you continue on and Jean is going to help me.  You can tag people in it.  You can add the photo to a map.  You can also cross share to Facebook Tumblr Flickr Twitter or Foursquare including a Foursquare check in.  You also write a caption.  The pros use this as an opportunity to add 80 or 90 hashtags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  I don't know how they tippity tap.  They must have some hashtag machine some hashtag engine that does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know that there was SC or Instagram optimization.  Seriously.  Instagram engine optimization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seriously.  I'm just going to write my and then you can also as in Twitter use hashtags to make you know kind of comments and stuff.  My word of the day and then you can say something like hashtag.  Here's a good one.  Sorry not sorry.  I like that hashtag.  This completely meaningless in this context.  But okay.  And now I press check and I go now one thing Instagram added and they fortunately been slow to add too many features is this direct messaging capability which I don't use.  But you do have an ability to directly send it out.  But otherwise it's going to be sent to my followers which it is.  And now it's sent out and there's my Instagram post.  Jeff you should do it.  It's fun.  People can then heart it by double tapping it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do it.  I just don't do it.  Here's the here's the only problem.  I don't think of it often enough.  I don't think I can take a photo.  I share it on Twitter.  I share it on Google plus.  Don't laugh.  I don't share it so much on Facebook actually.  But I should do more Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well and you can cross post to Facebook.  So if you if you wish you could you know just use started an Instagram thing is again I have to say this.  You know Instagram always makes me happy.  The only bad thing that happens with Instagram sometimes a little FOMO.  I'm looking at all the web postings right now and I wish I were in Paris.  I following Chris Michelle.  Do you know who he is?  He started military dot com.  He is a turned into an amazing kind of like a style street photographer.  If you want somebody Christopher Michael if you want somebody to follow on Instagram.  It's M.I.C.H.L. is his last name.  Let me just show you Christopher Michael.  Yeah.  Instagram.

You couldn't go look at people's Instagram pictures on the web.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And that was a real pain in the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there were a lot of third party apps to handle that.  Nope.  That's not his.  That's not his Instagram.  I have to figure out what is.  Oh it's Chris I think Chris under underscore Michael.  Let's try that.  Chris underscore Michael.  Let's see if that's it.  But he is not a professional photographer.  That's it.  And he's doing a lot of beautiful kind of black and white stuff of all the people you  know in the industry.  Entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah I recognize some of these folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's Kevin Rose and Tony Conrad.  And a beautiful picture.  I mean I really think these are beautiful pictures.  So this is all at the web.  This is the bad thing.  The only bad thing is that I get depressed because people are having better lives than  I have.  Look at this picture.  I didn't even realize the web was on by the way.  I know.  Let's see if you are on Instagram.  Look at that.  And I also can tell from this picture that they are at Guise of Loic's yearly dinner  party at the best restaurant in Paris.  And that makes me even more pissed off.  I want to be there.  I want to be there.  There's Loic meditating.  He's beginning to meditate now.  Loic Lemur the entrepreneur.  There's Loic and Geraldine his beautiful wife.  They are the organizers of the web.  Although they've sold it but I think they still run it.  These are great pictures that Chris takes.  So this is why you follow somebody on Instagram.  A lot of photographers on there.  Oh yeah.  I like them.

Transcript:  Yeah so this is fun.  They all look so French.  So French.  Anyway.  Okay I don't know how we got into that.  But let me tell you.  Oh I know how because it's bigger than Twitter now.  And now I know why.  You can't troll people on Instagram.  You can only put up nice pictures.  The worst thing you can do is make me feel bad about my life.  Because I'm not in the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you?  What can you do?  That's my own flaw.  What do bad people do on Instagram?  Well you can post crappy comments on someone's photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Comments are the big problem on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they currently have no way to delete comments.  You might be controlling them can't I?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I'm sure they'll, I hope they'll fix that.  It is a mistake.  Damon Wayans.  We had on.  The great comedian who we had on.  Our show Triangulation a couple of weeks ago.  Has been using it to do commentary.  Which is sometimes very profane.  He has this new app.  That lets you embed video.  Into a little head, a little TV.  Into an Instagram movie.  So he's talking and.  I don't know if we should play it.  Because I don't know sometimes it could be.  But it's funny.  He's a good guy to follow.  Damon's very funny.  And this is.  This is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So.  I can see why it's got 300.  Hey I got a treat for you.  Here's my tool of the week.  Nokia before they got sold to Microsoft.  Really made a great suite of apps.  Called the Hear apps.  Many thought that Nokia's Hear Maps.  Were the best nav tool out there.  It is available now.  It's come out of beta.  I've been using it for a while.  And Samsung was offering it on their Samsung store.  For Samsung phones only.  But now it's on all Android devices.  Nokia Hear Maps.  And you know of course you're going to continue to use Waze and Google Maps.  I'm not saying replace it.  But one thing that's great about Hear Maps.  You can download the maps.  And the maps can be all of.  I have downloaded all of the United States.  So I can use this completely offline from now on.  As a turn by turn nav.  It's among the best nav tools out there.  And it doesn't need to be online.  It just needs a GPS.  So it's free.  It's available.  It's still beta.  But it is available on all Android devices now.  Hard to find on the Play Store.  Just went live today.  And so you know how sometimes it takes a while to propagate through search.  But if you search for Hear Beta.  And the maker is Nokia apps.  Don't be fooled.  There are some fakes.  Hear Beta.  Very good turn by turn.  Just one more thing to have on your phone in addition to Google Maps.  If you're offline it's very handy.  And you forget to download ahead of time.  I put the entire United States on there as a few gigabytes.  But you can download maps from all over the world.  And because it's Nokia.  They really have excellent representation.  All over the world.  Asia.  Australia.  And you can do country by country.  Next time you're in Hong Kong.  Just download the Hong Kong map before you go.  That's my tip.  Tool and number of the week.  We are done my friends.  Gina Trapani.  I'm sorry.  Think up.com.
