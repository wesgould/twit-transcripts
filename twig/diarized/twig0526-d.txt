Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now is this a rule that you have to say that every time to give credit?  It is the name of the school.  The Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.  It's the name of the school.  But it is at CUNY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY.  Can I use an acronym?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seems like a lot of work.  Craig School.  Craig School.  Stacey's laughing.  Stacey Higginbotham is also here.  She doesn't have a long title.  She's the woman in charge of Stacey on IOT.com and co-host with Kevin Toffle of the IOT podcast.  Hello Stacey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  From the great Pacific Northwest.  Winter is coming.  That's all I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The rain is already here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it is.  I actually miss rain.  We got a little rain this morning.  It was kind of nice.  I miss rain.  Also joining us, and I think we're going to get to see a little bit more of Ant because I really like having him on the show.  Ant Pruitt.  So do we.  Hello.  And I like his lower third of twit.tv.  Man, look at that.  That's good.  That's good, isn't it?  That's a good stuff.  Oh wait, so we should promote.  California is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Other than waking up this morning thinking I had a leak, like a plumbing leak, it was just rain.  So it wasn't coming in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't coming in the house, but I heard it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You heard drip, drip, drip.  I'm like, oh crap, something's wrong.  Oh, it's raining?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I told you it was my fault because I told you, oh, we're not going to see any rain until October, Ant, or maybe November.  Foolish me.  You pretended you couldn't believe it.  What?  It stopped raining in May and you won't see more rain until October.  That's right.  That's the California way, Ant.  I fell for it.  It moved out of here.  Well, I don't know.  Some of it's super secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got two shows in the works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have two in the works, but I do have a hands on tech segment.  So make sure you subscribe to hands on tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's twit.tv slash hot.  That's the show.  That's the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the show.  That's the show.  That's the show.  That's the show.  That's the show.  That's the show.  That's the show.  That's the show.  We'll be working on a couple of shows with Ant and there'll be more to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same thing with our other new host, Micah Sargent.  A couple new shows we'll be announcing soon with Micah.  I'm actually doing a new show called Ask the Tech Guy, which is just really more of me.  We don't need enough of you, my man.  Oh yeah, right. Just we need more Leo.  So Google announced its event October 15th.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's in your backyard, JJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is, I would go. I have a meeting that day. It's killing me.  Oh, come on. You could cancel that.  What kind of meeting?  It's a big diversity meeting with lots of people coming in.  Oh, you can't cancel that.  Oh, nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we're going to cover it. I presume it's going to be, I think it's 7 a.m.  It's going to be live. They're going to stream it. We will be covering it at 7 a.m.  I will not be in the studio at 7 a.m.  I will be here with Mr. Jason Howell.  Jason Howell and Ant have volunteered to come in very, very early in the morning.  Looking forward to it.  You know, it's a little disappointment for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Kevin's going to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, good. Nice. Kevin would be great.  He's going to be there. Oh, yeah.  Oh, you mean at the event?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, because the Pixelbook 2, right?  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  Kevin will be joining us next week on the show to talk about what he's hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In addition to us covering it here, Florence from All About Android, she's going to be there.  She's attending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's going as well. So Kevin Toffle, Florence Lyon.  So we'll definitely be covering it.  This, according to a 9 to 5 Google, it's a second time that the Pixelbook 2 has shown up at the FCC, which is weird.  A clamshell style Chromebook, codename Atlas.  It'll be built by Quanta, which has built other Google Chromebooks before.  We don't know a whole lot based on this entry.  It has a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  Duh.  Shocking.  Duh. Quanta built the slaves.  Well, if it didn't have those, we would notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I'm curious.  You know, Apple announced at its event, and now we're starting to see new computers come with Wi-Fi 6.  Oh, I knew you would know something about this.  802.11ax.  Stacey Higginbotham.  Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  So this is what we're telling everybody.  The big news about Wi-Fi 6 is it is AX.  It is designed to support many, many devices at once.  So many different devices sending data around.  For most people in the home, this isn't going to be a big deal.  Where it is going to matter is places like corporations, enterprise campuses, stadiums where you're trying to send a lot of data in one place, and kind of big crowds of people.  And what you'll want to do is buy Wi-Fi ready phones or Wi-Fi 6 enabled.  Sorry, sorry.  Wi-Fi 6 enabled phones.  I know the new iPhone is.  When we're talking about your home and your current router purchases, I'm going to tell you not to run out and buy a new router.  Really?  Really.  Because this is not something, until you have like 50 or more devices and they all have to be Wi-Fi 6 compatible, you're not going to see the benefits.  50 is a high number.  We'll say 30 to 40.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what phones are, Stacey, what phones are already, are phones already compatible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the iPhone is, I believe.  The first I've heard.  Huawei, the Huawei.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are new phones announcements coming from OnePlus next week, Huawei, Google, of course.  Huawei's or Wi-Fi 6?  I'm going to guess anything announced from now on will be Wi-Fi 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let me just make sure that Apple Wi-Fi 6.  No, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They made a big deal about it.  I thought you said it was all in the effort.  I swear they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, they made a big deal about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think that's the first phone I'd heard of.  Maybe Huawei.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  So, but there's no benefit to you at home with Wi-Fi 6 if you don't have a Wi-Fi 6 router.  But there might be, as you say, a benefit in a crowded space like a football stadium.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll want it on your phone.  And if you're like a gadget person who goes to lots of events that's going to have Wi-Fi  and tons of people running Wi-Fi in a, like at a launch event, perhaps, you'll want that  on your computer.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll need that for CES.  CES.  So I stand corrected.  ScooterX says that the Samsung S10, S10 Plus, S10e, and presumably that means the Note 10,  all are Wi-Fi 6 as well.  Oh, nice.  So the newest Samsung phones are Wi-Fi 6.  So thank you, ScooterX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you are in the market right now for a new router, like you're like, oh, I'm dying.  I need a router.  Get one that's Wi-Fi 6 ready.  But don't, like, if your router's fine, you can wait a couple of years because in the  home all of your like smart devices that you might think would gain from this aren't because  those devices aren't going to get Wi-Fi 6 for a while.  But it will be good for IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is something if you get a new IoT device, you'd probably look for, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I talked to the product manager over at Google Nest about Wi-Fi 6 and they are.  Here's what they said, that the bill of materials is going to be higher on Wi-Fi 6.  It doesn't necessarily make sense for devices that can't take advantage of it.  And right now there's not a real reason for most smart home devices to try to take advantage  of it.  So I would say you're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a minute to share the nerdy side of it as far as how this is going to work?  Because when I think about it, well, I'm thinking about just being at a stadium or CES or something  like that.  And you have all of this congestion on the network.  Is the router just a better traffic cop at this point?  There's a better traffic cop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then there's also the MIMO.  So OK, call me out here.  Multiple traffic cops.  OK, call me out here.  Multiple in, multiple out.  Yes.  So they have multi-user, multiple in, multiple out.  So MU-MIMO.  MU-MIMO.  Yeah, yeah.  So what's going to happen is with all of those antennas, you're allowed to create more direct paths.  You're allowed to calculate these kind of very direct paths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it beam forming or something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I may be confusing MIMO and beam forming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Beam forming is available in Wi-Fi 5.  Yes.  It's got 11 AC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's the antenna configurations give you more capability.  Now I'm forgetting.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's one of the issues with Wi-Fi.  And I'm curious.  I bet you this is an attempt to solve this, which is it's like Ethernet, a collision-based  network.  So and this is something I only recently learned and I was kind of disappointed to learn.  When you have Wi-Fi traffic in a house, if you have multiple routers or multiple devices,  if two devices start speaking at the same time, the same thing happens on Ethernet.  One device will say, oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  My bad.  And stop.  You go.  The other device will continue.  But then that's the device.  And if it's your device, that means you are now halted.  No more Wi-Fi for you for a period of time, a random period of time.  And then you begin again.  Collision-based networks do not handle a lot of different devices very well.  Ethernet is that way as well.  That's why you segment a LAN in your office to avoid that.  And I think it's one of the reasons Wi-Fi has become increasingly less effective in  a home is because we have so many devices now.  I'm a little sorry to hear that 802.11ax, the new Wi-Fi 6, isn't going to be on IoT  devices because I feel like that's the devices that are screwing up my Wi-Fi.  Possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so most of them aren't always on.  They're low bandwidth devices.  Well, they're low bandwidth and they're very intermittent.  Now, ScooterX just put this in to save me.  Thanks, ScooterX.  He's been our researcher today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wi-Fi 6 access points will be able to divvy up each individual signal between multiple  recipient devices, servicing all of them with a single transmission like a truck driver  making multiple stops on our route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So that's how it's going to deal with congestion.  Yep.  But I don't.  So I can't remember if MIMO is just about capacity.  I really feel like there's not necessarily a beam forming angle, but there's an angle  there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MIMO has been around for a while.  We've had Wi-Fi MIMO for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that's what, so if you listen to Qualcomm, that's what they're, we've had  MIMO on the cellular side for a while.  Right.  And we're now bringing it into Wi-Fi.  And that's why Qualcomm's like, we have such an advantage because we've been doing  cellular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We know MIMO.  Yeah.  But.  Okay.  So this is a good thing to get in a new device.  I understand that something like an Echo or a Bluetooth, you know, your smart lock is  probably not going to be a critical device.  But if you have a camera that's always on like a Nest Cam, I think you would want it  to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I imagine those will come out first.  Yeah.  But again, it's not something you don't see a lot of advantage from it until you get like,  again, like 30 to 50 devices in your house.  But I have that many.  Cameras that need, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, devices, you're right.  But a lot of Echos, a lot of Google assistance, those probably don't need it.  Got everything.  I have so many devices.  It's really out of control.  And I don't see, I think I'm an outlier now, but not for much longer.  This is going to be more and more common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, no, the average, the average home, according to Comcast, I think the most recent  stats, they have 13 devices in their house now.  Everybody has a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody has a phone.  Everybody has some IOT thing.  It's commonplace now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I now have four Nest cameras, a hello doorbell, probably five Echos, maybe an equal number  of Google assistance.  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You are the one person on earth who actually does need Wi-Fi 6 in your house.  Just because of all the crap you have running.  You and Stacey are the two who need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I may be an outlier today, but I think it's common for a lot of people.  I mean, yes, of course.  I mean, Comcast is talking about the average.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we're on the upper end of average.  Show title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The upper end of average.  Yeah.  I'm upper average.  Thank you very much.  All right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So this will be in the new Pixel 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To get back to Pixelbook 2, it will be in the new Pixelbook 2 code name Atlas.  No, I'm sorry.  This all came up because I said I don't see it in the specs for the Pixelbook 2.  So maybe it won't be.  Why do you need a new Pixelbook?  Is yours wearing out, Jeff?  Mine's two years old and it's starting to do occasionally flaky things with the video.  And I use it to do things that I don't want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So in my old routine, you who buys something new every week, I've got a little FOMO lost here just to get a new computer.  So I feel secure.  You want a new computer.  Well, don't you want more processing power and horsepower in particular?  Yeah, I'll have all that too.  But if you have a Pixelbook, you got a lot of horsepower.  You have a lot of overhead.  I do.  I love the machine.  I got nothing wrong with the machine now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just that you can't get a lot of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not going to get a lot of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to get a lot of power.  I'm going to get a lot of power.  I'm going to get a lot of power.  I'm going to get a lot of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to get a lot of power.  It's just that I'm guessing it's going to die.  I'd rather get something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, explicitly, the FCC listing says the Pixelbook 2 does not support Wi-Fi 6.  It is a Wi-Fi 5 device.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not taking it to Stadia.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should be okay with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not.  I want the latest.  I want aX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this isn't you.  That's not me.  Well, here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I wanted, of course, as you know, is LTE because my intention was to get a Fi data  SIM.  Is that all going to go away now?  Or is that is Fi going to just become another phone company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think that that was the impression I got when they announced this new flat pricing,  the $80 a month flat pricing, because it's a terrible deal unless you know you're going  to use all those gigabytes.  They are not killing what we use.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have an unlimited plan, but that's more so they can say to people who are going to  Verizon, well, ours is 10 bucks less.  They say consumers understand that better.  But the existing plan, which has I can't remember the name of it.  It's not unlimited.  It's the other one.  Pay as you go sort of is going to stay.  And that's honestly a great deal.  They said one reason consumers don't like it is that they don't know what they're going  to pay every month.  That's dumb.  So you overpay.  So it's the same amount every month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If this is why people get excited about tax refunds every time something like, dude, you  just let the government have your money.  You're letting them money.  That's your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're getting back.  But it's just a consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's easier to think about.  I get it.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't there some type of flexible gig cap or so that actually that's you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They throttle you back.  It's 20 to 20.  Same for unlimited, by the way.  That's no different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same as most places.  Who uses the same?  Who uses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly the same as Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really, as far as I can think, the only reason they do that is so you don't use it as residential  Internet because you'd have to be doing that to get that much data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I once did Twig from a show on my phone because the broadband in the press room was so bad.  What did you use?  I used, I think, five to six gigabytes streaming the show.  I'm sorry.  And my, you know, we got a note from our plan, like you're out of, and my daughter thought  it was her and she kept like her like phone.  Oh, she in trouble.  That happened to me.  She put her phone on airplane mode everywhere she went and I felt so bad for that.  We told her it was us, but she was like, I thought it was me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, you have a nice daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That happened to me at CES one year when I was uploading a lot of doing a lot of live  streams and just uploading a lot of content and everybody in the house was getting that  notification and my son was freaking out.  He's like, well, I promised dad I wasn't doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so Ant and I, it's going to be the Leo and Ant on the Road show at CES this year.  It's going to be.  And the plan is to use probably the new iPhone to shoot a bunch of interviews and then just  upload them as we go.  I'm going to use.  I'm on T-Mobile.  Will that be?  I hope it's going to be all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you need multiple plans for something like that.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I will.  I can bring different SIMs and multiple phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He will have five phones in his pocket.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or just one phone and several SIMs, whichever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's a good idea.  You're a good thinking, Stacey.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Fi will also limit video streaming video to incoming to four.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what everybody does with these quote unlimited plans.  So I do hope it's not a sign that fi the fi model isn't working for Google.  They're going to be moving you to unlimited.  I love it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the unlimited.  I have a second phone.  I use it when I'm out of town.  It's worth it for me to keep it going just for that reason.  But if they raise the price or become a regular plan, then I'm stuck.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then you switch over to T-Mobile.  Well, then I've got to get rid of.  No, actually, I have to do.  Or you could do like Ting or something like that.  Ting, our sponsor, by the way, Mint Mobile is a great deal.  So Mint Mobile is I paid 300.  You pay at front a whole year.  So I paid 300 bucks for a year of 12 gigabytes a month for a year.  And then unlimited phone calls.  International?  No, they ride on T-Mobile.  That's why I have fi.  Yeah, fi is the thing for.  That's by the way.  And this is purely on a personal note, but I'm disappointed that Google's event is on the 15th because I won't be able to get a Pixel 4 for my drip.  I'm leaving on the 21st.  I'm really bummed.  Unless they have them that day, which they nobody ever does.  No, they won't.  Pixel 4 will be doing its own face ID at Google.  I don't know.  Are they going to still have fingerprint?  Have fingerprint?  I don't know.  I hope so.  I hope so.  I would hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want this face crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd rather have the fingerprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've teased the face ID and this will be using the Project Soli technology.  They've teased it with a little video that shows that you can.  It'll recognize you just at an angle.  And then there's this new hand gestures, which again, I don't know why.  Gimmick.  Gimmick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know.  I'm still sad that Soli isn't available in the Nest Hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, by the way, did you get your Hub Max yet?  No.  I did.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I ordered.  I thought I finished ordering it, but I didn't.  Oh, I've done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went back and ordered it.  Oh, no.  So I got it.  I had it for a few days.  It's the speaker's disappointing.  It's not as good as the Echo Show, even the original Echo Show.  It's OK, but it's not great.  I was hoping for better.  You've got a bigger device.  The screen, though, is beautiful.  Because I love the little one I have on my bedside table.  That one doesn't have a camera.  This one does.  If you turn on face recognition, which I did, it's a little creepy.  Oh, no.  Horrors.  When you walk up to it, it says, oh, hi, Leo.  Oh, no.  It knows that you're there.  It starts showing you your cali.  It goes, here's what you got today.  Here's your specially customized news.  The whole thing is completely customized for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd dig that if it wasn't scanning my face.  How else is it going to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's terrible at voice recognition.  So this is a good option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it, but we've talked many times on this show about the creepy line.  It's right up against it.  It straddles that creepy line.  But I turn it on.  You have to turn it on.  It's not on by default.  No, that's good.  It's opt-in.  And I have to say, so I thought, well, if I'm going to get that, I should get the Hello Doorbell,  the ring to see how the Nest is different because it's always on, right?  Stacey, that's the big difference.  It's unlike the ring, which has to kind of turn on.  So there's this lag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't remember if it's always on, but it's definitely faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello is always on.  The ring, I get the UPS guy's butt most of the time as he's leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How's that butt though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, those shorts are very flattering.  I'm like, that's a thing for a reason.  But the camera's pretty much, it looks the same.  It's very wide angle.  I like it though that I can say to my Nest Max, stream the front door.  It's on.  It's there.  And I have now Nest cameras everywhere.  For years, I laughed at people who had cameras.  It's just making you nervous.  There's no reason.  And now I kind of like it.  I can see what's going on everywhere.  There's somebody at our front door right now.  You know, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You talked about the speaker on it.  What expectations do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you mean for the Nest Hub, my home hub, next max thing?  Yeah.  Well, it should sound as good as the Echo Show.  It's their version of the Echo Show.  I just don't think any of them should sound good.  It has a nice, it should have a decent base.  It doesn't.  It's okay.  I'm going to buy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I figured you should sound like a beach speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.  No more, no less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like a low-end beach speaker.  Some have more, a little more bass.  Oh, wow.  My Lenovo display.  We'll do a hot review.  Everybody can hear it for themselves.  How does that sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My Lenovo display, that sounds pretty good.  I'm going to have to compare them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if audio is important, I think you should get the Lenovo rather than the Google.  But the Google seems to have more features.  You could do duo calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can do duo calling on the Lenovo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe there's more features.  Okay.  They did say that it's not the same technology that Lenovo uses.  It's more like a Chromecast technology in the Google version or the Nest version.  Nest version.  Which is weird.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it.  I think it's, you know, but I see maybe I'm an outlier because I loved the Echo Show when  it came out.  I thought this is the best one ever.  This is so great.  I love having a screen.  The reason I had the Echo Show is because I could say, show my ring doorbell, because  they're both Amazon.  So I thought, well, I should get the hello.  Right.  Just to tie it all together.  But one little issue on the hello.  And I don't know.  Do you have a hello to Stacey?  I used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't on this house.  It's supposed to do people recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  It's starting to do it now.  It only recognized one person so far.  You have to train it.  As in someone that you trained?  Yeah, I'm going to train it now.  That's Michael.  And then it says it hasn't seen anyone new yet.  Once they do return to the screen.  Now I've had it in place for a week.  It should have seen a lot of new people.  Did you just opt into it or maybe it just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the other thing it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This may be illegal in some jurisdictions.  Yeah.  And I wanted to ask you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are the implications of someone...  It says find out what the laws are in your location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is an interesting punt because when I had an alarm company install a doorbell  for me, so I had Vivint come install their doorbell about two years ago in my old house,  what I found most interesting is they actually forced me to put up a little sticker that  said this premises is monitored video or whatever.  Google, they send those ring sends them in their box, but they don't require you to put  that up.  And I was very curious because the Vivint guy was like, yeah, you have to put that up  if you've got a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're on my freaking property.  That depends per state though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what the...  You definitely have to do that.  I know you have to do that in Washington.  I don't think you have to do that in California.  Here's what the language is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Use this feature in compliance with the law.  Depending on where you live, you might need to get the consent of people visiting your  home.  I don't know how you would get consent before...  Well, what you do is you just put a sign up on the outside like we do at the school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you enter this home, you're going to be videoed, recorded.  Right.  We have that in the studio.  And maybe a photo of it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I want to say Megan Maroney did that.  She just stuck signs up just to see why...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it would have a good deterrent, but I don't know.  I don't want to do that.  That seems kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's not weird to...  We're watching you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're on my property.  They're on my property.  Can't I take a picture of them on my property?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the company you have at the flat to sign in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not just your property though.  So here's an example we used actually to talk about Nest, or sorry, about Ring and the deals  with police departments.  You can sometimes, not every case, see other people's property.  So if your neighbor across the street is smoking weed on his porch...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see that.  But I mean, I can see the drive and I can see the street out front.  Right, the street out front.  But then I don't see anybody's face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I know.  I understand being in public.  But there's a difference between...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is somebody's way, way, way far away is the other person's property.  Well, we're talking about legality now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes.  But there's also like this...  One of the issues with something like having a doorbell cam like this that is accessible,  like whose files are accessible to law enforcement, is they can look for that.  Like they could do something like face recognition for, let's say, an immigrant.  Maybe it's ICE trying to find people to round up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the difference in the police having it.  I'm not sharing this with my law enforcement.  This is a different issue.  This is just mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's definitely legal for police in California to use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and by the way, that's going to become a campaign issue.  I think some of the Democratic candidates for president have already said, I think it's  Bernie Sanders has already said, we want to make it illegal in every jurisdiction for  police to use face recognition of any kind.  We have a story about that.  Which just drives me nuts, yes.  It seems like a useful policing tool.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and not just policing, but again, I keep on the same examples, missing children,  missing Alzheimer's patients.  There are legitimate criminals who have just shot up a bunch of people because we have  guns in this country.  The technology is not what the problem is.  If you have problems with the police, you have problems with the police.  Yes, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would recommend a moratorium until they figure out the rules for how to do this.  Yeah, the rules on how to use them and until facial recognition gets better.  That's the biggest problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a great piece by Benedict Evans from Andreessen Horowitz in the rundown about  justice.  Yes.  And Ben's brilliant.  If you don't follow Ben on Twitter and get an email newsletter, I'm telling you you want  to.  What Ben says, he goes back and he looks at how there were similar fears around databases.  And when you got something wrong in a database, there were all kinds of books at the time,  right?  Data banks in a free society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People are still dealing with database problems though, Jeff.  Look at the no fly list.  That is a perfect example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ben goes through that and he says, yes, there are examples of these kinds of mistakes.  Those mistakes are there.  Yes.  But that doesn't mean that we eliminate all databases.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not eliminating facial recognition.  We're saying that we should put a moratorium on using facial recognition for policing purposes  in various cities and cities themselves are voting on this local municipalities.  This isn't even a federal or even a state wide.  It's banned in San Francisco.  Moral panic.  Moral panic.  These citizens are saying that this is what they want.  Because they're getting drummed up by moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff.  No, because the technology is not there yet.  It's not ready.  The facial recognition technology is not ready for law enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Listen, folks, I'm sorry, but if you have a relative who has Alzheimer's, it's fine  for you to say, oh no, but sorry, you can't find it because it's going to take another  two years to get this ready.  The point is not the technology.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me just finish one sentence.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You interrupted me with your moral panic stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to finish telling you why facial recognition is not awesome.  One, it doesn't work the way you're saying it works.  You don't just feed in someone's face and then all the cameras in the city.  This is not Minority Report yet.  So that's one, Jeff.  Two, the way that police departments have been using it, and this is documented in New  York City and other places, is not, it is an overreach.  It is not using the technology in a way that is catching people, catching the right people.  The right people.  So that's what you regulate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What you regulate then is, no, you say, can I regulate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that has anything to do with moral.  That's just whether it's right or wrong.  The tech is not there yet.  It's just not there.  Listen, look at it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's input data, right?  A witness tells you that person just stole something.  That person could be lying.  That person could write.  That person could be wrong.  What you do with that piece of information, that one piece of data, so-and-so says, so-and-so  stole something, is what a justice system is all about.  But it's just one piece of data and we have structures to look through that.  In this case, you have one piece of data.  The computer says this person looks like this person.  Well, then you've got plenty of ways to say it either is or is not that person.  If you go shoot somebody because of it, yes, that'd be wrong.  If you arrest them and put them in jail for the rest of their lives, that'd be wrong.  But we have justice systems to deal with data.  Do the police screw things up and are they often benevolent, especially around race?  Yes, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if we replace the word face recognition with fingerprints?  Because fingerprints aren't perfect.  There are false positives.  Some people don't have fingerprints.  Fingerprints are a very useful law enforcement tool, however.  And I think with fingerprints, you have that kind of protection that you're talking about, Jeff.  Nobody just relies solely on fingerprints.  But isn't that a useful law enforcement tool?  Isn't that like face recognition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just saying, you regulate the use of the information.  Sorry, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So fingerprints are really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacy. I'm sorry.  No, no, no. You go ahead, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, fingerprints are way more reliable based on just how long we've been around and how long the development has been there.  But they're not perfect.  They're not perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're also not as accessible.  I'll add on to that.  So to get a fingerprint actually requires you send a person out and dust for prints.  And that is much less...  So again, I want to tie this back to that concept we talked about several episodes.  So this is just a better way of doing it because it's easier and faster.  Well, but that kills your privacy in a lot of ways.  So that's that ambient privacy idea.  So if I can pull out this...  If you had my face on your camera, that's a lot better, right?  To actually try to match it against faces in the system.  What the police are doing now is they're saying...  Someone will say like, oh, the Woody Harrelson guy actually.  This guy looked like Woody Harrelson.  And so they ran faces of Woody Harrelson.  They ran against Woody Harrelson to find this particular person.  Did they find him? Yes.  Is that a great way to use this?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but you have to trust...  I think Benedict is right in the sense that the real issue is not lack of trust in the technology.  It's a lack of trust in police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes, that is true.  It's the same problem with the Woody Harrelson thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That seems like a crappy idea.  But you can't give a baby a knife.  But that's all they had. It worked.  And if you trust the rest of the police process, it worked effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't give people who aren't ready for the tools the tool.  And that's what these moratoriums are trying to do.  They're saying, you know what?  We're not trustworthy enough to have this as a tool.  And I don't think that's that's not a wrong thing to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But again, for what?  Right. Let's let's let's take out crime.  Let's take out crime for a second.  Would you be OK if they use this technology for missing children?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or if Tay-Tay used this at her concert to block stalkers from getting into the concert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you could ask that law...  So Tay-Tay is an interesting thing because that's private.  You can opt into that.  Using it for missing children, it depends on how they use it.  And it depends on where that data goes.  So the point is made that it does depend on the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Use. It depends on the use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't just depend on the use.  So it depends on the use. It depends on who has access.  Would I give this to an organization that isn't like the police?  Actually, maybe.  So that's why I would give it to Taylor Swift, you know, to go see her concert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think she's far more trustworthy than our local police department.  I'm just... I mean, these are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get you.  Taylor Swift is an armed...  Everybody does not need all of that particular power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's unreasonable to say let's slow down or let's have a moratorium.  I think that is not an unreasonable thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who says when it's ready? Who's the god of ready then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The citizens. That's why they're being decided at the municipal level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're always the god of ready.  They're being pumped up by moral panic.  Before we leave Benedict's piece, can I just point out this neat chart he has in there  which he gave credit for which I think is a really nice expression of machine learning  just for future use for PowerPoints, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. So classical programming.  I've said this for a long time. This is my definition.  It's just really done.  This is actually my definition of artificial intelligence.  Normal programming, you give it...  The programmer gives it rules, then gives it data.  The computer program applies the rules to the data, results in an answer.  That's algorithmic programming.  I think a lot of what we call AI is actually that.  Real AI, real machine learning, you give it a ton of data.  You give it answers. So you say these are all bananas.  Then it generates its own rules for picking bananas from hot dogs.  I think that is very useful for everybody.  It's a nice little chart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Ben went on Twitter, he found this, and he said, does anybody know who did this?  And sure enough, Francois Choulet did, and he put credit in it.  But I think it's a very nice little PowerPoint thing. I just want to mention that.  It was a nice way of changing the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would also just to put a button on this conversation.  If you want more of this, more conversation about this, you can check out Triangulation, episode 400.  We talked about the guy behind the San Francisco police ban on facial recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Ben, I can't remember his last name.  Yeah, that was a very interesting triangulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very good job of promo.  Thanks, Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to give our other shows a little bit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we want to give more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you put a button on it or do you put a bow on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's more of a button than a bow kind of guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm like, wait, have I been saying that wrong this whole time?  Because it just happened all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Harvard thing.  You can tie a bow around it or you can put a button on it.  I think both phrases work.  I like button. That seems a little more archaic than bow.  But I may have made that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may be a neologism, but I'm allowed to do that because I'm a Harvard major.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Put a button in it is fantastic.  Harvard is where the home of neologisms in the United States of America.  Let's take a little break.  You know what Mr. Harvard needs?  He needs Grammarly.  You know, I always said to myself, I don't need Grammarly because my grammar is perfect.  Then I started using Grammarly and went, oh, maybe I do need it because it's more than grammar.  OK, the basic free version of Grammarly is spelling and grammar.  But then there's Grammarly Premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I totally use it.  Havid uses Grammarly.  I thought you were the one person who doesn't use it.  I very much depend on Grammarly.  No, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all use it at Twit now, and it's really good.  So it always tells me I'm in the 99th percentile for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Me too.  What is it, productivity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no.  I'm a number of words used.  Oh, I'm just productivity.  I'm like, what is that even measuring?  It just finds whichever category you're in.  It finds whatever you're good at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes up a category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really basically, Stacey's just saying to you, man, you write a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I do, but it's like, oh, your errors are just really basic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm probably one-th percentile in productivity.  I don't write at all.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just curious what other people got as their, yeah, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Verge says Pixel 4 is the most leaked phone ever, partly with the help of Google, by the way.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  These are pro Google leaks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We now know there is going to be an orange one as well as a black and white one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Coral.  Coral.  Coral.  Coral.  No, I hate their coral.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't feel so bad.  Is that really coral?  It looks more orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what they're calling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're calling it coral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They always have weird names.  To some people, they'll market it as the Trump phone and it'll be fine.  Oh, gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe I won't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, orange is like my favorite color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Cheeto color.  It is far from Cheeto.  Big camera square around back.  Everybody's doing it.  Everybody's doing it now, this big bump.  Everybody except OnePlus.  OnePlus doesn't seem to.  No, I love the OnePlus too.  They don't even have a notch.  They don't even have anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it have to bump because the phone's too thin?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it?  So it turns out the quality of the phone is somewhat reliant on the depth that the camera  has, the lens to the sensor.  So all of the better phones now.  By the way, I loved it.  John Gruber today in Daring Fireball said, why don't they just call it the iCamera and  be done with it?  They didn't even mention that it makes phone calls with the Apple of it.  Does anybody use their phone to make phone calls?  It's a camera, right?  So as the cameras get better on these iCameras, you're going to see these bumps just because  you need those.  The iCameras.  Just the iCameras.  Yeah.  So just call it the iCamera and be done with it.  Is there a fingerprint reader?  Even with all the leaks, we still don't know.  We do know the project solely will be used for better face recognition.  I'm not a fan of face recognition, mostly because it works pretty well in almost all  environments.  But the one time my iPhone, I can't ever get to wake it up, is when my face is on the pillow  squished like that.  Right.  And then it says, I don't know, are you a dog?  Are you a corpse?  I don't recognize you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you having a stroke?  Blink!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you having a stroke?  So it's not good in bed at night, but every other place it seems to work pretty well.  I've kind of gotten used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish it had both.  Just give me the fingerprint scanner.  Yeah, it works so well on the Pixel 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so good.  You're a Pixel 3 guy, right?  I am.  Yeah.  I told Ant yesterday that you're going to be a Pixel 4 guy.  He was happy to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was happy to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We told him when you were gone to just look very poor and whiny about how he really would  be really nice to have a 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have a good division here of people who use iPhones and Android phones, but we've  got to make sure we keep parity so that the Android phones are well represented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was that your excuse, Ant?  I'm sorry, I'll do Android if you insist.  Look, he's using Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My God.  Right.  And I'm the only person using Windows at the studio as well.  Pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because Paul's not at the...  So is the coral, is that going to be like a Clemson orange?  That's what I'm hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I'm hoping.  That's Ant's dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He just put a little tiger paw on that.  Put a paw on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd have one on the screen and on the back.  It would be beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ad in Times Square is not looking quite that orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we should see that, yeah, because Google really leaning into the leaks has now posted  a big ad on Times Square with the picture of the coral phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not leaning in when you're sending these units out.  I still believe they're sending those units.  That's not a leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is early PR.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As I said on all about Android, that's marketing 201.  Is that a better strategy than Apple's strategy, which is to keep it secret?  I think so.  Just go ahead and embrace it.  Especially if you can't stop the leaks.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just go ahead and embrace it.  So Apple tries, but fails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they put a bullet in Mark Gurman, they'd be fine, but that guy is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple pulls a lot of energy just trying to stop it and get stuff taken down.  Why burn all those calories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just roll with it.  And don't you think that part of this is that these days, after all the secrecy with Apple,  people end up being disappointed in the announcement?  Yeah.  This is true.  But it's a letdown.  So now with Google, there's no letdown.  You know what it is.  You actually get to see it.  To me, if you had something really major like a spectacular new Pixelbook, you might want  to keep that really secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to have a little bit of an excitement when these events come around, but I get it.  It keeps all of the disappointment at bay, allegedly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of think these events are silly now.  I was reflecting upon this because Apple, with their event, they've got all this pressure  to create this big bang buzz kind of thing.  And right now, we're not at a phase.  So it feels like, you know, when you're a kid and you stop believing in Santa Claus and  Christmas is maybe you don't have anything awesome coming.  Don't tell Leo.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe in Santa Claus.  By the way, I just want to point out, if you don't believe in Santa Claus, he doesn't bring  you gifts.  That's my problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feels like you just go through the motions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that what Corey Lewandowski said in his testimony in front of Congress?  Because the guy said, I don't believe this anymore than I believe the tooth fairy.  And Corey said, my kids are watching.  Oh, man.  Corey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the least of their problems.  Corey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Stacey, you're channeling Charlie Wartzel, who is a tech writer for The New York Times  now, also opinion writer, who just a couple of days ago published this opinion piece,  The Last Apple Keynote.  Let's hope the company's product launch pageant has become a parody.  Time to call it quits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I haven't read this, but does he go into the fact that we may just be at a point  of not necessarily stagnation, but innovation stagnation?  You know, there's only so much we can do with these phones now.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there's other devices that they're launching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, What started as a Steve Jobs Ted Talk has become a parody.  This is his chief point.  A decadent pageant of Palo Alto executives closed in their closed in their finest dad  casual reading ad copy as lead in for vaguely sexual jump cut videos of brushed aluminum  under nightclub lighting.  The events.  Hot take of hot takes.  I know.  I love it.  Exhausting love letters to consumerism complete with rounds of applause from the laptop lit  faces of the tech blogging audience when executives mentioned that you, yes, you can hold the  future in your hands for just $24.95 a month or $5.99 with trade-in.  The tech bloggers are not the ones applauding.  Yes.  John Gruber was quick to point out that that's not who's applauding.  That's the staff, right?  Yeah.  Gruber said it really isn't a press event very much.  At Steve Jobs, he doesn't have a lot of room, so it's not a lot of press.  And obviously Apple employees who are and certainly those are the ones cheering.  At least I hope so.  Here's Matt Hovind Honin's tweet.  Apple serving Gilded desserts at today's event sure does seem symbolic of something.  That is a Gilded Macaron.  And a lemon bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, looks like a delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, I haven't been to an Apple event since 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey's reverse engineering the desserts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they've really upgraded the stale muffins they served back in the day.  It's like green stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. Go back down.  What's the...oh, it looks like some green thing.  Kombucha?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Soylent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, it's a smoothie, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But honestly, these are much fancier than they used to do.  Superfood.  Yeah, superfood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I appreciate Apple putting their effort in to try to give it a little bit of pizzazz and some showmanship and marketing, if you will.  But at the end of the day, it's still pretty hard to sexy up a phone because they're all doing pretty much the same thing where there's an Apple phone, Google phone, Huawei.  Everybody's pretty much doing the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Young man, I'm old enough to remember when people would sleep out in line for two days to get one of these new phones.  I was one of the people who did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember that too and I thought they were nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Gruber pointed out...  Hey, you just called the boss nuts, but that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gruber pointed out on Daring Fireball that he would not want to be in Kim Cook's shoes when he goes to the board and says, oh, by the way, guys, we're not going to be doing these events anymore.  He says, look at the... we don't get numbers from Apple about how many people watch the events, but look at the YouTube.  They, for the first time, they put it on YouTube.  4.2 million views of this event since September 10th on YouTube.  Apple has 10 million YouTube subscribers.  This is not for the press anymore.  This is for the public.  This is for Apple fans and it works.  It sells phones.  They're going to keep selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But as the public, I mean, we're going to keep going because you get the most page views when you do Apple stuff.  But honestly, it's...  Hey, I'm not doing this for page views.  What do you think?  I'm just saying that's why...  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a podcast network?  Honestly, I'm not doing it because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was my job.  We used to have to track all this.  And this is where...  I mean, September was always the biggest month.  I'm sorry, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm hurt that you think that we do this for the page views.  I do it because I care.  I do it because it's a good topic.  About the page views.  No!  I mean, I used to...  I have never done anything to increase the audience on this show.  I think everybody will agree.  No comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our marketing staff would agree with that statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's their job, not mine.  I'm here to give you great content.  And I believe great content will be all I'll have to do.  Definitely.  Everybody's laughing at me now.  Lisa's in here going, yeah, right.  That's what I do.  The NLRB has ordered Google to let employees speak out on political and workplace issues.  This is a settlement.  There were complaints that Google was restraining free speech.  In fact, remember when Google said, we're not going to allow any more political speech on our internal bulletin boards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is talking about them talking to the public.  Including about salaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NLRB said you can talk about salaries.  I can't imagine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think in these cases we've got to ask a few things.  Number one, we've got to ask, were the complainants purely political on one side of things?  And was the process purely political or was this a legitimate process?  We're forced to ask this all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so sad that this is the state of the nation.  It could be legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be one wing versus the other says, you're being mean to us.  You can't talk.  I find it odd to say, listen, to say that you can talk publicly about how your employer does bad things.  Yes.  But beyond that, to force the ability to do political speech in the company, outside the company, sure.  Inside, to reveal salaries.  So I don't know how to read this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I should be able to tell people my salary if I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a historic tension between employees and employers.  Employers, of course, want employees to be in the dark about what the other employers are making.  It gives us, well, there's two arguments.  One is it just breeds discontent.  But the other argument, which is probably the more realistic argument, is we don't want you negotiating based on someone else.  I don't want Ant coming to me saying, you're paying, Micah, what?  So it's best if nobody knows that.  On the other hand, employees, it absolutely is important.  It's very valuable.  That's why there's websites where you can go and see what the typical salaries are for people because it gives you power to negotiate.  So I have to wear two hats because I am both an employer and an employee.  And I would like to tell you how much I make, but I actually don't know.  No idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lisa lets you know at the end of every month or the end of every year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not allowed to tell myself how much I make.  It's against the rules.  So no, actually, I really don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are only tools when he doesn't make enough to get what he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the problem is, OK, so nobody cares about this, but this is an LLC.  So it's pass-through taxation.  So basically, our tax return, because Lisa and I file jointly, is what we make.  But it's really, with the company, it's like a bigger entity.  And I definitely know I don't get whatever that is because I am definitely not getting all that money.  I think somebody else is, but I don't know.  Appreciate you having me.  Yeah, thank you.  I hope you're happy.  Hey, we had to get him to move out here from North Carolina.  Google Nests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're getting paid in Outback Steakhouse gift certificates, right?  Yes.  That's what I'm getting paid in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the queso you can eat, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All the Bloomin' Onions on the floor.  Bloomin' Onions everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google is apparently, according to 9.5 Google, planning a new Wi-Fi hub.  It won't look like the old one.  This is an artist's rendering, the old Wi-Fi with a Google Home Assistant on top of it.  It will not look like that either.  Don't get excited.  It's well lit.  That is clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doing a mock-up right now.  That is clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just need the duct tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Kevin broke this story.  I just have to give props to Kevin all the way back in April,  because he found the chip in the language in Chromium for Mistral and then did all this other stuff related to it.  So I just want to give a big shout out to Kevin Toffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And again, he'll be on next week.  We'll be talking about this.  That's awesome.  The 9.5 Google post says, according to sources familiar with the matter,  Google will announce this new router at the event on October 15th.  The Nest Wi-Fi...  Everything's going to be Nest now, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All their home products are now Nest, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nest Wi-Fi router will be accompanied by little beacons that double as assistant speakers.  That's nice.  Assistant everywhere, LD.  That's pretty cool.  Listening everywhere.  Did you watch...  No cameras, all right.  Did you watch Succession on Sunday?  So Tom, who is just complete mess up, has a new slogan for the News Network ATN.  We're listening.  And his assistant, Cousin Greg...  Oh, I'm sorry.  He wants to be called Gregory now.  Cousin Gregory comes up and says, we can't use that.  Tom says, why?  Well, because we actually are listening.  Oh, man.  It turns out the set-top boxes we've sent everybody have microphones.  And well, it's fairly aggressively listening.  About that.  So...  Yeah.  So then, well, what about we hear you?  No, that's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm behind two episodes.  So I give it away.  You're going to laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They ended up with the slogan, We Hear For You.  It is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like a Silicon Valley episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is actually comedic.  It's the most comedic of episodes.  What is this show's succession?  Oh, it's on HBO.  HBO is so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did they get...  Leo, did they get the...  I saw a lot of comment going on about the Allen Summer Camp.  It's our jesties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They nailed that.  They call it our jesties.  It is absolutely nailed.  Right down to the...  What was it?  Oh, God, I can't remember the exact name.  What's the European airline...  The Airbus Eco Walk Lecture.  What?  They walk over a bridge in ponchos while they're talking about their commitment to sustainable something.  Oh, wow.  You're going to love it, Jeff.  Have you been to Allen & Co.?  No.  Okay.  But you've been to Davos.  You've been to enough things like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Davos, yeah.  There were a lot of Davos jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That you'll probably recognize.  Oh, it's the best show on TV.  So good now.  In fact, if you're too behind, the episode you're about to see next is absolutely one  of the best shows I've ever seen.  Wow.  So good.  All right.  I don't know.  I got off track.  The Assistant.  We hear you, the router.  We're listening.  So now you'll have devices with microphones in every room of the home.  Sources say Google's adopting an Eero-like package with Nest Wi-Fi.  Really?  But that was always the pitch of the Google Wi-Fi was that it was mesh, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the Assistant that's the cool new part.  You're adding the Assistant.  But yes, it was always mesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The smaller devices will double as Assistant speakers as well as microphones while the  main router will not.  Oh.  Which is odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see that in action.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you'll be able to use it with your old Google Wi-Fi hardware.  So if you have existing hardware, it'll still work.  But not Wi-Fi 6.  Wi-Fi 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not Wi-Fi 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Wi-Fi 6.  I use Eero's, of course.  I think they'll probably have to do hardware, right?  Stacey, you can't do a software upgrade, so you'll have to do a hardware upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this will need new hardware.  They're a sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I also use Netgear's Orbeez, and they've already announced Wi-Fi 6 Orbeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm telling you, you don't need no one.  But again, it doesn't matter for the home, right?  I don't need it.  Don't run out and buy a new router for this.  Unless you're buying a router.  If you're buying a router, look for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have 60 devices plus.  Stacey said so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But dude, they're not going to work.  You're going to have to get all new devices that are Wi-Fi 6 compatible.  Wow, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have to be Wi-Fi 6 compatible.  Like Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, that just gives them the excuse to buy all those new devices.  I can buy new devices.  They're not out yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to get into Leo's head here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can buy new devices.  As you say, buy new devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plant the seed.  Plant the seed.  Stacey told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, don't tell Lisa any of this.  Lisa, I didn't say that he should buy new devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not buying new devices.  Google has published a paper on the Google AI blog about using deep learning to inform  differential diagnoses of skin diseases.  AI is slowly marching into medicine.  We've seen in the past that AI did a pretty good job interpreting x-rays, doing the job  of a radiologist.  General practitioners, when shown images of skin conditions, are between 24 and 70% accurate.  You're GP.  If you're a dermatologist, it's much better, 77 to 96% accurate.  But a lot of people can't get to a dermatologist or they don't have the access to a dermatologist.  That's why there's this interest.  It's not that dermatologists don't do a very good job.  They know what they're looking at.  Right.  But it would help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would take me six to eight weeks to get into a dermatologist.  If I thought I had some sort of cancerous lesion, I guess then it might be like, yes,  this is 75% likely to be melanoma.  Then I'd be like, ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How soon before it's an app?  Cancer app.  It should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So that's an interesting question.  Should it be because of this?  Again, if we don't have the medical infrastructure to help me out, I see this, then I go to my doctor.  My doctor doesn't know how credible it is.  Is this going to be FDA approved?  I don't know.  And the FDA currently has.  So I have my cardio.  Well, yeah.  My cardio.  That has been approved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has been approved.  It has been approved.  And it doesn't just do a good EKG.  It reads the EKG and says whether I'm an AFib in a reliable way because of machine learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  This is the AliveCore product.  It's 99 bucks.  It works with a smartphone.  Did you get the new Cardia?  K-A-R-D-I-A.  Is there a new Cardia?  I think there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is, yeah.  AliveCore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is actually.  This matters to me.  Yeah.  I think it's a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it a watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me go to their website and see AliveCore.com.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, there it is.  Cardia 6L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you had occasion to use it?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's more diodes.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There it is.  Six views of the heart, six times the data.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  It's a six-lead EKG.  So this was, of course, the original Cardia was two leads.  Two thumbs.  Right.  The Apple Watch is two leads.  You put your one finger, your finger on the stem, and then it reads your wrist.  A traditional EKG is 12 leads, and of course, much more accurate as a result.  This is a six-lead, though.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How does it do six leads from just two fingers?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Science.  Magic.  AI.  You have all the answers.  I don't know.  It's got two sensors on top and now a third on the bottom.  It's magical.  So you put it on your thigh.  So your left leg.  Oh.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I got to pull my pants up or I got to start wearing skirts.  Wear skirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Larger muscles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it's an excuse to wear shorts.  In fact, yeah.  Can you do it on your arms?  You don't want to see me in shorts.  I'm wearing shorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You do not want to see me in shorts.  Yeah.  My thighs have not seen sunlight since 1976.  You don't want to see me in shorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're probably a Fitzpatrick type one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was reading on this.  It turns out this is relevant to the Google AI skin thing.  There are these Fitzpatrick types.  There are six of them.  Type one, pale white, always burns, never tans.  Is that you?  Oh, I burn.  Yeah.  Type six, darkest brown, never burns.  The best accuracy was achieved on two through four.  So not quite as accurate on darker skins or yours, really pale skin.  The accuracy was similar to actually even a little bit better than the general partitioner.  69% to 72% accurate.  The top three accuracy, 91% to 94% accurate.  That's pretty strong.  It's good enough.  Gives you some idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I like that they had to parcel out, parcel, partition out the data so they could say it's accurate on this type of skin.  Isn't that interesting?  Which really matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what you should do with face recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really critical and important with race as well and what the learning set is.  Yes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so this gets to this FDA thing I was trying to talk about, which is as we start bringing in machine learning products into medical devices, which is important, we're going to need a process for when they retrain their algorithms for making sure that it works better than the other one, for example.  So just like if you have a new formulation of the drug, you have to go through new testing things.  The FDA is trying to figure out what's the process by which you should update your machine learning algorithms in a medical device.  And I think it's really fascinating because they're talking about how to do reproducibility, how to make sure your data sets are all in a good sample size, I guess.  It's a really tough problem.  Try to standardize things.  Yeah, well, and standardize it and also do it in a way to make sure that the Fitzpatrick one people also, you know, you know who this is not going to work for, for example.  It's trying to not to be a bit biased, but address it and make sure that people are aware of it and it's communicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a piece that we already mentioned that Ben Evans uses the now classic example with AI that if you have a bunch of pictures with rulers on them next to the lesion, that at some point, if you don't do things right, your AI will identify skin with rulers as skin with cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent example.  Every time I see a ruler, there's cancer.  That's how dumb these things are.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want to get the new Cardia mobile 6L Jeff it's 150 bucks.  I'm about to get it. I'm going to get it.  It's still very reasonable. And of course you need a smartphone.  This is a point. This is the.  That's all. Really?  Yeah, I know.  The old one's $99.  For that tech?  This is the magnifying factor.  It's like, you know, who was it Archimedes said, give me a lever and a proper fulcrum and I can move the world.  This is the fulcrum is the smartphone.  You are carrying a supercomputer in your pocket.  If it weren't for that, you couldn't do the Cardia mobile or a whole lot of other things.  It's because you couldn't put rabbit ears on yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just rather take selfies.  Slow fees, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Slow fees.  That's something you can't do on that new Pixel 4.  At least I don't think so.  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wait, what's a slow fee?  Oh, you don't want to see Apple of that.  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to open it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So actually this is one thing that I think is culturally telling.  The new iPhone will have three lenses on the back.  Kind of a telephoto medium and ultra wide.  All 12 megapixels.  It will have for the first time an equivalent 12 megapixel camera on the front.  Normally these front facing cameras are lower quality.  So the selfies are a little lower quality.  And for the first time ever, this 12 megapixel camera on the front can do slow motion.  So get ready for slow motion selfies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Micah and I are watching the event.  Micah is typing furiously.  So what are you doing?  He says I'm getting a domain, slowfees.com.  I said, Micah, it's not spelled with a P-H.  He bought two or three domains.  S-L-O-P-H-I-E-S. Poor kid.  Nice work, Micah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was so mad.  But that's how you sell phones though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And domain, web domains apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One thing that the Pixel 4 will have though it looks like is astrophotography.  Oh yeah, they talked about this last night.  We talked about that last night on all the Androids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this comes from a video that Google, well, see this is the question.  It was a leaked video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's released if Google sent it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Google didn't send it out, but somebody found it.  And it showed astrophotography.  Now astrophotography, John's done a lot of this.  John, of course, tripod, right?  Because the camera cannot move.  It's a must.  You've done exposure.  Oh, you've done it too, of course.  It's a must.  How long is the exposure typically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can start out at 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's too long and you'll see star trails.  You might want to see star trails.  So it depends whether you want to see star trails or you just want to see the stars brighter against the background and all that.  But that's something that traditionally you'd use a fancy camera and a tripod for.  The thought that you could do this with a camera phone is mind boggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And being able to get that infinity focus on a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's another thing, isn't it?  Oh, oh.  Here's the this is OK.  Again, a quote leaked promo video.  It's definitely made by Google.  The video go and play it.  This is from pro Android dot com.  And it's just showing a lot of what happens when people who made this YouTube and Google Maps.  I like this ad.  This is probably going to be one of the ads of the Pixel four.  Then, you know, the Google way made this a smartphone and then they show some of the features, the gestures.  You get an assistant.  Of course, we all know that it's fast when you say, hey, you know who?  Show me my photos of Tokyo.  The ones with food share this.  Look at that. Pretty cool with Jen.  That's you know, we all know about that.  Now they're showing the camera bump helps you get perfect photos.  And then here's the even in the dark.  So there's night sight.  Apple, of course, achieved night sight parody with a new iPhone.  Even get the stars.  Now that is a star field.  They don't show you how you do it.  It's a setting.  I'd be very curious when you have to have a tripod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get yourself a tripod.  I have a smartphone tripod mount.  Sure.  That I use for long exposure.  Yeah.  And you're going to have this extra computational photography in it.  Now I think it's just going to up the game a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Astrophotography.  They talked about it last night.  If you want to watch and learn more all about Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sat right over there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What were you saying, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got a small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bought my first smartphone tripod way back in the day when I bought a flip camera.  Oh, yeah.  Now I just the big downside was when I am when they took out the headphone jack,  I suddenly lost my ability to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the release.  We're going to change the world, weren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now everybody can have a camera.  Little did I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is actually another thing that you can blame on smartphones.  The death really of the camcorder.  What do you need a camcorder for?  You got a great video camera in your pocket.  And to some degree, the death.  Yeah, we we, by the way, bought up the entire stock of Canon Vixia camcorders for this network.  And then, by the way, the almost death of point and shoot cameras.  You hardly see point and shoot cameras anymore, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you see those artsy fartsy people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you mean like like the long longography, like the kind of intentionally bad Russian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, oh, you know, and Omen is not artsy fartsy, but he is kind of artsy fartsy.  He'll he'll understand when I call him that.  But he doesn't shoot with digital anymore.  He only shoots film.  He shoots film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, geez.  Oh, yeah.  He's a good photographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a very good photographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the I don't own a television of 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there you go.  The impact of smartphones in the camera industry.  This is from CIPA and Statista dot com.  And you see the rise, the blue line of the camera, the digital camera.  Real great until the until the digital phone came out and boom, it just plummets in lines cross.  But they need to break that down all cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not just point and shoot cameras.  All cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They need to break that down a little bit more because there are people with a awesome iPhone camera, awesome Galaxy camera that still walks up and asks me, hey, what camera should I go buy?  But these are hobbyists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are enthusiasts.  These are not regular people.  And honestly, I don't think that's a bad thing.  I think you're almost any high end smartphone today takes superb pictures, better than many point and shoot cameras.  And if you're not an accomplished photographer, maybe even better than a very fancy camera.  Very much so.  Because he's doing all the work.  It is computational.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Computational photographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm looking at O'Malley.  The problem with doing film, does he develop it himself?  Where do you get it processed anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there are labs.  There's labs out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what they do mostly?  They just scan.  Or they scan them.  Scan them.  Then you import them into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has digital files he'll send you of the pictures.  So I'm not 100% sure.  But he.  So look at this article that O'M just wrote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  September 3rd.  Camera sales are falling sharply.  We're in the end times for camera sales.  It's become it's like a record player.  It's become a specialty product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although record players are coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so the stat is vinyl records outsold CDs for the first time ever.  Right.  Because no one's buying CDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want to buy vinyl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Howard Stern makes such fun of Gary Nellibonte for getting vinyl.  This is the most ridiculous habit on Earth.  We probably should steal something out of the changelog because it's relevant.  CBA?  Let me scroll down.  Google Photos gets same day pickup for prints at CVS.  That's brilliant, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that is brilliant because I can't tell you how many times my daughter still has to print photographs for school.  Drives me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So.  Or you got the fancy printer.  It's a pain in the butt to do it.  They would go to the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it also saves because CVS has a big photo processing printer in the back.  All of the great equipment.  They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on it.  So now what you do is you actually can do this in Google Photos and you say I'll pick it up at my local CVS.  I think that's awesome.  Now I don't know how good the prints are.  It's using a codec system called Moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We used to send ours to Walmart when we had to do these.  Or Best Buy or Costco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were fine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've done Walmart and CVS.  But doing it straight from Google Photos is actually kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  My son still prints his photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like photo books.  He still prints his.  He'll go out and shoot in the pixels.  I think there's something about having prints that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Especially when you have kids.  My kids would just pull down the photos themselves and spend hours.  It's a certain ego of a child.  Going through.  But they go through all those photos.  Here's a flip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you have these Google devices.  I have one that's sitting on my desk and it shows all my Google Photos.  Which, by the way, my husband, if I'm taking a picture of something,  he's like you probably want to delete that receipt so it doesn't show up on your Google Photos in a few minutes.  Wait a minute.  No, wait a minute.  Google Photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've not seen this?  Probably because you're deleting your receipts.  After a while, Google Photos will say I have all of these receipts.  You want me to move these to the archives?  You don't want these in the photos, do you?  They offer that for screenshots and receipts.  It knows.  And whiteboards.  I've seen archives or something else.  I didn't know it was just.  Yeah, it's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is smart.  No one wants to see that up close on the, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Anyway, the point is my daughter and her friends will sit there in front of this photo display.  Looking at the receipts.  It just shows up on the photo.  It's like, oh, I'm going to send that to Google.  I'm going to send that to Google.  I'm going to send that to Google.  I'm going to send that to Google.  I'm going to send that to Google.  So what you can do with the Nest Hub and the Nest Hub Max is you can have a photo slideshow,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it lets you say, oh, this person, this person and this person.  So it uses face recognition.  So any picture of me, Lisa or my kids, it goes in there and it's pictures.  I have up, there are 60.  I have pictures from 20, almost 20 years of photography.  Yeah.  There you go.  Isn't that awesome?  So you see, is that your wedding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's, we were at a thing.  I'm trying to, there's my dog.  Yeah.  And you can pick which albums that you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can either go by albums, but I go by face recognition.  So then it's everything.  If it's a picture of one of my kids or if it's a picture of basically of a family member,  it shows that.  And it's fun because you get, I'll wake up and I'll look over and there's a picture from  15 years ago of my son.  Right.  And it's like, oh, that moment.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's super nice to have around the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It solves a problem because we take so many pictures that we're probably never going to  see again.  Sure.  So it's nice to have a way to kind of get those pictures back to life.  That's pretty slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's, I will also say that when my daughter was in Spain, we synced up her account.  We shared a Google account, a photo album with the family that was hosting her.  So as they took pictures of her then they would just pop up and circulate through on  our photo display.  That was super fun.  I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very sweet.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they also took pictures of Anna and us and they actually printed them out and stuck  them in a frame in her little room that she was staying in.  So look, both, both high tech and low tech.  Very special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I get it.  Ohm is shooting with a Leica SL film camera.  Oh yeah.  I get it.  He's always been a Leica guy, but he's gone to film now.  That's outstanding.  Yeah.  Two thirds of my photos are shot with a camera on a tripod.  So he's one of those guys.  Because he has to.  Quite frankly, he has to.  He's really thinking about it.  They're beautiful photos.  They're gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're art.  Yeah.  I actually, so I have printed some up and I'm waiting for them to arrive.  When they arrive, I can show you guys.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's Venice at night.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice.  So I went on a photo expedition some years ago with my good friend, Michael Alland, who's  a great photographer to Tasmania in Australia.  And all of us, you know, Peter Krogh, Michael, all of them, there were about 20 pros.  It was two weeks, typically six, seven, eight thousand photos, you know, because it's digital  you're shooting.  There was one guy, Charlie, who was a, he was shooting a medium format, big.  He had like 30.  He also brought with him a cardboard frame that he would carry around looking at things  to see what it was going to look like in the shot.  Everything was very methodical.  It was very methodical.  Those view cameras.  Isn't that, I mean, it's just, it's, you know what?  It's art.  And I think that's what's going to end up happening to photography.  You and I are big photo buffs, but it's going to be photo buffs because everybody else is  going to use their camera.  Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin pointed out another additional thing about the Google photo frame, should anyone  care.  You can actually create public albums and people can subscribe to them.  So if you wanted to, you could subscribe to Kevin's dogs album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know who did that first?  I thought that was already available in Google Photos.  You know who did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's in Google Photos.  Mike Elgin did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember Mike, when he got off Facebook, he's created Mike's nice book, which is how he  shared photos with everybody.  And it's pretty much every day I get Mike has uploaded 10 more pictures to Mike's nice  book.  I think I might've unsubscribed.  I'm not saying I have.  I'm not saying I haven't.  Sorry, Mike.  We know you still love Mike.  No, it's, oh, I love Mike.  It's a good idea.  No, mostly it's because I'm jealous because of all his pictures.  Oh, I'm in Prosecco now.  Oh, I'm in the south of France now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get out of here.  In Provence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube is shutting down.  Actually, before we do that, let me do a break and then I will tell you what YouTube is shutting  down.  Our show today.  It's great to have Ant Pruitt on the panel with us.  Yes, it is.  Thank you for being here.  Always been happy when he's on the show.  Ant has this nice, calm centered.  I try.

Transcript:  When Jeff and I are yelling at each other, Ant's just like.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Shaking his head.  I have a thought.  Yeah, usually I'm shaking my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You people.  We're not yelling at each other.  We're yelling about things with each other.  You know what is neat though?  Oh, no, I'm yelling at you, Jeff.  Like, listen to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is because Ant was brought up in, was it Alabama?  Mississippi?  Carolina, South Carolina?  Carolina.  It was one of them southern states.  He calls Lisa Miss Lisa.  Yes.  He calls people Miss like Miss Stacy.  What do you do with guys though?  You don't call them Mr. Jeff.  You are Mr. Leo.  Really?

Transcript:  It is what it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to New York City and then you cross over the river to Jersey, you're going to  see a different kind of Jersey.  You're going to say, why do they call this the Garden State?  Because it's kind of industrialized, right?  But you're in the more of the beautiful part of Jersey.  Feeding the needs of America.  That's true.  All of those phony flavors they put in McDonald's french fries, those come from New Jersey.  Oh, really?  Just over the river.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, because I've passed by.  It smells good, doesn't it?  When the roads are really crowded, I pass by this place across from the Essex County  Prison.  Is it in Elizabeth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Because Elizabeth is where they make a lot of the food flavors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's another food flavor place and it looks like the worst factory you've ever seen.  Yeah.

Transcript:  It smells good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're doing an ad, you guys.  No, actually, this is a good.  It smells good, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does it smell like?  Nothing.  It smells like diesel fumes when the trucks go in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that's the food flavoring place.  That's just a factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it smell like Mondays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's a food flavor factory.  I was trying to say that five times.  Food flavor factory.

I haven't seen the new memories on Google Photos since we're talking about Google Photos.  Maybe let's just do the changelog.  Let's just do it.  This will be changeloggy.  Surprise, Carson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So mean.  So mean.  So mean.  The Google changelog.  By the way, a tech in San Diego says he tried the McAllen 25, your pick of the week last  week on Windows Weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, that was McAllen 12.  Oh, he tried the 25.  I see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So good and smooth.  Best sipping whiskey ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've had the 18.  I haven't had the 25, but I've had the 18.  25, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like to drink whiskey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't necessarily get better with age.  I'll be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that true?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Also, it depends on the whiskey.  It depends on the whiskey and your taste too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I keep palming bottles of half-drunk whiskey off on here because I don't really like it.  I'm right here.  Oh, I would give it to you if you really were.  Are you a whiskey drinker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I drink both whiskey and gin.  I have some lovely whiskey recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, after the changelog, whiskey time.  You must be 21 to listen to this show.  This is another one.  No, no, stop.  It's not over.  It's not over.  Car stand.  Well played, sir.  Well played.  Google Photos adds memories.  Now, I haven't got this yet.  I keep looking for it.  It looks a lot like Instagram stories, little circles at the top of your photos.  Let me check and see if I got it yet.  Last time I checked, I had not.  The idea is it's memories of your life, year by year from the past.  I would love that because I put everything in Google Photos.  No.  I got today, yesterday, Monday.  I don't have memories.  Do I have my phone in my pocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  I wish I had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I have memory.  Oh, you do?  I have a memory.  So tell us.  You like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at it.  I don't know.  Relieve your budget.  It supposedly has been rolling out to users since the 12th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have nothing.  These are people I have no idea who I'm sitting next to at a conference.  I have zero idea.  You do too many things like that.  They wanted selfies.  I don't know why.  Oh, you shouldn't have left it.  That was very uninspiring.  It was a bunch of smiling faces, so Google thought, oh, they're happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's just me.  Oh, it does look for smiles.  Do you have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are those circles at the top?  I don't have anything.  Go back down.  No, no, scroll down.  Oh, it wasn't.  That was just my notifications.  Oh, that was your notifications.  Yeah, it's just notifications.  It's just notifications.  OK, so photos.  You may have seen the notifications saying here's rediscover this day, but now they're  going to appear as small circles.  They'll be at the top.  Just like Instagram, you tap it.  It'll show a selection of photos or videos you took on that day from previous years,  starting a year ago and going back as far as Google goes with you, which is for me,  2019 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine jumps back further than that, but I think it's just a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Google Photos hasn't been around that long, but I uploaded all my photos to it,  basically.  I ran the backup thing on my desktop and just put everything in there because it's so useful.  Probably a mistake.  Google has a new search feature you might like for the fall season.  Do they still have a fall TV season?  Remember September used to be a big deal.  Oh, do I use to?  I had to delay my honeymoon because of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The final season of The Good Place, the 27th.  That's the final season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Jeff is, as many of you know, a former TV guide critic.  You put off your honeymoon because it was the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We got married in the fall and we couldn't go, so we didn't go until December.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was trying to explain that concept to my daughter because she was watching.  I don't remember what we were talking about.  But the concept of sweeps week because she was like, why is this episode so over the  top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very special blossom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know what?  It was never a week.  It was always a month when we call it sweeps week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just for those who like your daughter, who are befuddled by the term, it's when the  ratings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they're too expensive to do.  So you didn't do them all the time.  You did them only in certain months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And so that's when you got to do, you know, get your eyeballs, get them all you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  can.  My mother sells ads for a TV station.  Oh, so she knows.  So she knows all about sweeps.  She knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does she want to come work here?  We're kind of like a little TV station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, we could bring my moms closer.  It would be nice.  I was going to say that was the moment there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do I want my mom here or not?  I want my mom.  Working.  What are the same office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you search for things on Google like what to watch, you could shoot.  Well, let's do it.  I want to do it now.  Google.com.  Oh, is this active?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does this work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what to watch because it's going to ask you what do you subscribe to?  No, not yet.  Not yet.  So we got a bunch of stuff that doesn't work yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's giving me top picks for me and it's asking me to rate things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  So you're getting it.  OK, I'm getting it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it does have some luck.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't hit me.  Oh, no.  Did you get that very special blossom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got the 90210 reboot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know, that's based on your age and gender, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually not because I looked up infinity train recently and the first thing is like  asking me to oh, it's asking me to rate infinity train, which I didn't watch on YouTube.  I actually watched it somewhere else.  You searched for it.  I did search for it.  Sex in the city?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Again, I think that's that's kind of gender biased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is X2, X-Men Unlimited, United, something.  I don't know if I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you choose which TV and movie subscriptions you already have.  You'll get personalized recommendations.  You'll see where you can watch them.  If you start a day in the U.S.  when you search for things like good shows to watch on mobile, maybe I have to do it  on mobile.  You could tap you could tap the start button in the top picks for your carousel to begin  rating shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's actually doing a good job, you guys.  Oh, it's that Google.  How do they know?  I rated a bunch of shows and then now it's given me ideas and some of them.  OK, no, some of them feel stupid like Disney's Aladdin.  That's not going to work.  I got it.  They know you have a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, they know.  They got me nailed.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all like Star Wars and OK, it is working on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Available to stream recommended for you.  Thirteen reasons why.  No.  Avengers, X-Men, Dark Phoenix.  It.  Oh, wait, that's not for me.  Here's the top picks for me.  Rate movies and shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the first the first thing is popular.  It's just popular.  And the second one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better Call Saul.  Love it.  Patrick Melrose.  Love it.  But it whiplash.  Love it.  It knows I saw all these.  I never saw pixels and I don't think I would like it.  It's got Adam Sandler.  I don't want to see any more Adam Sandler in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's recommending succession, even though I don't like that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Deadwood.  This is all stuff I watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It knows better than you, Stacey.  Westwind.  Leo likes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should too.  You know, it's doing pretty well.  I swiped a bunch of swipe rights.  It is a couple of swipe lefts.  OK, new picks coming your way.  Silence your phone and dim the lights.  Really?  So there's popular.  Here's the picks for me.  All the things that you said yes to.  Oh, no, La La Land, the deuce, the leftovers, the righteous gemstones, Rogue One.  So I guess it's what?  It's I'm a type.  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's doing just a recommendation algorithm.  This is I mean, this is not terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of cool.  And if you say, oh, well, OK, I want to see Rogue One.  Where can I see it?  It will then show you YouTube as the primary watch option.  But then it shows you other watch options and how much it costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It took me down about eight rows to finally get to something.  And I'm like, OK, yeah, that's that's up my alley.  Well, you need to give Google some more information.  Well, I believe it's more data.  Everybody else in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  So you see some stuff that others in the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Everybody else in the house.  This is the stuff that they would watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't watch. I make them watch what I want to watch.  So it's perfect for me.  I wish I could usually just leave the room like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish you would ask me which my favorite show because then I think it'd be kind of fun to be like, by the way, like, I love Dairy Girls.  That's my new.  Did you not get the thumbs up, thumbs down?  I did, but it didn't it didn't offer me specific shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so so I try to just use the browser search bar and say what to watch.  I got nothing. I have to use the bottom of the phone thing.  Apparently, yes. And it's mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  So that's cool.  That's a fun little thing to play with and actually very, very useful because that has always been the problem with all these services is knowing where something is.  I actually used to recommend a site called Can I Stream It?  Yes, I stream it and it did the same kind of thing.  But this is not like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is when you have all three of those things together.  You don't know what's playing where and it's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something I would like to use, but I'm not completely clear how this works.  Google is going to start highlighting key moments from videos in search.  So instead of just listing relevant videos, when you search, Google will highlight the most relevant parts of longer videos.  And this is the part that where I paused based on timestamps provided by the video creators.  OK, so I guess I mean, this is something for us.  We do a lot of video would be really nice if people could search for.  I want to review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want the review of the Jeff and Stacey screaming about fighting more search for moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would take you right there.  That would be really cool.  I was going to ask who would have searched for Stacey's sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's the name of the tool we use to do that in in-house?  We have a tool we can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a snipping tool.  And then this feature was also built into some other things.  But this is not stepping.  So you do the search.  So here's what the look at the screen here.  This is so you do the search for something and then you see it says in this video and has these dots and these dots.  So this is podcasting for beginners.  Here's microphones.  It found this boom arm shock.  So you can jump right to the part you want.  But to make this work, con content creators first have to mark up their video with bookmarks.  So we're going to have to figure out how to do that.  A lot of YouTubers are doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's using YouTube's engine.  I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The editors have plenty of time.  All right.  We got a new task for you, editors.  Now, I started off and I didn't tell you what YouTube is shutting down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not that big a deal.  Maybe it is.  It's TV friendly web interface.  This is kind of a big deal.  This version of YouTube will be going away soon.  You'll still be able to view YouTube dot com.  But you're going to need a supported device to get the optimized experience.  So it's a lean back interface that was on a web portal for YouTube.  It's going away soon.  I have no problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's plenty of devices.  Was that when you Chromecasted?  No, look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm on YouTube now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, this is the thing.  It's going away.  But you see this different interface?  This is kind of like what you would see if you were using a set top box, a Roku or something  like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you were using the browser on one of those boxes.  No, this is like a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like Android TV has this interface, right?  So this is a lean back TV experience for a computer, for a browser on a computer.  But it's going away.  Did you use this, Carson?  I bet...  You know, I bet you use it.  A lot of kids use it, like teenagers and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't use it because I use the YouTube app rather than the YouTube web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And you'll get something similar to this.  But this is pretty cool if you're just using a web browser.  My kids used to just put YouTube up on the TV and just segue from song to song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to do that, but the apps are so much better.  Better.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So much better.  My kid never watches TV on the TV.  She only watches it on her computer or a tablet.  That's pretty much the future.  Or a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually true.  YouTube doesn't spend a lot of time on my TV.  Well, they know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they're shutting this down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is kind of, I mean, you know how we were talking about cameras going away?  Do TVs eventually go away?  We only have one in our whole house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not from my cold dead hands.  Oh, sports.  I forgot about sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I definitely have browsers that spend no time on my TV.  I'm always watching Plex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have five TVs and there's only three people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm always watching Plex or college football or something.  So I need my television.  I like TV.  Plex is a sponsor.  I like to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, Plex is a sponsor.  Google has an addiction website.  It's called Recovery.  This looks very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is fighting one issue which is bad addiction content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good way for Google to handle that, isn't it?  Exactly.  They should have a vaccine website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  Which is where I think they're all going to head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Around Earth website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Around Earth website.  For those of us who still believe.  So this is called Recover Together.  It's at recovertogether.withgoogle.com.  And it's for National Recovery Month which is September.  There's lots of information here.  This will be a lot better than searching for it.  That's the theory, right?  Now if I search for recovery, I would presume Google puts this at the top.  Although that's a hot button right now for regulators.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if I search for something like AA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it all recovery or is it just...  Let's see.  Oh, I get American Airlines.  That's exactly what I got.  You might want to look at the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, wait a minute though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got a Knowledge Graph card on the right for Alcoholics Anonymous.  Yeah, and AA was the second entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, see mine was AA and then...  Oh, now so alcoholism, knowledge card, mental disorder.  Does that get me there?  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just searched for heroin addiction and I'm not getting it.  So interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe you just have to search for Recover Together.  I don't know.  This is a really nice site.  I think they've done a very nice job on this.  How do I get to it?  Yeah, recovertogether.withgoogle.com.  Not the greatest advice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even that I didn't get.  I searched for it and I got join groups.  That's really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of an important thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, to be able to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it the Recovery Village?  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Recover Together with Google.  Recovertogether.withgoogle.com, is that it?  Yep.  No?  No, that's not where we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got it about four entries down on my screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I asked if I was an alcoholic and it told me I still haven't found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the ads you're going to get now, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's a way to know if Google thinks you're drunk.  Yeah.  It's the number third search result for me.  Think about how often I'm searching cocktails, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I searched addiction recovery and it's not on the front page of my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is weird.  At all.  Yeah, mine isn't coming up.  Another slow rollout.  Another slow rollout, possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it kind of defeats what we were assuming is the purpose of this,  which is to give somewhere that Google can send people better than this generalized search result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google is really good at surfacing their own internal projects for things.  It's funny.  They should show this to the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, maybe that's the secret purpose for this.  See?  We don't help ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did this nice thing but we can't show it to anybody because you won't let us.  Google begins rolling out new features for its family and friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's a great way to get people to see what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google begins rolling out new features for its FamilyLink parental control.  Do you use this, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, my daughter turned 13 this year.  She's out of the parental control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Push her out of the nest.  She can see all the garbage she wants.  So this comes built into Android devices with Android 10 and up.  And it also can be downloaded as a standalone app from Google Play.  If you don't have it, it's called FamilyLink.  But it's nice that it's built into the OS now.  Native.  You can set device bedtimes, track activity per app, set daily limits,  view the device's location on the map, ring it, and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?  I should actually set this up because my daughter's now on an Android phone again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's going to...  Oh, she likes it by the way.  I don't think she's figured out how to charge it yet.  I'm not kidding.  I'm just like, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  How do you charge this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's one port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love this feature.  And I want to see this in a lot of parental control stuff.  It's called bonus time.  So if your kid does her chores, add some bonus time.  The phone normally would lock at nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's disgusting.  Why is that disgusting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to like, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're like bribing your kid with screen time?  Well, don't make it chores then.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make it, she ate all her peas.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, bribing your kids with screen time for doing something.  You don't ever bribe your kid?  I have a really exceptional kid and not like at a parent braggie way.  She just, I bribed her once and she went along with it for the bribe.  And then after she got the reward, she asked me if I would take the bribe away.  Oh my God.  If she reverted back to form.  And then she, I said, no, of course not.  You earned it.  And she's like, okay.  And then she reverted back to form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I totally get it though.  The last time I bribed her.  I totally get it though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You bribe Isaiah and Jacob?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I encourage them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He believes in the stick, not the carrot.  The audio listeners are missing out on what you need to ask for encouragement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just all I need to say.  Stick, no carrot.  All stick, no carrot.  That's aunt's parenting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's parenting 101.  You don't hate your kids, do you?  Not anymore.  You're not a caveman anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Allegedly.  No, you actually, but your boys, whatever you're doing, you're doing it right.  Cause they're very sweet, nice boys.  Thank you.  Although you tell me that's not actually.  They got you fooled.  How they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I totally get it.  I don't want to encourage more screen time.  I think that's a big problem with most kids today anyway, is everybody's sort of walking around staring at a screen and not necessarily taking advantage of the stuff going on around them, walking into poles, walking into the streets accidentally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As long as they're not walking in front of me, I have no objection.  That's when I have a problem.  Out of my way.  I was coming down today into the path train, right?  And there's a narrow staircase down.  People are trying to, there's a train right there.  I can make the train.  People were saying I can make the train.  And there's some guy on the stairs tweeting and going slowly.  I mean, Jesus, can't you just walk four steps and get down?  No, it's so annoying.  That is annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem is that guy's rude.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And although I think technology does encourage people to live in their own worlds and not feel more entitled than being part of the world around them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if they're on Facebook, they're actually communicating with other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Allegedly.  Other Russian sock puppets.  But.  And that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will say, you guys, I ran into a pole not on my phone while I was looking at my purse to make sure I didn't leave it in a cab.  And I literally walked into a pole and it was the most embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were you in Leipzig when you ran into this pole?  That's the Google change log.  Okay, a couple more stories and we're going to take a break.  Then we're going to get some whiskey.  Jeff Jarvis.  What would the world look like if.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a really long post.  So we may not want to do this.  If pessimists win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm calling me a pessimist.  Okay, so I read in the New Yorker actually dystopians.  Jonathan Franzen.  Did you read his New Yorker piece?  He said it's time for us to acknowledge the fact that we're going to lose on climate change, that what needs to be done needs to be done so quickly and with such unanimity, there isn't a hope in hell that we are going to avoid even the worst consequences of climate change.  So the wise thing, which I think is dystopian, the wise thing to do would be just prepare for it.  I in fact.  Move away from coasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Weather control technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I honestly, as a technologist, still think that there's going to be a kind of a Deus ex machina that somebody is going to invent.  Carbon sucking.  Carbon sequestering technology.  They're going to put it and it's going to be fine.  And it will make auto fuel.  And everything's going to be fine.  I heard they're working on it.  I did get two books.  One I really actually I haven't read the second one, so I won't recommend it, but it looks good.  One called the sixth extinction.  There have been five massive extinction events in the history of the world and its author, he won a Pulitzer Prize says we are about to enter the sixth.  And gives lots of it's very well written.  It's actually not dystopian.  It's kind of jolly, but the outcome is not good for us.  And then I just got another one, too, which I want to read because I'm just going to think, well, OK, maybe friends is right.  I it's hard to see that every nation in the world is going to go to zero emissions by 2030 doesn't seem that likely.  Then we're going to give up air travel that we're going to give up gas cars that we're going to, you know, I mean, it just doesn't seem that likely,  especially since the US government just told California we can't have higher emission standards than their crappy emission standards.  It just doesn't seem that likely.  So is that an example, Jeff, of dystopian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, by the way, I'm looking at a Vox story that says that just while you're on Franzen, the headline says scientists are pissed at the novelist and the New Yorker for publishing him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was quite good.  I mean, he says it's time to take her head out of the sand.  Anyway, really, I mean, I went live Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People began to express their ire online.  Climate scientists and activists were especially pissed at the author and also the magazine that published them.  Critics anger seemed to coalesce around four main complaints, three of them empirical in nature.  Franzen is wrong on the science, on the politics and on the psychology of human behavior as it pertains to climate change.  The fourth complaint was more about credentials and identity for prestigious magazine.  He's a novelist.  He's a novelist.  He wants to allocate, yeah, exactly, a boring one with that, I would argue.  Oh, I love his books.  But OK.  I gave a great review to an early one about St. Louis.  I was reading the corrections on 9-11.  Oh, so you have a bad taste in your mouth from that.  It was, well, no, it was this.  The copy I had was literally filled on every page with the dust.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually loved the corrections, but it's slice of life fiction.  It's not for everyone.  Well, the problem is after 9-11, it just seems so self-indulgent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does seem self-indulgent, but that's human.  That's what we are.  But no, that's not my view of dystopia.  Oh, what is your view of dystopia?  My view of dystopia is that all you guys who keep on complaining about everything technology win.  That would be bad.  And that what I call the unholy compromise of the year 2022 happens,  and Trumpist conservatives and war-night liberals join forces to attack the Internet companies,  each for their own reasons.  And in the aftermath, most of the Internet companies are broken up.  Collection and use of data by commercial entities as well as academic researchers is severely curtailed.  Moderation requirements and consequent liability for copyright violations, hate, falsehood,  unauthorized memories and other forbidden speech were imposed on social media companies,  and then on news organizations and media organizations.  New speech courts were established to adjudicate disputes of falsehood and hate,  as well as information ownership, excessive expression and political neutrality by net companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is if all of the calls for regulation of big tech go so far as to kind of really break it all up.  Because I think what we talk about here is not, in fact, I think we've often said probably not a good idea to break up big tech,  but certainly that some regulation is in order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I went to the limit on all of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's always been my concern too, as you start talking about this,  if you go all the way down that road, then you lose all the benefits of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Precisely. So what happens when we demonize data? What happens when we fight over data ownership?  I propose that there's going to be a law here that says that you have to do what I call technology impact reports  that list everything that could possibly go wrong with the technology that you introduce.  If you don't list it and it happens, then you have liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think companies should do that internally before they release a product, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it actually should. In this case, it was about liability.  Well, but they're not.  Forbidding technologies. We had a discussion today about facial recognition.  I argue here that it's outlawed, that we have the beginnings of laws that try to establish truth versus falsity.  That's already happening in France and Singapore.  We get to the idea. There's a lot of argument going on today that we have too much speech, which scares me to death.  But respected academics are asking whether the First Amendment is obsolete because the people out there are talking and they don't like it.  So take that down the road. So this is a piece I wrote is very long. It's too long.  But I really wanted to explore. I think it's obviously it's dystopian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's your version of Jonathan Franzen's New Yorker article.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, I'm not. I'm saying we can stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can stop it. And I love the coda, which I presume you wrote, which is, I'm sorry, this essay proved to be controversial.  Professor, I'm devastated you lost your quest for tenure.  Thank you for challenging a challenging class. I wish you luck in your new career in the Tyro industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The technology impact report optimization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the editor. Is that you or is that medium?  That's me. That's me.  This paper will get an A editor. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's in the year 2032.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very nice. Did you clearly mark that a satire, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I marked it as history 302 fall semester 2032 final essay.  If everybody doesn't get that, then fine.  That sounds pretty satiric. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm teasing you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did like the I like my nickname.  I'm now going to call you guys the distos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Distos. I was a techno. Now I'm a disto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now you're a disto. It's the distos versus the technos.  If you distos win, this is the trouble that will then occur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just a quick note.  Richard Stallman has now not only resigned at MIT,  but as well at the Free Software Foundation,  which he led for a long time, creating new Linux.  He was a computer scientist, one of the original MIT hackers  who held some very controversial opinions.  Regarding the Epstein situation.  Regarding not just Epstein, but for 20 years,  he's had very controversial opinions about pedophilia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had somebody introduce me to him at some event,  and he just went off in this ridiculous rant.  And I walked away from him. I couldn't take it.  I told my friend, don't just keep me away from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's never been.  He's always been a challenging person to be around.  I've interviewed him and I respect what he has done as a computer scientist.  We wouldn't have Linux if probably if not for the Free Software Foundation.  Right. But he was always very adamant about his positions that no software should suffer.  All software should be free.  And apparently he had some... I didn't actually was not aware of his...  I wonder if he'll be investigated.  You know, one of the things that came out in the Epstein thing that really disturbed me  is that Marvin Minsky, who was a legendary artificial intelligence scientist,  researcher, professor at MIT, apparently, according to accusations,  misused his position as a professor to sleep with an underage undergraduate.  And that really disturbed me because even more than Richard Stallman,  Marvin Minsky is a hero for artificial intelligence.  So it goes deep and it's not...  So this is an interesting thing because no woman bothers to say someone is an intellectual

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and then clarifies it with, you know, but and they don't sleep with their students.  Like men seem to think that you can be intelligent and it's weird that you're this genius  and you make these really crappy decisions that take advantage of people.  Right. And I'm constantly surprised when people express like what you just did, Leo.  And I'm not saying you're wrong to be this, but it's surprising to me that you think that those are related.  Right.  So I guess I'm just throwing that out there that people seem to know he was so good at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's why I said it.  And maybe you're right.  He made some very important contributions to our field.  Very important, as did Marvin Minsky. Very important.  And I feel like that deserves to be acknowledged at the same time as we acknowledge that he was a complete jerk.  And are you saying I shouldn't need to say both things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm just I guess when people say he was such a this a credit to the field, I'm surprised he also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he was not a credit. I won't say A, he was not a credit to the field.  He was exactly the opposite.  And I'm and B, I'm not surprised because I have like Jeff.  We've both had that experience.  I mean, he he had personality, some strange personality disorder.  But Minsky, I never met, I don't know.  Legendary, both of them legendary in computer science.  And clearly, you know, there were problems.  So that happens across the board.  I mean, it's there's separate issues that I don't think they need to be.  OK. A lot of people are jerks. Yes.  And and they may do you know, I there's a lot of great novelists, playwrights, movie directors whose work, whose art is great and whose personal life is despicable.  What what should we say about that?  How do we always very hard to separate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not saying and I'm not saying you you don't have to say anything.  I'm not calling it a task on the same.  You can if you want to.  I am surprised when people try to say, oh, this person has done so much.  And I don't I don't mean it as a way of saying, oh, that's not a mitigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It mitigates in any way.  I'm not saying I'm not.  In fact, it is the contrary because they use their positions reprehensibly.  So well, what are you saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surprised that someone couldn't be a predator and a really good person or a really good.  No, it happens all the time.  Contributor to the field of A.I.  Bill Cosby was a great comedian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  I like Michael Jackson's music.  And by the way, this is a challenge we all face.  Do I stop listening to Michael Jackson's music?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did you decide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Woody Allen, Woody Allen films.  Yeah, it's Wagner.  I've never come on as a critic, as a critic.  I've never come to I've never been able to decide in the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's tough.  Certainly a person's behavior in life can be smirked their reputation.  Oh, yeah. But it doesn't necessarily diminish their art.  Or just feel like it does.  Stacey, does it diminish their art?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think these people, because of their art, are given a pass, obviously.  That's wrong. That's wrong.  And that's what T.S. Chaps was saying.  It's wrong, but it's also there are certain people who are more likely to get a pass.  And there's even certain fields where people are more likely to get a pass.  Like if you're in academia and you are a woman or probably a person of color,  you probably don't get the same pass that these white guys who've contributed so much to their field.  If you are in sports, like you're a football player, you don't get it.  Or you'll you'll probably get a pass that other people wouldn't get for like beating up your girlfriend.  Happens all the time.  So it's it. Those are just some of the thing.  I mean, this is one of those.  I was just ad hoc expressing my surprise because it because it hits me right here.  No, and it's important to talk about. It's super important to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't I completely want you to correct me.  Oh, don't worry, Leo. I'm not going to shut up or no.  Furthermore, I want the correction. If you feel like it's an inappropriate way to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't a correction. It was just an observation.  I don't think it's surprising at all that this person could be a sexual predator and good at AI research.  No, I'm not surprised. I'm disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're right. I'm not surprised.  And having grown up in academia, my father is a professor.  I have I'm very well aware of the horrific behavior of professors, male professors going back generations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking of which, I may while we've been on the on the show of MIT had a large faculty meeting.  Oh, really? Which are open. So Ethan Zuckerman live tweeted it all.  We just read a couple things here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zuckerman with the computer scientists who resigned from MIT Media Lab after the Epstein revelations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So he said that Heather Paxson, I'm presuming a faculty member, reads a letter from 61 senior women faculty members.  Deep dismay at the Epstein situation. Call for action.  Fundraisers violated Institute values, especially in inviting Epstein to campus.  Attempts to conceal relationship. Staff and students forced to collude.  Situations symptomatic of larger cultural issues at MIT need to address gender and sexual implications of Epstein, not just fundraising issues.  Sexual abuse survivors shaken by these actions.  How can our leaders be trusted given these violations?  Lisa Parks, MIT, another department, says that there are 1066 faculty members at MIT.  Only 266 are women. Fewer than 30 are women of color.  Our community says this tweet, the recording, hears he feels undervalued, unsafe.  MIT relationship with Epstein reveals a cultural crisis, a crisis in values.  This ain't getting dropped and nor should it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you read Larry Lessig's apology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, did I? I'm so disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too, because here's another guy that I really look up to, I really admire.  I honestly think that some of the issues he raised were not inappropriate. He pointed out that it's...  Zillogical.  Yeah, it was a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Stacey and Ant, did you see that?  I'm just now seeing this on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Larry Lessig, long-time Harvard professor, the guy who created Creative Commons, was running for president last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And who believed that it was okay to take the money as long as it was kept anonymous.  That making it anonymous so you allegedly don't get anything out of it makes it okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't whitewashing Epstein's reputation because it was done anonymously.  That I'm sure was the justification in the MIT administrators' minds as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it got up to what he wanted, which was introductions to science leaders and, I fear to say, young students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it did in fact probably whitewash his reputation somewhat among those who knew.  I like Larry a lot. He's been on our shows and I think the world of him. And again, he's wrong on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that a lot of times there's...  He may not recognize the... And I hate to say privilege, but he may not recognize that an anonymous donation...  He may not understand the impact of what he's quite saying because he doesn't live in a world where that matters to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one thing I thought that he raised that I thought was interesting though is there is a range of misbehavior among donors.  And often institutions kind of have to hold their nose.  And he said, well, where is the line drawn? I mean, clearly Jeffrey Epstein is definitely way beyond the veil.  There's not any question. But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People at MIT object to Koch money, but others would not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there you go.  The student body wanted to reject a bunch of money from Jim Bob, I can't think of it, MacMurray, the Freeport MacMurray guy.  It was mining, strip mining, very bad at the time. And they took the money. They built a new biology building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andrew Carnegie, who was a horrible human and made his fortune, the US Steel, and trust-busting, union-busting, in his later his life, built all these libraries.  Do you reject those libraries because the money came from Andrew Carnegie and the blood and sweat and tears of steelworkers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People are stripping the Sackler name off of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As they should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go. You're like, I mean, we're drawing lines all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do you not build the library because of that?  Do you say, no, Andrew Carnegie, your money is blood money. I will not take that free library money.  There are free libraries all over the country built with his money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they have his name on them as a requirement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Many of them. Well, ours does not. It says free public library on the one in Petaluma. It's a beautiful building.  Probably, yes. I mean, it certainly was well known that Carnegie did it. So it was, everybody knows it was to whitewash his reputation.  Bill freaking Gates.  The work that he's doing, do you say, well, we don't want to take Gates money because Gates was a robber baron in the 90s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, there's a vast difference between Gates's robber baron.  But that's the point. It's a continuum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the point. It's a continuum. And where do you draw the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's where we are. I mean, that's the fun and pain of being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Rockefellers were a nightmare. We wouldn't have a National Park Service without the Rockefellers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so this is part of people's participation in a democracy, right?  Back then, the people who were deciding whether or not they took the money, they probably looked at the Rockefellers and Carnegie's as fellow travelers, right?  When you have more people with more say, which we're opening up more people like everybody in the white male contingencies is like, yeah, I've seen you're fine.  I like young girls, too.  But when MIT students were like, as a young person who does not want to be preyed upon, I think this sucks.  That's the conversation you have. You can't draw a line.  You certainly can't draw a line based on the current power structures.  And that's why we're having a fun conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem, isn't it?  Well said.  Yes. That's that privilege problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's the structure. It's a structural problem.  That's the structural problem is that when only some people are having went out of a thousand sixty six professors, only 30 year women of color at MIT, then who's having the discussion?  Right. Faculty meeting where only faculty can talk. Right. Who's at the table? Right.  Yep. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I know.  Story. Okay.  One other story and then I'm going to get that problem moving on quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook and I've written about before we talked about before, but Facebook's oversight board this today, this afternoon, your time, they announced the final rules for it.  The charter, the structure. I've written about this.  I went to two meetings.  I think it could be, you know, Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They will have non-vitoable ability to say, no, that's gone.  Can't be overridden or vice versa.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can't be overridden. They can't be fired.  Who are these people?  That's the next step.  So they're going to have 40 and the structure is they're going to have about they have they brought in consultants and you know, all kinds of people, the hydrogen struggles and all these search companies.  And they're going to try to come up with, I think, eight to ten people that Facebook will indeed pick, but a minority of the 40 in the end.  And then those people will pick everyone else who joins the oversight board.  I nominate Jeff Jarvis.  They would they would not be on a lot of to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a question for you.  Yes.  Just kidding. This is a new story.  So keep going, Jeff.  This is a big step forward.  I think this is a big step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looks good from the point of view of how to solve Facebook's tough, difficult problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't solve at all.  It's not going to scale.  It's only going to do with certain issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But at least it's not Mark Zuckerberg saying, let's go ahead and do it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I the people who did this process, I have immense respect for.  They're very smart.  They work through everything.  They listen to tons of people.  Does it solve everything?  Absolutely.  Of course not.  But it creates an independent voice mechanism of appeal, a pressure on Facebook on not just specific takedowns, but also on policy.  And we'll see.  It's a definite we'll see.  But I think it's a decent step.  That's such one.  Make sure we mark that today.  Thank you.  Yes.  And full disclosure, I raised money for my school from Facebook.  I'm independent of Facebook.  Received nothing personally from Facebook.  Stacy, your last story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is just a question.  Speaking of Facebook, Leo, are you going to buy the new cheaper portal gear?  Built for your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about the one you just hook onto your TV?  So it watches you every time you watch TV.  We're listening.  We're listening to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We hear for you.  We hear you.  We hear you.  Holy cow.  Why do they keep putting this stuff out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And apparently they're selling it.  The portals are supposedly selling well.  Yeah.  Somebody's.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are cheap, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are $20 cheaper.  $179 and I think $129.  The portal and portal mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $179 and $129.  Shipping starts next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's something to think about.  They haven't figured out a business model for this yet.  Would you do this without a business model?  There's a business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's definitely a business model.  Facebook puts microphones and cameras in your home, but there's no business model?  I think there's a business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've also just updated the terms of service.  You can opt out of certain things now.  It's a pilot program.  Or you can opt out of them collecting audio clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's Facebook doing essentially what Amazon and Google are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a true statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it that we trust Facebook less than Amazon and Google?  To be fair, I do.  Are we wise to do so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook has not only have they gone out and outright lied to us on more than one occasion about what they're doing with your data.  Passing a buck.  They come out each time and apologize and thinks that it's suddenly okay.  Right.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which goes to my dystopia.  Internally, they should be doing technology impact reports and saying what could go wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, Facebook, it is to be noted, is trying to trademark the word book in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you serious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not for you, Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They apparently have rights over the word face in the United States.  Face blank, right?  Face blank.  They also have Facebook and the face book.  But they're trying to get book.  This is from the register.co.uk.  Inchiria, intellectual property news from the United States.  Last week, the Ohio State University lost its attempt to trademark the word the.  Okay.  Now I need a drink of whiskey.  I will get that as soon as I tell you about the thing that saves me.  Carson, we use this.  Zapier saves me so much time.  It's always been said amongst programmers, amongst IT professionals, sysadmins, if you do something more than a couple of times, you should automate it.  You should write a script.  But if you're not a sysadmin or an IT professional or a programmer, can you do this?  Yes, you can.  With Zapier.  Zapier makes it easy to automate the things you do over and over again, especially in business.  Zapier has over 1500 plus connected apps.  All the apps you use, of course, Facebook and Twitter, but all the apps, CRM apps like Salesforce, it lets you create multi-step zaps that automate your workflow.  And I just love it.  You can use it to, well, here's what Carson and I do.  Whenever I'm in my news reader and I star an article, it automatically takes that, tweets it to a special links for Twitter account.  It pin boards it so I have that bookmark.  And then it makes a line in a spreadsheet, a shared Google Docs spreadsheet so that Carson can easily cut it and paste it into the show rundowns.  And all I do is press a button and it does it all automatically.  I have the same script is also taking anything that I favorite using pin board.  So it's just amazing.  But it's your email.  You could, for instance, you could have you get a new lead.  You could engage them automatically, import new customers, notify your team about opportunities with one click of the mouse.  They walk you through it.  So no programming involved.  You can do it.  It's very simple.  And they and they give you ways to test every step of the way.  So you know exactly what's going on.  This is exactly done right.  ZAPIER, don't waste times on tasks you know could be automated.  Don't have to go to the IT department.  Don't have to go to developer.  Just go to zappier.com slash twig.  Connect the apps you use the most.  Let zappier take it from there.  Four and a half million people use zappier and get this.  On average, they save 40 hours a month, a whole work week by using zappier.  You could try it for free right now through November by going to zappier.com slash twig.  Z-A-P-I-E-R zappier.com slash twig.  14 day free trial.  I love zappier.  There's a free tier.  I pay for this starter.  Enough scripts to do everything I need.  I just love it.  Zappier.com slash twig.  I've been using them for years.  You will want this.  All right, Stacey, tell me something good.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is what I've been missing out on.  Oh, Fortnite Funko Pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a Fortnite Funko Pop.  Fortnite Funko Pop.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was doing it as a service to everybody who might be considering one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you think they're really nicely made?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't know the quality.  That's really important in an Advent Calendar.  So I'm showing you.  They come prepackaged.  Nice.  And...  I'm going to cut it open.  How do I feel?  Oh, these are good quality Funko Pops.  Her face lit up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man, these are good quality Funko Pops, she says.

Transcript:  The Hibiki Harmony is a lovely whiskey, should you like it.  That's a great one.  It's hard to find now.  Your best bet is duty free.  Yep.  And then I'm just going to give you another whiskey recommendation if you wanted it.  Please.  But that's two things.  We do.  Because I live in Washington, I went and tasted some Washington whiskies.  And I can tell you the Woodinville Whiskey.  So it's WoodinvilleWhiskeyCo.com.  Their Woodinville Double Barrel Whiskey is excellent.  It's very smooth and quite delicious.  And not unreasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next week we're going to have an event at our local distillery, which is Griffo, which makes whiskey.  So we'll let you know how that Griffo is.  Micro distillery.  So micro distilleries suddenly become, turns out we are in kind of distillery alley here.  Started with Lagunias Beer.  Now there's a bunch of distilleries and beers.  And you can get absinthe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any gin mills?  I think I went to Hen House last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hen House is good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can send me some gin, Leo.  Is that what you, well, I'm thinking for host gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You like gin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love gin.  Oh, are you coming to my house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Imagine the show if Stacey and I are both on gin.

I saw you on the show at the last minute.  You don't have to have a pick.  I do have a pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  I know we talked about Google's recovery story.  Yes.  But September is also Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.  So if you folks could be so kind to check out the St. Jude website and look at the ways that you can give to help support and raise awareness and raise some money for research to help nip this thing in the bud.  That's nice.  That is my pick.  A good pick.  You're a good person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have my moments.  Most of us pick things that we can spend money on for ourselves.  I really like that you're bringing, last week it was mental health awareness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is your groove.  I think the goodness groove.  I don't know, man.  I have my moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's so funny because we had a priest work here for years and he never did that.  Although I was looking at our security guard out front, Mo, great guy, and Mo does carry a sidearm as well as mace, because be prepared.  That is what it is.  But then I noticed there was a rather large Nerf weapon next to him.  I said, do you use that too?  He said, Father Robert left me that when he left.  It was his gift.  Jeff Jarvis, Pick of the Week.  So I got two things.  The Stacy Furst of her ass.  You bought the Pick of the Week.  The 3A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, 3A.  Oh, OK.  So I was going to peeve you here.  The Pixel 3 is now, of course, in advance of the next announcement, 50% off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is, this is, only white men could think they could get away with wearing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it?  Oh my god.  There's a wearable chin.  This is from the Tech Insider Twitter account.  A wearable chair that will allow you to sit anywhere except you've got these weird metal  things hanging from your butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This guy walking down the street looking self satisfied.  Hey, I got a metal chair.  Wearing his chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My butt chair.  Look at that.  Don't worry about standing on that bus my friend.  You've got a chair built into your butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like butt skates.  I'm going to throw him a bone, okay?  Yeah.  I've done shoots in the past.  Oh, where you wish you had a chair.  Yeah, and there's a couple times I would have like a little plastic footstool or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get walking sticks that turn into stools.  That's reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would use it for something like that.  I'm not going to walk the streets of Petaluma with that though.

Transcript:  If you need your hands free, I mean, because a walking stick chair and okay, I'm going  to throw this out there for, my mom had this condition where she didn't have any cartilage  in her hip bones and as it wore away.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know that feeling.  I have a replaced hip.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  She was like 45 when she had her first hip replacement and something like this is actually  really helpful.  This would be good.  So yes, it's ridiculous, but if it's effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just use it for when you need it.  I'm not going to walk the streets with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This video really needs audio to see how much you're clinking as you're clink, clink, clink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's better than a miniature pony service animal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Silicon Valley.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my pick of the week is at Hugging Face, transformer.huggingface.co.  Get a modern neural network to auto complete your thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you were going to do image roulette, man.  No, this is even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can start writing and in fact, let me tell me something to write.  It was a dark and stormy afternoon.  And then if I want to get a suggestion, I press tab and then I can add day when we were  out but I got out.  I was feeling great and having a good time.  Okay.  Stacey was wearing her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I really don't want you to share.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had to ask tab her what happened to you.  Her about it.  Him to put it on my lap while I was doing.  That would be no.  What happened to you?  End quote.  She said she had a little too much to drink and tab.  It's not going to go well.  The only way I could help was to ask.  You know what?  I'm going to pick that and then hit tab again.  I asked her to stop smoking and put a cigarette tab in my mouth.  And there's my short story written by computer.  In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote previously  unexplored valley in the Andes.  This was the one we saw before.  Even more surprising research is the fact that unicorns spoke perfect English.  So now you can find your own.  The other thing that's cool about this is you don't have to use that particular hugging  face NLP.  They have other models you can play with.  So if you're curious, should I try GPT 2?  Let's get some.  Let's select.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to do the same thing again to see how it's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not in that much mood to do that.  And I don't think anybody else is.  But you can just keep hitting tab, tab, return, tab, return, tab, return.  And the whole thing.  Oh, my goodness.  Will finish itself.  So that's it for this week in Google.  We've taught you how to write, how to drink and how to get Marvel characters in a special  little box for Christmas.  Thank you all for being here.  And to prove it.  Where can we find and prove it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can find me here at twit studios.  Are you Instagramming?  I am Mr. Graham.  What's your Instagrammer?  I'm still at underscore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same with your Twitter.  Yes, sir.  Anything else people could follow?  I think it's a good way to know what you're up to is you go there and when you announce  the shows, you'll certainly announce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll announce the shows.  But I do have a segment on hot.  So that's twit.tv slash hot.  That's our hands on tech product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hands on tech.  And I are going to both review the new Sony A7R2 with its 10 pound.  That's why you were playing with it.  Brand new camera, 61 megapixels, 10 pound dumbbell, which doesn't matter if you don't  take the lens cap off, Leo.  Stacey Higginbotham is at Stacey on iot.com.  She does a great podcast with Kevin Toffle.  Anything else you'd like to mention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sign up for my newsletter.  It comes out on Fridays and it's free and it's free.  You can sign up at Stacey on iot.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should be.  Yeah, I get it. I love it.  Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.  He's at BuzzMachine.com.  He's at Jeff Jarvis.  And he's also on Medium where you can read his very long submission.  Yeah, dystopias on dystopia for his 2032 class.  We do this week in Google Wednesdays, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.  If you want to watch live twit.tv slash live, you can listen live there too.  You can even ask your Amazon Echo, just listen to twit live.  It should play the shows, whatever is on live right now.  If you're doing that, though, go to the chat room because they're watching and typing while they're listening.  They don't use neural nets.  They it comes out of their own noggin there.  Just go to IRC dot twit dot tv.  Although I have to say, in a way, they are my neural net.  I have trained them over the years.  That's what they are over decades of listening to me.  So now they complete my sentences for me and they do a much better job, by the way.  Much better jokes, much better jokes.  I get all my good jokes from the chat room.  If you want on demand versions of the show, go to twit dot tv slash twig.  Best thing to do, though, subscribe in your favorite podcast application.  That way you'll get it the minute our editors are finished cleaning it up,  removing all the swear words, that kind of thing.  Thank you so much for joining us today.  Hope you had a good time. We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
