It's time for This Week in Google, Twig, we call it, with the Twig crew, starting with  Gina Trapani of SmarterWear.org.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hey, Leo.  How's it going?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Going great.  I hear you were recognized in Disneyland.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  A Twig viewer recognized me in Disneyland, which was the first time ever that I've been  recognized anywhere.  So, that was exciting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Where were you when you?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, did that viewer wave at you?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He did not.  He did not.  He just said, hey, aren't you Gina from Twig?  And he was really cool about it.  And I was kind of like, who, me?  What?  And then we shook hands.  In fact, I think if I remember correctly, his name was Dean.  So hi, Dean.  And I thanked him for making me feel like a rock star.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's so neat.  Here also is a rock star, Mr. Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.  Hey, Leo.  Two of the top blogs in the world with Buzz Machine and SmarterWear.  And ironically, as you were observing, you don't get indexed by Google News because you're  a single author blog.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've even complained about that to the Google News team and we don't get anywhere with that.  So has John Battelle even and he's gotten nowhere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess they have to draw the line somewhere.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But why is that the line?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What would you suggest?  I mean, who would decide that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, people suggested on Twitter that I should, it's like trying to go in the diamond lane  with the pop doll.  Oh, yeah.  I should make up some authors.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You need an inflatable author.  Yes.  Very simple.  Very simple.  That laugh is the great Danny Sullivan who's joining us from SearchEngineLand.com.  Hi, Danny.  Hi.  Danny's been an observer of the search engine scene, not just Google, but going all the  way back to 96 with Lycos and AltaVista and Yahoo.  Yes.  And really an astute observer.  In fact, one of the things that spurred me to get you on today is to talk a little bit  about this new social search, Google social search that, well, not just Google, Bing's  doing it too.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you have a great article on that.  We'll talk about that in a bit.  But before we get to that, I left something out last week and I really would like to talk  about it this week, especially with the new announcement of Droid, Android 2.0.  Verizon took a big shot at Apple with its, what is it now?  Get Droid, what is the website?  Droid...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Droiddoes.com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Droiddoes.com.  It doesn't load on an iPhone.  It doesn't?  There's one more tagline.  This ad doesn't.  So if you go to Droiddoes.com, which actually redirects to a Verizon wireless site, you'll  see all the things that the iPhone does not do that the Droid does.  Droid is a new Motorola phone that is running Android 2.0.  So what do you think, Gina?  Have you seen 2.0?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I've only seen screenshots.  Boygeniusreport.com has been doing some fantastic coverage of Android 2.0.  And what to say?  It looks really cool.  There's Microsoft Exchange support.  There's Facebook friend integration into your contacts, which seems really cool.  There seems to be, oh, there's a car specific home screen.  So if you have the phone with you while you're driving, you get the kinds of apps and maps  and interface that you would need if you needed directions or needed to look up businesses  on your way.  There's a unified email inbox, which I'm not really sure what they mean by that.  But definitely...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know what would be nice that the iPhone doesn't do is put all of my mail into  one inbox.  I have to go to my Google box and then to my Yahoo box and then to my other boxes.  A unified inbox would be great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It would be.  And if they could do things like even kind of intersperse your SMS messages and all the  different ways the messages that we get into one kind of flow, that would be awesome.  But it looks really cool.  I definitely suggest Android fans to check out that Boygeniusreport screenshot tour,  which we have in the show notes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Continuing in the line of pastries.  This is Eclair.  Cupcake was the last one, donut, and now Eclair.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But let's just say that commercial is scary and weird.  Really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought so.  It's very aggressive because it's essentially saying all the things that the iPhone doesn't  do.  It really is underscoring things like closed development.  And it says Droid does.  And I think it's effective.  I think it's very smart.  It's surprising given that Verizon thought they were going to get the iPhone.  At least I thought that's what they thought they thought we're going to get.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  I think that's like the first part of the commercial, the I don't parts.  And we talked about the best way for Android to market.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The seven style graphics.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't like the transition.  It's like, oh, show me something better.  It went from the happy Apple song with the reflection and all that.  But then it kind of transitions into this like, yeah, exactly.  I don't want my phone to kill me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I talked to someone whose dad works for Verizon, who has held the phone, has shown the phone  to others.  I take it with a grain of salt.  This is from Verizon.  But his dad said, this is the iPhone killer.  This is an amazing phone.  Five megapixel camera.  It's got a real keyboard that slides out, but not much thicker than an iPhone.  Looks like a screen the same size as the iPhone.  I presume it's a capacitance touch screen.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It seems to be getting really great early reviews.  My only my only problem is, I mean, I'm a fan.  I love Android and I can't keep all the carriers and models and makers straight.  Welcome to the world of cell phones.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You want that Android club, damn it.  Let's start it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm buying this one.  So I'll hand off my last Android phone.  But I am definitely going to get in line for this one.  This looks like it's going to be a spectacular phone.  When does it come out?  No one knows.  Although, if you look at that strange, weird graphic at the end there, it has a binary  calendar at the bottom, which some have interpreted to be, I think, October 31st.  Is that right, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I thought it was November 9th, but you're probably right.  Soon.  Soon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Soon.  And well, I don't read binary.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I didn't know about the binary calendar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if you look at the bottom, that's what that looks like.  Yeah.  You're probably too scared.  They are, Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was hiding from my life.  You were terrified.  I can't look at that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's the real question.  You can put all that hardware together.  You can put a great operating system.  It does sound like 2.0 is cool.  Doesn't it come down, though, to the application store?  At least if you're going to compete against an iPhone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is a good question.  Yeah.  I mean, I think the apps have a lot to do with it.  And I think, you know, if you're talking about the iPhone, music and video is also a really  big part of it.  You know, the iPhone, iTunes integration is really good.  I mean, I got an iPod Touch because it was just like, I was so set up in iTunes that  I was hard for me to make the transition.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  A Microsoft phone will never ever make sense to a human being.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Well, we know that much.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's impossible.  No matter how many good apps you can put on Microsoft OS, it will not.  I can't find them.  I can't get to them.  I have two or three, you know, Microsoft OS phones and they're dreadful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Here's the binary clock.  I'll just zoom in on this.  Can you read binary or is that Klingon?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know what that is.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  I like that if you go down below that, they actually have a disclaimer telling you that  droids are a trademark of LucasFilms.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Of LucasFilms, yeah.  Well, that's going to be a problem.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  I mean, droids kind of generic, but something's going on there where they decided, well, we  better make sure we don't get anybody from, you know, LucasFilms after us.  Or maybe there'll be some more surprises and we'll discover that the droid is somehow  going to have some connection.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It says used under license.  So they obviously got permission to use it.  Well, that's interesting.  Wouldn't it be cool if it like had Wookiee Fur cases?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to hear the Wookiee ring.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And of course, we're going to see an ad from Apple saying, this is not the droid you're  looking for.  If I were Steve Jobs, that's what I would do.  So a big announcement this week started with Bing.  It kind of perturbed me a little bit.  Twitter announced that it had sold its fire hose, all the data that comes out of Twitter,  something that does not give away easily or lightly, and many have asked for, to Bing  for indexing.  Bing is also going to index Facebook.  And then Google said, Marissa Meyer said, oh, no, we're doing it too.  It's we're calling it Google Social Search.  Both search engines.  So this is a good one for you, Danny.  Both search engines.  Is it real time search?  What exactly are we talking about here?

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Well, that's part of the problem.  We talked about real time search and I try to explain it like if we were saying we're  going to do image search and you do a search, you get images.  If you were talking video search and you do a search, you get videos.  So if I say we're having real time search, what do you get?  Real time?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, that's for a real good time.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  And so the way I've seen it, when we look at the different players, it's either somebody  tried to let you see the kind of microblog real time content that's out there, the actual  tweets where somebody may be saying what's going on, or they try to mine the links that  are being tweeted or being Facebooked or whatever you want to call it that's put out there.  And so with Bing, they kind of went both ways.  They said, all right, if you want to see what people are saying, we're going to try to show  you the most authoritative tweets and we'll also show you the most tweeted links that  are out there as well.  Google Social Search is actually different and independent of the whole deal they cut  with Twitter.  They actually were working on that before they had a deal with Twitter.  And I've actually seen it and it's one of those things where I looked at and I thought,  that's actually really cool.  You know, it'll see all your followers that are, for example, on Twitter, you do a search  and it will show you at the bottom of the page, all the pages related or written by  the people you follow because it can figure out it knows who you are, it knows who they  are and it can see who they've said which are their websites.  And it's kind of neat.  It like super personalizes some of your pages, which actually has nothing to do with real  What's that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sorry, can I, can I, is it just Facebook followers or is it my email contacts, my inbox?  My employee, fellow employees?  What pools of people can I set the search against?

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  On the social search, it'll tie into anybody you've indicated on your social profile.  So it's your Google profile that it's using.  In Google, you have a profile and on the profile you can say, hey, this is my Twitter account.  You could say this is my LinkedIn account.  And if Google can get to that account and then see the people who are listed as your  friends and then in turn find them and they've listed what their websites are, then it can  use that as sort of a greater network.  Maybe they'll get more explicit down the line where you can actually go through and pick  out individual people.  But Twitter is a very good way, the way it starts off.  It can pretty fallacy go through and say, you say this is my Twitter account, look at  all those people, find the blogs that they say that they own and operate and refine the  results that way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's another reason to get your Google profile in a shape because it's going to be dwelling  information from here.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Well, and that's, you know, there's another reason they want to kind of try to get you  to do that because they haven't had much luck in getting people to do much of social  on Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, hey, I just went to my profile.  I noticed that there's a new tab in there.  There was about me.  Now there's a SideWiki tab that shows what I've written in my SideWiki.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They seem to be integrating Google profiles with all the new products.  Your profile in Wave is pulled solely from your Google profile, your profiles.google.com  page too.  So they're really pushing it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they need to if they're going to make a utility and give it some usefulness, right?

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  By the way, for the Twitter stuff, so they've got the social search that they kind of put  out there because, you know, they've got something in development.  They may still go ahead and do an actual Twitter search.  Down the line, you may actually be able to go to Google and search just Twitter stuff  specifically, not just tied to your friends.  But we're waiting to see what they'll do with that.  They just kind of really kind of said, look, we got a deal too.  We got a deal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So well, in the blog post, they kind of talked about, well, if there's a, I don't know,  if there's a snowstorm coming, you could you could do a search and you'd see all the tweets  about it.  Or if there's a traffic jam, you do a search.  So it sounded like there would be a search of the fire hose in addition to a search of  your friends, both of which have value.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What upset me, I'm glad to have it there.  But two things bothered me about about the announcements.  The first is that Twitter and Facebook with Bing are presumably selling content that is  not theirs, it's ours.  And that if as various folks, including Gina and Dave Weiner have asked if Twitter were  instead of the cloud, there'd be an API and you could just search it.  It wouldn't be a case of making a deal like that to one person, not the other.  Though Ev has said that he intends to make this not competitive and open, which I hope  and assume he'll do.  The second thing that bothers me is that it sets a terrible precedent because these, I'll  say it, idiot newspaper people, Danny writes about this, we'll hear about in a few minutes.  Who will now say, well, Google, you pay Twitter, you should pay us.  And of course, it's entirely different, but it's going to confuse the hell out of their  little brains.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They can't handle it.  I can't.  You can't handle the truth.  So I actually tweeted that and that I thought this is the problem with silos is that it  isn't global.  In fact, we've had this conversation with Twitter before.  My friends, Ken Shepperton and Dustin Sailings were saying we, you know, they were doing  a track service and they said we would like the fire hose.  We could add some real utility to it.  We'll eat the bandwidth.  And Twitter really kind of dithered and said, yeah, send me an email.  And but you don't want it.  It's really big.  And and Dustin said, I can handle it.  And I wasn't clear whether Twitter thought this is a monetization strategy or I don't

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  think so from what I've heard.  I don't know what Facebook is versus Twitter.  And I know Tinker.com has had the fire hose for a while.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Only a few have. Yeah.  So did Gnip.  But you had to kind of get permission.  And I think that's the point is that this should be kind of an open this information  should be open. We're all contributing to Twitter.  A number of people said, well, if you don't like it, don't use Twitter.  I don't think that's the answer either.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I mean, the data is I mean, there's an API available, right?  And the data is accessible to everyone.  I mean, we're talking about access to the it's limited, right?  We're talking about access to the fire hose, which is all the data are streaming real time,  which is an incredible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can only get a certain number of updates an hour if you use the API.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right. You can only get it right.  And so basically they let they white list certain companies to get to make, you know,  huge amounts of requests.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Your Twitterlytics program runs into that API limit, right?  You would you would like the fire hose.  I mean, you may not want it from a technical point of view, but that would be valuable to you,  wouldn't it? Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the fire hose is valuable.  But I think that like the bandwidth and I mean, that I don't know.  I do think that Twitter should be distributed.  And I don't like the idea that all everybody's tweets are centralized on Twitter servers.  That said, I do think that Twitter has been really generous about opening up access to the data.  And I don't think they're withholding the fire hose access for reason like for because  they're trying to hold on to the data.  I think it's I think it's just a scaling issue.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know. I guess what Dustin proposed is, well, just if you have a bandwidth issue,  send one copy of your fire hose to somebody who's willing to mirror it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is the issue, right?  Because on a mailing on the mailing list, a Twitter API mailing list, that I believe does  break Twitter's terms of service.  So you can't create a distributed network of nodes all who request as much data as they can  handle and then exchange it between one another peer to peer.  And this is what we need to distribute it.  And this is this is the thing that I that I think I am definitely in favor of doing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  On the deal with Facebook and did Facebook not do Google only Bing?  And what's the deal with Facebook and Bing?  Do we know?

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Facebook and Bing, my understanding is they didn't say Facebook.  It's Sheryl Sandberg.  It's that they didn't actually get any money for giving the data up.  Right.  So which was probably what are implied that they did.  It sounds like, yeah, yeah, which we sure love to know what the terms were, because what did  you get from this thing that everybody thinks is incredibly valuable?  We don't even we don't even know that like an ad deal was cut off of it.  But on Facebook, it's harder because, you know, I think people still don't quite realize that  they're putting some of this stuff out in public.  You have to actually change it and say you want to put it out in public or whatever.  But I think Facebook was kind of sensitive to the idea that they don't want to suggest that  they're just selling people's information.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Always the issue with Facebook, although they said that they would modify their user  interface to give you a chance.  I mean, already you can say everyone you can have an everyone setting for your status  updates and your photos and so forth.  They said they would surface that more and and make that more clear so that you could  choose to have your data be part of that search.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But can you go to a Facebook profile and not be logged into Facebook and see that profile?  No, even if you know, yes, somebody can make it up that way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  You know, you see like some information about it, like some information.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, you can choose to make everything.  I'm pretty sure you can choose to make everything available.  You just you go through you have your, you know, your limited profile, your public profile.  And that's where that everyone setting is.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  And that's part of what and I think one of the twin things here is over the past two  years, Facebook has opened up more and more of their information, in particular, to get  traffic from Google. More of this stuff is out there.  The events, the forums, the profile pages, because it brings them in traffic.  And so when you look at why, for example, Twitter would do this, Twitter's been under  pressure that, well, you're flattening off.  People aren't coming to the website.  We're not seeing enough information that's out there.  So when they do deals with Bing and they do deals with Google, on the one hand, you can  say, well, they're giving away their most valuable information.  But on the other hand, they're putting this stuff out in these huge traffic drivers.  And if that starts sending people back to the Twitter website, they may feel like this  is a good way to show that they still have growth going on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, but I think I think the Twitter website at some point becomes irrelevant.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hope so.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what has to hope that they're I mean, they're still looking for the business model.  Hello, business model.  Right.  So you're somewhere. I saw it a minute ago.  I think this is the first company that's built for the post page Internet.  They just don't know what it means yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's certainly valuable.  I mean, the idea that somebody dies or some event happens, you know, there's a boy in  the balloon to be able to see that real time.  And Google's been moving towards that with that sidebar thing that they do, you know,  in the last hour, the last day, the last week.  But it's not it's not really very valuable unless you have some sort of stream of  information like Twitter or Facebook that you're watching and that you do something

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  to have more relevancy than the last thing that was posted is the first thing at the  top. Yeah, curated somehow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How do you do that, though?  I mean, that's that sounds like a human.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  That's where you go. And you look at what Bing's saying that they're trying to do,  which is look at the person who's tweeting, look at the amount of times they've been  retweeted, try to get some sense of the authority of the person putting the information  out there as well as the authority of the tweet itself.  When I did a couple tests on it, they didn't really live up to the promises yet.  It's still a beta. So we'll see how it goes.  But I was still seeing spam. I was still seeing misleading stuff that was showing up  there. But yeah, that is the challenge.  How do you know to play with the different signals you can get to see if you can come  up with, if you will, some kind of a Twitter rank to know which Twitter is actually the  most important thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And at the same time, a tinker is trying to cluster the tweets,  like Google News or Daylife, where I'm a partner, are trying to do.  And it's really hard to analyze something over 40 characters long.  And it's going to take a while. But I think the more they can tie that to what's being  linked to what's in a conversation, what's you can at least maybe you're not getting  to the authority that Danny's talking about.  But you're getting to at least clusters of smarter views of what truly hot topics really  are and what's within those, what are the links within those, what are people talking  about?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Authority is really the issue. And how do you measure it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And when Matt Cutts was on a couple of weeks ago, Leo, when you're in Dubai, he was saying  that he felt like Google PageRank works, you know, works on Twitter just as well,  because people who get retweeted, you know, those things are links, inbound links.  And so you can tell authority, you know, not based on Twitter's internal metrics, like  how many followers people have and how many times they've been retweeted and how many  lists they're on or whatever the popularity metric of the week is, that PageRank actually  does scale to those because because things get linked.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think authority breaks down, though, in a real time world.  It's not as effective as the blog world where you have time to stew and get more links and  accumulate links. If you don't get retweeted, we tweet it right away.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But don't you always, when you get retweeted, it happens pretty instantly, doesn't it,  though? I mean, isn't it?  Yeah.  I find that response to my tweets is, I mean, basically within the first hour.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That could be a measure more of how many people follow you and how engaged your followers  are and what you're saying. In other words, it's an authority, but it's authority.  It's a very kind of this is Mr.  Tweet said this to me. He said, it depends, you know, to your to your, you know,  your kids are authoritative to you, Jeff.  I mean, what Jake says is authoritative, but completely unauthoritative.  Everybody, I guess if everybody's.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One size fits all doesn't work.  Right.  And that's why I think things like Twitter lists become interesting because you start  to cluster people around topics and then that starts to establish a new authority when  you understand what the topic is.  Fred Wilson, who invested in Twitter, was was tweeting about this and wondering whether  the Twitter list was the new follower.  I disagree. I think it's more like the new blog role or what I really want is tags.  I want to tag Gina in a list of people who are really authoritative about  technology and other things different from Jay Rosen about journalism, different  from somebody else about politics.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But they might be the same list.  So they're subdivided in that list.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or they're in somebody's different lists.  And as you start to see who's associated with whom, you now start to see who's  retweeting whom, who's associated with whom, who's quoting whom, who's writing  about what. It's the same exact kind of structure the blogs have tried to do for quite  some time. Who's in a constellation.  And once you have that, you may not have authority per se, but you might have  a sense of topicality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think lists, it's really interesting how the ecosystem can be changed so  dramatically by something so simple.  I think lists changes everything on Twitter.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a whole nother number to obsess about.  It is.  Initially.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I said that. I didn't know that Fred said it, but I said it as well.  Forget the follower number.  It's now how many lists you're on that matters.  Of course, it doesn't matter yet because everybody doesn't have lists.  But once once everybody gets lists, that's that's going to be a big number.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I should save this for the wish list time, but that's all I have.  I look at people who are at conferences and stuff and they have a hashtag for the  conference. But I come in halfway in and I wonder, where are they?  Right.  And I can't figure out where that is.  I wish we had a simple little nomenclature that says something like hashtag set  hashtag what you're using for the conference so that you can go look up and see  what is this hashtag mean?  Why does somebody put it in there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really it's two things here at work, taxonomy and authority.  And they're both really important.  And they're related. They're interrelated because authority within the taxonomy is  important.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it's a folks on me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a folks on me. Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what you're saying. I know you're not disagreeing.  We're not disagreeing. But I think that's the important thing is how do you make it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  emergent? Right. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Rather than determined.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Folks on me is a taxonomy that's determined by people ad hoc as it goes.  Is that emerges emerges.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Jeff, have you tried brisly?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Love brisly.  No, you got me, Gina.  I'm a brislier.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a it's a it's a Twitter interface.  It's actually it's a web based Twitter interface.  It's basically like the Twitter website just better.  And one thing that it has on the sidebar is that it lists all the current trending  topics on Twitter. And then there's a little link that says why.  And you click on that and you get an explanation of like why this topic exists.  And it sounds like that's what you're you're interested in for hash for general for all  hashtags like hashtags for my friends.  Why what do they mean?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the why is a wiki is a wiki why because anybody can add to the why.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Modify. I need that button for life.  I think. Yeah. Why.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The why button is so fun.  I love it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It should be an app on my iPhone.  I could just hit it any time and say why.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Grizzly is very cool.  I it's also we'll send you an invitation that Jeff.  Thank you. Yeah, because I think it's still invite only.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. I just looked at.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I feel left out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess I can. It says I can.  Yeah, that's right. You can't invite somebody.  Right. You have to tweet about it.  There's people are getting people are getting the social engineering going on now.  It's just stunning.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I love Grizzly.  I didn't love that part.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. I'm going to.  Jeff, quickly go to my Twitter account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to tweet this.  Invite Jeff.  Jump.  All right. Ready?  One, two, three.  Yes. Tweet this.  We'll see how long it lasts.  The last time I did it, they lasted about three seconds.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, it's nice. You pay tribute to Suppy sales.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I love Suppy sales.  Grew up with Suppy sales.  And I think a lot of us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No idea what we're talking about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't know who Suppy sales is?  Well, I'll give you a hint.  Probably the you know, you'd only see you'd only know by seeing  old kinemascopes in black and white.  That's how long ago Suppy sales was on TV.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I am Wikipedia right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. You'll find some on YouTube.  It's a it's an interesting kind of goofy sense of humor.  Jeff, you and I were probably kids when Suppy sales was at his heyday.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's why we still have a soft spot for him and Fang.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There I am. Thank you, Leo. Good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's one way to do it.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Come back with more with our guests.  What a great team here.  Of course, Gina and Jeff always the greatest.  But Danny Sullivan is also here of Search Engine land dot com,  a guy who's been an observer in this scene.  Thirteen years. Wow, Danny.  That's pretty amazing.  I'll talk more. I want to talk more about all this stuff.  But first, a word.  From our friends at Citrix, the folks who do those fabulous programs,  go to my PC, go to meeting.  And for those of you who are in the support business,  go to assist Expressive. You heard about this one?  This is fantastic.  I think it was a was it Colleen that was just using this a second ago?  You thought it was great, didn't you?  It's amazing. So here's the thing.  You got to assist somebody, you know,  phone support kind of thing.  And that's painful.  You don't ever want to you don't ever want to have to do this.  And, you know, you're there's a great video of John Meyer,  the you know, your body is a wonderland guy.  Somebody got him in a cell phone video of him talking to his dad  on the phone, he's like outside the concert hall.  He's going, no, dad, no.  OK, it's under the apple.  It's system preferences.  OK, dad, no, no, don't click that.  No. And at the very end, the very end, he says, dad, no, don't give up.  You can do this.  And I really felt for him. I know how that was.  And I tell you, if I had a coupon code to send him,  then I would have sent it to him for go to assist Express.  I'm going to send it to you right now.  You go to go to assist dot com slash twig T W I G.  And you can sign up for 30 days free.  So they're using all their great remote access software,  but they're using it for support professionals.  Now, individuals can use this.  They have a day pass, so if you've got the need for it, you can use it.  But really, it's aimed at the support pro.  There's some features that make it particularly useful for you.  For instance, unattended support.  Normally with a remote access, the other guys got to be there with this.  Once you set it up, you can get into their machine at any time and do the work.  You can have eight sessions at once.  And at any time anybody's done support, you know, you start an installer,  you start a scan.  Now what? You sit there, you read a book.  No, you go to the next one and the next one and the next one  makes you much more efficient.  It has another feature I really like.  It has an assay of what operating system is running on the remote machine,  what security software, all the programs running in the background.  That'll save you a lifetime of trouble.  Really a fantastic solution.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  Go to G-O-T-O-A-S-S-I-S-T.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  Secure 128-bit encryption, 24-7 support.  The easiest, the best.  If you want to start a support session, you just send them a link  or you can get on chat and you say here, go here.  Couldn't be easier. Go to assist.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this weekend.  Google, Googley.  You must have been a kid. I'm looking at you, Danny.  You must have been a kid when you started  search engine watch way back when.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  I wish I were a kid.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What was how what was the motive?  First of all, I mean, 1996, there's barely even blogging at the time.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Yes, we didn't have blogs.  I'd have been a blogger back then, but we didn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what did you what did you do?  Oh, it's just a web page about search engines.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Web pages.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  And but but you were essentially blogging.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's that was it.  You know, I had left newspapers, did web development for a year, had  clients who couldn't understand why they weren't showing up on search engines.  And so really started looking into the whole situation on how they operated  and published everything that I had found out is something I called a web  master's guide to search engines.  And it had both tips that you needed to know and also look at the marketplace.  Because at the time we had so many search engines and some of them  were incredibly difficult to submit to.  You know, you could spend hours literally filling out these forms  that they wanted you to do.  So I wanted to know the important ones.  So just kind of carried on with that.  And it took off.  You know, it became my my new career, the new beat that I was following.  And it was a lot of fun.  But it was just web pages.  They didn't.  You know, I use WordPress today.  I wish I'd had stuff like that back then.  I was writing on front page and pushing stuff across.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You didn't have a content management system.  You were just hand coding the pages.  Not at first.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Just writing it all up and pushing across.  Well, I mean, front page was a nice, actually good content management system.  You could do everything locally.  I worked off of a modem until 2004.  I lived in a little village in Britain.  So we we didn't have broadband.  So wow, it was a real treat when I finally got that.  It was it was nice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You're a patient man, which is a required trait for a blogger, by the way.  You have to be very patient.  And you obviously you obviously are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow. I mean, that's amazing.  What a story. That's wonderful.  Yeah, I remember we would we would check in with it to see.  I mean, wait, watch had some of the implication of watchdog, too, didn't it?

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Well, that was it.  And at the time when I started, we had a number of watch sites that had begun.  There was a board watch and I think there was Internet watch.  And so, you know, I thought, well, OK, I'll slap watch on the end of the name  and that'll fit in with the whole kind of thing.  Clearly today, I should have called it crunch or something.  But, you know, that stuff.  So but yeah, so just carried on with it from there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Crunch makes no sense, by the way.  I never understand all these crunch sites.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Well, they, you know, the brand gets built up and, you know,  I suppose the idea of the watch type of thing, you know, kind of fits in with it.  But, you know, you get these different things,  you get slapped onto the end of words and they make them distinguished in some way, I suppose.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Twitter, was it were you surprised by this Twitter deal  when it when it this real time deal when it came across?

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  A bit on the timing, I hadn't really thought, oh, what 2.0 is coming up.  They'll probably finally roll this stuff out as part of that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because you knew about you knew about the social search.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  And again, the social search independent of Twitter, they were able to do that,  which is the stuff they could see in the public.  That's not really real time.  That's tapping into your social network.  The real time aspect may be something completely new that will come.  But the that the timing that it was announced on that particular day  was a surprise that Google, you know, a couple hours later,  managed to get their own deal together and say, we have one, too.  It was definitely a surprise.  I thought they'd probably have to take a couple more days to to hammer out  whatever it was they needed to finish doing. Right.  Made for an exciting day. Yeah. No kidding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Another announcement this week.  Wolfram Alpha has an API, but it's it's paid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It paid.  Auto paid. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For 50 bucks, you can get the iPhone.  I don't understand that at all.  I mean, you could still use the Web page for free.  Has anybody had the  initiative to buy the iPhone app just to see what you get?

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  I've got it. I'll try to get it up in a minute.  I couldn't get it to work.  I had a demo thing that they sent across. And

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm very curious. I mean, what could you get for 50?  I mean, that's not you getting the price.  You get an app on your phone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The scientific calculator.  But I can see that. Oh, look at that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It looks like a keyboard. What is that?

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Yeah, it is sort of.  It's like got a little search box on it.  And it's got a huge keyboard  underneath with a lot of both numbers and letters,  which I think is probably designed for some of the mathematicians  that they think they want to use.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's as Jeff said, it's kind of a knowledge calculator. Yeah.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Well, it's you know, I think that they who knows?  I mean, I think they it is in the same way that Wolfram on the site itself is.  I think that they figure that you're going to have some people  who are really into the kind of data that they can use that aren't going to think  twice about paying $50.  Right. And which is an interesting change because the website was designed to be more  hey, anybody should be able to use this.  So and in the time since they launched that site,  I think it's fair to say it hasn't really taken off.  You know, at one point you had people talking about it  as being a Google killer, this huge revolution, just kind of sitting there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's too difficult to.  To figure out, I mean, if I almost wish I would just could take,  you know, a few days and think of and kind of start to understand  how to how to make queries, if you know how to make queries, it's very valuable.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's why I'd be powerful on top of it is you could take something  that's complicated, like, I don't know, wave right.  And Wolfram Alphera and create engines that would be usable for us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That makes sense.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But if the API is expensive, it's going to limit the use of the API.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you want 50,000 requests, it'll cost you 2100 bucks  and a nickel a nickel a request after that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Holy crap.  Excuse my reaction.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's not so 50,000  requests isn't that much.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, no. Oh.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And we're used to making mistaken requests and going back at it.  Yeah, seriously.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I can't tell you how many times I locked myself out of Twitter  developing my Twitter app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you wanted a personal use plan, that would be a thousand requests.  That would be 60 bucks.  And then after that, eight cents a request.  But I don't know, is that for a year?  I don't know what the term is. Yeah.  Well, they have to pay for all this stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A thousand requests a day, an hour, month.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a monthly plan.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's all you get in the end is knowledge that is already  somewhere on the Internet or somewhere in a book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I take it back.  The personal plan is that you buy a block of requests.  And when you use up a thousand, you buy another one.  The developer and business plans are monthly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think I'd spend my time figuring out how I could scrape the website  from different IP addresses.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you get the same data, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's not like. Yeah, I shouldn't say that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Some of the data is not from the web, it's from books and things like that.  But still, if you scrape WolframAlpha,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you just write an interface to WolframAlpha.  You wouldn't you could do it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I should say, I think WolframAlpha is really cool.  Oh, I love it.  And Danny's point actually is really interesting.  I mean, the sell right was that this data should be available,  not just to hardcore researchers, it should be available to anyone.  But then they're, you know, they're charging $50 for an iPhone app.  For a price. Yeah, exactly.  Although I guess that's not much more than some desktop software.  So I don't know. I guess it depends on.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  I guess if you're, you know, if you're a mathematician  and you know, Mathematica and you do these sorts of things, right.  This might be a great calculator type for you to use.  I'm not. So it makes nothing to me.  I did another thing where you've got to know if you can see it again.  But one of the examples they were putting in there, so I go this way,  is like Big Mac calories.  And it's what you get on the web.  You go up there and it'll tell you how many calories you've got along.  Four hundred and fifty three or whatever.  Don't count this a lot of calories.  But I could do that.  I think I can do that.  Just launching Safari and going to WolframAlpha on the web.  So if you're not doing the calculations,  I don't think that you probably are going to want to make much use of this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an interesting.  I mean, I guess they need money.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think that is right.  If you they need to package different versions of it,  or they need to enable the API to be made in different things.  And if it's just web knowledge like Big Mac calories,  there's no resale market for that. Right.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  But this is also really common, though, for  it's really common for companies that launch these new search products  and they don't quite know what they're going to do, that where they end up  that can be radically different.  A classic example was Applied Semantics.  And this was back in 1997, 98.  And their whole goal was to try to help you search better with search  refinement, all these things.  It became AdSense.  I mean, their product was actually called AdSense.  Google launched their own AdSense product under a different name.  They ended up buying Applied Semantics,  bringing some of that technology in.  But it was supposed to be this thing for like scientists and researchers.  And it turned into an ad product, like, you know, radically different.  So I think Wolfram is probably going to throw a lot of stuff against the wall  and try to figure out what's going to stick, especially given the investment  they put into it. And they may not know.  And I think Wolfram actually said that at one point.  He didn't quite know what might happen with this.  So I'm sure we'll see even more evolutions of it going along.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But at this point, I think he'd use some VC money to open it up  and figure out what it is. Right.  That's that's that's to me the issue is that it is it is too soon to close up  in a way that's going to lead to really interesting development.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have an article in your blog, Jeff Howard Stern 3.0,  the future of entertainment.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I was listening to Howard on my Sirius radio and I'm a Howard fan  this week because he's the other guy who talks about penises, you know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's you and Howard, the two of you.  Yeah. And so I heard something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And because my new Sirius radio, I could back it up like a TiVo and listen to it.  I said, I got to hear that again.  And Howard talked about what he could do tomorrow on the Internet  and how obviously we all know this could make it watchable.  Listen to live. You could listen to on the iPhone.  But he said, and I wouldn't have to work for a company.  Yeah. So I thought I saw the future of.  Yeah. Howard.  And so then Tim Windsor came in the comments and said, well, that's Leo.  That's exactly what I'm doing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the whole point of it was was precisely I didn't want to do it.  Precisely. I'd be my own company.  I didn't want to have to work for anybody.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think you should give Howard a tutorial.  I should give him a call. Howard, though.  Howard, though, that to Gary Delabatte.  Yeah. Have you ever talked to Howard or called him?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No. But I mean, I think it's really interesting that here's a guy who had,  you know, maybe 10 to 15 million listeners  went for the gold, partly because he was just fed up with the FCC and broadcast.  So he took half a billion dollars from Sirius  and went from we don't know, but went probably from 15 million listeners  to fewer than a million listeners.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, no. It's more than that because he brought in a loan.  Eight million people. Did he?  They can listen time and time again.  So, you know, the guessing is that it could be four or five.  But that's guessing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's still a big drop.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a big drop, but but it's a lot of money and it's freedom.  But on the Internet again, you know, I suppose the guy was against paid content.  But I pay for Howard now.  I would pay for Howard on the Internet. Right.  He would have a direct relationship with people.  There'd be no middleman.  You know, he's you.  And he wants to do video and he wants to do exact things you're doing.  And how much does your whole you have a you have a deluxe Cadillac setup right now.  Right. Yeah.  You were to recommend to somebody to have it's cigarette money for Howard.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's, you know, for well under 100000, he could do this.  Yeah. Well under.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's that's that's easy money for him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And we're doing we're we did two and a half million in revenue this year.  That's awesome, Leo.  So there's there's money in this.  And I mean, the Howard look, if you make half a billion dollars,  you probably don't need to work anymore.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He was making that point, too.  He was he was complaining about Rush Limbaugh selling tacky chairs  and t-shirts and stuff.  And Gary Delabatti was asking him and saying, well, you know,  if it's a million dollars, Howard and Howard was saying, no, you don't need that.  You don't want to rip off your list. He's right.  And so I think for Howard, he's kind of burying himself.  Plus, my thought is it serious?  Got some major proportion of that payment, probably in stock.  Right. As a serious stockholder, I can tell you,  you know, worth a whole lot.  I'm very happy that my Google is up and my Amazon is way up.  My Apple's doing well, but my serious is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it really I mean, it really is the future of broadcasting.  It's funny because my motivation is very similar to his because  and I'll tell you, everybody I ever met in radio,  their dream was to own a radio station.  And the reason was not because you make so much money  owning a radio station, but because then you'd be the boss.  Nobody tell you what to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, for cocked programming director.  Yeah. But on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a stupid motivation, frankly, but that's the motivation.  And it was certainly what motivated me.  I think it's very interesting.  I mean, hey, Howard, you know, I'm sure he listens to Twig.  Anytime, dude, just come on over. I'll show you how we do it.  It's simple.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's the motivation for people who love it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. You know what I yes, you're exactly right.  You show the way, Leo.  It's your motivation to Gina, right?  It's all of our motivation. We want to do what we love.  We don't want any limits on it.  We don't want somebody saying, where's our T.P. six report?  You got to you know, we got to come to another meeting.  We just want to do what we love.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I do it just because I can't stand the idea of shutting up  and not, you know, and not writing, you know, that would I think I would explode.  But, you know, that's a there's a particular kind of personality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's in some ways, you know, we've we've lived in a patronage system  since Leonardo, you know, where an artist can't create without a rich,  wealthy patron. Mass media has really been an example of that.  Jeff doesn't get to write unless, you know, somebody at Time Life says he can write.  I don't get to do a radio show unless somebody at Clear Channel  says I can do a radio show. It really is a patronage system.  And I don't know if artists know how to live in a world  where they don't have to have patrons.  The only patrons are your consumers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Are you listening to the post?  Sorry, have you seen Kickstarter?  No, what's that? Yeah, Kickstarter is cool.  Kickstarter is fascinating.  It's designed right now for artists and authors and journalists and such.  But I think it's a fundamental economic change, because the idea is that you can go in there.  And the guy who designed Obama's campaign went in there and said,  if I raise 60,000 bucks enough to pay for the first printing, we'll create the book.  So I went in and I preordered the book.  You could Robin Sloan, who was at Current TV,  who was an Internet pioneer, is trying to write a novel right now.  And he put an amount in there and said, if I get enough money,  I'll write it.  And so it's really rather like the one percent rule of Wikipedia.  If enough patrons choose to support you, then you do it.  And you do it for the whole world, then this is amazing.  You might still sell it.  And maybe maybe the patrons get some benefit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, how committed is this?  Are you if you commit? I mean, what is the pledge?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You give them your credit card.  That's it. If they do it, you're paying.  But you know, you might be able to go to a movie studio, a movie lot  to watch it being made or go to the premiere or something like that.  You've invested in it is like spot dot us for journalism.  You've invested in this thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wish this had been around when I was when I was trying to build Twitter.  This is fantastic. Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I talked to Fred Wilson, the VC, about it this week.  He's one of the kind of clued me in on the bigger picture.  And he was talking about somebody he knows who wants to start a kickboxing studio.  And he can go to something like this and say, give me a thousand bucks.  You'll get free kickbox kickboxing for a year.  But I'm free funded.  I basically go on to my customers proactively, you know, preemptively  and gotten the money in to fund the business without having to go  to another damn middleman.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like it's like micro patronage, right?  Like, like Kiva, like Kiva for Patron. Yeah.  Yeah. Like Jason Kotke a few years ago, he said he kind of ran a,  you know, micro patronage drive and said, hey, like, just give me five, ten bucks.  And I'm trying to raise enough money so that I can, you know, support  support my blogging habit and make it a full time job for a year.  And he did incredibly well.  He already had a platform, but that's what Kickstarter does,  is that gives you this this platform to do that. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I just kind of  bootstrapped it, but it's the same idea.  I mean, you know, of course, I'm in a little bit different  because I'm in I'm in free media.  So the money comes from advertisers as opposed to the audience.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. Right. But I think you can do either here.  I think you can start most anything this way.  I like this better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We would have I mean, what we my plan when we started  to it was never to take advertising, just let every let the have a direct  drive mechanism, you know, the people who listen to it pay for it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it's the ultimate consumer research.  If people won't pony up, then you know, you shouldn't do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow, it's fascinating. Isn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Jeff, are you going to use Kickstarter to to do a project?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have this book that I wanted to do about saving newspapers.  And my editor said, please, no, please don't propose that.  No, don't do it.  And just, you know, from my nose and see what what's what.  The problem is, I have to actually do it.  That's right. All right.  A hundred losses.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, I'm looking at the front page and I wonder how many I mean,  there's got to be many, many, many, many more projects in here  who never do get funded.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's interesting, too, though, about the also a notion of investment.  So, Gina, I would invest in you writing, you know.  Android apps. You bet.  And if you got enough money to say, OK,  Gina says it's worth three weeks of my time to do this.  I got enough money to do that. I'll put it up.  And, you know, I get the app free or I got some tutorial from Gina  or I get some benefit or you pay back your investors at some point.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Just right. Right.  Return the money. That's interesting.  Yeah, I've been I've been Kickstarter is quite tempting, isn't it?  It really does give you that license of like, oh, all those things  that I wanted to do, I bet, you know, this really can help me do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We live in exciting times, don't we?  We do.  Here's a new web page from Google, Google  Freedom of Expression.  It's a YouTube page.  What's the idea behind this?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In honor of the Berlin Wall's fall, that's the German PR director  from Google you're showing there, Kai Oberbeck, I think his name is.  And they wanted to open up a page about  why freedom of expression matters.  And I think that's that's great.  You know, Google and we all live on that.  My smartass response to it is also I wonder whether this is being seen in China.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly. Yeah, guarantee not.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  It's kind of like a few years ago, they did a big thing on  for their book service and they talked about banned books week  and how how bad that was.  And it was the same sort of thing.  So we you're against banned books in the US, but it will ban certain things  in China, you know, OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We have the other the double irony here, Danny, is that Chinese publishers  are now going after Google for copyright.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good luck. Good luck with that.  Hope that works out for him.  She's. Let's see here.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Should we talk about raindrop?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yes. Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Drizzle. I've been waiting for that, Gina. Drizzle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is raindrop?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So Mozilla, which is my other kind of cloud cloud company love,  is launching a new product called Raindrop, which is interesting.  There are two interesting things to note about it, and it's not available yet.  Right. So there's just demo videos out there.  The first one is that it's a web application.  So it's not Firefox. It's not Thunderbird.  It's not an installable app, right, which is straight, which is different,  different for Mozilla. It's a web app.  And what it does, I mean, it's kind of trying to solve the same problem  that Google Wave is, but in a different way.  And this seems to be this seems to be like the 2009, you know, sell  for new new messaging apps is, you know,  what email would be, you know, what email should be or a better email.  This is this has been going on for a while, but I think Wave really kind of  brought it up, brought it along.  Raindrop is basically it's a messaging application.  So Google Wave takes email and says this should be document.  You know, it's really document collaboration.  That's really what you're doing.  But but Raindrop is saying, no, we want to give you an easier way  to manage your messages.  So what it does, the premise is that, you know, your mom sends you an email  and that that email shouldn't get pushed down by another message  from some mailing list that you only browse, that there's a, you know,  messages should be prioritized differently based on who they're from  and how important those people are to you.  And that's the whole point of Raindrop.  It's going to it's going to integrate your messages from different platforms,  Twitter, Facebook, your email, all the different places  where you get communications.  And then it's going to smartly prioritize those based on how important they are to you.  You know, we've heard a few a few different companies and products  have tried to solve this problem and it really hasn't been solved yet.  So it'll be interesting to see what Raindrop does.  But but there are a couple of design mockups on Flickr  and there are a few demo videos on Vimeo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't this kind of stuff really hard to do?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think so. I think so.  But but I don't know.  I mean, now that if you use one unified app to to to interact,  I think that you can it can figure out there's enough information contacts are.  Yeah. I mean, based on your activity.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  I mean, it's something that  something that Gmail ought to be able to do right now.  Right. I mean, it or any inbox system is looking at the people that  you're already sending to a lot.  It should be able to know what you send to this person a lot.  So I'm going to make sure that's prioritized.  And this is one of the things that Yahoo was talking about with their inbox,  that they were spending a lot of time saying, well, you'll be able to identify  who your friends are. You'll be able to tag them this way.  You'll take that way.  And first, I thought, well, I don't want to spend all that time.  I just want you to do the work and figure it out magically and make it happen.  So, yeah, if you just look at the contacts that are going along,  you ought to be able to do it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, Gmail already has like a most frequently contacted  or suggested contacts. I forget what they call it.  But if you go into Gmail context, they they they do have by frequency list.  So they should be able to do that.  I mean, I think part of what Raindrop is saying is that, you know,  the way that we get notifications from different systems like Twitter and Facebook  is that they send us email notifications.  So like if Leo sends me a Facebook message, the message appears to be from Facebook,  but it's actually from Leo.  And I think the idea is that Raindrop would be would be aware of Leo's identity  and be able to let me know, like, hey, this is Leo.  This is just across those.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Solidate your Google reader, your Facebook, your Twitter, your email,  everything. Right.  And then algorithmically try to help prioritize it for you. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's the dream.  I already know that's exactly what the buyers have been talking about.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And listeners get mad at me when I say this again, but the hyper personal news  stream. Right. Right.  You've got both companies working on this.  You know, it wouldn't be hard for Google to bring together your reader  and your Gmail and your Twitter now and something else and learn enough about you  to prior to preemptively try to prioritize.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, it seems like this is something Google would be better at than anybody.  I mean, they know more about us than anybody.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  You've got Gmail already configured so that you can pull in from multiple email  accounts. So, you know, you can you can bring in your Yahoo mail.  You can bring in your Hotmail.  You've got that account. You can bring all that stuff into one central inbox.  If they had a way for them to actually I mean, I get stuff sent to me on Facebook.  And what's annoying to me is I've got enough inboxes to deal with.  So most of my Facebook mail gets ignored.  But if that was actually, you know, if that was actually coming in through IMAQ  or POP or something like that is actual regular mail message, then that would kind  of solve the issue of knowing that it really is you and who that person is as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, why not roll Google Voice into it as well?  And why? I mean, you put my voicemail, my text messages in there, put all  contacts into that. And who's going to do that better than Google?  I mean, Google's got it got all that.  That'll be wave.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  No, we will be able to take care of everything for you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is there a wave backlash?  You think people are starting to turn on wave, aren't they?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think they're just turning on us for talking about it all the time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That could be it.  No, no, no.  It's a combination of the people feeling left out because they weren't invited and  also the just like WTF factor, which is like, you know, when I hear that most from

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  people who got a wave invite finally and said, oh, what is this?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I got the it's like the day after Christmas.  I got the invite and I'm in and.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I also think there's a little bit of not vetted here going on of people.  You know, you can turn into an old fart really early.  And some of the people, I won't name names, who've complained about it, I think,  say, well, I invented the future of the Internet.  They can't do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me think who that would be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm not saying I'm not saying a single syllable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Who could you be thinking of?  Let's see, we're going to get to our tips in just a second and our wines of the week  or wish list, as Jeff prefers, because he's a positive, positive guy.  But before we do that, I do want to talk a little bit about backing up your data.  This is we haven't talked about Windows 7.  Anybody want to say anything about Windows 7?

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Oh, I got a copy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got a copy.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  I bought a copy.  It was exciting.  I went into fries.  Look, look, he's got it in the bag.  Oh, wait a minute.  We got to get it.  I went into the fries.  Just I had time to go do some shopping and I walked in and you just bought it.  I had to ask somebody where it was.  And it really surprised me because I thought this is this big, huge rollout.  Right.  And I expected huge kiosks and I could hear them making announcements.  I've come to see the new demo and everything.  So I thought it must have been a big failure.  But then I actually found somebody and he showed me where it was.  He said they'd been flying off the shelf.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we had we had a party on Thursday.  We had Windows 7 house party.  Oh, yeah.  I stopped by to check it out.  Yeah.  We even have a puzzle here that we had.  We had a race between because they kindly included a jigsaw puzzle.  I can't really pick it up.  It'll fall apart.  But they kindly included a Windows 7 jigsaw puzzle.  And we had a race to see if we could finish the puzzle faster than the install.  And we did.  So that was fun.  That's the activities they were talking about.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  I've got an old Windows Vista laptop that's just been sitting behind me for about a year  and a half.  So I thought maybe I'll get some use out of it now because it wasn't with this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I really like it, actually.  I really like it.  The most of the reason I want Windows is so I could run Chrome for crying out loud,  although I guess we're getting Mac Chrome sometime soon.  Yeah, yeah, it's coming.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The the the dev version is pretty good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The is that Chromium or is that something else?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's it's it's something else.  Chromium is from.  Why?  It's a Chromium build for the Mac, which is available now.  OK.  And I could be wrong, but I think that they fork the the official releases of Chrome,  often the Chromium project.  And just somebody on Twitter just corrected me, Mike Tellen.  Thank you. There is code available for raindrop.  It's preliminary code.  You have to check it out of a of a of a source code repository.  So it's you know, it's the rock salt.  You know, one ice cream, here's the rock salt.  But but but there is code available.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that what programmers say?  Here's the rock salt.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a man how he said about my my Twitter program.  He said, I hate it when I click on links and wind up on GitHub.  It's like saying one ice cream is the rock salt.  That's good. That's a good line.  Yeah. So there's rock salt there for raindrop, it looks like.  Love that.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  They were really close to that Mac version.  And then, you know, now the Google and Apple hate each other.  It's probably a bit slower.  I didn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wasn't Larry or no, it was Eric Schmidt was apologizing,  saying how bad he felt that the Mac version was so far behind.  Yeah, I feel really bad.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  There'll be a version for Chrome OS.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How hard could it be?  Come on. How hard could it be?  Apparently more than a year's worth of hard.  How I don't get it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't want that. It's really pretty stable.  It's the one that's that's available.  It's pretty stable.  I'll be using it with Wave on my Mac.  And it's it's you know, it's got a couple of little things  that need to be fixed.  But it's pretty good right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've been using it. It's fine.  I just don't get it.  What?  Anyway, that's why I wanted Windows 7 so I could run Chrome  and I wanted Chrome so I could run Wave.  And I'd have no idea why I wanted Wave.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're going to Windows 7,  you know, the most important thing to do is to back up.  You got it. Back up first.  Anytime you're upgrading or making a change, you are backing up.  Of course, you're backing up all the time.  You wouldn't dream of having a computer.  What? You're not always.  Oh, my goodness. We've got to do something about that.  It's time to get yourself a copy of Carbonite.  Carbonite.com.  It's backup done right.  And I'll tell you why it does it automatically.  So you don't have to think about it.  That's one of the problems with backup.  There's there's two that I can see.  One is nobody does it.  You just because it's a pain.  So you forget. So you don't do it.  So Carbonite handles that by just doing it in the background all the time.  Once you install Carbonite, identify those precious files,  the emails, the photos, the music, the things you can't afford to lose.  It just says, OK, fine, I'll take it from here.  It backs it up, backs it up to the cloud.  See, that's the second problem.  The second problem is people might be backing up,  but they back up to a hard drive right next to their computer.  What happens if the worst happens?  A fire, a flood, a tornado in your house blows over.  It goes to Kansas.  And then you've lost a backup is the same as you've lost your computer.  That's no good.  To have a backup, a true backup, you need to get it off site.  You need to get it away from the originals.  Carbonite does that.  It uploads your backups, encrypts them, encrypts them with a 128 bit  DES, no AES, I'm sorry, encrypts them.  Then using SSL, so it's encrypted again, it sends it up to the Carbonite  servers where it stays safe and sound till you need it.  You can access it any time from any computer by logging into your Carbonite  account or if it's time for a restore, just a couple of clicks of the mouse  and boom, you download that file.  Now, here's the best part.  It backs up all these files, the photo, the music, the emails, the financial  records, the office documents.  It backs unlimited amount for less than $5 a month.  For $54.95 a year, backup as much as you want.  As long as it's on your computer, you can back it up.  You don't have to think about it.  There's no second tier or anything.  Mac and PC, try it free right now.  Go to carbonite.com, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com and use a coupon code, twit.  Now, here's what's going to happen, by the way.  I want you to sign up for the free trial.  Even if you know you want this.  Fix that coupon code.  I have the wrong one there.  Even if you know you want this, I want you to sign up for the free trial  because even if you use a free trial for just one or two days, when you then  sign up for Carbonite, you'll get two months free.  So it's worth it.  I mean, it's always a good idea to try it.  Make sure it works.  Make sure you understand how it works.  You're comfortable with it.  And there's no cost.  You don't even need a credit card.  It does require an Intel Mac.  So I know I get emails sometimes people say, I have an old PowerPC Mac.  No, I'm sorry.  It won't work on that.  But it does work on all the Intel Macs and it also works on Windows.  And you're going to love it.  C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.  Carbonite is back up, done right.  So we do a little thing, Danny, every week.  Gina has a tip.  Jeff has a number.  I have a tool.  And then we get our wish list.  Anything you wish for, having to do with the cloud.  It's not like a puppy or something.  So we'll get to that.  And we'll give you a chance to have your wish.  But let's start with Gina's tool of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  My tip this week is a new feature that rolled out in Google Reader,  which is pretty cool.  If you click on any subscription or any folder full of subscriptions,  you can now sort it by, I think from the folder settings button,  choose the sort by magic option.  I love magic.  Yeah, I love magic.  Who doesn't love magic?  You can sort by newest, sort by oldest, and then you can sort by magic.  And magic is Google's algorithm.  It takes Google Reader, tracks your behavior and what items you've been  looking at and what items you like and which items you share and comment on.  It takes that data and tries to figure out what items would be most interesting to you.  So sort by magic.  It's kind of awesome because if you want to just hit your feed meter for just a few  minutes and just see what the most important stuff and in fact,  I tried it this week and I tried it earlier today when I was looking for,  when I was researching stories for the show and it did really well.  It suggested items that I was certainly interested in.  Now, in the blog post, they said that this data is based on the things you share and  like in Google Reader.  So if you're using those options, which I am, you'll get better data.  So I don't think it's just what you look at.  But it's a lot like Flickr's interestingness on photos, except that it's based on your  behavior, not what other people have done.  But I think it might even look at what things that your friends have liked as well in  Reader. But it's pretty cool. It is indeed magic.  It was good for me. I'd be interested to see, Leo, what you think if it turns up  interesting items for you, if you give it a try.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So show me how to do this again.  I'm going to go to where?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Click on a folder or click on any subscription and then in the folder settings  button at the top.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, I can say sort by newest, oldest, sort by magic.  And it somehow knows that this is what I would be most interested in.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, in terms of what you what you might think is relevant.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google Chrome Themes video uses some YouTube magic to make a lasting impression.  See, I would be interested in that.  Look at that. There you go.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There you go. My top hits were pretty good, too.  That's neat. It works really well in folders, especially, I think, when you have lots of

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  subscriptions. Yeah, I use you know, there's two different services.  Feed Hub and AdrSS that will give me kind of a hot stuff, you know, hot, hot articles  based on the number of clicks and so forth.  Like, here's my AdrSS top stories.  In Japan, nerds control girls with joysticks.  But so that's the so that's the newest.  Let's sort by magic. I think that's what it knows about you.  Yeah, no, top 10 top 10 entrepreneurs to watch.  So that's neat. That's really cool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know why. So, Gina, is this dare I say it one more time and get more trouble?  This feeds into what we're talking about with raindrop and the algorithmic guessing and  the news stream, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I honestly had made the connection.  But yeah, it is. It's based on your behavior and what you've expressed interest about  at your gestures with on data.  It's making suggestions, smart suggestions.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The ultimate Google wish for the world is to know your intent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Right.  So they can sell it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it knows much more than your intent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they can sell it.  If you if I knew you intended to buy a Ford F-150 pickup, I'd be rich.  And now our number of the week for Mr.  Jeffrey Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Two million.  I found it interesting that that's the number of businesses Google bragged on its  official blog are now using Google apps in the enterprise with 20 million users,  100 countries, 40 languages.  OK, I got the sales.  Well, what really interested me was that they then have a commercial.  We don't see commercials from Google.  Yahoo spends two hundred million dollars to put commercials up.  Google doesn't put commercials up.  They have a new commercial campaign called Go Google that they're putting in airports  and all around.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've seen billboards in Silicon Valley.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly. They're bragging about all the companies that are going out.  And so then it all made sense because a few days later, I saw a link.  Eric Schmidt says that enterprise is the next big opportunity for Google.  And it's going to be a different business model that they don't think that as  supported enterprise stuff will work terribly well.  And so they're going to charge people for stuff.  And their price point is lower than everybody else's.  Like, guess who?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so Google is now starting to pitch into enterprise, saying that they already  have a huge base of two million enterprises to begin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they're trying to get Google apps primarily right in there.  That's the wedge anyway.  And that ties into my tool of the week, which is something Gina and I have talked  about before. In fact, when we first talked about this show, she said, OK,  could be about Google, but make sure it's about cloud so I could talk about Zoho apps.  And Zoho apps are fantastic and now even more Googley.  This is basically like Google apps on steroids.  I mean, they have the basic apps, but they also have, you know,  Wiki 67 more.  Is it that how many?  It just goes on and on. There's CRM.  There's discussions. There's online web conferencing.  There's invoicing project manager.  I mean, it just goes on. And this is the new feature.  You can use your Google apps log in to.  So if you have one of those corporate Google apps accounts,  you can integrate this in, even import and export, share Google apps documents.  So it really is nice to have that kind of interface to Zoho.  Do you know when you have a choice, Gina, do you?  Will you choose sometimes to use Zoho office instead of Google?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I haven't switched to Zoho just because of just like inertia,  momentum, you know, just I'm just used to using Google tools.  But every time I look at Zoho, which is pretty often because they're often  rolling out new stuff and they send us press releases at Lifehacker,  I look at it and go, this is this is just great.  I mean, it's just a matter of like habit and what I'm used to and,  you know, just wanting to kind of keep up with what Google's doing.  So I haven't made the switch and I actually feel kind of ashamed to say that  because it really is a fantastic product.  And now that they have the Google sign in for both the vanilla account  and a Google Apps account, it's really that, you know, they're doing everything.  They can lower the barriers for people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought maybe this would be a fun thing to use for our business.  We use Google Apps very heavily to share, you know, projects, ideas and so forth.  I thought because of the integration, I could do this.  I was able to set up a Twit, you know, account with a Twit logo  and and, you know, and share it and so forth and have shared email and stuff.  So I think that there's for.  And how do you like it?  It's very impressive.  You know, I have to say, I'm kind of prejudiced towards Google  because I know they're going to be around.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there's that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, and and I'm sure I mean, Zoho has a financial model  that that makes a lot of sense and, you know, works really well.  But and, you know, for instance, they don't have a project planner on Google.  So I'm using the project planner for some projects of ours.  And it just it makes sense, especially in the areas where Google doesn't have a tool.  Right. Right.  Certainly worth taking a look at, especially as you say, now that there's a Google login.  And finally, we'll wrap up with our wish lists.  Danny, have you thought of anything you wish would come true in the world of Google?

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not so much from Google.  It's probably the newspapers that are poking at Google.  I I felt like this week we'd reached this new low point in this debate  when the Wall Street Journal Managing Editor had suggested  that Google was causing people to be promiscuous online. Oh, great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Somehow, you know, sexually promiscuous or news promiscuous,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  promiscuous to sources.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Oh, OK. We're being news sluts when we go to Google.  And we think that we can just ignorant news sluts.  I know. I I felt so dirty.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's horrible.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  But no, but this was I mean, it came up at the Web 2.0 conference.  And there were a number of slams like that.  And I just kind of felt like this was from the same person  that was also saying that, you know, they felt like we needed to have  a rational debate about professional journalism where we go.  And I'm thinking, yeah, I think that we could use rational debate  or actually we could just use a more rational discussion of what solutions are.  And what I tend to hear from the industry poking at Google,  it's just a lot of complaints and not a lot of solutions other than.  Welcome to my life, Danny.  This is why I live with every time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There was a really great post you wrote in response to Robert Thompson  of the Journal, and I tweeted it was it was, yeah, what he says.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Well, and thank you.  And I but, you know, I would love for you and I and everybody else  to be able to get past having to to debunk the the charges  and just start talking about the solutions.  And one of the things is like, you know, I don't I'm not a Google fanboy.  I just like to have balance.  And when I watch that thing, I thought there was no balance  and there wasn't anything reasonable.  I for the life of me, I still can't figure out what the Wall Street Journal  seems to want because they had everything that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They want to have a simple I think I was talking to somebody  who used to work with Google about just this topic this week.  And I think the newspapers don't want a friend.  And it was Google's mistake to think that they could befriend them.  And instead, the newspapers want someone to blame because they f'd up.  They've had 15 years since commercial browser came out 15 years ago this month.  And they haven't done Jack because they protected their old world.  And I've been trying to work with them and, you know, I want to see them  advance in the future. And some people are getting smart.  The New York Times is doing good things and so on and so forth.  Martin Nissenholz defended Google and said, welcome to competition.  The executive of the New York Times is in charge of digital.  But you're right, Danny, it's all it is, is whining and mewling and moaning  and mourning and no constructive sense of how to move forward.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Well, and so that's my wish. I want that constructive thing.  I want the specifics. I don't want any more of the rhetoric.  I want to know exactly what it is that you want so that we can actually go forward,  because I think enough time has been waited on on the accusations that go.  And, you know, I'd like to see that.  I think there are things that can happen.  I think there are places where people definitely needs to be called on  and held up. But when they do that, I want them to stand up when they do it.  And most of the time, I just don't see the stuff standing up. So.  I wish I could be more positive about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, that's why I call it the wine, not the wish.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  You're right. If they could be wine, it was a good one.  All right. Go ahead.  More time. I'll come up with a wine against Google itself.  No, that's fine. I think that's a very good one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a very good one.  I think that's appropriate.  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the good news half of this is that Google worked out a deal with Virgin  to provide free Wi-Fi access on planes across country.  That's the good news. Now, my wine would just stop saying,  gee, you won't believe it.  I'm in an airplane and I'm online.  Enough. I'm fed up.  Enough tweets. We got it.  I've done it.  Say you won't believe where I'm calling from.  OK, you can tweet from the air. We know it. Stop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. I did it once in night.  It was about five years ago on S.A.S.  and I'll never do it again. I apologize.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think five years ago was probably OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was pretty unusual then.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was unusual then. Yeah. Yeah.  I have not. I have yet to have Wi-Fi on a plane.  And when I do, I will absolutely tweet that I have.  And I'm going to annoy Jeff.  I'm on a plane.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How long?  How long before Saturday Night Live does a parody song?  I'm on a plane.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wonder whether those those pilots were too busy tweeting.  That's why they missed their other destination this week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What happened? They over over sailed it.  What? They flew 150 miles. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Whoopsies.  Yeah. Oops.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oopsies. You know, air traffic controllers think all pilots are idiots.  They just wish they'd leave it on autopilot the whole way.  Just let us bring you in.  I talked to a pilot when I was on Emirates flying to Dubai as a fan.  Hi, Bruno.  And he told me he was really interesting.  You know, he flies the A380, which is the big airbus.  And he said,  it's fly by wire, you know, in the old days, you'd turn you to feel the rudders,  you'd feel movement, you'd feel shake.  And of course, they simulate that so that you know what's going on with the plane.  But really, it's joystick. It's electronic.  There's no feedback.  There's no force feedback from the actual wing.  And United pilots complained, I think it was on the 777.  They complained because they didn't have to do trim anymore.  The plane trimmed did all the trim.  So Boeing, in order to continue to sell airplanes to United,  put a fake trim button on the joystick.  It doesn't do anything, but you have to press it.  And Bruno says all the pilots, all the rest of the pilots  hate the United pilots because they're such old farts.  They needed a trim button.  And now everybody's got to press the button, even though it does nothing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, the whole autopilot thing, that's where automation scares me.  You know, it's like when the guy who's flying me from San Diego to New York  is just kind of sitting there, you know, watching things happen automatically,  that makes me nervous.  I want him or her to be a lot more engaged.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, Bruno listens to all our podcasts because he says there's nothing to do.  He says, yeah, a friend of mine is a pilot.  Yeah, she says the same thing itself.  It's amazing and does a better job, I think, in most cases.  The pilot would frightening.  It's only a matter of time.  You know, already cars, the new Prius has this avoidance detection.  If you if you if you veer out of your lane, it tightens your seatbelt,  improves the braking, it beeps at you.  It's just a matter of time before they drive themselves.  Gina, do you have a wish list item?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  My my wish, I'm going to I'm going to shamelessly steal Danny's idea.  And based on Raindrop and the Google Reader sort by magic,  I want a sort by magic button in my Gmail.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. So that your mom's mail always goes to the top, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because I miss mom's mail all the time.  Good thinking.  I think everything by magic, everything magic every

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  every except my planes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a little different.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  Fly by magic.  That's everything by magic.  Say again. What?  We just need a button that will automatically make everything automatically by magic.  We had a button for that.  So we'll get to it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just one button that does it all.  I don't know. My only wish is that the Droid phone comes out soon  because I can't wait to get my my hands on one of them.  I you know, I I really hope that developers will not abandon Android.  I know that, you know, it upset them when Google shut down the third party ROMs.  But I think it's our last best hope to providing some competition to the Apple.

Speaker: Danny Sullivan
Transcript:  My my concern, though, is, you know, I was with Verizon for a long time.  And when I lived, I lived in the UK and I lived in the U.S.  and I can't do the U.S. a lot.  And I had two phones and I had a phone in the UK  that would have been perfectly fine to use on Verizon if it could have taken a SIM card.  But there's CDMA and there's GSM.  So I want to if that phone comes out, the one thing it probably don't do  is let me take it to another provider down the line if I want to.  I'm going to buy this phone.  That's going to be a brick if I ever decide to leave Verizon.  And the reality is, you know, every year or so I'm dumping my phone sadly anyway.  Right. But still, is it going to let me work on a  GSM network if I wanted to?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The the phone handset is the Motorola Shoals,  and there is a GSM, UTM UMTS version of the Shoals.  So that's an interesting question.  I mean, Verizon may not sell it to you, but there will be that Motorola phone will be  there will be a world edition.  You know, Verizon does sell some phones that have, you know, both GSM and CDMA.  Yeah, they need they need to do that.  It's a real problem for Verizon and Sprint customers is they can't travel.  They're kind of just stuck.  You may not leave.
