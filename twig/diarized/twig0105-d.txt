Our first episode from the brand new Brick Twit House.  And this is actually the first time we've done a show at the roundtable with everybody  on video. So this is kind of fun. I'll start from my left. Gina Trapani is here. Back from  China. Welcome back, Gina.  Thank you so much. I missed you guys. We missed you an awful lot. So much has changed. Yeah.  You're in a chair. You go away for a few weeks and I'm sitting in a chair. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything's different.  How was China?  Congratulations on the move.  Thank you.  China was incredible. It was a great trip. I'm really, really glad to be back. Actually,  I wrote up my travel log with a bunch of pictures on my blog to check it out. But I thought  one good story that was appropriate to TWIG is, you know, Facebook is blocked in China,  but on my flight from Beijing to Shanghai, they showed the social network on the plane.  You're kidding.  Go figure. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't know what this is, but if we could use it, we'd probably like it.  Can you get on Google Plus? You can't, or can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Plus was blocked for me, the web app, unless I proxied. I was able to proxy through  it. Oh, and the mobile app worked.  The mobile app worked. I found that with Twitter. When I was in China, I could tweet, but only

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right. So I did a lot on my Android phone. But I had trouble getting a SIM, so  I didn't do as much posting as I'd like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, I see that stranger over to my right. Mr. Jeff Jarvis is also here. He is home with  a glass of wine because we had so many technical difficulties earlier. We had to move our  record date, occurred time a little bit later in the day. Sun's gone over the yard.  Nice Côte d'Orone.  Looks delicious.  It is?  I'm a big fan of the Côte d'Orone myself. So welcome to Jeff and Gina. And let's introduce  a third person today, actually a third and fourth person today. Dr. Kiki is here. Dr.  Kiki Sanford, our host of This Week in Science, Dr. Kiki Science Hour on the network, and  her baby Kai, I think is right there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He is down here. I just put him down for a second.  Oh, show us Kai. Oh, I want to see Kai. Okay, here comes the baby, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so impressed by Dr. Kiki.  Look at that. Oh, he's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello, little guy.  This Week in Babies.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She brought Kai to the studio a few weeks ago and he's about the sweetest baby I've ever  met. I mean, just adorable. He's coming tomorrow. Coming to the studio tomorrow.  So the reason that we asked you to join us, and stick around as long as you want, Kiki,  but this is really the hottest topic right now, at least on Google Plus, and I think  in the Googleverse and really in the internet in general, is this ban on handles and fake  names. Number of people have been kicked off. It started with the brand Brujaha. So people  were upset about Mashable, for instance, even though Google Plus had said no brands on Google  Plus. Mashable and others, Ford, created brands on Google Plus, and Mashable gained  over 100,000 followers. Google started booting some brands on Google Plus, so Mashable changed  its name to Pete Cashmore, and stayed on, kept all its followers, same exact content,  changed the name. Then Google went after the handles and started banning people who didn't  have real names, including one Dr. Kiki. Are you still off Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am still off Google Plus.  Have you appealed? Is there a process?  There is. There's a form you can fill out to give documentation. If you have a license  or something that has the name that you want to use on it, you can submit that to Google.  Additionally, you can submit websites like a Facebook profile or a Twitter profile, anything.  If you've been interviewed and had a name used in an interview online as a documented  journalistic entry, you can use that name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For instance, an internet show called Dr. Kiki's Science Hour, wouldn't that qualify?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You would think, right? I actually tried using that as one of my pieces of documentation  in the appeals process. I got an email today from a nice Jeff at Google, and he said that  it had been denied and that if I would like to continue to use Google Plus and have my  I have to get rid of the doctor, so there are no professional titles that are allowed.  Doctor or professor is not allowed. My wanting to go by Dr. Kiki, which is how many people  recognize me and will search for me, isn't allowed. I have to go by just Kiki or Kirsten  Sanford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At least you're not completely unknown by Kirsten Sanford. What do you think about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know I'm not completely unknown by that, but at the same time, that's not how I want  to be known. I'm actually in the middle of trying to decide whether or not to change  my profile. I'm actually considering not being a part of Google Plus right now, simply just  to take a stand.  Good for you, because that's what I do.  It makes me sad, because I really want to be a part of the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  One thing that Katerina Fakes said is if you had two fields, if you had a real name field  and a known as field, and people could find you either way, since you're not being synonymous  for a reason of security or anything, would you be okay with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am okay with that. They've got a nickname section or an also known as section, so I  could put in Kiki or Kirsten Sanford and then Dr. Kiki in my nicknames. However, for me,  this is the question where it comes to brand versus identity. For me personally, how I  want to be known online, that is my brand. I am my brand. My brand is me. To try and  be searchable, and Google should understand this more than anybody as the largest search  engine, I want to be searchable and have my primary search results come from Dr. Kiki.  I think that the name that I would choose to have in my profile, when I looked for my  guest who's going to be on Dr. Kiki's Science Hour tomorrow, Vincent Racinello, his Google  profile comes up in the search results for him on Google. That's his name, so I want  that name Dr. Kiki to come up as my search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just looking. This is part of the problem with Google is that all of these enforcements,  including the brands, I guess because it's big, they've got 18 million people or whatever  in here, but just do a search for DR period, and I've got Dr. Ashu Goyal, Dr. Vivek Andrews,  Dr. Robert Cargill, Dr. Colleen Spock, Dr. Moik. There's a lot of doctors on here. Are  they all going to get knocked off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably. If not, then I just wonder what Google's doing if they don't go after everybody  evenly in the same way. It's a huge question. I wonder what Google is getting from this  hard-handed, you have to do it the way we tell you to do it attitude, as opposed to  letting the community dictate the way that they want to use the social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree. What about, the chat room says Dr. Phil. I don't even know Phil's last name.  Yes, Dr. Laura.  Dr. Drew, Dr. Laura, Dr. Ruth, Dr. John. Are you not going to let these people on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it's Dr. Drew, does he have to be Drew Pinsky? If it's Dr. Laura, does she have  to be Laura Schlesinger?  Why does Fitty Cent get to be Fitty Cent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or Fitty Cent, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty obvious. We were talking before the show, Gina, and I think that you wrote  a piece about this. It's pretty obvious that on the one hand, I think in principle it's  a great idea. People use their real names, they're accountable for what they say, you  get a higher tone of conversation. The problem is when you start to implement it, you realize  we've got a problem here. Who's Lady Gaga?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there's Lady Gaga. There's issues of brands and there are issues of folks who  really don't benefit from using their real name. The piece that I wrote, I always think  back to when I was in high school and I was not out of the closet. I was not going to  sign my real name to certain bits. I was trying to found a student group at my college and  one of the requirements to get a charter from the school and to get funding was you had  to get a list of, it was a gay, lesbian, transgender, queer student group. You have to get a list  of names and student IDs. No one in my circle of friends was willing to do that.  Actually I think, I forget, we have the link. There's a geek feminism wiki that lists all  the groups of people for whom this real names policy really harms them. It's generally people  who are activists and there are risks associated with revealing their full identity beyond  even brands. I think I added it to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Vic Gundotra I guess talked to Scoble and I think appeased some people. Although I was  told Vic's real name is not Vic Gundotra. It just seems to me that this is such a slippery  slope. You can't enforce what Google wants to enforce. I understand the desire to do  that, but not only are there good reasons for anonymity, there are plenty of people  known by their brand, not by their name, who are damaged by this. Shouldn't we judge people  by their behavior online, not by their handle online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sympathetic to both sides on this because I think we do want a space online where we  have some real identity and know that, but I think that there's also, it's not a question  of there being a single identity. I think Katerina Fakes started down the line of having  a good taxonomy of this. That there are people who I think could come in and say, this is  my name and in fact if you're a celebrity or something, this is my name that Google  verifies. This is the name that I claim and then this is my pseudonym, but I will tell  you my real name at the same time. Or this is my pseudonym and I don't want to tell  you my real name. There could be a kind of taxonomy of that that could be enabled. It's  complex, but hey, so is life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if Google Plus made the also known as field, the field that you decide is the public  name that shows at the top of your profile and is the name that gets returned in search  results but your full name isn't necessarily, I don't know.  So that you have the choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, both could be searchable.  Yes, you say.  I think Kiki, in your case, people who know you in other forms of life might also want  to search in your real name. They should be able to find you under either, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For Kiki that's an easy solution, but there's plenty of people who...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would solve my issue, yeah.  Can you hide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That doesn't solve all the issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you hide your real name and say I want to use the AKA, but Google can know my real  name and do you trust Google with your real name and is that a solution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is the issue with China, but this is the issue with Iran and Iraq and China  and Egypt and so on. I'm sympathetic to Facebook saying, listen, we are a service about real  names and real relationships and real identities and that's what we are. And if you want to  have a made up identity, use Twitter. But that's what we are. And at some level I think  it's okay for the creator of the platform to have some say in that. But then Kiki's  absolutely right. At some point you lose control of the platform to its users. You've  got to figure out where your line is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Google has laid down this... Has created this rule that Google profiles are public.  That's it. There's no way to have a private Google profile, right? So to me it's like  you can't have both. You have to be able to give users the option to say I want my name  to appear as this in my public Google profile if it has to be public. On Facebook you can  have a private profile page and only show it to certain people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's going to make me sad that Google Plus then can only be used by people who are willing  to have their name known in public. Is that right? Is that how we should have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's talk about the rationale behind that. That's what I'm trying to figure out is that  if you're Google, why is it that they're starting... This is their starting point, we think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you heard the rumor going around that suggests it's for advertising purposes? How  having a real name connected to an identity that is connected across the Google properties  could be sold for... That information could be sold for a lot of money to advertisers.  I don't know if I buy it myself, but I'm just bringing it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly what Google would run away from. Part of the advantage of online advertising  and cookie online advertising is that it doesn't have PII attached.  It doesn't need to.  It doesn't need to as opposed to an axiom database of magazine subscribers does have  your real name attached. Online hasn't been strong enough in selling that as an advantage  is that you're just a computer, not a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it strikes me as it was just ill thought out on Google's part that they've just off  the top of their heads as I might think if I started a forum, because Google Plus is  really just a forum, I'm going to make people use their real names. Because when people  use their real names, they're more civil, they're accountable. The conversation, the  level of tone and everything in the conversation is better. So I'm just going to make people  use their real names. But they didn't go far enough down the road to think, oh, but what  about Dr. Kiki? What about 50 Cent? What about Lady Gaga? What about activists who are in  China or Iran and don't want their name known?  What about Weldonim?  Right.  Yeah, that's not his real name, right?  They can go to him. Yeah.  This is the guy, of course, who started the Egyptian, the Arab Spring with the Egyptian  revolt and did it in public, but not with his real name. Of course, he tried not to  with Facebook.  Yeah, he got arrested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can establish a whole new Google account with a new Gmail address that kind of goes  by all their rules, no doctor in the name and all that stuff, and set up a Google Plus  account, right? I mean, they're not verifying names through credit cards or phone numbers,  right?  So what's the problem with this?  That's a doctor, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I say my name is Lady Gaga, that's my name, first name Lady, last name Gaga, what do they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do about that?  Right.  I guess if somebody questions you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even Katerina, whose last name is fake, she has a great screenshot.  Her real last name.  I was registering for some airline or something, putting Katerina fake and it said, sorry,  you got to use your real name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about poor John Doe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Arbitrary rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we talked about this, I think, last week. There's also the question of Google's speculation  about their celebrity strategy, and that one contemplation, said the report, was that they  were considering having celebrities fax them their driver's license.  Probably what they'll do instead is have their agents and managers verify their identities  to be a celebrity, which, listen, I understand that too, because you don't want to be the  fake Lady Gaga.  Google wants to be able to say, we know this is Lady Gaga.  We know-  Or William Shatner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  Which they kicked off.  Right.  Now, obviously, Twitter's figured out a solution for this.  They have verification.  They verified me without asking.  I don't know how they verified me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They verify very few people, and that's an issue too, is that you can have fake people,  and it becomes an issue.  I think there's a huge business opportunity here in verified identity, and that the way  I would see this going in the long run is a separate independent company we trust.  I don't know who that would be.  It's not Microsoft.  It's not the Post Department, but somebody, we say, okay, you can verify my identity.  Google accepts that.  Twitter accepts that, and we can have a verified identity, or choose not to use the verified  identity, and I can come into Google Plus and have an experience only with verified  people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  So have a switch that says, I'm only going to talk to people who's verified.  That eliminates spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you want to motivate people to be verified with identities that are verified in some  way.  So they should do it with a carrot, not a stick.  Now they're doing it with a fence.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.  Isn't the best solution, though, for this really just to say, oops, we made a mistake.  There's a problem doing this.  Why don't we just judge people by their behavior online?  And if you're a jerk...  Does that scale the O?  Well this doesn't scale either.  That's the problem.  This doesn't scale either.  I mean, this is what happens.  The only way that this works is by community enforcing it.  That's why Bill Shatner gets kicked off, because a bunch of people say, that's not him, that's  not him.  And Google's automated Python script said it's not him and killed him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that is the solution.  I actually think Twitter has handled this pretty well.  to have impersonators have a way to get verified, but most people are not verified.  I feel like with social software, you're given the opportunity to identify yourself.  We're all given the opportunity to identify ourselves in life and call ourselves what  we want and tell stories about who we are, the way that we want.  Social software should enable that.  It seems weird and strange to have arbitrary rules.  This seems like just a programmer.  Some programmers are like, this seems like a good idea.  It's like the Zuckerberg idea.  Everyone should just use their full names and that's it.  Life is not that simple.  There's a great post, I just added it to the rundown.  It's called Falsude's Programmers Believe About Names.  It's a list of 40 things.  The first one is people have exactly one canonical full name.  People have one full name which they go by.  People have at this point in time exactly one name.  It goes on.  The list goes on.  I think the reality is that names are personal and they're complicated and they're not always  John Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Programmers would call this a namespace problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the problem.  The programmers think that way and there's a canonical name for any object.  It never changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People get married, they move, they use different languages.  There's all sorts of situations where names change and where names get complicated.  It works for Twitter.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll get to this later but in thinking about hashtags, which I'm sure we'll get to later,  the advantage of a hashtag that struck me is that it is not like a canonical namespace.  No one owns it.  You don't have to borrow it.  You don't have to rent it.  You don't have to buy it.  You don't have to get permission for it.  That's a thing that programmers don't realize is they look at the world like DNS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kiki, this has hurt your feelings more than anything else, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does hurt my feelings.  I'd love to be able to just be in Google Plus and a part of the community as the identity  that I choose to use.  It's not like Dr. Kiki is totally different from my real name.  Dr. Kiki, I have a PhD that works.  Kiki comes from Kirsten.  It's all part and parcel.  I'd love to not have this be a problem and unfortunately it is.  But I also understand this is a beta application.  Google is still working on how they're going to apply rules, what the rules actually are.  So they're going to come up against this particular issue and hopefully make adjustments to it  based on everything that people are writing.  There's time to fix it, but when you have 18 million people on here, there's already  so many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at Mashable was able to, analogous to this brand issue they've had.  Mashable got huge value out of breaking the rules.  It got away with it.  You can call it a field trial, you can call it a beta, but there's value here.  There's lots of people here.  And you miss out because of their policy.  Regardless of whether it's a field trial or not, you lose.  I think you could make a case they're causing you commercial harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, which is kind of the way I feel about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel that way too because you work for me.  One of the things you do works for me.  It's called Dr. Kiki Science Hour and you can't promote it on Google Plus because they  don't want you to be Dr. Kiki.  Anyway, Kai's getting fussy and probably doesn't want mom to be on.  He is getting fussy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He wants playtime.  Well, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kirsten, I'm glad you could come on and talk about this.  Kirsten Sanford will be back tomorrow with Dr. Kiki Science Hour and Kai will be in the  other room in our childcare facility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  Before I go, I just wanted to make one final point.  I find it interesting that Google has even embarked on this in the first place because  it seems as though the way that the whole system has been set up with circles and you  choosing who you're going to follow in different circles, that inherently gets you with the  community of people that you want to be hearing from.  And so people that you're going to follow, you choose to follow certain people and so  you're going to be following people that you trust and that you want to follow anyway  who aren't trolls, who don't have bad behavior.  So the system kind of supports itself.  And with that, I will leave you to discuss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Kiki.  And that's how Facebook operates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the community is doing a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you very much for having me on.  I really appreciate it.  Great to have you here, Kiki.  Bye, Dr. Kiki.  See you tomorrow.  Bye, Dr. Kiki.  Bye, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bye, Julia.  Bye, Leo.  Take care.  Because I think it's easy to talk about it in an abstract, but real people are affected  by this.  Yeah, definitely.  I don't think it's...  I think Google mishandled this badly.  But, I mean, you know, it's their site to screw up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're not really screwing up.  I mean, it's doing really well otherwise, right?  I mean, this name thing has been an issue.  The brand thing, I'm totally on Google's side.  I feel like that makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's also a difficult thing to enforce because what if Pete Cashmore takes over the  Mashable account?  Now what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he has, right?  He did.  He took over the Mashable account that he shouldn't have created because it had 100,000  followers.  So he got away with it.  Yeah, I mean, yeah.  Well, I mean, but he changed the name, right, to Pete, and now he's kind of owning that.  Same content, same feed.  Yeah, right.  It's the same content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, Boing Boing did that.  They have an intern posting.  Was it CBS did that?  They have an intern posting.  It's the same account.  And Google let them just kind of transfer it over.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's frustrating.  For those people who said, OK, we'll wait.  Yeah, that is frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I guess I care only because I love Google Plus and I want it to succeed.  But you see how mistakes like this with Buzz, you can see how mistakes like this can kill  you very early on out of the box if you get a backlash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  What do you think about Google separating out the business accounts from the people?  I like that idea.  Even before...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think as a brand, I like that.  I even like that idea as a brand.  I have a Twitter profile waiting for them to enter the...  Whatever.  Put my name in the Google spreadsheet so that we could be a brand.  There will be advantages, I presume, and I think they've indicated this to brands in  the way a brand page is handled that's different.  I think that's good to make that distinction.  If people don't want to follow brands, they shouldn't have to follow brands.  I don't think this...  I think that that's OK.  That doesn't bother me.  The pseudonyms...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that seems like it will benefit brands and users.  Sorry, Leo.  I keep talking over you.  I don't know if there's a delay or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we're having...  It's because you can't...  It's a part of our audio issues.  Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When Kiki left, I crashed, but I'm back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, that's another problem we know about.  But at least we didn't get the feedback.  That's another problem.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Upgrades are fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Welcome to the new studio.  I apologize to everybody.  It's beautiful.  It's magnificent.  If I were a brand, if I were CBS, I would have had this studio up and running for a  month without going on the air.  We would have worked all these kinks out.  Instead, we do it live on the air.  But that's kind of part of my ethos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what the guys were saying when you had the Hangout, is that's exactly what makes  you you.  That's why we do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's fun.  Absolutely.  It's fun.  Why shouldn't you get to see this?  And if it's frustrating to you, well, tune back in a month.  We'll have it all fixed.  You know, that's just the way it is.  F'em.  Oh, speaking of which, we're going to talk about hashtags with Mr. Jeff Jarvis, who lit  a fire, baby.  You were the what did you call it?  You were the the Tinder was there.  You just set the flame.  The spark to the Tinder.  I love it.  We're going to talk about the profane Jeff Jarvis.  I said you were cranky last week.  I just didn't know I have cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right.  You're right.  I was thinking about that today.  I've been a rotten mood, actually.  Yes, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it.  Jeff Jarvis in a rotten mood.  I mean, they compared to Howard Beale on CBS.  The guy in network is I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, this happened right when I got back from China and I'd been thinking a lot about  the sort of the freedoms that I enjoy every day being an American.  I really appreciated so much about China, but I actually found myself feeling more patriotic  than ever.  I came home and saw that Jeff had started this hashtag and I was like, yes, yes.  And it made me very proud.  So thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said, Gina, you are far too polite to use it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You are not the one I would have chosen, but she's a nice girl.  Wouldn't have lit up.  Well, lit up the way that it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And by the way, that's the that's the main reason to travel is because then you read  when you get home, you appreciate what we have here in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Dag nab it wouldn't have worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Makes you a patriot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember, Gina, when I left East Berlin after spending some time there, the one I  wanted more than anything else was a choice of colas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the old days, they had the worst fake cokes in the Eastern Bloc.  I had one in Czechoslovakia.  Kami Cola.  Yeah, Kami Cola.  It had cinnamon on the bottom of the coat.  You'd get the dregs of cinnamon.  It was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I spent the first few days like I'm going to just have this whole experience and just  green tea for me.  And then by day two, I was like, oh, God, just a diet coke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just the good news is the Chinese love Coca Cola and Kentucky Fried Chicken.  It's everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, everywhere, everywhere.  And Coke was everywhere, too.  So it was fine.  But I was humbled by my very American cravings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Chinese don't even drink green tea all the time.  That's an American thing.  The Chinese are drinking the slug in the Coke.  We're going to take a break.  Come back.  Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trippani.  Don't you love this?  Don't you love this?  I feel like you're here.  I just love this.  It's a great, great setup.  It's so fun.  Full screen, baby.  Full screen.  Your head's bigger than mine, though.  We've got to work on that.  Jeff's the right size.  No, Jeff, you could be the...  Oh, the other one.  But Gina's so big.  We'll be back in just a minute.  Netflix.com slash twit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But every night, I thank...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every night I go to the Netflix.com.  I go to the Netflix.com.  I go to the Netflix.com.  I go to the Netflix.com.  I go to the Netflix.com.  If you're not yet a Netflix member, and I know you all are, who isn't?  But every night, I thank...  Every night I got home, I thank the Lord, I don't live in a commie nation.  I live in a country where I can come home and I can watch great TV like this.  Netflix.  Well, there's a lot of places you can't do this.  In fact, I know there are a lot of people who watch.  I shouldn't be silly about this, because about 30% of you live outside the US who watch this  show and can't get Netflix.  If you can, you'd just be grateful.  You'd just be grateful.  Netflix.com slash twit.  The streaming is what I like.  This is the best deal in entertainment.  $7.99 a month for thousands of movies.  TV shows too.  There's your Glee.  You can watch your Glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Season 1 and 2, I'm sure the rest of them will be on soon.  Great movies.  I just, I've been going through the old Office episodes with Abby.  That's been so much fun.  She was in France, she missed a whole season, so we just said, well, let's start all over.  I love it.  Oh, Marathon, man.  That is a great movie.  Dustin Hoffman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just added Mad Men, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, where is Mad Men?  Eileen Rivera, our producer, is a Mad Men fanatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love Mad Men.  Great show.  I was told it was just added.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me look, let me look, let me look.  Mad Men.  Mad Men.  So you do a search right here.  This is the watch instantly.  There it is.  Mad Men.  Yep, you can watch it instantly.  And this is nice too, on the instant, because you're not getting the DVDs.  You can watch any individual episode from any of the four seasons.  So you say, you know, I would love to see episode five, season three, The Fog, over  again.  Boom.  Boom.  There it is, opportunistic Pete trying to work a new angle.  Don and Betty going crazy over Sally's behavior.  And a strange dream.  What's the Kodak episode?  Yeah.  See, you remember them.  You got them memorized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If this is, if for $7.99 a month to watch every episode of Mad Men, that's a deal and  you don't even have to pay for it.  Go to Netflix.com slash twit.  And if you're in a commie nation, you have my deepest sympathies.  Netflix.com.  I like this.  This was okay movie.  I'm going to rate that.  It's going to be, give me some recommendations of the movies I might like.  I love it.  Netflix.com slash twit.  And if you're already a member, would you do me a favor?  Cause we were trying to get, get some people to join here.  If you just tell your friends, your neighbors, go across the street.  Say, Hey you, you're no commie.  You probably want to subscribe to Netflix.com slash twit.  It's the American way.  It goes over great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That or I'm taking away your cola.  No cola for you.  You're stuck with green tea for the rest of your life if you don't sign up.  Had you like to be drinking.  And by the way, buy a brick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I didn't even think of that.  Buy a brick.  That's what all good Americans do.  And some international viewers as well.  Thank you very much.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got, we just got Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  There you go.  See, that's how you make up to them.  Hey, we just got Spotify.  You've had it all this time.  You know who I blame?  I don't blame Netflix.  I don't blame Spotify.  I blame the record industry, the movie industry, the TV industry and the publishing industry  because they don't have these, you know, they're very parochial.  It's, you know, Hey, it's, we've got Fox just went worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fox is now going to charge you on Hulu for the next day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What even if I have Hulu plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unless you're a cable subscriber and can prove it and all this stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That, that actually, you know, CNN's doing that too.  If you want to watch their streaming, you have to get a deal with a cable.  You have to have a cable account and not all cable companies have signed up for it.  And that's unfortunately, that's just the way it is with cable agreements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't, um, but it doesn't align them with their customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the no and they don't HBO go works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  And believe me, HBO and Fox and CNN would just as soon go straight to you over the internet,  but they can't because they've got deals with the cable companies that say no, no, no, no, no,  because you undermine our subscribers.  Right?  If you could watch all these without being a cable customer, then that would cost them.  So that's how they, that's what it is.  I know this because of tech TV, we had rules in our covenants with all the different cable  companies, no more than 10 minutes of any given show on the internet.  They're all these rules.  You cannot stream live.  And it drove me crazy.  Cause I was, I would say I would go into executive meetings at tech TV.  We're building a brick and mortar business in an internet economy and there was nothing  we could do about it.  That's why, by the way, this is not on cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Hence the new studio.  Hence the new studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nyan nyan nyan nyan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hence the new studio.  So Jeff, how do you feel about Washington these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you know, Saturday night, what happened?  Tell us the story.  I was sitting home.  I had a little Pinot Noir.  I violated my own rule.  In my book coming up, I have a Cabernet rule where I say you shouldn't allow friends to  tweet, blog or do anything after they've had too much to drink.  That's probably true.  But after a few glasses of a nice Pinot, I had watched the, I've been all absorbed in  the British story.  Then I came and I watched the stuff about what's going on in Washington and I just had  it and I came online and I just on Twitter because Twitter is meant to offload your chest.  Right.  And I just said, you know, it's our money, it's our economy, F you.  And it took off a little bit.  People said that.  I said, you know, well, we ought to have a chant here.  You know, F you Washington.  And somebody came in, named I think Booger something.  I can't remember the name.  That's the great thing about it.  See handles are okay.  Booger.  Yeah.  Nevermind real identities.  Poor Mr. Booger.  Or Ms. Booger.  I have no idea.  And said you should bring the hashtag.  And I said, well, duh, of course.  And it took off without me.  And it wasn't the most genteel expression of the sentiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but it was, it really was a Howard Beale moment because you tapped into sentiment.  Of course, it's all about the battle over the debt ceiling and the fact that this country  will be in default in a few days.  And it's, and it's just the stalemate in Washington and it's going to affect, you know, it's the  of British finance minister.  What did he say?  He said a couple of right-wing Republicans are holding the entire financial world at  a hostage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vince Cable in the UK.  Yeah.  And so, you know, the interesting one was is the people, and I wrote a post today about  this, it taught me a lot in the end about the structure, always about the structure  of the internet.  That when I did F you Washington, people came in and yelled at me because I didn't say F  you GOP or F you Democrats or F you White House or F you Congress or whatever.  But what happened that amazed me was is that people imbued their own meaning in it.  And so very quickly it left me and people said F you Washington for not letting me marry  who I want to.  F you Washington for making me nervous about whether my parents going to get their social  security check.  F you Washington for the war for this, for that, for whatever.  In a sense it was all entirely negative, which by the way I was a little nervous about after  Norway.  I didn't want to be inspiring anyone to take up arms.  But also inside this, it really struck me, and I always have to remember the faith that  I have to have in my fellow men and women here, my fellow citizens, is that in each  of these was a message of hope, was a message of expectation of the government.  And in saying that they didn't meet this expectation, there was a hope that they could and that  they would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this isn't nihilistic on your part.  This is get it together Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's all it was.  And I was just mad and saying you should be doing better.  This is your job.  It's your job to manage government.  So it went on and on and on.  And of course the other interesting thing here is that media is now after.  They're second.  And so media came in and so I did the CBS early show the other day and you just had  where they carefully bleeped and blurred everything.  But at the end they put up this trends map where it says in full glory, F.U. Washington  across the whole country.  I love this.  I love that.  As I said to the correspondent, it's like a Howard Beale moment where everybody across  the country is raising their windows and screaming this out.  I'm mad.  It was hot that day and people said on Twitter that they didn't want to open their windows  because they let the heat in and the air conditioning out.  We are a little nihilistic now.  You know and I kind of dare the FCC to go after them for a fee and expletive here.  And you know it just it always teaches me, Leo and Gina, about you know and thinking  about the show and the cloud is that it's always a lesson in the internet and its impact  on society and how people are using these things and how they're using them on their  own and how this new architecture enables people to do things.  And I want to be very careful here and make clear that this is not a revolution.  It's not a career square.  It's none of that.  It was a little lark on the weekend.  It's already dying down.  All I'm saying is that I learned lessons about my fellow citizens out of this and they were  good lessons.  We applaud you.  Yeah, we do.  We do.  Nothing to applaud.  Applaud the pinot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's why people really were attracted to it, Jeff.  It was a genuine passionate expression that people gather around.  So what was the final tally of the number of people who used it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just looked it up on Topsy.  It's 87,000.  Which is not much at all except that if you looked at how many letters to the editor would  make it in, you know one or two across the country a few weeks later, and those are 87,000  expressions of an opinion that somebody got to hear now unmediated by media and that's  what I like about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know the Ask Obama, the Twitter Town Hall Twitter and the White House had put out the  Ask Obama hashtag and had promoted it during the weekdays for several days going up to  the event so that had quite a bit more, you know a bigger announcement and traction and  promotion than yours did and it got 119,000 tweets with that hashtag.  So it's very close.  And it's interesting, we did a bunch of analysis on the data that we got back from the White  House from actually President Obama's tweet, the replies to that tweet and we wrote it  up on the Expert Labs blog and it's interesting.  I think it's really easy for people to express anger about policy.  I think it's harder to get people to participate constructively and I don't mean to, I think  what you did is great, like I said not the words that were chosen but the next step is  like yes I'm frustrated with a lot of policy and it made me really happy to see somebody  take your tag and say that they're upset that they can't marry who they want because I  can't either and I feel the same way but then it's like what's the next step?  How do we make these conversations constructive and inform policy rather than just kind of  an expression of just anger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What warning, I'm about to do it, you said Glee and now I'm going to say it, okay watch  out chat room, Habermas.  I did it, I did it.  I really think, and this is, I'm going too far, I'm going way too far but that's what  I do for a living.  I think that in the internet and in these moments like this I see us the people starting  to recapture the public sphere and you're right Gina, then comes with that a responsibility  to what to do.  This was a silly little thing to say, it didn't accomplish anything, it vented some steam,  that's all it did but there's an argument, James Carey who's a scholar who unfortunately  died a few years ago who's an expert on journalism and media says that it's media's job not to  inform the conversation but to be informed by the conversation that we're having and  that he argues that the worst thing that happens to America is opinion polls because they reduce  us to a number.  But you listen to the opinion polls and Americans are telling Congress, compromise you idiots.  Somebody said earlier one of the most picked up lines was F you Washington for not having  the compromising skills of a three year old.  And I think at some point we are holding the feet to the fire of Washington.  You again got mad at me saying that I was going into government hate here, I'm not.  People said what they cared about then and that's that.  But you're absolutely right Gina, it's the same problem here and the same problem in  Egypt.  How do you take these tools and now start to rebuild a new kind of society using these  tools and we haven't gotten there yet.  And I think we won't lead the way, I think Egypt and Tunisia will and we better learn  from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, that's the next step.  I think you're right, I hope you're right.  I'd like for us to lead the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the cloud.  I would love to too but I think we're too cushy and people like me are too privileged  to spout this kind of stuff out in other countries.  You did this, you could get killed for it.  If you did this in China, if you were even able to try, you'd be jailed.  You know, F you Beijing.  Wow, and you can see why they block Twitter and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean these are dangerous platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, well they have their own versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also have their own language, be careful, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, completely censored, everyone has to provide their identification card in order  to use them and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the issue with IDA again, because it comes full circle to the other discussion.  It does, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, in the Beijing airport to use the free Wi-Fi I had to scan my passport to get a username  and password because there's, yeah, I posted a picture of the slip of paper of my username  and password.  There's a rule that you cannot access the internet anonymously and in fact they're  asking like small coffee shops and businesses that offer free Wi-Fi to install this like  $1,300 software which requires users to provide their identification number and a lot of coffee  shops are just saying, screw it, I can't pay for that and they're just turning up,  they're just unplugging their routers.  But yeah, I was floored by that.  I was like, what do you mean they want my passport?  I just want to use the free Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, that tells you something about the real name debate.  There's an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does, doesn't it put it in perspective?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Google, don't ask me to scan my passport before I can use Google+, okay?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in Germany they have ID cards that are going to have RFID chips involved.  Lord knows I've talked about Germany enough in this show but when they go wacky on the  one end on privacy and the other end they're adopting that and that's a little scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it makes everybody safe, Jeff.  This is what, when you use the subway in Beijing, same thing.  You have to scan your identification card to go inside the subway and our tour guide  explained that this made things very safe.  No one worried when they rode the subway and that bombings can never happen in their subway.  It was really interesting.  Very interesting perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you know that vampires run Google?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you watch True Blood, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you remember this?  I think you have to scroll a little bit.  Do I have to scroll in a little bit?  Like 1-14.  Okay, so Bill, who is the king of Louisiana and a vampire, talks about the history of  vampires and why there were a lot of vampires in the priesthood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know nothing of our history?  Vampires have often found it advantageous to maintain a hidden presence in humanity's  most powerful institutions.  In the 1600s that was the Catholic Church.  Today as you all know, it's Google and Fox News.  You threw it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a great off and then it moved on.  But I just love that.  As you know.  Such a great show.  That was my favorite part.  And as you know, it's Google and Fox News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, Googlers are never seen in daylight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's very pale.  And there are no mirrors in the Google bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They sparkle.  Oh, that's the wrong vampires.  Sorry.  Oh, now everyone's going to get upset with me for bringing up Twilight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that a Twilight vampire?  They sparkle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twilight's the glee of vampires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you haven't enjoyed Robert Pattinson's sparkling.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You haven't lived.  I don't know what you're talking about.  No, I really know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need more women on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a crush on Sookie.  Oh, I know.  I love Sookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you, Eileen.  Oh, Sookie is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eileen is putting in a vote for Twilight.  Do I have to now like somehow follow Twilight?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can stay with True Blood.  No, no, it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  True Blood is gory, sexy, over the top.  Not for children.  Perfect show for me.  Did you see this SEO who's there?  I don't know.  This is from the Atlantic.  Selling plus ones.  They must have like some guys at a plus one sweatshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Paging Matt Cutts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plus some PLUSSEM.com.  I'm of SEOshop.biz.  Is offering plus ones for your site at the rate of 50 plus ones for 10 bucks, 250 for  300 bucks, 2000 plus ones for 170 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what do we do the math for me, William?  What's the lowest cost of per plus one there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  Gotta be the 2000 for 170 bucks.  That's just a penny's per plus one.  We're talking a dime or less for plus one.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not worth it.  And suddenly PageRank for users gets implemented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and here's what they promise.  All plus ones come from people with a Google account that has been verified by phone.  All plus ones come from real people.  No bots are used.  All plus ones are beginning manually going to your website, clicking the plus one button.  There's no way Matt Cutts can track this.  It's untraceable.  They even say that.  Interesting.  Because plus ones are being given from different IP addresses.  And they're driven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the outcome of a plus one?  Are they really using it yet?  Are they really using it yet?  Aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  Actually, you know what?  They're only using it if it's a plus one from somebody somehow associated with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got the sense that they're not using it very much right now, but it sounds like it's  going to become one of those signals that count more down the road as they gather more  data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and you know that that's what SEO is all about is raising your ranking on Google.  And if there were a way to easily raise your ranking on Google, like hiring a thousand people  to click, that would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's going to go away.  Well, I'm sure.  I saw one of the things I put on is whatever it's called.  Think the Google kind of an advertorial magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say on your t-shirt, I visited the Apple campus and that's all I'm allowed to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Love it.  On the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't turn around all the wires.  It just doesn't have a logo on the back.  Oh, that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's great.  And you know what's great about that t-shirt?  You know that Steve Jobs approved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, exactly.  So he has a sense of humor.  I got my Julia, my daughter, who's in the video editing.  I got a YouTube that has the play button and ER after it.  Oh, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.  Nerdy.  Cute.  I love these things.  I love swag.  Somebody says not swag if you have to pay for it.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love all this stuff.  I stole this from the Juliet prison.  That's how bad ass I am.  So what does this think quarterly?  Is this something Google does every three, four months?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's their first effort and it's basically an advertorial thing to send out some fancy  companies to advertisers and such.  It's very pretty.  I like the typography.  It's very well done.  There's some neat stuff in there.  What the thing that's been rolling around in my empty brain like marbles is that I think  one of the heads of advertising said that 80% of advertising will be live and personal.  And that changes the entire idea of media.  The idea that media is static and the advertising around it is static and it's a message, boom,  gone.  Goes back to the notion of SEO, that there's a static rank for a topic.  We've talked about this often on this show about how things get personalized, but it  gets really extreme that way.  So plus one, I'm not sure is really a universal at all.  It's a signal that they can use in some clever ways, but I don't think it's a one-on-one  page ranky kind of thing.  No, in fact it's a personalization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a personalization feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the fact that some unknown user comes in and plus one's a whole bunch of stuff and  they don't really care about that user, I mean the problem is if that user comes in  and plus one's a lot of ski stuff and the poor ski advertiser is showing advertising  to somebody who lives in Dubai, yeah, they're going to get ripped off for that.  But there's other signals they can throw in too.  They can recognize this person only has one ski slope in Dubai inside.  And so I'm not sure that that kind of gambit, it's clever and somebody does it, but I'm  not sure it's going to get anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a little disappointed.  You know, we have a, I like Google Places a lot.  We have a Google Place page for Twitter.  Let me see if I can, you get up, by the way, this is the metrics page that you get of how  many people visited your page.  Look at this spike here recently, I think because of the Brickhouse opening, people  wanting to find out where it was, where driving direction requests come from, top search  queries that get your place pages.  This is great stuff.  I'm a big fan of the place page, but thank you, Gina Trippani, by the way, for the review.  Leo is the best.  Used to have reviews, used to have reviews from Yelp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And City Search and TripAdvisor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now it's just from Google, although I can see reviews from around the web and a link  to Yelp, but they don't embed them anymore.  Was that the request?  I'm sad because I like Google Places.  I am too.  And what's great is when you go to, when you search for Twitter on Google Maps and you  find it, this is the entry that was created by me.  So I have times, directions, all of that stuff.  Any business owner can do this.  They had 85 reviews, now there's just a handful of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which really dilutes it.  And the story I put on the rundown said that it was those three services that wanted it  They complained.  Like big media companies.  But it's stupid of them.  Because now I don't go to Yelp.  I know I'm odd.  Not nearly as often.  I ended up at Yelp more often going through a place page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like Yelp, actually.  But you're right.  I think that's how I find it more.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  I mean, I, this feels like I was really surprised actually that they did this.  Because it would be like them saying, oh, okay, we're going to take our snippets out  of our search results because it's a search result.  Pressured from the web.  I mean, it's a search result, isn't it?  So I was surprised that they pulled these.  So I don't know.  I assume they're pulling these reviews from the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're right, Jean.  I guess if you're heading toward the cynical interpretation, it could be that they want  people to put in their own reviews and not benefit Yelp and TripAdvisor.  But that's not a very Google-y way to think, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  That's true.  And I mean, I couldn't, I would imagine there should be some sort of system like robots.txt  where applications like this could say, hey, Google, don't pull my content.  I mean, I suppose that there could have been.  And they all probably said, don't pull my content.  Stupid move on Yelp's part.  I was surprised that Google, from what I understand, decided to just pull those snippets,  pull those reviews because there were complaints.  And they're getting tougher that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Belgium, where we had this case go back around and around and around with Google News,  where the papers said, how dare you?  And they won a court case for a while.  And the government's judgment was you couldn't have snippets on Google News,  but also on Google.com or Google.be.  So Google pulled the papers off Google entirely, including Search.  The papers screamed and said, oh, you're just punishing us.  But no, it said we can't be on Google.be.  So, meh.  Right.  And the papers came back and said, well, no, no, no, no, we really want to be there.  And Google finally said, OK.  So I think Google's being tougher now and saying, you're going to miss us when we're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so now I'd really love to see Yelp's No Doubt Google Analytics report for after this,  after the reviews got pulled.  I wonder if they'll take a hit.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Interesting story from CNET's Privacy, Inc., Declan McCullough writing,  saying Google Street View collected locations of millions of laptops, cell phones,  and other Wi-Fi devices.  They were, of course, the Street View, this is probably another bug, right?  But boy, it's embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should have been transparent about this and confessed everything back when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These cars, the Street View cars, were trying to match GPS coordinates with  Wi-Fi access points, closed or not, the idea being that then they can create a Skyhook-like  service that says, based on Wi-Fi, visible Wi-Fi access points, here is where you are.  Skyhook does that commercially.  And they got in trouble initially with, was it Germany?  Yeah.  Because apparently in capturing these access points,  captured snippets were kind of random snippets of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now it looks like maybe they were collecting more.  Cell phones is not a cool thing.  It's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's so many things about this.  It's like they said that they did a thorough audit of the Street View software, the bug,  after the first problem, right?  So they didn't catch this, the MAC address.  And now not only were they collecting the MAC address information, but they made it,  it was publicly searchable, right?  So not only are they collecting the data, but it was publicly searchable for quite some time.  In theory, that's upsetting.  I mean, in practice, there's not much.  I go to Foursquare and check in where I am.  There are easier places to figure out where my cell phone has been.  But still, yeah.  And I mean, isn't the FTC babysitting Google for the next 20 years about what  data they collect and how they publish it?  I mean, this just doesn't, this is bad news bears.  I'm disappointed that this happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and that Google hasn't sent anything.  They have declined a comment.  Unlike the other Street View brouhaha where they stepped forward,  this one they're holding back a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, right.  And they have seen that reporters asking people to, you know, or they were asking people to input  their MAC address to see if, you know, what information it would attract on them when the  story first came out, when they were trying to figure out what was going on, but that they pulled  that you can't publicly search, you can't search for MAC addresses anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That solves that problem.  I think it's probably a side effect of their technology that they gathered MAC addresses.  I don't think that that it's not useful to them in any way.  I mean, there's no, I can't think of any surreptitious reason they would want that information  or any value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not mobile MAC addresses are not useful to them, right?  They're just trying to figure out where the Wi-Fi points off.  If they got it, they got it by accident.  Right. Yes.  So it's just a glitch.  But still the way it got handled.  Yeah, not well.  Yeah.  Given the buzz problem and the original Street View problem,  it seemed odd that they were so reticent about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The idea I keep having with Google, nobody cares about, but I keep coming back to is that  Google, I think, needs independent bodies.  Imagine if you had a committee chaired by Gina Trapani,  and of developers who dealt with developer issues or who dealt with these kinds of issues.  People would trust you.  Now, you may not want that job, but at some point, a jury of peers on these kinds of things  could allow an audit of this stuff.  It's the same thing Murdoch's going through right now, right?  Where the cover-up always gets you.  Right.  And if Google had come out and said it, you're right, Gina, at the time, it just said it all  and had someone come in and say, okay, here's everything we found.  It was stupid.  And here's the fullest of stupidity.  We wouldn't go through this again.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And they did that really well the first time.  Really.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it was surprising.  So I don't know.  Maybe they needed time to figure out exactly what happened.  Maybe they were super extra embarrassed because they had released the data was publicly searchable.  Maybe the FTC pressure is getting to them.  I don't know.  It's hard to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You like Gmail's new look?  I haven't been able to see it.  You haven't.  Well, maybe I have.  I can do it.  I have the new theme.  Oh, okay.  So that's the new theme, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the new theme.  And you can pick the lighter, the heavy.  Oh, we talked about this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure why this is in here.  Yeah, it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we did.  It's nice.  I think they just did a post about user feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and what do the users say?  Yeah, that was nice.  It's nice.  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A little too error, not enough information, I think they said, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they got some people saying too little information, too much information, which, you know.  Always does.  Always, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never ask a fucking group.  Where's your clock, Leo?  I want to talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where's your clock?  Too little information.  I don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were going all OCD on you, man.  They were.  And I don't want to know how late it is tonight.  You always had a clock behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to get in the new studio, in my little studio, the clock will be there.  It's not going to be everywhere.  Maybe we should put a little clock everywhere.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's what's so funny is you changed, could you have imagined that way?  Because that caused quite a stink this afternoon.  Yeah.  Well, the funny thing is-  Your audience was going nuts for the clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought the clock.  We were at, Colleen and I were at Costco.  I just threw it in the car and said, oh, that's kind of neat.  That'd be fun to have behind me.  But little did I know, this would become like the most important thing on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a big anchoring focal point of the shot in the cottage.  Like it was, you looked at it and you were like, we're supposed to be on now.  We're, oh, we're getting toward the end now.  I think that's why people want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'll put it back.  We'll figure out something.  We'll have a clock somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what else.  Sorry, I didn't mean to go off on that.  But I think it's the same thing with Gmail or interview services is that-  You lost the clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't please everyone.  You can't please everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like this.  You can now do three-way calling on Google Talk and Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Is it three-way or do you-  I think it's, you can use your call-  Oh, it's two lines.  First call on a whole-  Oh, you can't merge them though.  Not yet, but that doesn't seem too far down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a question.  I've got a really, really Fred Flintstone question for you both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you can't use your bare feet to power your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not a cup holder.  It's a DVD drive.  Just kidding, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am trying to tell the world that I don't have and refuse to have a fax machine.  Oh God, forget that.  What do you guys scan?  What do you do for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tell people I do not have a fax machine.  I will scan and email you the PDF.  I just got a scan snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I basically say, hey, I work out of a home office.  I don't have a landline.  I don't have a fax machine.  Sorry.  Most people are okay with it at this point.  Contracts and things like that, things that you have to sign.  And that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some things still need fax machines.  I pay for a fax service, like 15 bucks a month for eFax.  And it's the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that it goes to a fax machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they send me a fax, I have a number, but it comes in as an email.  And then if they want a fax, I can send it to them via the internet.  And then somewhere somebody has a fax machine and sends it to them.  It's probably a good way to make a little living.  That's the interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the whole network idea.  It's the great example of networks.  One fax machine worth nothing, networks worth twice as much when you have two,  and so on and so on and so on.  What's the diminishing value of the fax network?  Where does it die?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where is it no longer worth the effort?  Let's see.  Minitel is leaving France Telecom.  This was the precursor to the internet.  Everybody in France got a little Minitel terminal.  Started about 30 years ago.  And that was to save money on phone books.  It was a text only service with very simple graphics.  It looked like Minitel.  We had similar things in the earliest days of the internet back in the genie CompuServe days.  They made 30 million euros in revenue last year on this thing.  France Telecom did.  But they're still going to kill it.  The Minitel, like the fax machine, will die next year.  So it's very similar.  Bye-bye, Minitel.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  Minitel, we hardly knew you.  Now, I didn't...  Nobody picked this up.  I want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  Hey, hey, French users, I think they want to have a Minitel somewhere.  Let's have a Minitel on the set.  Yeah.  I want one at my school in my Museum of Dead Technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  We got an old Minitel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Send us a couple.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is a guy who's setting up ham radio antenna on his roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got a 35-foot mast on my roof going up there.  What's radio?  This is so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had the Wikipedia.  Okay, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is so I can use a ham radio.  I could talk to people all over the world.  I can talk to somebody in Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You really had Wikipedia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I thought to myself, oh, is that like the thing like my dad had in the car when I was five  to talk to other people on the road?  That's a CV.  So I had that moment and then I looked it up on the internet and I was like,  what's the range on this thing?  Like, oh, you know, he's like, why is Leo even interested in this?  He talks to the biggest network in the whole world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could do more with a cell phone than I do with my $500 ham radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's endearingly retro, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I do it.  Is it still a Heath kit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the Heath kit's not around anymore.  I actually, you can buy the kits though.  You can for your amps and everything.  I should do that.  That's what a real ham would do is solder this whole thing together.  If I were a real ham.

Transcript:  Dear Abby, I reluctantly signed on to Facebook at the urge of my siblings.  The problem is I'm now receiving many replies from people I knew back in college and elsewhere,  saying how glad they are that they've found me, how much they've missed me,  and that they would like to catch up.  It made me remember that I was very well liked then.  And how when I graduated from college with honors, people said I had a bright future.  But now I am nowhere near what I used to be when these people knew me.  My life has not been very productive or happy since I moved to California.  I'm married to a wonderful man.  We have no children.  And I have had only sporadic employment over the past few years  because of treatment for depression and alcoholism.  Most of those who've written to tell me about their children,  grandchildren, and the career progress they have made in their lives,  I can't tell them any of that.  Just tell me what I should say to these people on Facebook.  Unsure out west.  Dear Unsure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Facebook puts her in this blind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This I don't know.  These are just two Dear Abby columns from the Kansas City Star.  Where did you get these Eileen?  These are great.  I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Jeff did.  Jeff, are these yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff's soft spot in his heart.  This made me so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I brought the show down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's sad.  It really does kind of like bring up that conversation of like as a person,  are you a brand and like, and this, you know, the sort of jealousy.  And it's, you know, the internet gives us access to so many people's lives.  You think about people going through divorces or people who can't have kids  or people who can't find a job or unemployed that hear about their friends  getting promotions and having their third little bundle of joy and getting married.  I mean, it's hard.  It's difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So she feels this need to have a brand.  Abby says, focus on the positive.  Don't mention that you have been out of work because of alcoholism.  Say, I haven't had to work over the past few years.  Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I love Abby.  Oh, Abby, focus on the positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's somebody different now, right?  It's not really Abigail Van Buren.  Oh, yeah, no, no, no.  Abby's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you could be like, oh, I'm just relaxing on my porch drinking a margarita.  It's just another regular Tuesday.  I haven't worked in ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm enjoying one of the afternoon, but 10 a.m.  Hey, I'm married to a wonderful man with no rugrats.  We have a wild sex life and I'm drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Internet is as hard to give up as cigarettes and liquor, speaking of which.  Losing net access for even a day described as nightmare according to Computer World.  It's actually a survey of a thousand Brits between the ages of 18 and 65.  Some said giving up Internet access even for a day was just as hard as quitting smoking  or drinking.  One person surveyed said giving up the Internet was like having my hand chopped off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How were you in withdrawal, Gina?  It was really much harder than I expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was like diet coke and Internet were the two things that I was most ashamed.  It was tough.  It was tough.  I couldn't get my SIM card set up with a data connection, you know, and so that so I was  kind of I was and I was on a bus and on a tour and going to real world places all day  long.  You realize accessing my sites were was just hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had to pull this phone out and start doing stuff whenever there's downtime or checking  in or whatever.  And you want man think of all the points you could have had on on on Foursquare if you  had checked in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wanted to check into the Great Wall so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was the mayor of Machu Picchu for six months.  No.  Yeah.  And somebody somebody told me just recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm the mayor of a resort in Beijing right now.  Yeah.  But because they had Wi-Fi there.  But yeah, no, it was tough.  It was humbling and it was tough about it.  I went back and forth from feeling sad and humbled and like self-righteous and full of  entitlement and rage about it.  So I was like I was like Jeff and Leo.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I was like going back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which one is sad and humbled and which one is enraged and entitled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm I'm exaggerating.  But you loved it.  You had a great time.  And you wasn't I had a great time.  And the real world has many wonderful things to offer.  I just I wanted to share and hey, I needed to post pictures of my dinner on Google Plus  so people could tell me what I was eating.  I mean, geez.  Well, I got eight pics feed after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought 200.  I was shocked that you had not tweeted.  I was shocked.  We saw so few pictures and actually was mad at you.  I thought she's holding back.  I bought the whatever it was the 500 megabyte plan on my iPhone when I went to China.  And I did an audio boo recordings from the Great Wall.  I was tweeting.  I was sending pictures.  I went out crazy.  Hog wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was dumb.  You know, I decided to take the Chromebook with me thinking that that would be a good idea.  And it was a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you're never on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, because first it's Wi-Fi only.  So only one of my hotels had Wi-Fi in the room.  All of them had ethernet ports in the room, but then Wi-Fi in the lobby.  And I was using SSH Sox proxy and that didn't work as well.  A friend of mine had a VPN, but I wouldn't have been able to install the VPN software  on the Chromebook.  So yeah, it was just that was a bad decision.  I should have brought a full on computer with a VPN ready and ethernet port and the whole thing.  But yeah, it was hard.  I actually went uploading photos to Flickr and then tweeting from Flickr, which did work.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  I actually set up a Posterous account because they didn't block Posterous.  That was smart.  And I was able to send all this stuff out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like via email, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Smart.  They can't block email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to take a break when we come back.  Gina's tip, my tool, Jeff's number.  But first, I just want to a little thank you.  We are building a new studio and one of the things,  first of all, I'd like to thank all the people who have bought bricks.  We are closing in on 1600 bricks sold.  My goal was 1000.  My dream goal was 2000.  I think we're going to hit 2000.  Still time, bricks.twit.tv.  The brick wall will be back here behind the gear.  Then our first shipment of bricks comes in on the 1st of August.  So we'll start putting those up and have them up in time for the official opening of the  Twit Brick House, which is the 21st of August.  I'd also do some, can you do the explosion wipe?  Do the explosion wipe.  I'd like to blow something up right now.  I'd like to blow something up right now.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, could we have done that with the old TriCaster?  I say no.  I want to thank the folks at NewTek who have provided our TriCaster 850 Extreme system.  This is the system that lets us pick up video like this, that lets us do transitions, lower  thirds.  It is the system that's giving us high def.  Here's another one.  Could you do that?  Could you do that at home?  I don't think so.  It's actually amazing.  We're building basically a very sophisticated broadcast studio with off-the-shelf consumer  stuff.  And the TriCaster is the heart of the whole thing.  We use the TriCaster when we go on the road.  We use our TriCaster studio for broadcasts on the road.  We use the TriCaster.  We have the 850 here, which is incredible.  The top of the line TriCaster.  If you want to know more about the TriCaster, first of all, thanks to NewTek for providing  it.  Go to newtek.com slash TriCaster.  A lot of churches, sporting events, broadcasters like me use TriCaster.  It's amazing.  A 24 channel system with everything you need to make a TV show, including virtual sets.  It's like having your own TV truck.  Look at this.  I love it.  Eileen is sitting here and she's doing it all.  She's doing all the switching, all the lower thirds, everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's another one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eileen's rocking it.  She's rocking it.  I'm learning.  I'm learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Leo, are you missing the fact that you're not controlling everything right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's taken me a little getting used to, yeah.  It's actually great that Eileen's doing it because she's producer of the show.  She knows the show better than I do.  I just think, and I like having other people do it, but I do, yeah, there she is.  Hey, Eileen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, there she is.  So when you go into your office set, are you going to not still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have some switch, no, I will have some switching capabilities.  Actually, I guess I'd be able to do all the same things.  The TriCaster allows me to do it remotely into the office.  So yeah, I'll have the office capability.  So it'll only be for the few shows that I do myself in my old office.  But the shows we do out here, like this week in Google, we will show this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not moving to your office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, this is where we're going to do this.  I think this is there.  But you get your choice, by the way, of colors on the back wall.  We should do a different color on the back wall.  What choice, what color would you like on the back wall?  Something googly.  Hey, is Brent still here?  Can we change the colors on the back wall?  No.  Do you know how to do that, Burke?  Does anybody know how to do that?  There's a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're learning tons.  I spent $1.2 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want green.  No, we can have any color you want.  And the curtains change, too.  Alex knows how to do it.  Here comes Alex.  What's neat is with the TriCaster in this studio, there are more people on this side,  normally on this side of the camera than there are on that side of the camera.  And that's the exact opposite of the way normal television production works,  where you have a host or two or three, and you have 20 or 30 people  who are running cameras, running the chiron, the technical director, the director, the tape.  All of that stuff's done by one person in the master control position over there.  So Eileen's able to do everything like that, which is pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except for change the color behind you, because I don't know how to do that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does Alex?  No, but we just don't know that.  We haven't all been trained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eileen, we're so happy we don't have any echo.  We're delighted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Okay.  Thanks to video, by the way.  Video is giving us this great, incredible high-def video from our host.  We're still tweaking it, and it's been a little bit of a challenge today  because we had some technical issues on our side.  But I think we're going to have much...  I love having a high-def picture of you guys on the round table.  I think that's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a great experience on our end, too.  Is it better?  Thanks, video.  Is it?  It is.  So it's easier.  Yeah, it is, because I can see Jeff at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't even know Gina had freckles until we started using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, many, many freckles.  No, it's so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I never, Skype never showed your freckles.  It's really cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm hoping they're all going to merge at one point.  I'll look like I'm tan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, Gina, it is time.

Transcript:  Your tip of the week.  My tip of the week is first quick, shameless plug.  You should buy this book.  Yay, it came out.  It came out a couple weeks ago.  New Lifehacker book.  Adam Pasch at Lifehacker did a great job with the revisions.  It's the third edition.  It's really great.  You should buy it.  Not only because it's a great book, because when you buy it, then I get some money,  and that makes me really happy.  So thank you.  Yay.  Help page.  That's my first shameless plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have the first book and the second book.  I will buy the third book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Awesome.  Thank you, Leo.  Although I think I have a copy coming your way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, I'll buy it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah.  I'm on my bookshelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, I think that's when I first met you, or if I didn't meet you, I wanted to meet you.  It was when the first book came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When the book came out?  Awesome.  Yeah.  Booked me a lot of favors.  All right.  But my official tip of the week is this is pretty cool.  It's going to be really useful.  Gmail now supports zip and RAR files attachments in its viewer, which means that if Jeff sends  me a zip file full of juicy Word documents and images and all that kind of stuff, in Gmail,  I can click on it.  I click on a view link, and it will show me a list of all the files inside the archive  and let me download one selectively, which is super, super, super useful.  The Google Docs viewer, it uses the Google Docs viewer, supports a bunch of file types already,  Doc and Excel and PowerPoint and PSD.  So the zip and RAR files just got added this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's really great.  I'm really happy about that.  15 different file types.  Used to be on Windows, you'd have to download and unzipper and all that stuff.  And then you didn't have a program associated with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's great.  So annoying.  Thank you.  So email your zip files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I pulled this one out of Google's Think Magazine.  Yes.  Number of the week.  And it's not necessarily that current, but I found it interesting.  There are three times as many smartphones activated every minute in this country as  there are children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is a crazy step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Dr. Kiki has three phones and one kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?  That is, that makes sense though.  In fact, my children alone have consumed three or four iPhones in the last three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I lean at least six or seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Abby has a fender bender like the other day.  She acts, you know, a little minor accident runs into a car in front of her.  You know how that happens.  You do, but she not paying attention.  Minor thing, but she can't find her phone.  It's nowhere in the car.  And the police officer says, oh yeah, this happens all the time.  It flew out the window.  So apparently she had the windows rolled down.  The phone was on the center thing, plugged into the charger, flew out the window.  Gone.  I just bought it for a month ago.  Needless to say, she now works for me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Time for my tool of the week.  I like this one a lot, although it has one side effect.  You may not like a lot.  This is the ability to add if you're using Chrome to add to any of the other smartphones  any text field in Chrome, the ability to just turn off the lights.  I think they're working on the color.  The ability to add speech input.  This is a user scripts.org speakable text.  The guy who wrote this, it's kind of funny.  He says, don't look at the JavaScript.  It's super quick and dirty because I broke my arm.  And so I could only type with one hand, but you know what?  It works.  So now watch, I'm going to go.  Let's go to Google+.  What do you say?  And I can let's see if this works.  We're going to try it right now.  So when I create somewhere to type on Google+, look, I get a little microphone.  I am now dictating my next Google+.  Oh, wait a minute.  It won't work because the mic isn't connected over.  I have to change the mic setting, but it works and it's using the Google API.  So it's using the Google dictation, which I think is pretty good.  You can now dictate anywhere there's a text field.  And Chrome, you can dictate the content.  Now the negative is it does because it's coming from an insecure server, not a HTTPS server.  If you're on an HTTPS site like Google+, it breaks the HTTPS because it's now the page  has mixed content on it.  You're still secure on Google+, and all that.  So I wouldn't worry about it.  But you might notice that if you install this script, now all the HTTPS pages have this  line through it.  This is how Chrome tells you.  Now there's mixed content on here.  In that case, in this case, the mixed content is the JavaScript coming from the guy's server  that is putting this microphone in the text field.  It's fun to play with anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then the source code isn't so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you looked at it?  Are you looking at it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm looking at it now.  Short variable names, but I'll give him a pass since he had a broken arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Long variable name.  That's kind of a clever idea.  It's just using their API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, really, really clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice geekery.  Good script.  Nice geekery.  All right.  Hey, thank you for everybody who tuned in late because we...  And thank you especially to Gina and Jeff who rescheduled their lives  because we did this show late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And thank you to the crew who worked their butts off to figure these intransigent problems out.  And they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks to the crew.  Kent's here from video.  He flew down from Alaska so that he could work on this and got it all fixed for us so  that we could be able to talk to him and get this great video from Gina and Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, can you try that again a little slower?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you say F-U, could you...  A little bit less on the sibilance.  Less sibilance on the F-U, please, Mr. Jarvis.  I think Baba Booey is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It makes me sit on my hands.  I can't gesticulate.  You've done this before?  Once, yeah.  They won't let you gesticulate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Without hands, that's no good.  No good.  I'm always like this below the camera line.  Always.  It's the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.  That's her website.  She's Gina Trapani on Google Plus and on Twitter.  And her book, her lovely book, her Life Hacker book is out now  in stores everywhere.  You must buy it.  Now, is it all new stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a revision.  It's a third edition.  So it's lots of new stuff updated for 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you don't have the original, you need it.  You got to have it.  I think you need it no matter what.  I have all three, like I said, and I'm a big fan.  I love Life Hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Quite a few actually new chapters.  It got really thick.  It's like 450 pages.  It's crazy.  Which is big for me.  I don't know.  Jeff, you probably have gone that big before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want them to be thick for some reason.  I think it has to do with shelf space.  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do.  Give it that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yours, Leo, were nice, fat needles.  It's all about shelf space.  So it shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's great to be back and congratulations on the new studio,  Leo.  I know that these transitions are always a little rough at first,  but it's amazing.  It's beautiful.  Well, I have a new way that I'm going to close all the shows.
