Don't get mad. That's the way  it is. Stacey Eganbotham is here. She talks about the Internet of Things on her website,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  stacey on iot.com. She's also the host of the Internet of Things podcast with Kevin Tovel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello Stacey. Hello. It's good to see you also here from the, where's his,  I don't know. I need your title card from the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic  innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York,  Mr. Jeff Jarvis. How are you Jeff? There it is. There's the whole lower third,  the complete set of honoraries, buzzmachine.com. He's sinking behind his lower third. In your case,  the lower third is really more like the lower half. It's good. Why do they call a lower third

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a lower third? It's never the third by the way. It should be the lower sixth maybe. Yeah. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  thinking. Yeah. Maybe Ant Pruitt knows that. He's a photography kind of guy. Hi,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the Ant Pruitt from Hands On Photography and Hands On Wellness. Good to see you. How you doing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mr. Laporte? I am well. I think you had both a sad day and a happy day over the last couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's been an interesting couple of days here. Should I mention or is it a private affair?  We'll just keep it private. We'll just say things have been up and down, but we are still

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  unbelievable as always. But on the upside, I think a little bit outweighs the downside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Always. A new grandson is always, or is it a granddaughter, is always a welcome.  I plead a fifth.  I think that should be celebrated. I think that's fantastic. He's a young man,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but he's been busy as they say. Right. So Palantir, we were talking about the Lord of the Rings  earlier. The Palantir and Lord of the Rings. Is that Saruman or Sauron? It was the ancient  wizards set up Palantir so that they could see what was- Oh, God. We're going to go through this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  now for a fantasy hour. No, no. I refuse to be on a show that takes the Lord of the Rings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's where the name comes from. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. There were giant  crystal balls that were spread around the earth. You could see what was going on from one Palantir.  It was for communications. When Peter Thiel, a former PayPaler, founded a new company in 2003,  he named it Palantir, which tells you a little bit of what its goals were. It's been a kind of a  hushed, shrouded in secrecy kind of a company until now. It's about to issue its first IPO,  kind of a weird IPO. It's not a traditional IPO. I don't really understand what it does.  I know that it doesn't make money. It's quite good at losing money. But the idea is that it  uses artificial intelligence to extract data, which it sells to a variety of people, including  the immigration control in the United States, which has been a little controversial. They sell  it to state and local governments, healthcare industries, financial. They've been involved in  tracking COVID-19, I think, to the good. So they were valued in 2014 at $9 billion,  2015 at $15 billion, $20 billion late that year. They've never, ever reported a profit, which  is my mistake, I think, because we were profitable. And I think the best thing would have been for us  to lose more money. We'd be worth a hell of a lot more. Jeff Bezos strung that out for a long time.  Yeah, but the market knew very well that he could make money anytime he chose to. That was kind of  more of an accounting thing. So Alex Karp, who's a very intro... Did you know that Alex Karp did his

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  PhD under Habermas? I saw him at a conference in Vienna where he chose to do his interview

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in German. He speaks fluent French, German and English. Show off. Yeah, I know. I would say a  bright guy. His PhD thesis under Habermas was... Let me see if I can find it. In fact, just now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was digging back in to my Habermas. Yeah. Is Habermas still alive? I have a headache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Someone should explain to those of us who are not intellectually elite who and what Habermas...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll be honest. I would have no idea if Jeff did invoke his name all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm scrambling through to run down. He's a historian who is credited with the concept of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the public sphere. He argued that it arose in the salons and coffee houses of the 18th century  in England and France. There are many who disagree with him and think that publicness was created  otherwise, but he has that analysis and that's what he says. So Karp is kind of...  You want to go back to Palantir's now and all that, which is worse, Habermas or Palantir's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder. Well, no. I have read The Lord of the Rings, so I had context there. I just didn't want  to spend all my time on it. Watch out. I'm going to go to Gutenberg. It's not a big leap from

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Habermas to Gutenberg at all in my head, but I'll refrain. As long as we don't have life stung...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you can tell me what this means. This is his PhD thesis, Alex Karp's, Aggression in der  Lebenswelt. What is that? The free world? Aggression in the life's world.  He writes about jargon, aggression, and culture. And it is, of course, in German.  Because it was the Frankfurt Institute under Habermas that he wrote this. So Karp,  I think you could probably argue, is a fairly sharp fellow. He's been... I think he's more  a businessman than anything else. He inherited money from his grandfather, which he invested.  In fact, he created a private investment firm in the UK called Cademon and made money there.  Was hired a year after the founding of Palantir to run it. So he's been there since 2004.  In any event, the reason I bring all of this up is as part of the IPO,  the CEO of Palantir, Alex Karp, has written a letter, which is kind of interesting. And I  thought maybe we could talk about it. It turns out none of you have read it, so I'll give you  a little bit of it. It's not really long, but here it is from CNBC. It starts,  our welfare and security depend on effective software. Remember that business of Palantir is  essentially data mining, but he makes a big distinction between data mining for good and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  data mining for evil. Which is fascinating because everyone presumes that Palantir does the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is evil. Yeah. Our software platforms are used by the United States and its allies around the world.  Many of the world's most vital institutions, he writes, from defense and intelligence agencies  to companies in healthcare, energy and manufacturing sectors, rely on the software platforms  we built. Our customers come to us because their tech, I'm skipping around,  our, their technological infrastructure has failed them. The enterprise software industries focus on  custom software tools and applications is misplaced. These approaches often only work briefly,  if at all. The problems and needs of an organization often change before software can even be deployed.  Our partners need something more. They need generalizable platforms for modeling the world  and making decisions. And this is what we've built. This is, by the way, the first time anybody's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really said what Palantir does. I don't think that's true. I really want to quibble with that  because we have been saying this. It's an easy cheat to say that we don't know what they do.  And you actually said machine learning earlier. Palantir is just a platform for data analytics.  That has not been a secret at all. And what is a secret is all the resources they're using

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and how effective it is. However, not what they do as much as how they do it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And whether, as Stacey said, whether they're actually good at it. I think that's a really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  important point, Stacey. And I think they are really good at it. And that's what scares people.  So back to the letter. I just, I hate when people are like, they're so evil and secretive. I'm like,  no, they're not. They say what they do. We just describe all these weird motives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are people giving them the documentation because of the government ties?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, there's a lot to unpack here. And we will. But we know they're good at it because ICE,  Immigrations and Custom Enforcement in the US has been using it very effectively to mine social data  of immigrants and people in communities that have immigrants to pick them up.  But Karp was quick to say, as others have, that they don't have anything to do with putting kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in cages. They're looking for people who stuck into the country. There's other things they do.  There's a big menu. But they're looking for people who've broken the law. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so have they broken? And this is where we get to, we can make laws. There's a difference  between laws and justice. There's when you start thinking about laws, we can have unequal  enforcement of the laws, but in living in what is becoming a surveillance state, we can unjustly  enforce those laws, which we're having protests right now about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Something interesting to say about that. But in that case, I guess the question is,  do you blame Palantir or do you blame the lawmakers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you blame both the lawmakers, but you also look at the tools they're using.  You can't give someone a pass for designing the nuclear bomb, right? Even the scientists  who worked on that were like, oh, this is, they did it. And so the question becomes then,  and you could say that an all seen- But there's still an argument even

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about the nuclear bomb, which is clearly used against people. But there's still an argument  made that it shortened the war, it might've saved lives. I mean, I remember going to Nagasaki and  seeing the classroom of children that was incinerated by the nuclear bomb. And it's a tragic,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  tragic thing to see there. One of the American generals insisted that,  I just finished reading the book about John Hersey and Hiroshima, that radiation poisoning  was a pleasant way to die. Oh, not so.  Yeah. So- Ant, I'm sorry, I was cutting over you when I was asking Stacey my question. You

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  were saying something. Oh, no, I was just concerned because he started out saying that  people assume they're evil when all they're doing is just, as what Mrs. Stacey said, was collecting  data and analyzing data. And you're going to assume it's evil because it's working with the  different branches of the government? I don't think that's fair. Yeah, I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me continue on. Because one of the things CARP does in this letter is really excoriate  Silicon Valley. He says, you're looking at the wrong people. We're not the bad guys here.  First of all, he says, at many organizations, Silicon Valley, employees spend their days,  even their careers posturing for others, concerned with claiming credit for success  and avoiding blame for failure. We have rejected- What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's just being all fussy and- He's claiming in this letter, and remember,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this letter is written for potential investors to make the case for why you should invest in us.  This is to pitch his company. I'm better than them.  The culture of our company is more than a mere byproduct of the people we choose to hire. Our  culture and means of organizing ourselves are preconditions for the creation of effective  software. We identify what needs to be done and organize ourselves around the outcomes that we  hope to achieve. Entire companies can persist for years on business models that may have made sense  at some point in the past. In the short term, there are often profits to be extracted from the  enterprise and from customers, but we've rejected this way of working. The alignment of interest  between our employees and our company and between our company and our customers is one of the  principal reasons we've come as far as we have. Now, this is where he starts to get mad at Silicon  Valley. It actually- Stacey, I'd be really interested what you think about this. Our work  and the use of our software present difficult questions. So he acknowledges what we're talking  about here. The construction of software platforms that enable more effective surveillance by the  state of its adversaries or that assist soldiers in executing attacks raises countless issues  involving the points of tension and trade-offs between our collective security and individual  privacy, the power of machines, and the types of lives we both want to and should lead. The ethical  challenges that arise are constant and unrelenting. So he's basically saying we don't ignore that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's owning up to it. Let's see what choices he chooses to make and that's how you judge them.  It's not enough to say there are ethical challenges. The fundamental issue is where authority

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to resolve such questions, to decide how technology may be used and by whom should reside. Our society  has effectively outsourced the building of software that makes our world possible.  Now, this is where he really starts to get critical of Silicon Valley. To a small group of engineers  in an isolated corner of the country, the question is whether we also want to outsource the adjudication  of some of the most consequential moral and philosophical questions of our time. The engineering  elite of Silicon Valley may know more than most about building software, but they do not know  more about how society should be organized or what justice requires. I think this is an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  answer. I'm going to come back up. Stacey, you first. No, I was just going to say yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it is an interesting letter. Yeah, don't you think? But, well, no, here's the, so I heard him

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  do the spiel in Vienna two years ago and what he's saying, and this is regulatory capture is  what's happening here. What he's saying is, don't blame us. Sorry. We shouldn't make any  of these decisions. Yeah, don't blame us. The government should make them. Don't blame us for  what we're doing. And then don't blame us, right, because governments make the decisions. We  shouldn't make the decisions. So you do it and we'll just do whatever the hell we want within  those limitations and then we're going to go wild. And I heard him then as a cop out. But wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this is a cop out. It is an abdication of the individual's role in participating in moral

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  society. But I do think. Well said. Okay. But he is saying, let me go on. Next section, section four.  Our company was founded in Silicon Valley, but we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology  sector's values and commitments. This is something we talk about a lot on this show. From the start,  we've repeatedly turned down opportunities to sell, collect, or mine data. Other technology  companies, including some of the largest in the world, Google, have built their entire businesses  on doing just that. Software projects with our nation's defense and intelligence agencies,  whose missions are to keep us safe, have become controversial, while companies built on advertising  dollars are commonplace. For many consumer internet companies, our thoughts and inclinations,  behaviors and browsing habits are the product for sale. The slogans and marketing of many of the  valley's largest technology firms attempt to obscure this simple fact. The world's largest  consumer internet companies have never had greater access to the most intimate aspects of our lives,  and the advance of their technologies has outpaced the development of the forms of political control

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that are capable of governing their use. And Palin here is serving people with guns,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and Google is not. So yes, this is, he's not wrong here. I will go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, you go. I stepped on you didn't mean to. No, I want, I want, you have not said a word,  do it. Well, so it right there, they're pointing at the likes of Google, but aren't they still  doing the same thing? Just collecting data, analyzing data, figuring out a way to air quotes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  sell that to their client for profit. But they said, but the purpose is different. They say,  they say our software isn't used to collect your personal data for marketing. Our software is used  to target terrorists and to keep soldiers safe. If we're going to ask someone to put themselves  in harm's way, we believe we have a duty to give them what they need to do their job. We have  chosen sides and we know that our partners value our commitment. We stand by them when it's  convenient and when it's not. So what he's really saying, manufacturer, there are weapons  manufacturer. Yes. Well, I was going to say they're like an arms dealer. Yeah, they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's, let's take this to the Marvel universe. They are Tony Stark pre his Iron Man debut.  And the debate we're about to have, and was it age of ultra? No. Which one was it where  they were? The big debate is they're launching the little satellites up in the air to like  understand what everyone's doing. Was that civil war?  I can't remember. I think it was civil war. Actually, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't remember. Ask me about playing in Chinese and automobiles and we can talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think, all right, civil wars. So the point is in the plotline there was that to prevent terrorism,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you have to know everything about everybody and have the ability to take them out before they do  evil. This is, that's an exaggeration of this argument, but that's what's happening. And this  is a very simplistic view of the world. And yes, he's not wrong about Google, but it's very common  and it's easy to say, I am going to let, I'm going to abdicate my moral responsibility to my  customers. And I've made my moral decision by supporting the aims of my customers, but that  ignores, like Tony Stark ignored the fact that creating these wars is not great and that those  arms can get into other hands and that there is inherent damage from this. And so you can't,  and we don't live in the Marvel universe, right? We live in the real world. So you have to say,  I think you constantly have to evaluate this and you may have to say, yeah, we're okay  with using people's data and don't collect the data. Their customers collect the data for them  and give it to them and then they analyze it and come up with, they create the platform for it.  And we're okay putting people in jail that it may not be just, but it's follows the law.  And that's what they do. And this letter is just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think he's abrogating. I think you're saying that he's abrogating responsibility  for what he's doing. I think he's saying, look, we use similar technology to that of the  big advertising companies like Facebook and Google, but we feel that we have a higher calling. We're  using that information to save lives, to protect our nation, to act out the will of society,  as opposed to the chasing the money for marketing, that we have a higher principle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I get that. But saying that that's your higher principle, everyone's still about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think one thing we all agree on is perhaps we don't agree with what the United States decides  what our current government has decided to do with this information. But if you put that aside  and say, look, the purpose of government, of civil society, is to express the will of the people.  No one is saying you shouldn't have a military, right? Or maybe you are saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are people who are actually- I know people say that, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should put it to policing. We had this discussion before  about facial recognition. And you were both on the case of, yes, cut it off,  because you don't know how police are going to use it. They're going to use it badly. They should

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not have it. They shouldn't have it because it is not currently as it exists. It's not reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's- You don't even know what Palantir is doing. You don't even know what conclusions  are going to be placed. You don't even know where they're going because there's no transparency here  because it's all secretive. And so it could be worse than that.  That's actually a good point. Yet you're somehow saying,  oh, it's okay here because we don't know. No, that's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you're- I would trust this letter better  if they were more open about what they do and how they do it. I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it matters- It seems like they're taking a bit of a moral high road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely. That's their point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's just look at this in a simpleton standpoint. And the first thing that came to my mind was  Google and Google Maps. And I'm a commuter that's not making a lot of money, but I have to get to  work on time every day. And it saves me a little bit of money to bypass tolls or what have you.  So Google knows, okay, you need to take this route to bypass tolls. It's watching me and saying,  hey, you know what? You might want to turn left here instead of turning right over there  because you'll be able to get to work on time a little bit faster and you're able to avoid the  tolls. That's a big help to some people. And it's- Yeah, it's a lot of privacy implications there,  but that is a big help and convenient for some people. Why are they trying to say that's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  something horrible that Google is doing? No, I don't think that they're talking about that.  Did you just apply utilitarianism morals to Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did that just happen? That was awesome. I love it.  But I don't think that's the criticism he's making. I think he's saying, look at these  companies, don't kid yourself. Google's business and Facebook's business is to collect everything  they know about you so they could sell that to the highest market.  Yeah, that's why I said the simpleton version of it.  No, you're exactly right.  That's the trade-off that you and I make. We use Google knowing perfectly well that they're  going to do that because we get value. There's utility in the stuff they give us in return.  So we're making an economic decision, which is ours to make, saying, look, I'm going to have a  Google camera in my house because it's very useful to me for a variety of reasons.  I know what they're doing with that information, but I think that's a fair trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say you have to also consider is Google doesn't actually have access to the power of the  state. Palantir's data collection comes with the arm, it serves the power of the state.  He's using that as an awesome thing, which is great in terms of his worldview.  But the state can do all kinds of things to a citizen with that data that Google cannot.  So he doesn't really talk about that. He just kind of elides that point with the fact that,  oh, we've all agreed to this with the Morals as a society, but we really haven't.  What states, by the way?  We haven't won because there's not truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then he may say, well, don't take that up with me, take that up with government.  If the government is not reflecting your desire.  And then he's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which government people? Is he doing it for Turkey? Is he doing it for Hungary?  Is he doing it for China? We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, he says very specifically. Now, I don't know about Hungary and Turkey,  but he's very specifically said we have chosen not to give that information to China  because we don't. Our leadership believes that this is the quote, this is in their S1 filing.  Our leadership believes that working with the Chinese Communist Party is inconsistent  with our culture and mission. We do not consider any sales opportunities within the Chinese  Communist Party. Do not host our platforms in China.  That's the only country he names?  He names it as a risk.  What about Brazil?  Yeah, he names. No, no, the reason he names it as a risk.  What about Poland?  Stop, let me finish. The reason he names it as a risk is because it's a very, very large market.  He says our unwillingness to work with China could hamper growth given that it's the world's second  largest economy, but here's why we don't do it. To promote respect for and defend privacy and  civil liberties protections. So they don't bring up Turkey, but it's not a very big economy. They  may well not choose to work with Turkey. I don't know. I think you hit the nail on the head though,  Jeff. All of this is fine if they're open about what they do and how they do it,  but because it's a black box, nobody's getting to weigh in on what he's up to.  He's just saying, well, no, the government knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. And it's like the stuff that Snowden revealed. This is for your good. We're doing  this in your interest. We are the government, which one would hope to wish to believe.  But in the case of what Snowden revealed, no, don't do that in my name. We don't want that done  in our name. And in this case, that was just privacy. I'm not diminishing the importance of  privacy, folks. It's important. But it's a hell of a lot more to stop people at the border or to  arrest people, presumptively, because you think they could be doing something bad or to target  bombs in Iraq or Afghanistan. Right. Like the Winter Soldier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Winter Soldier. Thank you, chat room. I was like, ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Evil John in the chat room says, he's a war profiteer. That makes it legal, but doesn't make  it ethical. Oh, right. So I actually, when I read this, I liked the moral high ground he took.  But I think you guys have really punctured it with the problems. And the chief problem for me is  it's complete lack of transparency about. You know what? Also, Leo, I think it's a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  bit like Apple, where Apple took a disadvantage. It couldn't sell ads, didn't know how to and turn  that into a feature and said, oh, we're wonderful. Well, right now in the last weeks, now that Epic  is going after them. Now Epic is paying Apple as the evil company. They may not be evil in  advertising, but they're evil in taking 30% of my business. Right. So, you know, and I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. So let's not, let's not take profiting. And I wouldn't even call that profiteering. That's  just a business decision. I agree with you. Evil. I don't think it's evil. I agree. No, but I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  saying people are calling them evil. I agree. No, I agree with you. Absolutely. I know.  We're so quick to call everything evil. Yeah. When a reporter came after me and tried to get me to  say it was evil, I said it's negotiation. He's got power. He's got more power than most epic does.  Right. Has more power than most. Now he's trying to use it to reduce the rate. It's business. It's  always been business. You know, that's what it is. So I agree with you, Stacy, but I'm just saying  that that the presumption that facial recognition technology out of Amazon is evil and wrong. Right.  Is no different from saying the talent here is evil or right. We just, we don't know enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a very good conversation. I'm glad I had a feeling when I read this that you would all have  something to say about it. And you've absolutely clarified my thinking a little bit. And thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for doing our homework for us. Cause that's the one thing I didn't read. Well, I wish I saw it in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  rundown sooner. Yeah. I mean, I think it's well, and I moved it high right up to the top, but  mostly cause it's a Habermas was mentioned. But you want little breaking news from the world or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. CNN politics, Justin, Dr. Anthony Fauci says he was undergoing surgery and under anesthesia  when the white house coronavirus task force discussed new CDC testing guidelines in which

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they're backing off testing. Yeah. Yeah. Good timing. These are the folks who are hiring  Palantir. Just to mention. Just to mention. Just convenient. Yeah. But I have to tell you,  if Joe Biden gets elected, I guarantee you it's not going to cut into Palantir's profit.  Actually they don't have any, but it's not going to cut into their revenue. Yeah. I don't think  those contracts go away. I mean, and they, and they were there under Obama as well. It's pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  clear. Yeah. If you, I mean, go back to Eisenhower's famous speech about the military industrial  complex and insert instead of military industrial, maybe we call it the military data complex. And  we're just going to keep building this and building this until we, as a society, decide  it's not worth it. And I don't see us making that decision anytime soon. And, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I respect, I don't know, I heavily respect the desire to keep our service personnel overseas  safe. I think that's a great thing. I heavily, I respect the desire to keep us safe from attack.  That's all to the well and good. But I think it's also in a democratic society, important to  debate it and important to understand the tools that are being used. And the problem with these  new software tools is there, it's unknown how powerful they are. They may be extraordinarily  powerful. And it's as if you invented the atom bomb, didn't tell anybody what it did or how it  worked. You just sold it to whoever wanted it. That's problematic. We need to have, you can't  have a debate. And this, and our society depends on that debate, unless you understand what you're  debating. And we just don't know. Right. So the Hersey book, Hiroshima, which was written for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  New Yorker, and they took over the entire issue and then it was sold as a book, huge sales. The  book I just read or listened to about the making of the Hersey book was making clear that the  effort of government was to keep reporters out of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to not reveal how bad the  bomb destruction was, to act as if dying in radiation poisoning, well, first to deny that  existed and then to say that it was a pleasant way to die and to try to keep us from having the  knowledge that we need in a democracy to make exactly the kind of decisions you're talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about. We have to make those. There's an argument to be made, well, you need military secrecy.  If the Manhattan Project hadn't been secret, the Germans or the Japanese might have been able to  steal it and beat us to the punch. So there's a reasonable argument for secrecy, but at some point  in a democratic society, we need to debate these things. I don't know if Truman could have gone  in the nation and say, hey, look, I'm thinking about a massive bomb on Japan. What do you think?  Yes or no? That wouldn't have worked either. So it's a little challenging. It's a little difficult.  By the way, I just found out my grandfather worked on the Manhattan Project. He was a metallurgist.  My mom used to tell me he'd come home with a briefcase chained to his sleeve.  And she said, he never, she said, we'd go to a picnic or whatever. He'd never be without it.  His briefcase was with him at all times. She said, I don't know exactly what it did, but it was  something about reactors. And I said, oh, well, he's a metallurgist. He's either working on the  rods or the containment vessels, something like that. And the other thing she said is one night,  one night in 1945, he came home and he said, I can't tell you why, but the war is going to be  over in four months. Whoa, whoa. And he was right. I think he actually had to kill you then.  That was Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So my grandfather worked on that. So I don't know at what point that  debate happens. You can't have it before. You can't have it. You can have it after. I guess. And I  think that that debate, we have had that debate globally over nuclear proliferation. I think we've  all agreed it should not, we shouldn't have another case of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey, you're delayed. That's okay. So some things have to be done in private,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but not as many things need to be done in privacy as the government and as the people in charge  would have you think. Right. They love secrecy. Yeah. And it's a fetish. So I think, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we elect Congress, we elect oversight committees, intelligence committees that meet in secret,  that are told things that the public can't be told. But they don't know stuff now, right? And

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that was, again, that goes back to the point of Snowden. There were things that the government  was doing that Congress didn't know. There are things the government's doing now that Congress  doesn't know. There were things that they were doing to Google that Google didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we're in a situation where what we all thought were norms and normative behavior  that everybody would adhere to, suddenly nobody cares about anymore. And that's a problem.  You know, when you have political conventions being held in the White House, that's a problem.  It's a patent violation of the law, but as Kellyanne Conway said, let me know when they  put somebody in jail for this. And so if you've got somebody who's willing to break the norms,  doesn't really care, then we really got a problem because there's no chance for this  democratic debate. There's no chance for Congress to do oversight.  This was a good discussion. Let's take a break. We have some Google-y stuff. This was peripherally  about Google. I think his criticism is certainly of Google and probably of Facebook as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if anyone gives us grief about not talking about Google, last week we talked a good 25%  about Google. At least. Pop that number up. 25%. Can't we do more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was pretty high. I'm going to confess, I misnamed the show. I can't deny it. We just don't,  we don't have another name for it. And now it's been...  What were you guys going to be lathering about technology and society?  Yeah, that wouldn't be good. Nobody's going to listen to that crap. So we have to pretend  it's about Google. I'm saying.  Habermas and Gutenberg?  No, this week in Habermas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would not listen to that. I got to be honest.  No, you got to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Wasabi. Hot cloud storage. Would you listen to me?  If I told you there's something better than S3, better than Google Cloud,  better than Azure, faster, less expensive, better than on-prem storage, that's Wasabi.  Wasabi is disruptive technology that's highly secure. It's turning the industry on its ear.  Storage that's 80% cheaper and up to six times the speed of Amazon S3. With no charge for egress,  no complicated tiering, no charge for API access, Wasabi is kind of amazing.  Wasabi is so affordable, it actually costs less than the same amount of on-premises storage.  In fact, it not only costs less, it costs less than the annual maintenance fees on the same  amount of on-prem storage. You'll save a lot of money with Wasabi. A lot of businesses these days  are creating data at a rapid but predictable pace. You know we're going to need another petabyte  of storage in the next year. We're going to need another hundred terabytes in the next month,  that kind of thing. You know. So instead of going out and buying on-premise storage solutions,  why don't you do it in the cloud? I'll tell you why. I'll give you my argument for it.  I would argue it's more secure than your on-prem storage. 11 nines of durability.  Wasabi's data is hosted in premier redundant tier four data center facilities. They're highly secure.  Their active integrity checking means everything you store in Wasabi is checked  for integrity every 90 days. And because you're in redundant servers, in redundant centers,  you can always restore anything that's missing. Wasabi is secure by default. All the data stored  in the cloud is always encrypted at rest, even if you don't specify it. Wasabi has some really  cool ways of keeping your data safe from let's say ransomware or human error. For instance,  you can designate data immutable. It cannot be erased. It cannot be altered. You'll be  protected from malware, from hackers, from fumble fingered employees. That's awesome.  There's access control mechanisms, bucket policies, and access control lists so that only the right  people have access to your data. Wasabi follows in every respect the best industry security models  and design practices. Now there's two ways to pay. They've got their very low cost, play as you go.  So just buy it as you need it. And I actually know a lot of people are using it that way,  just kind of back up that kind of thing. But you can also pay ahead of time with reserved  capacity storage. This is particularly for people who are buying on-prem storage at a regular clip.  You know what you need. If you buy ahead one, three or five year increments, you'll get greater  discounts for the longer term and the higher capacity. The savings are spectacular. It's  really a good solution for anybody who's buying hardware right now. Don't buy more hard drives.  Buy the cloud. Buy Wasabi. Of course, it's HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.  Wasabi is secure. It's fast. It's safe. And it's 80% less expensive. Calculate the savings for  yourself and start a free trial for a month. Check out Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I dot com. Click the free  trial link. Edit the code, twit. Wasabi.com. Offer code, twit. Join the movement. Migrate your data  to the cloud and do it with confidence. I'm telling you, I know the boss is going to say, who? You just  say, look, let me tell you why. Just repeat what I just said. And I think the boss will say, wow,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's it. Wasabi hot cloud storage for me. Thank you, Wasabi, for supporting this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright, let me find some Google-ish stuff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Seeing the wheels spin in Leo's head. Where's the wheel going to stop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Round and round she goes. Where she stops, nobody knows. Verily is getting into insurance. That's  the alphabet company that's for health sciences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not a tear. I put that up there. It's not terribly exciting because what they're getting into  is stop loss insurance. So it's not retail insurance. I thought it'd be like health insurance.  It's for the health insurance companies. Oh, so it's insurance for the insurers. I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. So that you don't get in nowadays with COVID. I think insurers for a company,  self-insurers. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Stop loss insurance. Yeah, that makes sense.  We thought for a while both Amazon, Amazon's started offering insurance to their employees.  We thought they would get in this business. We thought Google would. Nothing yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are they betting that we might actually get single payer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe this isn't a good time to get into that business.  Maybe it's not. Maybe you wait till after November 3rd.  Heavy ads story is interesting. Heavy ads. What are heavy ads? Google's blocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are ads that carry a lot of megs with them and Google's going to start blocking them. And that  means that ads that have fancy stuff going on in them, which are expensive also may get blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anything that consumes more than four megabytes of network data or 60 seconds of CPU usage.  That's a lot. And it is only 0.3% of all ads out there. But because they're so heavy,  they make up more than a quarter of all ad data network consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder if the takeover ad that I complained about last week with the Washington Post would  have been a heavy ad. Right. If it's got video probably. I appreciate the fact that these,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the people designing the ads didn't necessarily think about just putting all of the big flashy  stuff out there because they know as a society, we are stuck on the whole squirrel complex and  we look at big shiny things on the screen. And they fought that urge. They fought that urge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is why AMP exists because people were, what you were downloading with every webpage  was megabytes of crap. The camp exists for a number of reasons. I know you're going to set

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  up on that. Okay. You'd be fine with it. Fight words. So you're such an unhappy person. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  know how you. Oh, I'm sorry. I was saying I love the little disbelieving Leo squeak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like, we need a soundboard with our various sounds. Stacey, you have about 10 of them.  She's got the best sounds. We need a Stacey Leo soundboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm actually just copying Stacey. I'm just trying to get more Stacey stuff going in here.  Facebook. That's okay. What? Facebook. That's okay. I'm pissed off. Facebook now says you have to  have a Facebook account to use your Oculus Rift. Oh really? Yeah. And Oculus Connect is now Facebook  Connect. They're going to do a virtual conference September 16th. Facebook. The worst is the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  thing that the other name they came up with. What? The reality labs. Oh yeah. The AR VR teams are now  Facebook reality labs. A company that most people don't want screwing with reality is Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, in Facebook's reality, it's not real reality, unfortunately. Give or take. Yeah, no,  this is so frustrating because when Facebook swallows a company, it's trying to absorb every  aspect of it and it will force users onto its platform. And people are now, I mean, if I were

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  an Oculus user, I'd be pissed. I am and it's going in a box because I'm not going to create a Facebook  account. So what's the benefit? I understand the benefit of tying Instagram data to Facebook data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I get that. I don't understand the benefit to Facebook here of demanding you have a Facebook  for something that's basically its own business unit. Because Facebook wants to make its fall

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  into real reality, right? So think about things like the portal. Think about things like Oculus.  You can see where someone is in their home. You can influence their physical actions in the world  and get data about where they exist in the real world. That's very powerful data. And it's no  wonder that Facebook wants it. They don't know necessarily what they're going to do with it. I  know Mark has some weird vision of VR, but you know, that's how I look at this. It's my internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Terrible. Looks like the driver on the wrist, but now I'm scared after hearing this news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you an Oculus? Yeah, I gave you my Oculus. You have an Oculus.  Yeah. I'm, you know, I mean, you will be forced to do this. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going HTC Vive, baby. I mean, and I'm, I'm an Instagram user. I use Instagram fairly regularly  and it's a Facebook property. But it, I guess I'm limited. I sort of limit what I put on there as

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well. Would you, could you use something like Flickr instead? Is there anything you could use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  instead that isn't so invasive? Yeah, there are options with Flickr and stuff like that.  I look at my engagement levels. I get a lot more engagement about my work on Instagram and Twitter.  Of course. Nothing on Flickr or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Of course you do. That's the problem. That's where the people are. That's where the people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the whole problem. You know, I said before the show, I said I'm done striving.  That's why I can now safely leave Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and not look back because  I don't need to. No, you just enjoy being a contrarian. I don't like them. I don't want to.  You enjoy, not enjoying. My new master is Jeff Bezos, the world's first $200 billion man.  Unbelievable. $200 billion. He's got, that means he's got $2 billion Franklins.  There's a number for you. You think with all that money he could buy himself a better jacket?  Hey, that jacket is the best.  Oh no. Really? You like that jacket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could wear it. I don't know about you, but I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could pull it off. Yes, you could pull it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could wear a toga and look good. It doesn't, you don't need,  clothings for you are just something to hold your muscles back.  Amazon stock went up another 2% this afternoon. Bezos made, I can't even imagine making $4.9 billion  in an afternoon. Wow. He is now as of 1.50 p.m. Eastern time today  worth $204.6 billion. The next richest person in the world is Bill Gates. He's a punter at $116 billion.  Even adjusting for inflation, Forbes says they believe Bezos' fortune is the largest ever amassed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see this article and it makes me think about a recent issue I had with the Amazon order and  not a delivery in particular. This was more so on the database side, the software side. Something

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  went wrong. It was Amazon's fault. Jeff should have given you a billion right there. He just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  peel it right off. It's no problem. Well, that's the thing. They come at you and say,  you know what? We're sorry about this. And I'm thinking, all right, we pay the,  however much it is per year for that service. And they say, well, we'll give you a $10  credit or something like that. And I'm like, that's a slap in the face, especially if this  was something that I really needed at the time for a job. I think Jeff Bezos should come to your house  and make it rain. I think he should just. I told the representative, make it 50 bucks and I'll be  happier. Otherwise just keep your $10. That's a slap in the face. It's not worth the effort

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to cash the check. Tell them, I just can't be bothered. I'm rich like Bezos. You would

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  salt me with your, with your trivial offer of peace. You're $10 to mean anything to me. I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mr. Ant Pruitt. The president is actually going to go to the Supreme court. This is how pathetic  we've gotten. This is how sad. And it's not a comment on Trump. It's just how sad the whole  political sphere has gotten. He's going to go to the United States Supreme court, the highest court  in the land, ask them to let him block users on Twitter again. Oh, bless his heart. He's using  the solicitor general, the United States of America so that he can block users on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never quite got an understanding on his Twitter account versus the president of the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the argument. He says, look, I got a POTUS account. Okay. I won't block things on that,  but the real Donald Trump, that's my personal account. I can do that.  Okay. I think, I think he's president all the time, not just nine to five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He would argue if you tried to tell him that he was not president at certain times a day,  he would argue that no, he is president all the time and will be forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Forever. So arguing that this is a purely personal action is I think not going to,  I don't know. It'd be really interesting to see what the Supremes say. The court, three panel,  three judge panel, unanimously ruled last year, as you might remember that he could not block users  on Twitter because he used to make official pronouncements. And it is kind of the thing we  do in America. I think it's in the first amendment. I might be wrong. The right to speak up and say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like that. I think, let me double check. I think it's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a case too. It's in the, what do you call the law of open government information?  Yes, yes, transparency. Yes. Yeah. But, but I'm just going to bet the Supremes were going to  punt and wait and not rule this. It seems such a trivial,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  terrible thing for them. They don't want to get dragged down. There's so many more serious things  like TikTok. They could be getting involved in the tip TikTok or Apple versus Epic. There's so many

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  more important things. Oh Lord. I don't know. Well, let's take this a little further. So not  just Donald Trump wanting to block people, but let's think about as we go forward in time,  we're going to have presidents and people in power who have a history of social media use,  for example. And if you start thinking from that perspective, how far, to what extent could Kamala  Harris go to protect her accounts from harassment? And I don't know. So I'm just trying to think  about, maybe it's not just Twitter, but how, at what point do you become your job? It's kind of  the same between a public and a private person for libel reasons, right? Or not libel, coverage  reasons. And I mean, I'm not saying, I'm not thinking that Trump is thinking this far ahead,  but as a lawyer, I would be thinking that way. And I assume some lawyers are. And just like  your personal Instagram or what about your kids' Instagram? And yes, he is making political statements  on Twitter. So does that negate that? And if that's the rule that we come up with, then how does that  make other people behave on Twitter if they aspire to this office? He's not saying I want the power

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to delete old tweets, which he also deletes. He's saying I want to be able to put my fingers in my  ears and say, I can't hear you. I don't know what you're saying. He wants to block a route  for the citizens of the United States to talk back to him. And Stacey brings up a really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  analogy talking about Kamala Harris. I think there's a professor at University of Maryland,  Matthew Kirchenbaum, and the name you should know because he wrote the history of word processing.  It's a great book. It's a really fun book. Track changes. Track changes. So the other day he  tweeted somebody, some troll was going after him and he was just kind of saying, I'm not playing.  He finally said, you don't have a right to a conversation. And I like that. I don't have  any responsibility to respond to you. I don't need to rise to whatever bait you're putting up  before me. So there's that. Then do you have a right to be heard? No, you don't. So I think  Stacey's right that do you have a right to not be harassed? These are the things we've got to discuss

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now. That's an interesting voice of reason. Stacey Higginbotham. But who defines harassment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I think some people would say, well, anything that disagrees with me is harassment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Disagrees with you. Yeah, exactly. But you know what? That's where you get the Supreme Court involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's not reading. He's not reading his tweet feed. I think he's more concerned. Well, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if that's the case, but I think he's more concerned about followers seeing other people's  tweets to him than he is about him seeing them. You know what I'm saying? He wants to keep the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  dissent out of his at replies. Oh, that's a different question then. Does he? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Still controlling the message. I pray to God we can get rid of presidents tweeting. Please,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  let's get rid of that. That's a bad- That's a really important thing. I was sad. So back in the  day, way back in the day, I even did stuff on this, right? The candidates, Obama was making YouTube  videos. Right. Right? Now I can't keep doing that. It's a direct connection to the public. This is  great. It's using social media really well. I love this. If Obama did it, I would have loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, it can get abused. Well, I would say that, I mean, FDR started his radio addresses  and he did it because he didn't like the message from the press. So there's a time-honored history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, speaking to the people, not a bad thing. But that's why we call it the bully pulpit. You  have plenty of options to do that. You can call the networks and they come running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why not modernize a little bit? Why not modernize and go where the people are? I guarantee you,  my daughter is not listening to the radio or watching television. Apparently, I didn't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this. Joe Biden says he's promised to stop using his personal Twitter account if he's elected.  He'll just use the POTUS account. The interesting thing about the POTUS account is that is an  official account for the president of the United States. And it is not your account, right? When  Obama, which was created under Obama, but when he stepped down, he handed it over to Trump and  presumably Trump will hand it to his successor and on and on and on. And I think that's interesting.  That I don't mind because that then has the status of an official pronouncement from the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And I think the refusal of Trump to use it is very indicative of his personality and his  goals with this. And I think Obama's willingness to create the account and then leave it behind  is also very indicative of who he was as a politician. Actually, you may be able to delete

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  your tweets, but you can never delete your email if the USC border patrol gets a hold of it.  The end of the month, last month, Department of Homeland Security published a privacy impact  assessment detailing the electronic data they can choose to collect from people crossing the border  and what happens to it. In this assessment, they claim the right to search laptops, thumb drives,  cell phones, any device capable of storing electronic information. And when they call it  a border search, they can do this not just when you're crossing the border in either direction,  but even anywhere within 100 miles of the border. That's two thirds of the US population lives in  within 100 miles of the border. So now they have asserted a right to collect any electronic data  for anybody from two thirds of the United States. They also say, we will keep this. We will acquire  a mirror copy of the data on the device and store it locally. Once they make sure there's no porn on  it. Because that's dangerous. Once they've determined it's clean, they transfer it to  a border patrol system called PLX where the information is stored and searchable for 75 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This will get sued. I'm sure it also gets sent to Palantir.  But yes, they will be sued for this. They were sued over the within the 100 miles of the border  and that didn't work. This is really, I mean, this isn't the sort of stuff we look at other  countries doing this. So we're like outraged at, but this is where we are as a country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll see what the courts say. They say they plan to keep travelers emails, videos, pictures,  as long as they're not pornographic, texts and tap messages, financial accounts and transactions,  by the way, gave me a great idea. A new kind of encoding. If you put all your secrets in dirty  pictures, you're safe. Right? You're safe. Financial accounts and transactions, location,  history, web browser, bookmarks, task lists. Step one, acquire bomb material. Step two,  well, I won't continue because it's going to get in this list. Your calendars, your call logs,  your contracts. 75 years, although if it's not related to a crime, it may be deleted after 20

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  years. We can't promise, they say. So you travel with a clean phone is what this says. Yeah. Don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  cross. Well, don't get within 100 miles of the border with anything. 100 miles. That's right. Oh,  right. Right. Right. So a border patrol agent, if you're within 100 miles of the border,  and this happens all the time, I understand in Vermont and areas near the Canadian border,  they can just say, Hey, come here, give me your phone. Thanks. Okay. Got it. Have a nice day,  citizen. You don't have to be crossing the border. Yeah. It's blatantly wrong. But you want Palantir  to protect our boys overseas. Yes, I do. In Canada. Yes. In Canada. Yes, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've always wondered, I've always wondered if you're a border guard, because you know,  if you fly back from Toronto, you go through customs there. Are those US border agents  live, they're Americans, they have to be American citizens, I assume, living in Canada? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not a bad guy. No, they're always very nice to me. Some of them are fans. I'm not criticizing you  guys. I just don't think you should be able to suck all the data out of my devices and keep it  for 70 years. Within 100 miles. Yeah. Seattle's 135 miles from the Canadian border. You're safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but people who live in like the northern suburbs. Yeah. I'm puzzled because

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if they say two thirds of the nation, does that mean anybody who lives on the coast,  because the territorial border is, what is it 20 miles? Is that everybody? Anybody who lives  a little over 100 miles of the territory? Then I'm screwed. That's right. Yeah. I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because the coast is, what's the border? 35 miles? I can't remember what the, I always thought was  20, but international waters. What's territory versus fishing versus this versus that? Yeah.  What's our territorial waters? No detail is too small for us. We will. This is maritime law,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  my friend. Maritime law. I do not know. The law of the sea, my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm looking on the DHS site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The high seas. The Copenhagen convention of 1857.  Sure was 1858. It's complicated is the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. It is just complicated as hell. Look at this chart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's the continental shelf and then the extended continental shelf, the international seabed,  international water surface, international exclusive economic zone, national airspace,  and then finally outer space. So it's somewhere in this table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's national airspace, international airspace, territorial sea, contiguous zone,  high seas. High seas seem to go out a long way. The exclusive economic zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is an airport a border? The airport's a border too because you, I don't know how this works.  Oh my gosh. We need a maritime lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You just need an immigration lawyer. I'm sure they could tell you.  Anyone in the chat room? Somebody in the chat room? Anyone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure we have a few playing on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need to take a break. A little breather. One moment. Everybody stretch.  And then when we come back, we're going to talk about a new way the bad guys can make a copy  of your keys with their smartphone as they're walking by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. This actually, we talked about this. I just had a little stretch. Sorry.  We talked about this on security now from the association of computing machinery  and a demo. I think this was at Black Hat. It turns out if you record the audio of a key and a lock,  security researchers were able to actually make a copy of the key, 3D print it based on the sounds  it makes. When the key hits the tumbler and it pushes it and all of that stuff,  with a smartphone or even they say the microphone in a video doorbell, they can attack  and they can record. You want to hear what the clicks sound like? Here, I'll play the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't the microphone in the video doorbell your doorbell? So it wouldn't be dangerous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but what if they hack into my doorbell? And then I open the door. You should have this  in IOT. Here, listen. Did you hear that? No. Well, turn up your sound. That's-  Oh, I did hear it.  Apparently, they were able to record this from a distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's getting some pretty high frequencies too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and they actually roll off everything under like 10,000 hertz. They don't need it.  I didn't even know this, but in most keys, there's about 330,000 keys. So using that audio file,  they can reduce the search space down to just three. So they can 3D print the keys for the codes  inferred from the audio and one of those three will almost certainly work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the deal. Most locks are fairly hackable with just a screwdriver or a credit card  or a good kick in the door jam. I'm intrigued by people who are hacking door locks because really  what you need to watch out for, what I think about is remote access that can open a lot of  doors at once because that is something that it would be worth trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like that hack that was getting into electronic hotel doors, right? That the guy could just go  down the hall one by one, open the door, go in, take your stuff, go to the next door and all that.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And even that's, I mean, that is still much more value add for Rave. So yes, if you are like  a weirdly popular, like if you're Beyonce, you've got a different security profile, right?  You probably, yeah.  But for most of us, I would worry more about someone in a door jam and it could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. As Carson says, locks are just a suggestion. Like, please don't come in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at that and I'm thinking about the different variables with the locks.  I'm assuming not all locks are created with the same materials, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is true.  Yeah. No.  I don't know.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're supposedly, don't they make a, what are those Medeco locks that can't be picked supposedly?  But then Steve Gibson says, and when we talked about this yesterday on security night, he said,  but Leo, as you and I both know, every hacker worth his salt can hack and unlock a door very

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  quickly with just a hat pin and a couple of lockpick tools, which I can't, but I was honored that he  included me in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I'm saying is you go to your local hardware store and you go to pick up the lock for your  front door, you see the $10 one and you see the $15 one and you see the $100 one. They're not all  made the same. So why would I assume that they all use the same types of locks?  They all use different materials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no. There's a certain commonality.  No, no. But there are, there are less pickable locks, you know, supposedly anyway. I don't know.  I don't know. I just thought I'd bring it up. I thought it was kind of fun. I just  wanted to play that sound. I got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like if you tap your, your, your, your fork against your, your wine glass versus a cheaper  wine glass. They're both wine glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what they're listening for is not the quality of the sound, but the actual sound of the tumbler  of the pin hitting the tumbler and setting it. So even though it might sound different,  there's a distinct click. You heard the clicks.  Okay.  There's a distinct frequency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like the old days of listening to a typewriter and being able to replicate what the spies

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  could do.  It's the timing. John says the distance between the clicks tells you how big the humps.  I don't know.  Thank you, Jammer B.  Thank you, Jammer B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just put it in the chat, but I found the ACLU thing on the border zone and the 100-mile border  zone with the map that shows you the border zone.  Oh, handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And does it look like a lot of people are within that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Really?  Jeff, you're in it with New York City. It's in the chat room. Oh, here. I'll put it in the...  You're in it, Stacey?  Yeah, but here.  I got it right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you, Stacey. Your rights in the border zone. And this is where the figure comes from.  Pretty much everybody on the coast on it. Yeah, it's just all the way around.  Wow. That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's all of us, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That one here is going to have it all.  And they mention, as an example, on January 19th, two border patrol agents boarded a Greyhound  bus at a Fort Lauderdale station and questioned passengers row by row. The bus was scheduled  to travel from Orlando to Miami. No international border, but they ultimately detained a Jamaican  national who they claimed overstayed her tourist visa. Apparently, this happens all the time.  And I remember reading about, I think it was a Vermont town that was routinely harassed  by the Customs and Border Patrol agents because they would come down on a Saturday night. They  love to roust people. So 100 air miles from any external boundary of the US is a reasonable distance.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They can board a bus or train without warrant, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anywhere.  What right do you have to say, no, I'm not going to do this? Do you have any rights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do have that right. You have... They cannot detain you without reasonable suspicion. So if  you go, there's a segment in the ACLU, are there limitations to immigration officials power?  You have the right to remain silent or tell the agent that you'll only answer questions in the  presence of an attorney, no matter what your status is. And they cannot detain you without  reasonable suspicion, although they can create that very quickly. And they cannot search you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  without probable cause or your consent. So basically shut up, say, I need to see an attorney  and they can't arrest you for that.  And it knows it's doing it.  Try not to look suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can arrest you apparently if they ask you about your immigration status and you don't have  those documents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But the thing is, it's very intimidating and you have to be a surprisingly strong-willed  person to not say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have to know this. Most people are inclined to, and you see this in cop shows all  the time, but they're inclined to help because they're probably not guilty of anything and then  they get suckered into something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a great video. I gave it to my kids, but it's a video by a defense attorney who says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  under no circumstances should you at any time speak to the police, period. No good can come of it.  Just don't. You're within your rights not to, so don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's on YouTube if you want to watch it. He makes a strong case. I'm not that guy. I'm going to say,  sure officer, whatever. What do you need? I'm an honest guy.  Get along, Leo.  Get along, Leo. That's me. That's me. I'll show my Palantir card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm one of you.  I'm one of you, right?  Wink, wink, secret handshake. I'm there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love it when I see people, usually in hot cars, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Maseratis,  and they have a license plate border that says something like, I'm in the police 100 club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's the 100 club. Yeah, they have stickers. You see it all the time in the suburbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's, yeah, it's, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We donate money to your pension fund.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And supposedly that gets you off the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In Jersey, they also put, they have these shields they put right next to the driver  and the windshield.  Yeah. See, I believe it works in Jersey.  You got a problem with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know Chris Christie. It's the CHP 1199 Foundation. But see, I think that's nice. You  should make a donation, but not to get out of a traffic ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So my elite relative of mine, somewhat distant, was friends with cops in Jersey.  And they used to give him a card. And if you got stopped, you just hand over the card.  It is a get out of jail free card. It says, I'm a friend of Corporal Tomosky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Look at this wallet you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it a get out of jail free card or is it a just get out of a...  Those are very different.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I think you can only take it so far. Honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Plus the other thing is there's all these fake police charities that call all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Those, by the way, those are almost always scams. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So much talk about Leo.  So much.  Where do you start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And none of it's about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm trying. I'm trying.  What do you pick? I am, like I said, I'm done striving.  Checked out.  I'm done striving. I don't have to strive.  No more striving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the Gap School?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about it? You brought it up. You got to pitch it.  You got to tell us why it's important.  It's yours.  It's yours. You own it now, baby. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not Leo Loporte. I'm Ant Pruitt. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're just going to bring up a story and then let me do the work, the heavy lifting?  Exactly.  Okay. So at least to me what Jeff does, give me the line number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, line number. Sorry. Line number is 28, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. So from now on, just give me the line number.  Oh yeah. Actually, I started this, but I couldn't figure out how to pronounce ex-Googlers.  These are ex-Googlers. They have formed a virtual tech school  for gap year students. Jeff, you were in a bit of a Twitter feud about the idea of taking a year off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As if that was better necessarily. It was a matter of privileged people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I feel so bad for kids who worked hard. They got through high school.  First of all, they didn't get to walk as high school seniors. And then the college says,  by the way, just stay home. You can watch your classes on video.  We know you get along well with mom and dad.  Oh my God. I feel so bad for this generation.  That just sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what? I had my first class today. Last week I had the whole entire incoming class,  a hundred people in Zoom. Zoom didn't work for breakout sessions. I had to do a hundred  person brainstorm session. But today we had the actual first class with 16 students.  And it was great. And Zoom was wonderful.  Were they at home? Where are they?  They're at home wherever. One's in Venezuela, one's in Mexico, all over the country.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think we're going to learn how to do this better. And it may actually be that after  quarantine we actually have a new technique, which is great. But I think if I were a college kid,  I might be tempted if I had the option to take a year off. And Jeff, you were saying,  not everybody could do the grand tour and just kick around, but maybe what you do is you work.  You get a job at the grocery store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo, have you heard?  Have you heard?  What?  We have 60 million people out of jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. There's that.  Right.  There's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But there are jobs. Like my daughter's got a job a couple months ago at Trader Joe's.  Some of these jobs nobody wants because if you're an ad executive, you don't want to work as a bagger  at Trader Joe's, but for a college kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would work. I would do it. I would work at Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She loves it. Abby loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo, this is a big, I'm about to give you a great tip here.  Because Trader Joe's has a new dish. I wanted the food people on the call here.  Okay.  See what you think. One of my favorite dishes when I go to Italy, I have it without fail.  I love this. It is the simplest, most elegant, wonderful dish there is.  Cacio e pepe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love Cacio e pepe. There's a place near me that makes such, oh, so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this won't be in that place, but Trader Joe's has frozen microwavable  Cacio e pepe and I'm going to have it tonight and it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet I could make this because it's pasta and pepper.  And cheese.  And cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And cheese and a little bit. So you can always add like the place near me does lemon,  which is delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My parents used to make this all the time. They called it spaghetti al burro,  which means spaghetti with butter. It's when we didn't have any sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's different. Cacio e pepe is different.  There's a lot of cheese and it's just the right timing to get it to coat properly.  It's a big deal. I've made it. Even I have made it twice. Once successfully, once not.  But it's kind of like pasta.  Give me my happiness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where's the beef?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which I've made. Yeah. But there's no egg and there's no bacon.  It's a six. So it's and by the way, I personally, I would make my own pasta  if you really want to do it right. Make some tagliolini, some bucatini, some spaghetti.  You put in the butter, the cracked pepper, the Parmigiano Reggiano, a little pecorino for bite.  It's not hard. What's hard about this? You toss it in the pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to go out after the show and my wife refused to eat this late.  And I and I get out of the freezer and I put it in the microwave dish.  That's true. Seven minutes. It's ready to go. Great. It's ready to go.  It is adult macaroni and cheese. Yeah, that's what it is. Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. C-A-C-I-O-E-P-E-P-E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cacio e pepe. I've never heard of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cheese and pepper. Oh, it's delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or as my mom and dad called it, spaghetti al burro. I have some grain out back.  I'm trying to grow the heritage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you going to mill your own wheat? I actually do. Wait, wait a minute. I do mill my own wheat,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but I don't grow the grain. In fact, my son, who's a little wise ass, he's 17, says when we say we're  going to homemade pasta, he said, you're growing the wheat? I said, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will say so. This is as crazy as I got, but I was like, I realized how much our food chain is  like so much better than life used to be because I made a loaf of bread and it happened to be the  same day that I had also made meatballs and we were going to do paninis. And then I also had  fresh tomatoes. So I was like, oh, I'll just make the tomato sauce with the basil. And dear God,  I was cooking for like six hours for a sandwich we ate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fresh tomatoes. And yeah, and they ate it in five minutes. Mom, that was great. Bye.  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it was tasty. I don't think I'd ever do that again.  It was only happenstance. I didn't do it. It's hard to make it from

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  fresh, fresh tomatoes. But yeah, because there's a lot of cooking involved. If you get some nice  San Marzano tomatoes, here's a trick I learned from the great Marcella Hazan,  one of the great Italian cookbooks of all time. Very simple marinara sauce, a can of  Marzano's are the best San Marzano tomatoes. Diced if you want, whole if you want,  you can squish them up. A half an onion and a stick of butter. That's it. Cook it for 45 minutes.  That's it. It's the most I'm going to one up you. Fantastic. Better. Yeah. Roast it instead of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cooking it. Oh, good thinking. You're going to caramelize a little bit. Very nice. Very nice.  Very nice. Okay. I like it. I will. Here's, I'm going to throw this all in, you know,  if you don't want onion, because I'm not a huge onion fan, stick some garlic. If you want to get  crazy stick like an anchovy fillet. But see, that's why we don't chop up the onion. We cut

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it in half and put it a half an onion in there. Because then you take it out. It just flavors it.  And the butter gives it a nice fatty smoothness. It's very good. Yeah. I learned this from Blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apron. I now finish all of my pasta sauce. That's a good idea. Even a pat of butter. Yeah. Oh yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you always put a little bit. You know what? What is it? Salt, acid, fat, and yeah, it's only a few  things in the world. That's it. That's it. God, why are we doing this? We should be doing a cooking  show. So the application process was open for classes to start on September 14th. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they don't mention anything about pricing for this particular service or opportunity for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  kids trying to have a GAP school year. So I love the idea. Take advantage of that GAP semester.  Invest eight weeks this fall, preparing for the real world. Build your network. Gain guidance  from mentors. This is a great idea. Yeah. Let's, let's, you know what? Here's how you find out how  much it's going to cost. Let's apply. Send a form. It's in the form. It doesn't sound like it  costs anything. I think you just fill this out. I don't know how you would, like does every, I bet  you it's just virtual, right? It's called an externship, not an internship. Cause you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if it's virtual, that's fine, but that still doesn't particularly mean free of charge though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right? Yeah. And they talk about mentorship. Obviously not everyone can do this. So there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  has to be something, right? What is my time commitment? Who is this course designed for?  College seniors. You have to be 18. Eight week program starts September 14th. College seniors or  high school seniors. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. College seniors and juniors. Oh, so this is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for, this is not for kids going to college. That's weird. So it isn't really gap years.  Well, it's an accidental. Okay. Now I'm really confused. It's a gap in the middle of your college

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  years as opposed to between high school and college. Courses will be taught live via video.  So that's how they can accommodate. There is no cost to attend our speaker series and workshops.  We will offer additional services you might find useful to purchase in the future. You don't get  credit for it. There's no cost. It's really just informational video seminars about a lot of things  that you might want to know about. And here's an example of your schedule, project planning,  how to stand out to recruiters. This is for people about to graduate from college.  This is to get you ready for your career, which I think is a great thing. I think this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially since colleges can be so terrible at that. They really like, if you ever go to like  career counseling or services at a college, I mean, sometimes you just get the most outlandishly  weird information. And I get why it's because they're trying to counsel people, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  through a wide variety of jobs, but it's terrible. So if you're a college junior, senior, you're going  to take a gap semester because of COVID. Go to xooglerschool.com. X-O-O-G-L-E-R-S-C-H-O-O-L.com.  I think, and thank you for bringing this up. This is really good. That's really neat. And  it's free. And you know, it's definitely pre-professional training. I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really great. I had high schoolers on the brain because I'm thinking about my hard-head son as  a senior. Yeah. What's he going to do? We don't know yet. You know, we're still going through  the process of trying to figure out where to go. He definitely wants to go to college, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he won't be going until a year from September. So by then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not really. Really? I think it'll still be different, but I think we'll be...  Better shaped. We'll be in a different place that should be slightly better,  but it may not be what we are used to. Right. Right. I think that's true in general. I mean,  that's... Well, yeah, that's... Thank you, Stacey. Thank you, Captain Obvious.  But it will be even more different than we expect. Sorry. I think a year from now,  organizations will have learned a lot on how to deal with what we're dealing with.  I think they already have. Some have and some haven't. Schools are terribly slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they? Because my son is attending the Petaluma High for the first time this year as a senior.  He was at another online school for a couple of years volitionally. Oh, I didn't know he was  switching to Petaluma. Oh, wow. Well, he wants to walk with his friends.  Oh, right. Okay. Got it. But they have learned a lot in the intervening summer. They've really  got the systems down a lot better. And I think next year they'll be even better still. I just  hope that we can get back to some sort of group activities. I don't know. So while we're on that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  can I do a quick plug for my school, for the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism?  Yes, you may. That we just redid our entrepreneurial journalism program and applications just opened.  We're planning this all online anyway. It was not because of COVID. 100-day all online program for  a certificate for the independent, resilient journalist. So if you want to serve someone,  a community or market with your Substack email and your YouTube and your Medium and events,  we can have them and so on and so forth and make money through Patreon and Kickstarter and all of  that, then that's what we're going to teach you. Stacey, you should definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I said, Jeff, I've actually talked to, you know, Rosenthal Alves, right? I've talked to him about  his classes in the past about entrepreneurial journalism. So if you want, not only do I have  my own media company, my husband has his own media company in a totally different place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's not a different physical place, but a conceptual place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, you're right. It's the same place.  Grrr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Has a...  Plug over.  Do you think your school has gotten better at it, Jeff, that you've kind of figured out remote learning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Honest answer is that what we're still doing is in the early days of media, we called it shovelware,  right? Do what you used to do in this new way. I think what I think the benefit that's going to  come out of this for us is the professors are all getting very excited about suddenly making  hybrid things. They're making videos for the classes. The students can watch them with their  own. I did my entire orientation thing and did not only YouTube videos. I turned into a podcast so  they could listen. That's something I hadn't done before. So I think we'll get better. Yes,  we're doing fine at replicating what we did, but our classes are still three hours long.  That's kind of ridiculous. We've got to rethink that.  You can't do the remote for three hours.  This will open up our brains to rethink things more fundamentally, which would be a good thing.  I don't think that's a bad thing. Hey, let's... Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope. I was just going to say exactly. That's what I think in a year. That's the stuff I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What it'll be like. Yeah. We'll have a vaccine by then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even so, I don't think we'll be at the same place. Thinking of the vaccine as a panacea is silly.  I wouldn't get your hopes up there. Yeah. Do you think...  We're looking at lower levels of immunity. We're looking at a population that has  lots of anti-vaxxers. I mean, you're looking at...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but if I'm vaccinated, I don't care about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the silo norms are going to be totally different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Whatever immunity you get from the vaccination is not going to last forever.  Well, I'll get another one. It's still around the population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Look at the pandemic in 1918 never went away. It's H1N1.  We get a flu vaccine every fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it doesn't necessarily stop just that. It doesn't stop all flus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think... No, I know. I understand. Sometimes you get the flu.  Really, the only reason that works is because it did mutate into something less fatal,  which was a good thing. There's no guarantee that would happen with COVID-19.  But do you think at some point, in a year, two years, will I ever get to travel again?  Will I ever get to eat at a restaurant, go to a movie, go to a bar? Not at my age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is a question. You can say there's lots of people who might not...  That's the other thing. You can say you'll get a vaccine, but maybe you won't be able to get a  vaccine for production errors. Maybe it'll be riskier for people who are your age.  So you're just saying it's unknown?  I'm saying it's unknown and it's likely not to ever go back to being... Well,  ever is a strong term. I don't think it'll go back within the next two to three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the next one's coming.  Well, that's the other thing that concerns me. It isn't like this is unheard of. We had  SARS and we had MERS, and we were lucky in both cases. We kind of dodged a bullet because of the  profile of those particular viruses. We didn't this time and we could not again next time.  That could be a year from now. That could be three years from now. We don't know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure Elon Musk will have a cure by then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually like wearing a mask if it's freshly ironed.  Feels kind of like a nice sheet on the bed.  I do. I use the Niagara spray starch. It's like wearing a nice sheet. It's like getting in bed  when your sheets are changed. It's very nice. Freshly ironed. The nice thing about that ironing  a mask takes a second compared to ironing a sheet. So you can have a freshly ironed mask every single

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  day of the week. How about that? Do you guys have ironed sheets? Is that really something y'all do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That would be no. No. I'm old enough to remember when they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My in-laws actually have their housekeepers iron their sheets. The first time I slipped in there,  I was like, what is happening? It's pretty nice. It's very nice.  If you can do it. But I'm also like,  who would make someone iron sheets? So I've learned from my devoted watching of my reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  show below deck, which is all about the life of people who work in the charter yacht business,  those 150 foot mega yachts, that they actually is a big rolling device that you could, they iron  their sheets, but they don't do it with an iron. There's a big rolling device. You put it through  to press. Yeah. So we just get one of those press press. We talk about good bird. Good bird.  I want to do the change log. Play the drums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google, you will be thrilled to learn. Jeff Jarvis is rolling out automatic dark light mode switching  to the Google keyboard. The G board beta users. Enough said. I just happened to me recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did it just happen? Not that. No, not that. Something else would have made it go to dark mode.  And I was just, yeah, I was growling. Google is releasing ad mob for Android early access

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  available. Not to everybody on the play store. You can keep track of your earnings, your apps,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  explore useful metrics. I don't know. You're so excited. I'm not an app developer.  You lost your spark. You lost your spark. You're not striving for a better change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I lost my mojo. Google camera 7.5 does away with storing pixel portrait pairs and individual photos.  I don't even know what I just said. Is that the two pictures that happen?  Sometimes when I take a picture in certain. Yeah, it saves a blurred version in the original shot  so that you can edit one or the other if you want. Currently, 7.4 each pair generates and is stored  in a standalone folder, which means you will have hundreds and thousands of folders. So now they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  got some other way of doing it. Yeah. Yeah. It helps you clean up your phone a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're actually going to name it in a way that you can look at it and go, oh, that's the portrait  and that's the original. And yeah, that's good. I think that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually used, I actually go between looking at those two point of views because sometimes  the focal length is just right with that versus using the regular focal length on the  non-portrait mode. So you can just pick between the two and don't necessarily keep the blur,  but still have that same focal length and that same bit of distortion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll also get the new naming begins with a PXL, then the date, then a serial number,  and then the name has information about whether it's the cover or the original. So that's  that's good. That's going to be available in Android 11, which just, I think it's another  public beta. So I think we must be getting close to the release of Android 11. I like it a lot.  I really like a lot. Let's see. Google Chrome version 80 is now out and it's 10% faster kids  with tabs. It's got tab grouping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Better tab grouping. Better tab grouping. Somehow now it's 10% faster tab grouping.  Newer 10% faster. I haven't, have you used tab grouping or no, that's right. You won't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I use Firefox. Actually, I downloaded 80 just this morning just to see what's different about it. And  I like pinned tabs a lot. So this is kind of like pinned tabs, but you can have  work groups and stuff. So that's nice. So you can have a news and I would do that. I have a news.  Here's an example. This is a tab that's now expanded and then contracted back down. Save room,  because what happens to me with a lot of pinned tabs is pretty soon your whole top of the browser  bar is occupied. And something, something QR codes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't understand that at all. I didn't. Okay, let me scroll down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is a new way to share URLs? You can in fact print the page or generate a QR code. So  the QCAT goes virtual. Yeah. Yeah. So if you want to share a web page with somebody,  you can just give them the little dinosaur QR code. Are you guys old enough to know about the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  QCAT? Oh yeah. I know, I know, Dave. I know you do. I know the guy invented it. Oh, you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I'm old enough, I don't know anything about it. So well, guess what? Not enlightened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have one somewhere. It's probably in my, oh wait, throw it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like we invoked the QCAT in awful try.  This is why you watch this show live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the mic falls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is why you watch it live. Yeah, they're not going to cut that out. I guarantee you.  Probably be tweeted. So that's a QCAT. We've talked about this like five times already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nevermind. Okay. Stop. Stop. I've seen it, but I know nothing. Mine's autographed by Dave Matthews,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the guy who invented it. Not the band. Okay. A huge fan of twit and your team. Thanks for doing  what you do. Dave Matthews inventor. They gave these away at Radio Shacks. You could tell it's  pretty old because instead of having like a USB connector, it's got these keyboard connector.  And the idea is you'd read a newspaper and you'd see a QR, a barcode. It wasn't a QR code.  And you could scan it with this and it would open your browser. Because URLs were just too

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  difficult to ever imagine. Anyone would ever type them in. This did not make a big hit, big splash,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  especially because it's cat shaped, but it's cool to have. And Dave Matthews signed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought the cat shape was a selling point myself. Yeah. The internet loves cats.  You have a cat and a mouse. I think it was free too. Right. You got a cat and oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wired gave them away. That was the whole idea. You're going to put codes on every one of your  ads and stories. You're going to be tethered to your desktop machine in the den. Because it was  going to be too difficult to type in a URL. Usually change logs are things that are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a thing that is bad. Google Fi is ending its payment grace period for COVID-19.  So they're going to return to their standard policies for late payments and data speeds.  Because good news, COVID is over. Everybody's back to work. The economy is booming. Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, to be fair, how long do you do this? I mean, how long do you hold off on letting people pay  for essential services? And possibly maybe if Google says, all right, we're not doing this and  all these other people do this, maybe the government will realize that they need to  solve this. I keep thinking we're going to get nationwide broadband, but I've so far been wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to get Starlink. We're going to get Elon Musk broadband for $80 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what we're going to get. It's not going to help people.  You're going to need to cancel my Fi. Ellie used Fi when I was traveling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I stop the Fi, do I keep my number? Oh, that's an issue. No, I guess you could. You could probably  transfer it back to Google Voice. Yeah, you want to keep your number. Earlier this year, Google  extended the Fi grace period in which subscribers maintained full cellular service to 60 days  from the missed billing dates. You had two months. And if you experience hardship related to COVID-19,  you could request an extension from your account page. They are now reverting the late payment  extension back to three days, not 60 days. After that, you won't be able to make or accept calls,  send or receive texts or use data. Google One subscriptions also get suspended. Meanwhile,  full speed data limits will return to 15 gigabytes for flexible, 22 gigabytes for unlimited,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  starting on or after September 3rd. Sounds like they're on par with everybody else in the market.  Everybody else has started to change their services back in July or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess that makes sense. You can stop your Google Fi temporarily. How long is temporary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. Just halt it. Yeah. Oh, okay. I'll do that. Just hold it for three months and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pay for it for a month and then you can come back to it. Yeah. Okay. I'll do that. Because

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  basically I'm paying for Zoom now instead of Google Fi. Yeah. When you look for weather on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  your Android device now, you will see the little cute little Google frog that is in all the weather  displays has started wearing a mask when he goes outside. It's kind of cute. So I have a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about the Google frog. Yes. Does he do the same activities for like certain temperatures? What is  like, because you sometimes see the same stuff, but I have never mapped out his activities to the  temperature, but I kind of wish someone had, maybe someone has, but I'm very curious if the  frog is like, that's a good question. No one ever asked this. Come on, y'all. I know someone out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there has wondered this and knows the answer. I never even noticed a dad gum frog on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, okay. Well, here, everybody pick up your phone. Okay. My temperature right now is 75  Fahrenheit and my frog, I've never seen him do this before. He's actually on the roof of a building  in a lawn chair with a glass next to him wearing his mask. What is your frog? How do I get the frog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do I get it? I don't even know. What's the weather like? Click the weather little weather icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The weather icon. Where's the weather icon? That's what I do. It's on my front screen.  Mine has the frog up on top of a rock or a hill or whatever. It looks like it's having,  look like it's having lunch in a spot of tea or maybe coffee. It's just a little bit smoky and  hazy. Maybe you could see it. I don't know. Let's see. I don't have a weather. I got it. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have a weather. I have no frog. I've seen that frog on the rocks. Okay. And that was 70. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got a frog on the, on the, on the, on the roof with a drink. Oh, what's your temperature?  73. Where do you get these guys? How do you get, I on the, on the, on the, on the, on, on,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right here. I don't have a pixel launcher. Oh, you don't have a pixel. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but there, because he's got to be special. Leo can't use a different launcher. So I don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that. It was going to be contrarian. What I don't understand is there's no way to get it. Otherwise,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's not like a weather app. No, if you search, if you Google weather,  weather, if you Google weather, then you should get now my frog on the weather is flying a kite  weather. Well, yeah, mine looks different now. Is he flying a kite? What if our frogs are the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mine is, I can't tell what that is. He's on the rooftop somewhere with the,  Oh, that's fine. So I have the rooftop. Yeah, it looks like yours. Okay. So this is a huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  digression, but it was about Google. So that was our only story about Google all day long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't have any weather. Well, you scroll down, Leo. That was it. That was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, here. So here's what you look at me. Look at me. You're getting a different weather. See my

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  weather. Yeah. Cause you have that dark mode. That's why. Well, that's interesting. Look,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can scroll up and up and up, but no weather. It's a different skin. I got some, it's not a  SAM site. It's some, I don't know. It's weird. That's the Google change log.  Okay. I'm going to give you one last chance to pick a story. Well, I have a few, wait a  minute. I got to pick a few. There's a few here. Like the, like it turns out, I didn't know this,  but there is a Scottish Wikipedia. Did you see this? I saw the headline. I didn't get the story.  So apparently this Scottish Wikipedia is being edited, but the problem is it's by a guy who  doesn't speak Scottish. He's some American guy. According to vice, a self-professed Christian,  I N T P furry furry living somewhere in North Carolina. And Leo, Leo, Leo, stop. You got to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  this in the accent. You have to destroy the accent. I thought he was living in 10. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the funny thing is, um, his, his Scottish is about as real as mine is. So here's an example.  He, this is the first article he edited. Um, the human development index. I mean, it's just a simple,  simple thing. I'll just blow it up. Free Wikipedia. The fee book knowledge, the human  development index is a composite statistic or life expectancy, education and income indices  to rank kinderous intake for tears or human development. Oh my God. Apparently is no relation  to anything. Scottish. Uh, apparently though he's not, he's not, he's not doing it for any mean  reason. What he's doing is he'll write the article in English and then look up each word  in a Scottish English dictionary and just stick it in if it kind of sort of matches.  But this is the sad part. He's responsible for one third of the Scott's Wikipedia entries  and probably nobody noticed till now. Well, yeah. Uh, one user wrote, I find it insulting  that you would pass this off as our native language, but you clearly don't speak  again as a native Scott and native speaker. No one uses who uses the site as it isn't even  close to resembling any Scott's language. This is here on a page about the movie million dollar baby.  He wrote this film is a boot and unappreciated boxing  train. Bitcoin is a peer to peer payment system introduced as open source software  in 2009 by developer Satoshi Nakamoto. Um,  Oh, geez. Yeah. There's no indication according to vice that Amaryllis that's this guy's name  Amaryllis Gardner, his handle was attempting to do anything wrong, but their work has been damaging  nonetheless on their talk page. They wrote if I had to do it over, I would have kept to more  cleanup and just keeping the Wiki up and running instead of writing articles, but I meant the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like, it's like those old ladies who try to redo the, you know, the Renaissance painting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. You end up with something. Exactly. Yeah. You get the smush Jesus.  Yeah.  On the Reddit post, it says the damage done by this may be more severe than anyone anticipates.  As a result, quote, this person has possibly done more damage to the Scott's language than  anyone in history because of this cultural vandalism. It's possible. Many people think,  think Scott's is a mangled rendering of English rather than a language of its own.  For which I take some responsibility.  So now they're debating, what do we do if we close it? It will never be reopened.  The guy was just trying to preserve Scottish Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The answer is to solicit more people to get more people to more Scottish people to actually  participate because that's the downside of not having enough participants in an open ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was apparently, he was a teenager when he started doing it. He was  the Redditor who discovered it said, I've been told that there's been harassment going on.  Seems like a nice person who made a mistake when they were a young child, a mistake nobody ever  bothered to correct. It's hardly their fault. They're very passionate and dedicated.  The Scott's language version of Wikipedia is legendarily bad.  Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer, and Christian  philosopher. He was a child prodigy that was educated by his father, a tax collector in  Iran. So I think the kid thought this is how, this is it. This is how they do it.  Can you find some real, real Scottish? Can you find some real Scottish language? Is there  any example of that? They misuse common elements of  Scots that are even regularly found in Scots English like sign and, well yeah,  may old acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind. That's Scots, right? Old langsine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's Scots language and then there's Scottish English.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Once again, where's John McWhorter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's pretty funny. The funniest thing is the kid apparently was sincere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not funny. That's sad. Everybody's being mean to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My fear is that he's a Twit fan. He's probably watching right now and he learned how to speak  Scots from me. It's all me fault. Welcome to Wikipedia. Would you like a scone?  All right. I did kiss the scone, a scoon. I don't know what it's called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wouldn't you have like a bannock, not a scone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd have a bannock. Was Zoom down for your daughter a couple of days ago?  They use Google Meets.  Oh, they use Meets. So I got a call from Lisa. The school called us. They said Zoom's down.  It was.  And the children, they did rejoice according to The Verge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the idea of calling it the new snow day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The new snow day. Well, we really got a snow year is what we got. It was a big outage that covered  much of the United States at the beginning of the school day. So yeah, Zoom days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This was on the 24th at what time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It started at 6 52 a.m. Eastern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there's a hilarious Twitter account called associate deans, ass underscore deans.  That makes fun of all administrators and universities.  And at the same time, it just said, do you have a plan for when Zoom goes down? Correct.  Everyone was retweeting the hell out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Trust us. We're from the middle administration and we're here to help you.  You do have a plan for when Zoom goes down. Correct.  All right. So Charlie.  Boys might be weathering the pandemic better than girls.  Guess which August newspaper printed that headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New York Times, Wall Street Journal, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or yeah, could be the New York Post too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is by somebody named Julie Jargon. Really?  Video game. Oh, I know Julie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She talks to my husband for things.  Well.  And never quotes him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Video game playing his sword during the covid-19 pandemic  fueled largely by boys who socialize while they play.  That's true. I have to say our 17 year old, as soon as school's out,  he sits right down in front of the computer and plays video games with his friends,  with his school friends.  Yeah. Typical day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's socialized.  Plus they're anti-social. They don't want to be around anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're happy. Boys like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speaking of video games, did you see the AI created tennis games?  Federer versus Federer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see it right now.  I didn't see it.  They're Scottish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's pretty fun. It's pretty fun.  So they made little sprites.  And then Federer played himself.  You can they have Federer.  They can put anybody against anybody and it's real players with real shots mixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those are two sprites. Those are not, if you look carefully.  Oh, yeah. They're not really attached to the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Right.  So in fact, and nobody else is moving.  So obviously.  And so where are the sprites generated from real games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they take they take pieces.  Yeah. So it's annotated database of shots.  That's awesome.  Keep going. Now we have Federer v Federer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think we're ever going to really need tennis players ever again.  No, we're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Certainly baseball.  Now you can know Serena Williams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Serena versus Federer.  Yeah, that's cool.  Isn't it?  And then finally, you never see, right?  Yeah, you never see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now you can direct where the shot goes and the AI will do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  It'll actually put it there and then Federer will get it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This becomes a whole new view of a sport game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow. That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that cool?  Yeah.  Will this be the next version of eSports?  That's what I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. But it's going to feel realer because you're going to have real players.  You can do it in baseball because they spend nine hours just standing there.  So that'll be easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they do.  I will say my husband is desperate for eSports.  Madden football is the same concept of figuring out how to control where the ball goes and things like that.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who put this ad in for the IBM Selectric?  Did you put this in?  I did.  I always wanted one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Boy, did I want one of these.  Oh.  Is that Worson Wells?  No.  That is pretty bad.  He's actually those in Austin.  Look at all those balls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wanted the big one that you could do speeches with.  Someday all typewriters will be on the trash heap of history  or in the lobby of the Craig No-Marc Graduate School of Journalism.  Got them there.  I had typewriter fetishist when I was in high school and college.  That was instead of computers and smartphones, that was your tool, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was a good typist.  So I ended up at three in the morning typing papers for other students because I was a schmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did they pay you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man.  I did that in college.  It wasn't for typewriters going to the computer lab, but  none of my football teammates knew how to type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you made money.  I see you're smarter than I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm a socialist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody posted this story about the telegram messenger being used in Belarus  during the protests over the election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so what they said and what's fascinating about it was that at one point in the demonstration,  there's no microphones, there's no power, there's nothing.  But suddenly everybody does the same thing.  They all leave.  They all do this because they're all getting the same messages on telegram.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've seen this before.  We saw it in Hong Kong.  It's really interesting.  And it's very difficult for the authorities to stop.  Yeah, telegram is encrypted.  I actually really like telegram.  It's not as it's not an open source crypto, so it's not necessarily as safe as signals say.  But I like it.  I really like using it.  And you know what?  Obviously this worked because if the Belarus authorities could figure out how to get these  guys, they probably would.  Wow.  Yeah, telegram is really a nice messaging app.  I really like it.  All right.  Let's see.  What?  Who owns it?  So the story is interesting because it was the they called him the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia.  His name was Pavel.  I can't remember his last name.  Durov.  Durov.  That's it.  And he was a Russian national, created telegram, was very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Before that, he created VKontakte.  Which was the actual Facebook of Russia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he had to leave the country because they tried to take it over and they took it over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And well, that's what happened is he didn't want to sell it.  But Putin's government insisted.  And in fact, he was involved in a standoff with police in St. Petersburg.  So he left the country.  He fled Russia.  Yeah.  And after leaving Russia, he got citizenship at St. Kitts in Nevis by donating a quarter  of a million dollars to the Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, if that's all it costs, I'm on my way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Diversifying into extortion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then he formed Telegram, which was originally based in Berlin.  They flirted with a cryptocurrency for a while, which thank goodness they kind of dumped.  The Ton platform.  They raised money from Steve Jobs, widow Laurene Powell Jobs.  Federal courts halted those.  He's self-described as a libertarian and a vegetarian.  But yeah, so he's an interesting fella.  It's an interesting story.  Yes, he's very interesting.  I don't know if I fully trust it or not.  I really don't.  But it is a great messaging platform.  If he used an open source, well-known messaging algorithm, I'd jump on it in a heartbeat  because I really like it.  But I just don't know if I can trust it.  Not that anything I'm messaging is anything important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you don't trust anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I trust you, Jeff Jarvis.  Napster has been acquired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What?  Remember Napster?  Are you guys old enough to remember Napster?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, we're old enough to remember Napster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just barely, though.  70 million dollars.  Napster was owned most recently by Real Networks.  Did you know that?  I did know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you old enough to know that everybody hated Real Networks?  Everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Real player.  Yeah, real player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the beginning of the DRM dramas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Actually, Rob Glazier was a classmate at Yale and I've served on some committees with him.  He's a nice guy.  I like him a lot.  He said the company was grateful for the hard work by the entire Napster team  to keep the torch alive all these years.  Sold it for surprisingly a lot of money.  70 million dollars to a VR experience company, Melody VR.  It was 44 million dollars in debt, mostly in music industry companies,  and they're going to use Napster to establish, quote,  an entertainment platform that spans immersive live performances  and recording music streaming.  I like it that people are still coming up with ideas,  trying to do something different.  Now's the time.  Yeah, this is the time to do concerts you don't have to go to.  Things like that.  Concerts you don't have to go to.  Coming up next, get them ready.  It's time for your picks of the week.  Let's start those picks of the week with Stacy Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it time?  Yep.  Oh, okay.  I was like, I was not prepared for this.  Yes, you are.  You have a good pick.  Is an app.  I actually wrote about it last week in the newsletter,  so this may be not news to everyone, but it's a good app.  It's called S'mores Up.  It is a chore app, and I wrote about it because they connected it to Bosch dishwashers.  So if you're connected dishwasher, if you have this app and a connected dishwasher,  your dishwasher can actually, when it's done working,  it will assign the chore to whichever kid does your dishes.  Time to empty the dishwasher.  But even if you don't have any of those things,  because that's probably like 10 people,  it's actually really handy for, especially in the pandemic,  I feel like I'm constantly just telling my child, be here, do this.  Did you do this?  There's a lot more nagging.  You don't want to be a nag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not necessarily nagging.  It's just these things need to be done.  Mommy.  Or parenting.  Yes.  As we call it.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm just speaking to a mom.  Yes.  True.  True.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this app actually takes some of that off your plate and it helps incentivize kids.  If your kid, my kid is not super money motivated, but you give,  you can assign chores token values and they get enough tokens.  They could save some of it.  They can apply it towards things.  It's a nice app and there's like calendaring features.  I think if you have more kids, it's probably more useful because I don't know.  My brother and I used to have these complicated monopoly style negotiations over who did what  chore on what day.  I would trade two dishwasher unloadings for one folding the laundry.  Farter.  All of this happens in the app and you don't have to mediate it or deal with it unless  it doesn't get done.  And then the app's like, yo, this didn't happen.  You can set times for something to have happened to buy and it'll be like, hey, it's four o'clock.  No one walked the dog.  This is cool.  And yeah, so I'm going to make this my app cap on iOS today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think because I don't have any occasion to use it.  Actually, Lisa probably would like to use it with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could actually do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could see that.  I can totally see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do it for yourself if you wanted to.  I mean, like I just got a chore reminder.  Take chore, chore, take pet for a walk assigned to, oh, it's assigned to me, but it is my job.  That's fair.  Afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This way it's fair, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  75 days or 750 chores free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the free version is actually quite nice.  I will say you might want the premium version if you have a larger family.  And I talked to the founders and they are not taking data on your child.  They're not pulling any personally identifiable data on any of this.  I actually told them I, as a parent, would be interested in like aggregate data on like  what age do kids start making their bed every day?  That'd be kind of fun, but they don't do any of that.  Yeah.  Oh.  I just, you know, you know how parents love to like benchmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are my kids normal?  Exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or more like, is it crazy that I expect my child to do this at the age of 14?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like this s'mores up.  S-M-O-R-E-S-U-P dot com Android, iOS and Amazon.  You can put it on your fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff, do you have a number?  So a wonderful tweet I just saw when we were on the air.  Hey guys, want to feel old?  I'm 40.  You're welcome.  Signed, McCauley Culkin.  Oh my God.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The child star of Home Alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's 40.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have another one if you want.  Sure.  This is a couple days ago.  So it's even more so now.  I didn't realize this.  The top five companies, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, five largest publicly  traded companies in America rose 37% in the first seven months of this year.  Guess why?  Because we need them.  While other stocks fell on the S&P 500 fell combined 6%.  I think I mentioned this last week.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, thanks to McCauley Culkin.  Here's a picture of him then and now.  Actually, McCauley with Donald Trump in Home Alone.  I think it was in the second one, right?  Where he goes to New York City.  I think it's in the second.  Yeah.  This is the part they edited out in the Canadian version.  And now here is what McCauley Culkin looks like today with Donald Trump.  So there's really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For those of you listening...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's Boris Johnson.  And I shouldn't get credit for that.  That's a tweet from Juan Darnayuk.  Juan AD on Twitter.  That's a very clever response to McCauley Culkin.  Funny.  Yeah.  Tech is a huge part of this so-called...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't realize it was 20% of the total value of the market now.  Yeah.  Big tech.  That's what was new to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why you got to...  It's a challenge to regulate them because they are a driver,  especially because of COVID.  They're a driver of the economy right now.  We don't...  Audible has been a sponsor off and on for years.  I think we were one of the very first podcasts that they advertised on.  They don't have an ad on our network.  They haven't had one in a couple of years, but I still want to give them a plug.  Ungrateful louts.  Ungrateful louts.  We put them on the map.  Amazon bought pretty much every advertiser we ever had, including this one.  But they have come up with a new membership plan, which I thought was kind of interesting.  They call it the Audible Plus catalog.  It's a limited catalog of about 11,000 books, and a lot of them read by famous people.  I think this is an interesting...  It's really good.  Last night, I was reading for a new book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Both of you talked to...  Go ahead, Jeff.  And then Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacy, go.  Last night, I was doing it, and I saw that this was there.  You have unlimited books.  Pick one.  The first one was the French Revolution, which I want to know more about.  I hit it, and I started listening to it.  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to be a subscriber, but I think you can do it for eight bucks a month, I think.  And there's two levels now.  This is the higher level.  Okay.  Because I am a subscriber anyway, and so I got this as part of my membership, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I saw this new notification, but I didn't have time to dig into it to see what it was all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Audible Premium Plus.  You can listen to all you want of the Plus catalog on top of the credits you get as  your membership.  This is part of their plan to add podcasts.  By the way, podcasts will be a part of this as well as audiobooks and originals.  My understanding, though, that these are ad-free podcasts, so I don't think we'd  be in their catalog, unfortunately.  Well, maybe we will if things get any worse.  But for now, I'm trying to make it without them.  They're doing a lot of audible originals.  Yeah.  It's kind of unclear.  Is that a podcast?  What is that?  Yeah.  But they also, I think they've started to open up their catalog to podcasters as well,  which is interesting.  Absolutely.  Stacey, what were you going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was just going to say they have a similar Kindle something for reading.  Yeah, it's like Kindle Unlimited.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And frankly, I appreciate it because I get tired.  My eyes get tired.  I like to listen these days more than I like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I cannot handle listening to books.  I tried it.  I was trying so hard, but nope, it's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're striving too much.  You got to stop.  Sit back, start enjoying.  Stop striving, Stacey.  What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you listening while you do something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Washing the dishes, cooking, walking.  I can't do it while I'm reading newspaper articles or something.  Yeah, and I don't commute anymore.  So yeah, I used to get two or three hours a day listening, which was really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what's a pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give us a pick.  For me, there's two picks.  Today as of recording this, DJI released a new smartphone gimbal that's not much to  talk about except for the fact that they're making it a little bit easier to use.  I like the Osmo.  It already holds down and pretty portable.  But now you get this little magnetic clip that you can just magnetically connect your  phone to it instead of having to battle with clamps and arms and hooks and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Magnets are so cool.  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's a pretty good price at 150 bucks.  I have two smartphone gimbals here, so I doubt I'll buy it.  But I thought it was worth mentioning for people that are trying to  start creating stuff while they're at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've had a couple of Osmos and they do an amazing job.  They're very smooth.  They're really kind of incredible.  The problem with gimbals is balancing.  And so if you have a magnet, I wonder how well it must be auto-balancing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got to do something because I'm with you as far as balancing those things.  It could be quite a task.  It used to be a big deal.  I've used external mics on my phone, so I had to buy a counterweight to put on there.  And that just made it even more challenging.  I eventually got it to work.  But it's still a bit of a pain in the butt to get started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe I'll order this one.  You like the Jiyun as well, right?  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  You can read all about it at antpruitt.com.  It's a post on his most recent blog post.  The DJ on the Osmo Mobile 4.  And you're on a podcast, I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  That's my second pick.  I've been on a couple podcasts here recently.  And I said I'd like to share them out.  This one was really fun.  It was on He Shoots, He Draws with Dave Clayton and Alan Hess.  Alan Hess is a big Twit fan, big Security Now fans know all about you, Mr. LaPorte.  Knows all about you.  But he loves you.  And they allowed me to just chit chat about Twit and the things that I do.  And it went a little bit longer than most of their episodes.  And I really appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're catching.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I felt honored to be on it and felt honored to be able to just share my philosophy on how  I do things and why I do things the way I do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I have met, I feel like I've met Alan Hess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he loves Leo LaPorte.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think he's come to visit us because he's a great concert photographer.  So I feel like maybe I just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Concert photographer and Comic-Con.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Nice stuff.  Great fun.  Good.  We'll have to listen to that.  Can't wait to hear you malign me.  I have to listen to all these to make sure that people are being nice.  He shoots, He Draws podcast featuring Ant Pruitt, the 17th of August edition.  Karsten's Mask of the Week is wild.  It's the Air Solo Antimicrobial Irradiation Respirator.  A little expensive at $120.  Shipping begins this month.  It's worn under your face mask and uses a patent pending system to neutralize harmful  contaminants trapped in your cloth mask.  It's an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I say it has, it has UVC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  UVC, LED emitters.  Wow.  Yes.  We're, John and I are getting our Kickstarter pretty soon.  Right, John?  A hundred dollar, right, John?  A hundred dollar Kickstarter.  And then he also recommends that you stay safe with this alien facehugger mask.  Oh my God, do not.  That's terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, that's got Karsten Bondi written all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you've ever played, what is that game that the facehugger comes and gets you?  Oh man, it's terrifying.  Well, this is from, this is from Alien, but there, it reminds me of that other game,  Half-Life, where they, the facehuggers.  Oh yeah, Half-Life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Half-Life come after you.  But this is the Alien facehugger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  He's sold out currently, but he's going to be making more.  He makes these by hand on his Etsy shop, but he has other nice leather.  Stuff as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, facehugger mask sold out because who wouldn't want a disgusting alien on your  face as you walk around town?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who wouldn't want that?  Karsten will appreciate the McSweeney's article from earlier this month.  The corporation from Alien shares its reopening plan.  It is quite hilarious.  Karsten, you should read it here.  I'll stick it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love McSweeney's.  They're doing some great humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I subscribe to the quarterly concern.  It's really a print.  Right, but they now have an internet thing that they do also.  Yes, yes.  Their internet tendency is their humor.  Internet tendency, that's it.  They have their fake stuff.  But here, like, I think, oh, it's way up there.  I'm attached to my computer.  I can't get it.  But it's up on that bookshelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice.  McSweeney's.net.  Ladies and gentlemen, have we completed every portion of our allotted task?  I think we have.  This is the time we say goodbye to all our family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we saw the Kentucky Attorney General on the Republican National Convention yesterday.  Who mentioned Breonna Taylor.  Without mentioning that he declined to prosecute her murderers.
