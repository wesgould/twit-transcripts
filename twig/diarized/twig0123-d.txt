This Week in Google, the show that focuses on Google, but not just Google, the cloud,  Facebook, Twitter and today a little bit of Spotify too.  To my left, Gina Tripani from SmarterWear.org, founder of Lifehacker.  She's also responsible for ThinkUp app.  ThinkUp app.com.  Hey Gina.  How's it going?  It's good.  Are you in a new office or you just, we're a different angle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I rearranged a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You moved the bikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I moved the bikes and you can see my twit Fez is in, is like in the far corner there.  So I had to get that in the shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're trying to figure out, we were going to, I, yeah, we were going to, I'm actually  very disappointed.  We wanted to, we sent all the hosts, including Jeff and Gina, Fezes last year for Christmas  and we wanted to send you something equally exciting.  So we were going to get lab monogrammed lab coats.  There was a Gina Tripani this week in Google and have the twit logo.  But then first of all, they can't get them until after January.  And second of all, it's like, I know it will spend a lot of money on these and you'll  just put them in the closet.  Nobody's going to wear a lab coat with their name and a twit logo on it.  That's impractical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're going to wear my Fez every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You look good in a Fez though.  You should consider it.  Next time you go to Turkey.  Oh no, you can't wear it in Turkey.  Ataturk made that impossible.  Hey, on our far left here, Jeff Jarvis, who's visiting us from Blermany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to.  Which explains the look.  He's actually in a...  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you want to...  No, no, you're fine.  Don't worry about it.  We love you.  What are you doing in Germany?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was speaking at an event today by the, about the internet and all that.  And then I had dinner tonight with the world party about the internet and all that.  So that's why I wore the tie because my mother insisted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's had a very fancy meal with like, with interior, what, secretaries, ministers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Four members of parliament and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff it's not going to work.  We're going to have to let you go.  I'm glad we could see you.  And I'm glad how you look so good, but he's still answering the last question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's in another time zone.  I know.  He's in the Skype zone.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you want to try me on the only link?  I think we're just going to let you go.  Look, in fact, we didn't even have to.  It happened all by itself.  That's all right.  We're going to bring in somebody in that slot.  No problem.  We've got somebody exciting to join us in a bit, but let's say hi.  First of all, to the here suit, Mr. Movember, the last day.  Why did you choose that particular look, Mr. Matt Cutts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they call it the trucker, you know, and I could have gone for the whole  Kogan if I'd gotten just a little more off.  But this was easy.  And I've noticed people are very quick to get out of my way at the airport so I can  really make fast progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Movember is a yearly event now, which has become quite popular, started by some Aussies,  I believe.  It was to raise money and raise awareness of prostate cancer, I think.  Right?  Yeah.  Men's health issues in general.  Actually, Jeff, who is a prostate cancer survivor, would be a good person to have on here, but  unfortunately he's gone.  He's always had a Movember all year round.  Are you going to keep yours?  This is the last day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's probably my last day.  My wife is a little anxious to get rid of it.  You know, unless someone wants to start donating for me to keep it, I'll probably start shaving  it off.  Do you raise money by doing this?  Yeah.  In fact, on my lower third, I did a little thing where if you go to bit.ly slash twigmat,  you can donate to my team.  You've got a Microsoft versus Google competition going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's going to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's quite a few people now who will rush over there.  And I didn't say who, but you pick the one you like best.  I think this is great.  US.Movember.com is the site for the USMovember.com worldwide.  It is the last day, but next year you could do it.  I did it last year.  I started it.  I couldn't do it.  It was just too scratchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My dad wrote after four days and said, I remember why I don't grow a mustache now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He totally village-peopled it.  He is village-peopled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our small children like, daddy, a strange man tried to talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not too much, but my cat loves it because she thinks I'm another cat now so I can rub  up against her and everything's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, that sounds like Jeff.  Are we going to be on phone with you, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still on an audio.  If this works, I'll stay on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This works fine.  This works much better.  Thank you.  It does mean that we have room in the third spot for Dylan.  Thank you for doing that.  Dylan Combs is with Google.  He is...  Say again?  Casey, I'm sorry.  Dylan Combs is somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said I'd give up my face for Dylan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  You talk Dylan when Jeff talks and we'll think it's him.  Dylan Casey is a product manager at Google who is doing God's work.  He's replacing the Google bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've replaced the black navigation bar with the new Google bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now I still have.  I'm looking at my Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  Well, it's going to take us a little while to roll it out, but if you look at the Google  blog post that went up yesterday, you'll get some screenshots and see the actual video  that will show you what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was this in response to something or just what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is just the next step in a series of steps that we've been taking most recently  to really clean up the overall user experience across Google.  The significance of the Google bar is that it really glues together all of the different  products that users are already using and cleans up the interface and really makes it  a more seamless experience.  The goal is really to make Google one experience as opposed to a whole bunch of siloed experiences.  The goal here is that the Google bar is going to really enable easier navigation and just  kind of help the user understand what it is to use Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the bar that we're all familiar with right now.  Actually, I don't mind it.  I like the integration.  I like the fact that it goes across Google products and I have direct access to my Google  Plus and Gmail.  Of course, it encourages people to live in the Google ecosystem.  You did maybe one big fix already, which is to change the notification.  For those of us who get a lot of notifications from 9 Plus to whatever the actual number  is.  Now, we're going to get a...  Oh, look at this.  All the apps will be under the Google logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're calling it the Google menu, which is essentially showing you all of the apps that  you can access.  Like I said, making it easier to access the products that are important to the user.  We also gained a little bit of screen real estate by eliminating the black Google navigation  bar at the top.  Interesting.  It's going to have a more seamless look across all of the different Google properties, which  is something that we've always struggled with as we develop and launch new products.  Were there complaints about the Google bar?  No.  It's not like everybody was complaining and we said, oh, we need to make some big fixes.  This is really just part of a long-term vision and how the overall experience is just evolving.  This is just the next step in that process.  What we do is we pay particular attention to feedback from users, both internally and  externally.  We do lots of usability tests.  We try to really understand what works and what doesn't work.  We essentially take all of that information and put it together as part of the development  process to continue to push the envelope in terms of how we develop the products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did just roll out the black bar a couple of months ago when you rolled out Google+.  The presumption is somebody at that point thought this was the way to do it and now  you're doing it differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We release often and early and we iterate quickly.  That's the mantra of Google.  This is just an illustration of that process in effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's fair.  It's not a bad thing to back off on it.  I did wear my black shirt in honor of the black bar, which is gone.  I'm sorry, Gina, you wanted to ask something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a question.  When you roll over the logo, the menu reveals itself, so you don't have to actually click  to see the menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can click on it or roll over it and it will open.  We basically have two ways to activate the Google menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What struck me about it when I first saw it was, wow, this thing is tall compared to the  thin black strip across the top.  The Google bar looks taller and that's because the Google search box is in it, which isn't  the black bar and the Google logo.  Then I watched the video and seeing if you switch between Google products now, there's  a search box and a Google logo at the top of the page anyway.  If you compare it from that gray area up, the new Google bar is actually shorter.  If you compare it to the black bar, it's much taller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  We've actually moved the search box from the property or the product and moved it up into  the Google bar, allowing more real estate for the product itself.  For example, if you're in email or if you're in calendar, you're going to see more of that  specific product and it's going to be taken up by less of the Google navigation bar that  we had previously there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the process in this kind of stuff?  Does Google do focus groups?  How do you test this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We just normally look for random people walking by campus and we pull them in and we feed  them some food and we put toothpicks in their eyeballs and stuff like that.  Seriously.  It's an art form and it's a scientific approach.  I think Google is well known for having this process where we launch products internally  to all the Google employees and force them to use the products.  Eat your dog food.  Eat your own dog food.  That's right.  This is really a great way to get honest, clear, and passionate feedback.  Oftentimes we'll bring in groups.  We'll do usability studies.  We're very focused on metrics.  We track all the clicks and try to understand if we're creating any types of cognitive or  dissonance for the user as they open a page.  Do they sit there and just stare at it?  There's a lot of different things that we apply in a very iterative process.  It's a little bit madness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still don't have it so I'm working blind here.  I've looked at the blog post of course but I'm not sure exactly how this is going to  change for me.  How is this going to roll out?  Is everybody going to have it by a certain date?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're rolling it out slowly.  It's just part of our launch process but we hope that everybody should have it by next  week.  Is it customizable?  No, so right now it's a fixed set of Google properties and we're going to roll it out  to English only across all of our domains and then quickly add languages after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still want to get a sense here of what was the process that said, hey everybody, a black  bar is a great idea and then as Gina says, only a short time later, you know, the black  bar.  Was there complaints?  What was the internal process?  Was it Eric's gone and Larry's in charge?  I know you can't fully answer but give us some signal here of how this process happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think over the last 6 to 12 months we've been in a pretty significant moment  in the evolution of Google as both a product and a company.  Absolutely the case.  I think we've become really focused and part of the leadership that Larry has brought to  Google is really helping us be very mindful about how we build the user experience and  I think what you're seeing is the illustration of that leadership from Larry and of course  a whole lot of people.  It's really, I can't say that there was this very defining moment or like, oh my god, everybody  realized that they hate the black sand bar or users hated the black sand bar.  It's really just this natural, very organic process by which we make changes.  And I think what you're starting to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So as they say on Family Feud, good answer, good answer.  I'm still going to hear, is there some kind of principle that then came out, hey everybody,  here's the new rule and let's make the bar fit that new rule.  What's that new rule?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No there's no new rule.  I think what you can see is that the overall design across Google is becoming more...  Unified.  Unified, yeah exactly, thank you.  Got it, okay.  And the Google bar itself is just a step in that overall process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now we've seen this before, other companies have done this before, DigBar, remember?  And sometimes people push back against something like that.  They say I don't want this UI thing in every page of mine taking up space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one thing to remember is that the DigBar would show that as you would go out to external  places on the web.  What I personally really like about the Google bar is you can tell from the video when you  click from property to property, you get a very consistent sort of experience.  You know where the search box is going to be, your mental model actually gets easier  as you adjust.  I agree with you on that, that's good.  Yeah and if you can move the search box up, everything on the Google page has to fight  for its real estate in terms of being useful.  And so trying to get back a little bit of that screen real estate is also really, really  helpful because that leaves more room for your doc or your search session or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did say in your blog post, by the way, congratulations, you mentioned this on Google  Plus, Dylan, that Larry Page blogged it, which must feel good when the boss blogs it.  But you did say in your Google Plus and your original blog post that this has been a year  in the making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's probably for me personally, I've been involved in this project to various degrees  for over a year.  And so it was nice to kind of have that all come to a very specific crescendo with the  launch of the Google bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was the mandate a year ago when you started this project?  What were you told, this is what we want to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I wasn't totally focused on just this one project.  I had previously worked very closely with the search team and on the search team in  building Google's real time search.  We love that by the way.  Great job on that.  Thank you.  And as we started to think about what the future was going to hold and the Google Plus  project started to come to fruition, the teams and various people were starting to participate  in that process.  And the Google bar really is a product that has existed for quite a while, if you recall  many years ago, and I'm sure Matt has better details than I do around this, but we used  to have tabs across the top of the search box.  And then eventually we put that into a clear bar across the top.  And I can't even remember what we called it at the time.  But that was really where we first started to try to figure out a way to help users navigate  across Google and how to access products and how to find the other things just beyond search.  So I think that the Google bar has been in existence for much longer than the year that  I referenced as being a participant in.  So it's been a really interesting experience to see how it's evolved from just a couple  of links to something that's really dynamic and is going to create this kind of consistent  user experience across all of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dylan, does the web interface design group talk with the Android design group?  And I ask only because I know that in Ice Cream Sandwich the menu button is getting  deprecated in favor of drop-down menus that are contextual kind of in the action bar.  So is that purposeful?  Do the web interface folks talk with the Android folks?  Or are they just two different things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know specifically if there's any correlation between those two things.  But I wouldn't say that it's impossible that that isn't happening.  I'm sure that there's some sort of conversation happening between groups.  But yeah, I can't comment specifically on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The new maps for Android does it too, right?  6.0 has the menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has the menu at the top where you can tap.  Yeah, and I went to an Ice Cream Sandwich developer session and they said,  you know, don't use the menu button.  You know, use the action bar menus.  And it's a drop-down menu, similarly.  A few people I saw on Twitter had commented that the new Google bar menu drop-down,  because you can nest sub-menus within it, it looks a lot like the Windows start menu just,  you know, upside down, which I don't know if that was purposeful  or if that's even one comparison you want to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's only so many ways you can do menus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  OK.  But there's lots of room to add.  I mean, it's future proof, right?  Like part of the idea was to make it so that Google launches new products.  You can add it to this menu without taking up real estate right from other things on the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dylan, I know you can't stay with us much longer,  but so I really want to thank you for being here.  There must be a...  You know, even one pixel change on Google's pages is...  We're talking massive numbers of hits, massive amounts of downloads.  There must... Do you feel a sense of a little pressure?  I mean, this is unlike any other web page.  When you change this web page, you're changing the experience of billions of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was thinking about that last night, you know,  when I was leaving the office with a couple of my peers  and thinking of all of the product launches that I've been involved with at Google over the last eight years  and, you know, doing some back-of-the-envelope math,  the Google bar is probably the largest launch that I've done  in terms of the number of people that will see it and interact with it.  And so it is pretty rewarding.  And, you know, I think we take it for granted that, you know,  we have the honor and the fortune to work at a company and on a product  that really touches the lives of billions of people.  And it's a pretty incredible and rewarding experience.  And, you know, the best thing that we can do, I think our objective is to always do something  that really helps other people and helps users.  And, you know, if we're able to do that, and for a couple of people or for a billion,  that's pretty rewarding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, Dylan. We appreciate your time.  Thank you.  Dylan Casey, who is on Google+, of course, you can follow him there.  He's a product manager at Google and responsible for the change in the Google toolbar  at the top of all of Google's pages.  Thank you, Dylan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  Take care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was great to have somebody from Google come in on a new product like that  or a change not like that on the news of the week.  So good on you, Google.  Besides Matt, we always love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, there are very few companies that would do that.  I think it's really great.  Yeah.  And face the music as it were.  Hope the music wasn't too tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they've worked really hard.  I mean, it'll be really nice to have it be streamlined and consistent across a lot of these different properties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the process is fascinating.  It's just really interesting to imagine reconceptualizing this.  And I do, I respect Google, given this very difficult position.  There's so many companies that would this kind of iteration would not happen at this speed.  It just it just wouldn't happen.  I think Larry helps with that, I think.  Yeah, that's great.  And I'm sure it's a little bit of a roller coaster.  Do you get to rest now, Dylan, or what's your next project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we do not get to rest.  I make very clear.  Did you hear that, Larry?  He's not resting.  I'm not resting.  We have we have a lot of things that we want to get out very quickly.  You know, part of the challenge around launching software at this scale is that you never get  to get every feature that you want into the release.  So or that your users want.  Yeah, our users want.  So we're already planning some pretty significant releases and we have a lot of work ahead of  us.  So we might sleep a little over the weekend and that's about it.  Thank you, Dylan.  We'll let you sleep now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, thank you.  Take care, Dylan Casey.  We really appreciate you joining us.  Matt Cutts is also here and he must be, you know, Matt's an early Google employee.  You were in the first 100.  Yeah.  So you've watched this process over a decade almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost like punctuated equilibrium or evolution, you know, where sometimes you'll  be moving really, really fast.  And then sometimes you just really need to iterate and work on the polish and get the  last little pixels, you know, where it's really smooth.  So, you know, there's always some growing pains, people that want to move faster, some  people that want to move slower.  But it is pretty wild to watch how the UI people can iterate really quickly when it's called  for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, you may have a hard time talking about this and you don't have to answer if  you don't want to.  But it sounds like it seems like things have changed a lot with Larry at the helm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, he brings a really nice level of focus.  Larry's been very clear about some of the stuff that he believes in and trying to make  sure that that we follow down the right path.  And there were a lot of stuff that we were developing where, at least at the Google scale,  it wasn't getting as much traction or it wasn't going to be as good of a match.  Like, I love Google Health, for example, I send my wife we things and my fit.  Sad about that.  Yep.  But but at the same time, you know, if you want to really focus on a small number of  things and do them really, really well, then you have to make some tough decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, what's kind of fascinating about that is you would think from a distance that  Eric would have been the one to say, no, no, no, no, that's stupid.  I'll stop that.  And Larry would have been the one to say, well, I like this project.  And it's really interesting to me that Larry is part of it.  It's not just Eric. It's the triumvirate.  But but that Larry is bringing this laser focus.  And I find that fascinating that he in fact is proving to be a mature manager.  You don't have to say anything to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it's really helpful because Larry's been in the room.  You know, he's he's gotten to see all the great stuff that Eric's done over the many  years. And Eric has been a fantastic CEO.  And so that leaves Larry having seen all of the stuff that Eric has done.  And yet also he can bring his own, you know,  particular way of doing things and the things that he really cares about and make  sure that those get addressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that it's a sign of maturity as well.  And they say that Steve Jobs kind of mentored in some ways Larry Page.  And that was one of the things Jobs was really good at is laser focus.  He came back to Apple and killed a lot of projects.  And I wonder if this is a sign of maturity on Larry's part.  As much as Larry would love how these hobby projects, the green initiatives, I  know that that was something Larry and Sergey loved.  I'm sure Google Health. Same thing.  There is a maturity in a manager who says, you know, we love all this.  Sometimes you have to kill your children and focus on a few a handful of good  things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From what I can tell Larry is the quintessential engineer or nerd and that,  you know, inefficiency and waste, you know, is just, you know,  so bothersome to him. So I think, you know, for probably for him, I don't know,  I'm just totally speculating,  but I imagine starting a small company like Google having such success and  growing so monstrously big and then, you know, coming to the helm,  it's got to be really satisfying for him to say,  this is what we're going to do and we're going to trim all the fat and we're  going to focus and, and we're going to make this product better. It just,  it makes a lot of sense. I think it's great that he's doing it.  And I liked,  I liked the way that it's manifesting itself just in the little interface  changes. And, and, and I think that the, this,  the fall clean out or the spring cleaning has also been really satisfying.  I mean, there have been a couple of products I've been a little sad about  wave.  For the most part. Well, well, yeah, that was another story,  but for the most part they've been really, it seems like,  it seems like things are going, going really well. So good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and it's also very interesting.  Now we'll talk at a larger level,  uh, Google, which had a disparate number of products that were all over the  place. There weren't, there weren't really linked together necessarily.  It looked like a company that had a lot of brilliant people all working somewhat  in different directions given, given, you know,  given full authority to do that.  And there has been a tightening of the reins, not merely killing products,  but also attempting to create an ecosystem. And that's the thing.  I think the toolbar is the most interesting,  the most interesting part of the toolbar is it's a really, uh, again,  the analogy to Apple and the Apple control of the entire ecosystem. Uh,  it seems to me, um, for better or for worse,  Google has decided we're going to create a unified ecosystem  and keep trying to keep people in it. And you,  and you almost have to do that when you look at Facebook, uh, you know,  the competition, which is doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And isn't there a danger there, Leo? Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Well, I think we also acknowledge we come from the open web and we do best if  the web does well, you know, some of these conversations about SOPA and related  things, you know, it's, it's important that the web do well. And, uh,  and so things like data liberation, Android being open source,  Chrome being open source, I think in some sense,  you don't want to completely closed ecosystem. And I think Google knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be nice to get the best of both worlds. Yeah.  I would love to see that. We were talking on the show before this, uh,  Steve gets talking about Mozilla's browser ID initiative. Um, and, uh,  and it's a single sign on some kind of like open ID. And, uh, uh,  while it's great to have a lot of different things,  this is an example of you would like a single single sign on for everybody.  Just let's all have one. Let's figure out which one we want.  And sometimes the market's not the best choice. I mean,  Facebook connect is winning in the marketplace,  but it isn't the best choice for all of us. Um, and, and,  and even if Google did something, uh, there'd be some concern that, well,  we don't want Google or Microsoft or Facebook to own this. It should be open.  And so it's a nice, if you can get the balance of, Hey,  we do need to create a product that is unit that everybody can use.  It's unified. There's some consistent UI for instance,  and still kind of keep it. Keep it. So there's not locked.  Lock in is the word I don't like. And that's the Apple word. We want lock in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But right.  Large extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say again, uh, Gina first and then Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I and if Apple and Facebook,  this is why I have sort of this lurking distrust, right? I mean,  I mean Google has sold me that they're, that they're making, you know,  Google's making a platform on top of the web, but there,  but there's a commitment to openness and elsewhere.  There's lots of debates about what that all means,  but that's why I feel more comfortable signing in with my Google account than I  do connect to my Facebook account. So anyway, go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I agree with both of you on that. I,  I fear there could be a little danger in the more unified Google becomes,  the more Google's enemies say, see, they do everything. And,  and the argument has always been that there's an alternative for everything.  And every one of those things that Google does,  and I'm a little hypersensitive because I'm in Germany right now where people  tend to go a little.  It's the land, the land of the sea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. They're the ones waiting to pass. I'll give you an example.  Google's front page today, which by the way, I love the Tom Sawyer.  That is just awesome. I guess it's, what is it? Mark Twain's birthday or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anyway, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this, and this is something that you'll get,  I'm sure some pushback on right at the bottom and add in effect new Google maps  indoors, interactive start gear.  And Google's using the most popular front page on the web to  promote a Google product. I don't see a cool Google product. Yeah.  I don't see a problem with that. And yet I, yeah.  How about Germany?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the problem there is you can't win.  Google can't win because it's anti, I'll be too strong and I'll get arrested  tomorrow. It's, it's anti-capitalistic and anti-American.  It's anti-corporate.  Yes. And a corporate better, better said, Leo, better said.  And so to that extent, you can't win.  You might as well just do what you're going to do. And if you try to,  it's like the complaint I have with Google is trying to be nice to newspapers.  You can't win. So don't cry.  They're never going to love you. Yeah.  No, but, but I do think that it's a challenge for Google.  The more unified it becomes, the better the experience becomes,  but the more monolithic it seems.  And so some variation in the voice, the, the, the,  the voice of Google is not a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good point. Just to put people at ease.  Yeah.  By the way, this is not the new Google front page.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it ought to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For those of you listening at home, you'll just have to imagine.  We're going to take a break. Matt cuts is here. It's great to have Matt,  Gina Trapani and from Germany and we've got them via audio and you sound great.  I'm really glad we could do this. Jeff Jarvis.  We do not want to lose our Jarvis fix for the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never want to miss twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's my favorite part of the week.  And you're staying up late to do it. So it went well. You're,  you're breaking up. So let's say again, what you were doing.  You had dinner with ministers and I mean,  big shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had, I talked to a, a, a group today of basically from the  conservative party about the internet and freedom and publicness and all that.  And then I had dinner tonight with the liberal party people,  four members of parliament, which is kind of a,  that this strange American comes here and I get to do that. But, but,  but it was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Liberal and conservative in Germany don't mean the same thing they mean in the  U S I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, they all hate us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We want to take a break. Come back. We'll talk more about,  I want to talk about this Spotify announcement.  I think this is very interesting, but before we do,  let's talk a little bit about Ford. Also a great interest of mine. I, you know,  I was never a car guy, but when I got that 2010 Ford Mustang,  I kind of fell in love with it. It's a great car to drive.  I love the, you know, the pep, the muscle car thing, but it's funny,  because for all the muscle, all of the, you know,  kind of toughness of the, of the Mustang,  I've got this great super high tech Ford sink. And you know,  I've talked about it like crazy. I love it. I mean,  this is Siri two years ago where you talk to the car, you say,  what song you want to hear, who you want to call, you know,  what temperature should be, where's the nearest gas station.  But I always forget this is also GPS and it's the best GPS you can get.  Now, if you have the sink, their sink will just talk to you.  You don't have the big console. You, it'll just tell you where to go.  But if you have sync with my Ford touch,  where you get the seven inch screen in the center console,  two screens behind the steering wheel.  Whole idea for all of this is keep your hands on the wheel, your eyes on the road,  your driving safety is job one, but you still get things like,  you know, Pandora play my Rolling Stones station by talking to the car.  And with the, with the GPS, you know, one of the things is kind of a,  a little thing that bugs me about GPS is the points of interest database is  usually so bad. You always end up entering the address and that means I have to look at it.  It's just a pain.  They have now in the, in the Ford sync with my Ford touch, 40 million businesses,  they're all in there. They've really enhanced the database, not just directions,  but also phone numbers. You press a button,  make a call by business name to 40 million businesses in the U S you can also,  if you're on the desktop or your laptop, you can go to Google maps,  MapQuest does anybody still use MapQuest Google maps and you can say,  send this address to my car. And, and so you,  you could plan an elaborate trip with lots of stops.  You don't have to enter it on the car GPS.  You just send it to the car from your computer.  It's little things like that that just make a huge difference.  It connects you to the 21st century. Great vehicles, the great EcoBoost engines,  the high hybrid engines, the electric vehicle. I think I'm crossing my fingers.  I think Scott Moniot Ford just told me that he's going to put me on the, uh,  early influencers list for the electric focus. I cannot. I'm so excited.  If you want to try this though, the 2012 Ford focus,  a great way to take a look at what they've done with sync and my Ford touch and  all the great Ford technologies drive one today at a Ford dealer near you or go  to ford.com slash technology.  And you could see this great website where they've got all this great stuff that  they've been working on. Really a cool car company. We're going to see him at CES.  They have a big booth. They're going to have the 2012 focus there. We can,  we can show how that works and all that stuff. Ford.com slash technology.  We're talking about this week in Google with Gina Tripani, Jeff Jarvis,  and joining us Matt cuts who I, you know,  I never really give you the right introduction,  but I just figured everybody knows who Matt cuts is.  He is the guy who keeps spam off your search results among other things.  He's fighting the good fight for all of us. Were you, did you,  were you involved with SOPA, the fight against SOPA at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just as a personal person who thinks it's a really bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was your blog post that brought it to my attention, frankly. Oh good. Yeah.  Yeah. And it was cause of you that I put the censored thing on my website.  You know, speaking of censoring there, and this must drive you crazy. There's,  the SOPA thing and the IP protect, we're censoring by modifying DNS,  breaking DNS in effect.  A us judge has just ordered hundreds of sites,  de-indexed from Google.  Does that drive you crazy when you get this kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll just speak for myself personally.  You're not speaking for Google. Yeah, but it does seem a little strange.  There was a write-up by Eric Goldman and, or, or, or on Eric Goldman's blog,  and they were basically saying, how does this happen? Like,  under what authority, what particular law is this taking place?  And they also said it has to be removed from Facebook and Twitter.  So there's a German website.  It was like sopa mode.ws and people are transferring dot coms to GoDaddy.  And so this is a German registrar, you know, German registered domain.  It doesn't even exist in the United States.  And so if you're going to mention it on Twitter,  Twitter is forced to remove all mentions of it. That's kind of strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this Nevada judge a nitwit? He's a federal judge in Nevada.  It was a, it was a, a luxury goods maker, Chanel,  suing hundreds of websites, trafficking and counterfeit luxury goods. Now,  I'm not for counterfeit luxury goods,  but is it such a high priority that we not have counterfeit Chanel bags?  And, and that was sopa. It's the judge ordered, listen to this.  The judge ordered all internet search. This is quote from his order,  all internet search engines and all social media websites.  And then explicitly said Facebook, Twitter, Google plus, Bing, Yahoo,  and Google to de index the domain names, remove them from any search results.  And by the way, the investigation that was involved Chanel hired a, you know,  private investigator in Nevada to order from three  of the 228 sites. When the orders from three,  not 228 from three, when the orders arrived,  they were reviewed by a Chanel official and declared counterfeit.  The other 225 sites were seized based on a Chanel,  anti counterfeiting specialist browsing the web.  They didn't even order a product. And the judge, Kent Dawson,  said, that's it. We're going to take the domain names, transfer them to GoDaddy.  Where they'd all be read. Thank you. GoDaddy.  It's like this guy is like a nitwit, a freaking idiot.  And he says, they're all going to redirect to a page serving notice of the seizure.  Is this due process? 228 sites, three of them  were actual products ordered.  This guy ought to be deep this bard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same problem with Sopoleo. And the problem is,  and then same problem I had the discussion with the German politicians today,  there's no discussion of the principles that underlie these decisions.  They sound okay in the moment, but in SOPA or in this,  if the government is in a position to blacklist sites for whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  reason, that's bad. That's a violation of free speech.  And really there's no due process here. I mean, this was a hearing in Nevada.  These guys didn't come to Nevada. It's just Chanel, some guy, Chanel,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and the private investigator judge, judge, we're, you know,  losing millions of dollars to fake Chanel bags. Oh, no problem.  Let me just get rid of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, isn't just taking down the sites enough?  If the sites redirect to the seizure notice,  then anyone who clicks on the links from Twitter, Facebook, Google+,  will go to the seizure notice, right? I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. That's exactly right. And in fact, if you control the domain name,  which evidently now they do, you could put up no index meta tags,  or you could register it in Google Webmaster Central and remove it there.  And so there's no need to go to, you know, any of these other companies,  if you actually control the physical domain name.  And I have to say, it kind of reminds me a little bit of something we saw a few  years ago. Now I grew up in Kentucky, but a few years ago,  the state of Kentucky decided that they didn't like poker websites.  And what they ended up doing was trying to seize like several high profile poker  websites that weren't even based in the United States. So, you know,  full tilt or poker stars or whatever,  simply because gambling in Kentucky, you know, that was not allowed.  And so the state of Kentucky said,  we should be able to remove this content from across the entire web,  just because we think it should be not allowed in Kentucky.  And that leads to a pretty bad decision, you know,  pretty quickly where anybody could say, Oh,  this part of the web should be illegal, remove it from the entire web.  And that's pretty dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even know how it worked because, and you're right,  I'm looking at Eric Goldman's blog, but it's actually Venkat Balasubramani,  who's writing the blog post on this. He says,  there's no clear basis to authorize a transfer of a defendant's property,  pending resolution of the lawsuit to the plaintiff,  which is what's effectively happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's this big, bad internet thing, Leo, it's ruining the game for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is in my, my sense of this is this is the problem.  You've got a Nevada judge who doesn't understand technology,  doesn't understand in any way, the free speech issues,  the search and seizure issues, the fifth amendment issue,  doesn't understand any of this for some reason, because it's the internet.  So he's, his judgment is clouded. It doesn't see it as property.  He doesn't see it as requiring due process and unilaterally orders all of  this stuff that is, I mean, I don't want it to, we don't,  it's just, they shouldn't, this is who needs SOPA? If a judge can do this,  you don't need SOPA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So who's the other side who fights that? Right? Well, that's right.  It's not going to be this handbag site is some stupid handbag. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and by the way, the handbag guy just opens another webpage. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He just opens, he just opens on 43rd street instead of 44th street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't stop his business for more than a minute. Nope.  It breaks the internet,  sets all sorts of terrible precedents and it doesn't stop him for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you're right there idiots.  The minister who spoke this morning before me in Germany,  the conservative minister, he was asked whether he was online. He said,  yes, I'm on Facebook and I have a Google.  I have a Google. I have a Google.  And everybody went nuts on Facebook laughing at him,  which they should laugh at them,  but it really does indicate the kind of whack of basic understanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, because these guys have a lot of power,  they are not afraid to wield it in the face of their stupidity and ignorance.  And it puts in it and they have no idea what they've done here.  And who is going to fight against this if we don't,  cause it's the handbag guy isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But, but literally legally in this case, right?  The other side is the, is the pirate handbag guy from Nigeria or wherever.  He isn't going to go to the Supreme court on this.  So, so how do we fight something like this? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it means we're in a really untenable situation.  You don't need so, but you don't need IP protect.  You just need a moron judge. Yep. And there's lots of them.  Yes. Offense fully intended, fully intended moron judge.  Let me get, let me say the moron judges name one more time.  Judge Kent Dawson of Nevada. You're a moron.  You should, you should be,  you should take yourself off the bench and go get a job at the burger place down  the street. You're an idiot and you shouldn't be given this kind of power.  Sorry. Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does Twitter, Facebook and Google come back and say,  we're not going to remove this content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, so, well, what did Google do?  So, so I asked a little bit about this yesterday and as of yesterday,  as far as I know,  no one had actually sent us anything or sent us any information or any court  orders or anything along those lines, but it seems to me,  and I'm not a lawyer and I'm only speaking for myself personally,  but it seems to me that if a court is going to say Google,  you have to remove something,  then Google should at least have the ability to address that, defend that,  you know, make a case rather than, you know,  if person A sues person B and then as a result of that,  you get to tell Google or Facebook or Twitter what to do.  That's kind of strange if Google or Facebook or Twitter aren't allowed to at  least make a case. And as I understand it, that didn't happen here.  I don't know all the details,  but that would be kind of strange to say because of this lawsuit in which you're  not involved, some other third party has to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Something that, that kind of undermines their business.  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and no one wants to counterfeit sites, right?  No one wants pirate sites. The whole argument is, for example,  when the immigration and customs enforcement, you know,  yeah, when ICE seized like 80 or 130 domains, they had some false positives.  They seized, you know, a free DNS provider,  which actually had thousands of sub hosts and they free,  they seized a domain which had been ruled legal in Spain. Right. And so,  you know, certainly most of the seizures might end up getting counterfeit goods.  And that's, that's great for everybody.  But if there's going to be collateral damage and false positives,  you want that to be subject to some sort of scrutiny or due process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess I'll never go to Nevada now.  We're going, we're going for CES.  Good. Come get me Kent Dawson.  I'll be staying at the Hilton January 6th through 10th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a showdown at the Leo Corral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe I could be sued for calling  somebody a moron or a Nimrod.  That's opinion.  Nimrod law in Nevada.  That's an opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In Nevada, all bets are off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Obviously this guy thinks he's got, he's God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In that case, Dvorak couldn't go to any state in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Good. Well, Dvorak believes everyone is a moron. So it's okay.  Exactly.  It's okay. What do you think Matt cuts of this open source search engine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that people are trying different ideas. You really want competition.  You want people to try things like peer to peer.  Danny Sullivan made a good point that there was a distributed crawler search  engine called grub from 2003.  Oh, I don't remember that. Yeah.  Yeah. And I think it got, it got bought eventually,  but there's two basic ways people measure search engines.  One is to search for your name. You know,  you'll search for Leo Laporte or Mac cuts and actually tried this with this  search engine yesterday and there were no results for Mac cuts. The other way.  It's not a good sign.  The other way is to look for porn and there was porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very good at that probably. Yeah. They do say, this is just a demo,  limited functionality. It's not the, what is it? How do you pronounce this? Yasi?  Yasi. Yasi search portal.  So you have to install this on your computer because it is peer to peer.  You suddenly are beginning to, or you're going to be supporting this  by you'll be a crawler, I guess on your, on your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's Torrent or that search for extraterrestrial life thing, right?  Your computer does the indexing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's never heard of Leo Laporte either. Right. By the way,  lots of German on this page, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, then we love it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can virtually guarantee that the spammers are already installing their  nodes and trying to get their pages indexed. This is a very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you're the right guy to ask this about. Yes. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They there was, you know, there was someone saying, well,  there's no one person reporting who will rank number one. You know,  we all get to decide together.  And the problem is if you have a majority of spammers who hop into there,  well, then you'll get spammed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to be more aggressive than we ever would be. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt, I imagine you in a James Bond movie where you always know what the bad  guys are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you've seen enough bad guys, you can start to predict a little bit.  I did wear my, uh, my eating spam hat or eating spam shirt,  you know? So. Wow. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I imagine this moment where you say, ah, at last we meet Mr. Bond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to pull your spam off the internet.  So you guys did a great video. This is Ben Gomez, a Google fellow,  the history of search. I don't have the whole,  I don't have the six minutes to play this. Um,  but the history of search in six minutes,  and this is a video everybody should take a look at if you get a chance.  Cause, uh, just, just great stuff. Great stuff. By the way,  thank you chat room.  They have given me a number of new ways to address,  uh, this, um, uh,  judge airhead, bird brain, blockhead, bonehead, bubblehead,  chowder head, chucklehead, Claude Paul, clot, cluck, clunk,  cretin, Cuddy. And when we get down to the bottom, twit.  Okay.  Anyway, I just, uh, I'm sorry. I went off. Look at this, look at this.  I got to show you this, the original Google page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I have never seen that one. Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a picture somewhere that I was on Google plus of the original staff and  they had that logo, that super color logo hanging above. Are you in that picture?  Matt?  About 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably not.  They actually, the logo had an exclamation point at one point and then they got

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  rid of it.  Cause Yahoo already dibs to the exclamation mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do you know what our very first holiday logo was? No.  The first Google doodle.  It was a burning man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. That shows you how far we've come.  Wow.  Um, very cool. So this is a,  this is a really fun history of Google thing to go through. There's Marissa.  That's cool. That's cool.  She's got some sort of Google trumpet behind her.  Google cheerleader horn behind her. Anyway, well worth seeing.  I won't show it, uh,  because it's just too long, but you can find it at search engine land.  That's where we saw the original post. Let's,  I want to talk about Spotify in just a bit.  We also have to get tips and so forth. Got a great cast, great people.  Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis,  the lovely Matt cuts is always fun to have on.  Uh, reminder Joe, just briefly that we are brought to you today as always by our  friends at Netflix and a great holiday gift. Do you have that Roku?  John, is that around? We were looking at the new Roku.  It's so teensy weensy tiny. Did you get one too, Liz?  Liz lemon. This is the new Roku too.  It is so tiny. Do you think I can't open it? Oh, I can open it.  I'll open it. I don't mind if I open it. John won't mind if I open it.  Look at this. It's so teensy weensy. It weighs.  The thing is light as a feather. You put this on your TV,  you put the HDMI in there. It's got wifi,  where you can connect your ethernet. And now suddenly you've got 10,  20, a hundred thousand movies available through Netflix.  If you've got a PlayStation three, you don't even need this.  Xbox three 60, your computer, your iPad, your iPhone, your Android phone,  all the Android tablets.  Now Netflix is everywhere you want to watch and it just streams in and it's  fantastic. I want you to try it free. If you just go to netflix.com slash twit,  this is the page you'll see. You can start your trial.  You need an email and a password. That's it. And see if you like it.  If you do 7 99 a month, if you're not already a member. Now,  if you're already a member and I know everybody who's watching this show is of  course, uh, do me a favor. Tell a family member,  tell a friend, let them know what's out there. And you know what'd be great.  This would be a great gift. Given this Roku X to XS and a subscription to Netflix.  Wouldn't that be a great gift for the holidays? Netflix.com slash twit.  Try it today. Um,  we did not cover the Spotify announcement today because we just,  I was thinking what could they possibly announce? That would be a huge story.  I don't know if it's a huge story, but they've announced a platform  and I find that very interesting. They've announced Spotify apps.  Developers can build apps. In fact, I got the new,  you have to get the Spotify, uh, uh, beta for the Spotify client,  but this is the beta and you go to the app finder and there's a few apps here  now, but there's one that I really like, which I turned on immediately called  tune Wiki. So when you're listening to a song, here, we'll put a song on.  We'll, uh, we'll play candy says by the velvet underground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wasn't getting audio earlier, but, um, it's probably turned down,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but watch as that's fine. We don't need the audio because it's tune.  Wiki's great because it's a Wiki for lyrics and it's in sync with the song as it  plays. You can read the lyrics. Isn't that cool?  And if there's an error, you can edit it. So this is an app. I mean,  we're not talking angry birds. We're talking to things that are, you know,  last FM song kick, which is kind of cool. If you're listening to somebody,  it'll tell you where they're playing. If they have a concert coming up.  So that's, that's kind of cool from this is artists in my library who are going  to be touring. Um, let's show,  let's show you some of the other ones. So what do you think of this?  Billboard top charts. And I think they've, I'm,  it's my understanding they've announced an API so that people can incorporate  Spotify into their stuff, which is kind of interesting.  It makes you want a Spotify account. Doesn't it?  I think this is smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have to have a paid account or does this, you can also,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  good question. Um, I have a paid account, so I don't know.  Does somebody in the chat room, have they tried this, uh, for,  you could works for free works for free. Yeah. Yeah. And, and,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but as a developer, you can't charge for your apps. All the apps are free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. I guess that would be right. Huh? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not very interesting for developers. No, no money to be made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you're the guardian who has an app.  So when I'm listening to a song,  I can see if there's a review from guardian critics on here. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes a lot of sense. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is just another way to channel people in. Interesting.  Okay. I thought I mentioned it. It's not attracting a lot of attention.  So moving on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.  Is I listened to talk podcasts like these instead of music, you see.  Yeah. So this is no help for you.  I don't listen to music anymore because your, your voice is music to my ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you. You know, I just realized this. I should ask Dylan about it.  They're going to have to redo the Google plus commercial, right?  Isn't the toolbar, isn't the black toolbar part of it? Maybe not. Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, just a little bit in that one shot. Yeah. This is a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was, I thought this was not a great commercial, Matt,  you should tell your people Leo did not.  So I tell you why,  because it may circling looks so much more complicated than it really is.  It was like, what you do what, and then I, who, and the, and the, but I, you,  we talked about this last week. I think we do like,  we do like some of the circles that show up on this was an Epic bros.  That's the one we like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Matt dropped out as soon as you said, I don't like this commercial.  He's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There'd be a consequence to being so outspoken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I was going to personally hassle Matt about the Epic bros thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know if he heard that.  Matt is an Epic bro. I do think this is a,  it was a good idea to demonstrate Hangouts because that's kind of something that  might be intimidating to people. Yeah. Probably the best part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're trying to push Hangouts more.  People aren't using Hangouts nearly enough for their taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. I think Hangouts are great. They are,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but how often do you use them? When you hung out? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will admit that I have not used it as much as I, as I thought that I would,  but I've had, I've had younger friends say that they've lost, you know,  you know, someone said to me, I lost my entire summer hanging out on Google+.  I would do all night. So I don't know if it's an age thing.  I don't know if I'm just like an old lady and I'm not as social, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some people really dig it. I mean, there's people like, you know,  what's, what's the name of the musician?  The woman who has been using it to great effect.  Some people really love it. There's a new Google plus ad.  That's a love story, which is, I think a little bit better.  They're a little more emotional. This one is better. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We show you not getting any audio from me. I know it's not me on my end. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me, let me, let me look and see if I'm doing something wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you play the commercial? Yes, I can. Well, you have a link. Oh,  I don't have a link to that one, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me just pause for a station fixing.  I have a new computer and that we haven't used it before on here.  It says I'm sending you sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have it turned up. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It must just be something with that cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They put a link in the chat room. Oh, sorry. Not that one. Go ahead, Matt.  No, that was my video. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I sounded just like Matt cuts. How you doing, Matt? How's everything going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't complain. You know, I epic bros, little brony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Gina, go ahead. No, no, I'm not going to hold respond to Matt responsible for  the epic bros. They made the commercial. Come on.  I can't do that. And that's a nice engineer. He's it's, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true. You can't blame. You can't. I won't hassle him.  I won't. You can't blame him. It's cutesy. It's cutesy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And some people like it.  And then some people that rubbed the wrong way a little bit. And.  Hey, it's just an ad. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not your fault. You know why?  You know why the ads have been so good up to now, they've been so emotional.  And you go, God, I love that ad.  And this was the first one out of a bunch. So it's not that's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really good Leo.  The most emotional ad in a sense should be Google plus because it's the most  time to your life. And you're right.  It's not as emotional as they've made even search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They they did. I love those search ads.  I thought they were great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. There was a search ad where it was like someone falling in love  and like searching for first aid and how to speak French and how to get,  you know, getting married, that kind of thing.  And then there was the one where the father was writing Gmail messages  to his daughter, the dear Sophie ad. That was really good.  I loved those.  And, you know, so I was excited to see the Google plus ad go on during Glee  last night because it was like, you know, several of my favorite things  happening all at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If only there had been Chipotle somewhere in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. There have been a burrito.  And, you know, I like the message of the Google plus ad, which is like,  here's how to share as a grownup.  You know, there's there's a part where he says, you know, as a kid,  you just go out at recess and just everybody was there.  But now I've got these different, you know, which is the message of circles.  It just was a little slow.  Like the music is slow and the screenshots are so tight that it's not it's not.  I mean, it's not supposed to be a screencast, but it's so close in  that you're not really sure what's going on.  But, you know, overall,  I mean, it was heartening for me to see it.  It didn't surprise me to see that to see Google advertising.  I love it that they're advertising.  It is. Yeah. Yeah.  Because it makes sense now because Google plus really ties together  a lot of a lot of the services in a lot of ways now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does feel a little bit like Google's struggling with Google plus, like they  it's so close to getting traction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's strange to me is it really feels like if you watch the team,  they're moving very, very quickly, like the things that you complained about  when it first launched.  I've all been solved.  Things like the spam comments or the duplicates, you know, things like that.  And that's changed quickly enough that I found myself doing a few like  things that I've been meaning to blog about forever.  Like don't be evil versus do no evil.  I'm just like, you know what?  I'm just going to throw this up as a Google plus post  because it's easier than writing a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the people like and I would include all all four of us who  use Google plus and get it, love it.  It's just it's getting that that critical mass jump,  which I think you're this close to and I think the ads might help.  You're this close to getting it to the mass market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know what else?  There is a positive feedback loop.  There's a problem here because I got busy.  And so I've been posting to Google plus less and there's no my notifications.  I get two and it's so lonely.  And it's the problem of you come in as a new user and you see cricket,  you hear crickets or you start using it less for a little bit of time.  You get less feedback.  It's a real need for positive feedback loop.  And if you don't have that, you know, I fear you could fall off the wagon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of that's kind of true, absolutely.  And so if you see some of this stuff like what's hot on Google plus,  which is a little thing that sort of gives you a few people  you might want to follow and shows you some interesting things.  I do like that kind of that helps out quite a bit.  Yeah. And now my parents are on Google plus.  Like for a while, my mom used a Google apps account so she couldn't get on.  But that's been solved now.  I've got my dad on and so we're actually starting to share photos and things.  So, you know, it might take a little bit of time, but it's nice to see  that the base functionality is there now.  Yeah. OK, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is your dad your bro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. I think we have I think this the ad here.  This is the new one. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see. This is how you teach your grand to use a Chromebook.  Grandma, grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, this is Chrome. Sorry.  I thought you said. Wait a minute, though. I'm liking this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turn the music down, grand. It's four o'clock in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I posted that in the in the internal doc just because I wanted to say,  hey, Google's getting a little bit better about advertising.  I was in the Chrome OS.  There's actually a whole line of like how to how do you upgrade your  your laptop with Google with Chrome OS and stuff.  So we're starting to see a little more clever advertising, which is kind of nice.  And there's a lot on Google Plus, but the Chrome OS stuff is pretty good, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, now I have the ad. Sorry, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't mind. This is fun.  Love of my life.  He just dragged Lisa to the love of my life circle.  Now, Lisa just dragged Kyle to her creepers circle.  Oh, no.  Wait a minute. Wrong circle. Book club circle.  No, I don't think so.  Let's put Kyle somewhere. He really belongs. Guys with cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a little otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ski House.  She keeps dragging for Kyle's head around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's getting upgraded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe's well, he's there's two maybe's.  There's only two take him out of maybe's and put him into.  Keepers.  The right people in just the right place.  That was cute.  So it wasn't immediately clear to me that she was being upgraded over time.  But I get it now. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. That's a book club and then the ski house.  And then anything can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo started as a creep, ended up the love of my life.  There's hope for me yet.  Boy, it would be nice if you were so successful  that you actually had a competition to get tickets to your developers event.  Holy cow. Google I.O.  coming up was originally April 24th and 25th.  Remember last year, they sold out within a minute or something.  They've rescheduled now June 27th through 29th.  This is the developers conference.  And apparently the announcement on the Google code blog says that we might have.  A test.  A coding competition when the application process opens in February  to test general programming skills as opposed to product specific knowledge.  We're designing it so every developer is given a fair shot at attending Google  I.O. but don't expect it to be as involved as last year's last call for Google I.O.  I love this idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love this idea, too.  And I love that the blog post was like, don't make your travel arrangements just yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You may not have a ticket.  How good are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have any insight into this?  Should I study my Python?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's I don't have any special insight, but yeah,  I'm going to start brushing up on my constant, you know, dynamic classes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm getting my GWT book in the mail.  Wouldn't that that's just great. I love it.  It's Studio 54 for geeks.  Yeah, there's there's instead of a red rope, you've got the you've got the code bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I fail the test, I'm going to be trying for a press pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if they test press?  I think press should be tested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The press know nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Spelling test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We actually do that to get into journalism school.  Really?  Yeah, we get the test.  What's the test?  Current events and basic editing and style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am a fan of meritocracy.  I don't think meritocracy is a bad thing.  And I think it's a I mean, Google's the ultimate meritocracy, right?  You it's hard to get a job.  Well, it wasn't when you started, but it's hard to get a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Matt, that has said that himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is never make it through the front door now. Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which shows you that maybe it shouldn't be too hard,  because if you got a great guy like Matt and he couldn't get through the tests,  maybe you shouldn't make it so hard.  You think of all the Matt cuts out there who don't have jobs at Google.  I remember Colleen going through hundreds of interviews have seemed like  hundreds. YouTube big month for the first time ever.  They got 20 billion video views in one month.  Half of all videos watched in the US, according to com score,  were on Google sites.  Pretty impressive.  This is insane. Google YouTube also had the highest engagement.  Users averaged more than seven hours of video during the month.  Incredible, isn't it?  It's just it's just a matter of time before TV and YouTube flip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, definitely. It's true.  It's close. Seven hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But probably TV is like seven hours a night, though, unfortunately.  Yeah, I think it is.  You got to beef it up a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's lots of potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's purposeful viewing and there's background viewing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And most TV viewing is just noise in the background.  I've watched so many people.  It's just the TV's on and it's on all day.  Nobody sits down on a couch and watches TV for seven hours.  Your butt would get numb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Regis and Kelly, they do.  Do you like watching Kelly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I love Kelly.  Kelly is wonderful, isn't she?  They asked me to go be on the show next two weeks.  But I've just gotten back from France, so I said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I got to start the rumor here, Leo, is you're going to replace Regis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, you know, I was just talking with somebody  who's a big fan of the show about who they should get.  And we went through a lot of candidates.  You know, Michael Buble will be the guest host when I would have been there.  But I think they're going to get somebody like Matthew Broderick.  It's got to be somebody who lives in New York,  somebody who doesn't work in much.  But she has to be seen now.  Why are we talking about this? I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, we find the cloud angle.  Kelly cloud is alliterative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, this is the journalist test that Leo passed.  Give him a subject. He'll talk about it for 10 minutes.  It doesn't matter what it is.  I could vamp for 10 minutes.  So all things D did a funny little retrospective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a good piece.  It is.  This is a really good piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great Liz Gaines. I love Liz Gaines.  Oh, this is nice. Look at this.  Now, Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch have been banging on people for cookies, right?  Oh, the privacy violation, privacy violation.  The first time I've ever gone to all things D on this computer,  and I'm getting a big yellow thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of the advertisers and web analytics firms used on this site may place tracking cookies  on your computer.  We're telling you about them right up front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the Wall Street Journal was the person who has to write about privacy stuff  had to write the story that said basically that Wall Street Journal is now tying  your personally identifiable information to your browsing history,  and you can't do anything about it.  Meanwhile, the New York Times editorialized in favor of Do Not Track.  And I went on and did a blog post about all the ways in which they insist you use cookies.  And if you don't use cookies, you may not use the New York Times.  But anyway, Leo, you were saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The hypocrisy.  So meanwhile, maybe we should make this the apologies of Rupert Murdoch,  but it's the apologies of Zuckerberg, a retrospective of the 25 posts  Zuck has posted on the corporate blog in the last five years.  Ten were written to address complaints.  And so Liz, who is hysterical, has got a bunch of them together.  Here's one she calls a real gem from 2006.  This was his first company blog post.  It was a pre apology, warning users of upcoming changes they might not like.  When we've made changes in the past, a lot of people have gotten upset.  And he emailed us asking to change the site back.  Change can be disorienting, but we do it because we're sure it makes the site better.  So calm down.  He actually wrote, calm down, breathe.  We hear you.  I'm sure that Dylan was really.  It's OK. It's going to be OK.  But, you know, I have to say, you know, when you make a big change like the Google  toolbar, you know you're going to get probably tens of thousands of complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google is going to get serious blowback.  But that's just the reality of like making a popular web product.  You can't change anything.  I know redesigns at Lifehacker were a nightmare, but it's just it's just that  people react to change badly initially. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'll defend Zuck to this extent that that he does back off, but he just throws  things out there and then and then really listens to his public.  The argument is he listens too late.  He doesn't do as a beta.  He does it as a product release.  And that puts him in a less good PR position.  But, you know, what are you going to do?  Throw stuff out there. See how it sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He doesn't ask for permission. He asks for forgiveness. Right. Exactly.  And I don't think that's a bad strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't either.  And then but you the viewers and listeners at home and all of us have to decide, well,  do we want to play in this game?  Unfortunately, it's hard not to play in Facebook's game.  You can't, for instance, have a Spotify account if you don't have a Facebook account.  They've made it very difficult not to play.  And that's what really frustrates me.  It's not like you have a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can now do a turntable if you have a Twitter account.  You don't have to use Facebook anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Turntable.fm.  Hallelujah. Thank you.  They listened.  Can we make it an open ID or browser ID or something that we don't have to have an account?  That'd be nice. Yeah, it would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If open ID was easier for people to understand.  But, yeah, I agree.  I agree. We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  We all agree. Let's take a break.  Let's not take a break. Let's go right to Gina's tip.  We have a tip from Matt. Thank you, Matt Cutts and Jeff's number of the week.  And if there's time, I'll do a tool.  Let's start with you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, actually, you know, so this was a story that we passed, but I think it's a really cool story.  So I'll just make it my tip. Good.  Google Maps, and I believe this is just for Android right now, or it's on the web as well.  Now indexes indoors of public spaces. Isn't that wild?  It's so crazy. So like malls and airports and that kind of thing, you can you can.  And I actually I just watched the demo video. I haven't actually tried it yet.  I'm not sure if it's rolled out just yet.  But so you can see where shops are and bathrooms and exits and in public places.  And you can and you can move up and down floors.  That was the bit that just blew my mind is like what's on the fourth floor of the Manhattan Mall?  That kind of thing. So really, really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, just to lay aside any privacy concerns that I know Germany just going crazy right now.  They go to they go to the mall or the businesses and they say, hey, you know, the O'Hare airport,  they say, can you can you let us will you let us map the inside?  And so it's not like they're going they don't have a street view.  Tia, you know, little the I don't I actually somebody made it.  I don't know if it's a joke or if they're serious.  A little street view thing on wheels that you could go into the shops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would be cool to come to my house and show me where my car keys are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, these are these are public spaces. These are big. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And with the cooperation of the big public space. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when you're in some airport, you've never been in and you need to find the Chipotle.  This would be this would be a help right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's only 25 spots. San Francisco International, O'Hare, Macy's, Bloomingdale's.  But I would hope they would do more of these. I think this is a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I was saying, actually, Tim O'Reilly did a piece on Google Plus actually saying that this is kind of an interesting.  You know, Google generally doesn't build products for revenue streams,  but this has a lot of revenue potential. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You could show a special inside that store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. But I mean, it's also useful.  And this was this was my my real tip was going to be or my secondary tip.  I had to get that story. I thought that was interesting. It's good.  Google Calendar. There's a new labs.  This this this is nice. If you go into Google calendar settings, go to labs.  There's a hide morning and night option now.  So I use Google Calendar constantly in the Web interface.  And I'm always like scrolling through the middle of the night.  I never schedule anything.  I'm a night owl, but I still don't schedule meetings between midnight and four a.m.  So if you enable this labs feature, you can collapse late, you know, middle of the night times.  So you get more screen real estate and you don't have to scroll through that that time when you're not scheduling meetings.  So, yeah, it was a cool little Google Calendar tip. Perfect.  Now I want that on my Android phone because I'm constantly scrolling through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Now, Matt's going to show us how to explore the tool belt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So, you know, we talked a little bit about the Google bar, which is up in the top left and how it's got a drop down menu.  But you might not have explored the tool belt, which is if you do a search like Republican debate and you look over on the left hand side,  there's all kinds of really useful tools.  So imagine what if you wanted videos? If you clicked on the videos tab, you might get the Fox News Google debate, which was, you know,  one hundred and thirteen minutes. But the number two result might be from Saturday Night Live.  Well, there's all these great little things. If you click on long under any duration, then you'll only get the long videos.  Twenty minutes plus. That's neat.  Yeah. And so it's just this fun thing where even on images mode, you can click on images and you can look for things with a dominant color.  You can look for large and small sizes. You can click to see faces and photos.  So if you haven't done those sorts of things where you can kind of do a little bit of exploring and see what great tools are hidden under the tool belt,  even on the main Web search, you can slice and dice by date range.  So you can say, show me the Republican debates, but show me Web pages from 2002 to 2006.  So just lots of ways to slice and dice are just sitting right there a few pixels over.  If you just want to take a little bit of time to explore on the tool belt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's funny because we've I think we're creatures of habit. So we look at the search, we do a search, we look at the top result, we go there.  We never must drive you crazy because this tool belt is fantastic.  And I bet you most people, it's not as if it doesn't exist. They just go, I got it.  And they go. And it really is very, very, very useful, especially in the image search.  You can really narrow it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we like to joke that if we could spend five minutes with each searcher, we could really make them much more efficient.  But no one wants to take five minutes to learn how to search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's such and this is why speed is so important. You know, click, click, click.  And I'm there. And you do that very well. But yeah, I'm glad we could mention that because you're absolutely right.  I use it. I guess probably it was you who raised my awareness, but certainly during the show.  And I use it a lot now to narrow down results. Thank you, Matt Cutts.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The number of the week is two, which is the number of days it took Kansas governor and former Senator Brownback to back off,  trying to muscle an 18 year old girl named Emma Sullivan into apologizing for a negative tweet on him.  And she, God bless her, refused to do it.  Good right. And he learned a lesson about the first friggin amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Taught it by an 18 year old high school student who had a lot of guts.  Good on you, Emma Sullivan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God bless her. And it shows how, you know, we'll make it into a cloud by a big stretch here.  But but the cloud made her powerful.  The cloud brought her the support of Twitter and made her say, F you, Gov.  Yep. She said he sucked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hashtag was pound. He blows a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Suck blow, you know, I just I love that.  But I also think that Sam Brownback wins the weasel of the award of the year because his apology said my staff overreacted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes.  Well, that's like, you know, that piece about Zuckerberg's apologies.  He never really apologized. He never says that he did anything wrong.  He he's sorry that you perceived it. Yes.  It's your perception. You're sorry about your perception.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
