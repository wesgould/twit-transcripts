Jeff Jarvis is recovering from his emergency appendectomy and laparoscopy.  And he'll be back next week. He also has some other personal issues to take care of.  Like that hair. If you could just get a little haircut.  No, I'm just kidding. But instead we've got some great people.  And we've got them in studio because Google I.O. is going on right now.  Joining us Kevin Marks who is playing Leo Laporte at Google I.O.  He's even got a badge that says Leo Laporte. I like it.  I couldn't go down because we decided to do the coverage here.  There he is Leo Laporte. Chief Twit.  But we okayed that, right? She got the... Yes, okay good.  It's alright with me.  And so actually thanks to Kevin for missing a little bit of Google I.O.  And coming up here to our Brickhouse Studios.  And also to Gina Tripani who is here in studio which is so nice.  My first time in the Brickhouse. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First time in the Brickhouse. You never came here before?  I've been in the cottage. You've been in the cottage?  Yeah, but I haven't been here. It's so nice not to be just like a floating head.  Yeah, I love it. It's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although you're in exactly the same spot. So from my point of view this is no different.  Same thing, same, same. No difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But aren't I kind of over there? Like are you looking at...  No, you're right there. You're right there.  Okay, so same, same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm used to Kevin being right there.  Except usually Kevin's outside. So that's a little strange.  I can elbow you now though.  So you guys both were at Google I.O.  We saw the keynote today. There will be another keynote tomorrow.  We will do live coverage of that at 9.30 Pacific, 12.30 Eastern at time.  Today they announced Jelly Bean Ice Cream Sandwiches Successor Android 4.0.  Android 4.1 they decided, right? Not 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, 4.1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They also showed the Nexus 7, a 7-inch tablet. We'll talk about that.  The Q, updates to Google Play and Google Plus.  And Sergey Brin did not jump out of an airplane, but some people did on his behalf wearing Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Glass, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow. So it was a very interesting keynote.  Now the event is, Google I.O. is all week is for developers.  So you guys are going to go to the developer events.  You're skipping some today, so thank you later on.  What are you excited about Kevin? Anything you want to particularly look at in the developer events?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to see if they've got an API for G Plus yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am going to predict they do not.  And I think that was one of the big things missing when Vic Gundotra took the stage and talked about Google Plus.  He got Taylor Swifted. He Kanye'd, Sergey Kanye'd him.  We'll talk about that in a second.  But he came back, finished his talk, and at no point mentioned an API, but merely showed new Google Plus apps, showed hangouts on tablets, showed Google events.  And it tells me, here's me reading the tea leaves. You guys tell me if I'm wrong.  But it tells me they don't plan to do a right API.  That they learn from the lessons of Twitter, that they want to control all input.  And that's why they're updating the apps and updating events and adding features, and they control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still holding out hope. It's only day one.  I'm hoping that either today during one of the developer sessions there'll be an announcement about the Google Plus API or that tomorrow, or at some point in the next few days, even if it's not full right access, that there will be at least a few more features that will make it a little less useless.  There is an API, right?  There is an API. It's read-only and it's pretty limited.  You know, you can't get the number of circles that you're in.  You can't get comments, you can get posts, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not enough for you to do think up. I presume that that's the kind of thing you'd like to do with Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I mean, right now think up is pretty limited because it only accesses the current API.  So it just gets your posts and the comments to those posts.  And I think maybe plus ones as well.  But that's it. So you can't post to it.  You can't get, you know, the people who have circled you, the circles that you're in, that kind of thing. You can't see.  Wasn't that what was wrong with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The API calls are very limited per day as well, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you can't. You don't have a fire hose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they throttle you. But that's common. I mean, Twitter, same thing, right?  There's only a few hundred per hour. And I think it's a similar thing with Google Plus.  So you're used to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I forgot what I was going to ask you.  I was going to ask you something exciting about Google Plus and the API.  Oh, I know what I was going to say.  Maybe Google learned from Buzz because people were able to write to Buzz and Buzz ended up being just a place you would dump your tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what they're afraid of. That's certainly what, when Vic talked about it at South By, he said, I'm worried about polluting the stream.  But that's a management problem. That's a deciding, you know, if they're already deciding which ones to show you, they can decide which ones to show you based on origin as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you could say only native posts are visible in your circles unless you actively...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless you accept them or, you know, they're dynamically winnowing them for most people. Well, for people who...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's, programmatically, there's a way to handle this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. I mean, that's part of the piece that they've been working on for a while.  Originally, the first iteration of Plus felt a lot like Buzz in that every time you posted, that would fill your feed up for two days.  It would fill my feed up for two days because people were responding to it.  They did fix that.  And that has got better and they got better at that ordering problem such that the stuff you see there is less.  Facebook does a lot of that.  Facebook is doing a huge amount of that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think people don't... maybe they realize it, but I think they generally don't notice it.  They just say, oh, it's good. The stuff's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Facebook recently just added in the tweet so you can see...  Right.  It says, who are your real friends? Who do you want to see more from?  Right.  And then you check them and they appear.  Right. So you control it now a little bit more.  So there's a bit more control of that in Facebook.  Unless, yeah, Twitter doesn't really have that sense. Twitter is, know everyone you follow you will see.  So do you agree with Gina there'll be a right API?  I hope there'll be a right API.  Yeah, I'm hopeful.  I suspect what they'll do is it'll be like preferred only.  Preferred only.  They've already announced that Flipboard have got a better API access than other people.  Yeah, Flipboard has Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's actually a little weird because when you're using Flipboard,  normally you have sharing capabilities to Twitter and other things.  As soon as you get in the Google Plus stream on Flipboard, you can only plus one it and reshare it to Google+.  Oh, really?  So what they've done is they've said to Flipboard, well, you can include us,  but we're not going to let you kind of manipulate how people interact with this.  Right.  And it actually is bizarre because it changes the user experience depending on what you're reading.  That's not typically a good user interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's one of the things that Android gets right.  Android lets you use the share thing and anyone can hook into it.  You don't have a hard code every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unfortunately, you get a mile long share menu, but I do like that.  You could share to anything.  Right.  I suspect that, I think, I know you're hopeful.  I am.  I know you're hopeful.  I don't want to dash your hopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's only midday one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm still holding on hope.  I think if they were going to announce it, they would have announced it then.  There's no reason to hold on to this.  This is huge, right?  Developers want this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do, but they talked about a lot of stuff.  I mean, Jelly Bean today and Project Glass, they kind of, I think, had to lead off with the really big stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They could have shortened this, by the way, quite a bit.  There was a lot of, for instance, with Project Glass, they kept saying over and over, and you could take pictures.  And you could take pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Project Glass demo went on a little long.  Right, right.  And look, here's you taking pictures.  Taking pictures.  From your point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They never showed an interface.  They never even said how you're controlling.  So, there was room.  Don't tell me there wasn't room.  Fair enough.  But maybe they didn't know there was room.  I don't know.  So, let's talk about Jelly Bean.  We'll go in order on the announcements.  Jelly Bean is 4.1.  Does that imply, I think the semiotics of that are, it's not a major update.  It's not an ice cream sandwich update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you didn't say, oh yeah, this is strikingly different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  5.0 would say, hey, we're making a big update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, semantic versioning is major dot minor dot patch.  So, it does count as a minor.  But there's some really interesting stuff here.  Okay, so tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love the widgets.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, that's okay.  Widgets was really cool, right?  So, smart resizable widgets.  You add a widget to your screen.  If there are icons already taking up space, they automatically rearrange themselves.  If there's not enough room, the widget resizes itself.  That's really nice.  And I think that that's something that it's important for Android to emphasize the fact  that their home screen is way more customizable than iOS.  It's a differentiator not only from iOS, but even Windows Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Windows Phone has tiles that you can resize.  There's three sizes.  And there's at least their live tiles, unlike the Apple.  But it's very primitive compared to what you can do with widgets.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Microsoft did emphasize that as well.  I mean, the home screen is definitely ripe for innovation.  And I think Jelly Bean is continuing to do that.  I love widgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think that that is huge.  But many launchers let you do that, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  There are many launchers that let you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, resizing is not that unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Notifications was a thing.  Those rich notifications that you could perform actions in the notification bar without launching  the app, like liking or commenting on a four-square check-in, responding to an email, hey, I'm  on my way with the hand response.  Yeah, in the notifications.  That new two-finger gesture where you can expand a notification to see more information about  it, like the sender and subject line and new email.  I was really excited about the new notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Again, this may be cross-pollinated back from Apple, because Apple did at least put some  weather and stuff in its notifications.  They're a little bit smarter.  But they've gone one step beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they've given you more than one action for notifications as well, which is also important.  At the moment, if you're coding a notification, you can click on it, but that will take you  to the app.  I know someone in a phone call with a notification there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can pause, mute, do stuff, same thing with music.  So, there have been some actions within notifications, but this is going to be much wider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, this is you can call back or hang up phone calls from notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it looks like you can hook your own.  I mean, I mean, just look at the APIs for that.  It looks like you should be able to create a notification that appears and give you a  little mini UI in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, right.  So, they showed the four-square app.  You could like a friend's check-in or comment in notifications.  That's a third-party thing, right?  So, that's going to be another thing that developers can hook their apps into, kind  of like the home screen widget of like this is another way that user can interact without  launching the app and having to tap through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a little risky, though, to overload too much of that window, isn't it?  I mean, can you put too much in there and make it too busy?  I have to say, I do not.  The Apple notifications, I spend a lot of time closing.  You have to do it section by section.  It's easy on Android.  You just press clear.  Right, on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can clear them all.  You can do one by one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really dangerous to, you have to be very thoughtful about how you use notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, right.  It does take a little setup to say, these are the things I want to hear from.  These are the things I don't.  So, it doesn't get too chatty.  I do that as well.  Yeah, and you really have to configure it on Android.  It's one of those things.  Well, if you do it on iOS as well, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iOS will, every single page will notify you.  True.  I agree.  True.  Yeah, the badges and notifications.  Maybe even more so.  iOS, by default, every app has to ask permission to notify you.  Whereas on Android, every app gets to do it and you get to turn them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've gotten in the habit on iOS, every time you install a new app and open it for the  first time, it says, allow, don't allow notifications.  I've gotten in the habit of saying, don't allow.  My default is now no more.  I don't want to hear from you.  I'll let you know.  Because it was getting so chirpy and busy.  And I do wish Android gave you that capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you can do it, but you've got to find it.  I run NanoTweeter, which is an ancient app that basically pipes some of the tweets into  the notifications.  So I'm used to having a big pile of notifications like that.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a busy notify list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you have more than three pages, you're doing it wrong.  Well, no, but this is deliberate because I want to do a little tweet stream there.  And it's not my full tweet stream.  It's just, you know, ads and direct messages and a subset of people.  And you never have to go into the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's all just there.  Yeah, if you click them, it goes through.  So it's open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I may go and hack that to have better buttons on it at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a danger of creating this other inbox that you have to clear out, you know,  the point at which, you know, it goes from being fun to being work and you just have  to configure a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the things that's always been a negative, at least in demoing Android versus the iPhone,  is that frequently you'll have the screen will rebuild, widgets will redraw, icons will  redraw.  And that has given people the feeling that Android is slow.  That's one of the that's the first thing you see.  Right.  Apple has been buffering those images and it makes this scrolling very much smoother  on the iPad and the iPhone.  I guess that's butter, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Project Butter is about making those things look very, very smooth.  They're going to do that same buffering, right?  Right.  Much more responsive.  Yeah, they let off actually with Project Butter, which I think, you know, was an interesting  choice.  Kevin and I were talking about it and I was like, oh, they started kind of slow in this  keynote and then kind of build up the flashy stuff.  You know, first we were seeing charts about frame per second and that kind of thing.  And then we got into the skydiving.  So I guess it was a slow build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Skydiving was an hour and a half in.  Are you kidding me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was slightly skeptical about the Project Butter demos they showed because they said,  OK, we've got Vsync matching, which is good.  What does that mean?  It basically means that they wait for, wait to draw until the screen refresh is coming,  which is kind of weird in LCD.  I think you really have Vsync, but it means they've got a regular pulse when the screen  changes.  It's a TV thing.  Yeah.  So that for me is like…  That's puzzling to me.  That's slightly puzzling because the point of an LCD is you don't need to update it  all the time.  Right.  OK.  But then they said there were triple buffering and that may be paused because it's like,  well, you just added another buffer of latency.  You've got three buffers, then you're waiting.  Three's got to be better than two, which is better than one.  And I know they did the high speed camera thing and they showed, oh, look, the animation  is smoother, but they didn't show, I'm dragging my finger around the screen and the  thing is following me.  And there's a very neat demo that Microsoft research did where they showed the difference  between 100 millisecond and 10 millisecond and one millisecond response.  Huge.  Huge.  And when you're trying to draw something or do it on the screen, that's what matters.  So that's the demo I want to see them optimize for.  They may not have done that yet.  They said they were doing predictive on your chart, so it would actually draw at the point  it was expecting you to go to.  That sounds horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That does not sound good unless you're a very predictable guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're dragging, that's OK.  But if you're drawing a draw, I don't know.  So that's going to be the test for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're going there?  Oh, you're going there?  Oh, no.  You know, Apple has always paid attention to this.  Apple's mouse was direct drive.  It really felt like even on the earliest Macintosh, when you moved the mouse, the pointer moved  in exact synchrony.  On Windows, it took a long time for Microsoft to get that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was more subtle than that because Apple wasn't completely direct drive.  When you went slow, it was that.  When you went fast, it had a ballistic screen.  So it understood what you were doing.  And it's the same with the trackpads.  Somebody wrote a piece this week about the reason that all Windows machines suck is because  you have to configure their trackpads, whereas the Mac gets it right from the get-go.  It's true.  It does feel like an extension of yourself there.  And that's because they've closed that loop really tightly.  And I'm hoping that they've done some of that on this, but we have to try it and see.  It is one of the issues with Android is there is that extra little bit of lag.  And Apple will throw away the display in order to make the tracking work.  When you start scrolling on the Mac, they will make the thing track you even if they can't draw everything yet.  And then you let go, it fills in.  Whereas Android does the opposite.  It's like, OK, I'm going to fire the refresh loop and load everything from the web to draw that.  And you get this slight resistance.  And it's not a frame rate thing necessarily.  It's are you responding to my finger thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the most critical part of any touchscreen experience.  As soon as I feel like I've touched the screen and hasn't registered, you come out of it.  You're like, oh, Android.  And this is my the Project Butter effort sounds great, but I'm not concerned about how quickly or smoothly my applications menu expands.  I'm concerned that when I tap a button, that's going to respond.  You know, I don't want to look at spinners.  I don't want to wait.  I don't want to have to tap twice.  I want it to, you know, I want it to respond everywhere in third party apps, everywhere throughout Android.  I never want to be taken out of the experience and think I'm having trouble with my phone and I can't get done what I want to get done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a lot of that in Android.  In fact, the Kindle Fire, which is Android, even though Amazon never admits it, has a particularly bad problem with that.  Not merely screen lag, but unresponsive taps.  Oh, it's the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It kills you.  Yeah, it's the worst.  It makes you feel like this piece of crap.  What did I buy this for?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And ironically, it may be a fast machine.  It may do everything well.  It may have a beautiful screen.  It's but it's that responsiveness.  It makes you feel like this is a good experience.  So good.  So Butter is about that.  Butter is about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I hope that it improves it, you know, throughout the application experience, not just not just rendering the applications menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They mentioned predictive keyboard, which I think I would guess many Android users do not use Google's stock keyboard.  They're usually using a third party like swipe that's provided by the handset manufacturer or they've already downloaded SwiftKey or slide it or.  Right.  The power users for sure.  You told us about swipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then the user base is kind of split into like the superpower users who feel strongly about open source and then the regular folks and the regular folks are probably using the stock keyboard.  I have to say that that demo, the stock keyboard, it was he was he typed something like I'm able to or no, actually, this was the voice.  This is the voice demo.  He said, here I'm giving you voice dictation, even though I don't have a connection.  And Android typed even no KNO.  And then they changed it to even though in the context of the sentence.  Did you catch this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it was like, oh, it knew that it was even though not even know it misheard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looked at the context said, well, I must have missed.  And it happened really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The voice stuff has been doing that before.  I mean, there's also a bit of lag.  I did notice there was a bit of delay after he spoke because it was trying to gather more than one word before it would respond.  Right before it would type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And that happens all off line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That started an ice cream sandwich where you could kind of continuously dictate it, which would think about what you were saying and would even amend it as you as you spoke.  It was always quite amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they said they pulled it down to the device.  So you're not going through to this no longer online.  And that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These devices, I mean, yeah, the quad core processor, you got to do something with all that besides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I presume they're still doing the statistical stuff that will improve the whole thing.  Right.  Because part of the download the data later, maybe part of the value of what they were doing was feeding that loop with everyone's voice and improving it from that.  And that's that's how they were able to get such good quality for the dictation and for their voice stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is it is why they turned off Google 411, wasn't it?  That they had collected enough data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think at that point, they said we got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's never enough data.  No, there's always more data.  You're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe that was too expensive for him.  Predictive keyboard, offline voice typing, better accessibility.  All of these are things that you would expect improvements as operating systems are updated.  What happened with the camera?  What's new in the camera?  I see your note, Jeb, but I didn't see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They put they made it quicker to take and easier to manipulate than once you've taken them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And you can combine preview and shooting mode so you can preview the picture that you'd taken before you shot.  But you can also did you see that he kind of dragged the so he was in shooting mode.  So he's moving around.  You could see what was in front of the camera.  But then you could kind of pull the picture that you take and compare.  It's just looked easier to kind of switch between and view pictures versus shoot them kind of at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And again, that's something that a lot of users won't see because Samsung, HTC and others all customize the camera.  They have their own camera app.  And in fact, in most cases, it's better than the stock camera app.  The touch was for app in here.  Does panoramas does HDR does.  And I love this.  It will take three or five and it'll take the best picture for it'll algorithmically determine the best picture.  I don't know. I've never used it because it seems kind of odd.  But yes, I think I think that's in here.  Maybe I'm maybe I'm fantasizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I mean, I see us does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll also wait for a smile shot.  So let's try it.  Let me just see.  So don't smile frown at me.  All right.  Now smile.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was cool.  You got it right.  It put a green box on your face and it waited and it waited.  And then it took a picture.  Do that again.  Let me just see.  OK. It's got your face.  That's good.  So it's things like that.  That's a Samsung feature.  Not. But and so I think, you know, in some ways, I guess Google has to pay attention to its stock apps.  Right. Right.  But but often the handset manufacturers are modifying.  Right. And then there are third party cameras as well.  Yeah.  Notifications we mentioned.  Quick responses.  There's search.  It's important for Google.  What's new in search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are three new things.  There was a new UI.  There's voice search.  And then there's this thing called Google Now, which I thought was really interesting.  One of the most interesting things we heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And as I watched it, I thought it was maybe a little creepy.  Yeah.  Because they're they're saying based on your previous searches.  Right.  We think we know what you want.  We think you would go to this sports team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Based on where you are and where you're going.  Right.  We're going to make predictions about now to me, Google Now just screamed Project Glass to me.  I was like, this is clearly what's going to run on those glasses.  Yeah. Right.  This like constant.  We know where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We know what you're looking at.  Babe, best bet you want this.  Those fake movies kind of implied that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Right.  The voice search.  You know, you can ask a question.  I think the demo was like, who is the prime minister of Japan?  And the voice responds and the voice is a little bit.  It's a female voice, a little bit higher, a little bit less robotic than Siri.  But still the same voice.  Similar, very similar voice.  And this this new UI comes up with I think they're calling them smart cards.  It's kind of a white card with, you know, with the Roboto.  I think it was still the Roboto typeface and like, you know, kind of snippet from Wikipedia, from Google Maps or from whatever.  They're basically the one boxes but rendered.  One boxes but rendered for mobile.  You get bits of that already on the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you just do a straight web search on Google, if you search for weather, it'll give you an embedded thing in the browser on the right.  It works.  So they're just taking that and pulling it up more.  But they're giving you a button to go there if they get it wrong.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And really nicely done.  I think they said, you know, what movies is Angelina Jolie been in?  And they kind of came up with this, you know, nice kind of must must have been IMDb or just one of the one box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is the sidebar search stuff they've been doing, which is the.  Oh, right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The sidebar, the knowledge graph.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I suspect it's drawing on that stuff as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can see all these things kind of converging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's what now really showed me was they are going to take advantage of everything and kind of start to integrate it all together.  This would events kind of the invitations in Google Plus.  There's there really are starting to take advantage of everything they know.  Yeah.  We'll talk to you as well.  The one more thing on Jelly Bean is comes with Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. First device to ship with Chrome is a default browser.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yay.  The challenge they really need to do is to backboard Chrome to the other androids because the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they are offering it now for download.  It's in Play Store.  So it's no longer in beta.  Pardon me.  Only runs on four.  Oh, it doesn't run on the order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the problem we've got as a web developer on Android, you've got a bunch of these old Android browsers that are missing features.  So if you turn to HTML5 stuff, you'll find that one of them won't play audio properly or it says it will play audio where it actually have any codecs or there's pieces missing like that.  And because the update cycle for the browsers is tied to the OS cycle on Android, it means that they don't get patched over time.  So you're stuck with an IE6 type situation on Android where suddenly your crappy HTML5 browser is the one on most people's phones.  So this is something that the Fluent developer conference recently was the JavaScript conference.  They were already run.  This was a big bone of contention among people because they're like, great, we can do move to all this.  But we're leaving people behind.  But this thing is getting stuck in the past and bits aren't working well.  So hopefully if they can get this right, then they can go, OK, now we'll make sure that Chrome for Android runs on all the old Androids too and gets on the update cycle train so that they get all the features.  Then they'll be doing the web a big favor.  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did get the sense from some of the conversations we were watching on the keynote that they are aware of this fragmentation issue, that they really do want people to move to the newer versions.  They understand it's a problem.  But they did that last year too.  I mean, last year, they said 18 month.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What they said this year was that they have got a developer SDK for future releases that will be released so that you can port your hardware to map with it three months before the release of the thing with the assumption that that means the developers are able to do that.  And the question is, is that going to come with Jelly Bean?  They're going to show, oh, right, Jelly Bean will start running on my two year old phone or whatever.  Right, they're calling it the PDK, the platform development kit to port your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Jelly Bean is over there.  Update comes out for the zoom, the Nexus S.  What other devices?  A mid July.  So next month and open source mid July and open source mid July, which is very important.  Yeah, it was one of the other ones.  There was one other.  There was one other device and I don't remember now.  Galaxy Nexus.  Oh, so the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus S and I thought they said the zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many show of hands?  How many people have a zoom?  Nobody.  OK, not the zoom.  The zoom.  Ex zoom.  Ex zoom.  Ex zoom.  Still nobody.  Wait a minute.  There's somebody.  Max has one.  Max Rebo, Joseph.  OK, so there are a few people here.  Two, a few, two.  That's it.  They keep raising their hands.  It's the same two people.  Wait a minute.  Linux doc 66 has a zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I gave the one that I got in Google.  I know a couple of years ago to a friend and he was kind of like, thanks.  This didn't do so well on Gazelle.  Even Gazelle doesn't take them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to take a break and come back with more.  Gina Trapani in studio.  Love that from smarterware.org and thinkupapp.com and Kevin Marks from tummelvision.tv and salesforce.com.  Great to have you both here.  We're at the keynote.  We're talking Twig.  We're talking Google.  There's lots more to talk about in just a bit.  But first, let's talk Ting.  Hover has been a sponsor for a long time.  They're run by a company called TwoCast.  I'm sure a lot of you remember TwoCast.  Used to stand for the ultimate collection of Windows software.  It was a great shareware site for Windows.  It's so much more.  And Elliot Noss who runs TwoCast came down in I think last fall and said, we're going to do the same thing we've done with domain name registration with Hover.  We're going to do it with, get ready for this, the cell phone industry.  And he showed us Ting.  And I was blown away.  This is an industry that's ripe, believe me, for reintroduction.  Ting is going to change everything.  They're going to give you control of your cell phone bill.  They're going to give you great support.  They're going to give you transparency.  They call it billing clarity.  So you save money and you understand what you're paying for.  And let me just go to Ting.com.  Actually, if Ting.com slash Twig and you can find out, for instance, how much you would save.  They have a great savings calculator.  Go with your current cell phone bill.  But this is what I love about Ting.  By the way, Android phones, of course.  You choose the plan.  First, you choose how many phones you're going to have.  So it's great for business or family.  Let's say $6 a phone per month.  That's it.  Let's say four phones is a whole family.  And then I choose how many minutes those four phones will have from zero to $3,000.  Don't freak out about this.  You don't have to worry about it.  I'll explain why in a second.  How many text messages?  Zero to $6,000.  How many megabytes of data?  Zero to three gigs.  But it's almost like just this is what I think I'm going to use because here's the deal.  You can max all this stuff out, but here's the deal.  You only pay for what you actually use.  So they'll refund the difference if you pay more than you need.  And you could always pick zero across the board and then you'll just bill you for what you use that month without a penalty.  Without a penalty.  Creditor charged a difference from this price structure.  Also, voicemail, picture and video messaging, three-week calling, caller ID, tethering, hotspotting, all included at no extra charge.  So this is really fantastic.  So $24, I'm going to get, let's get a thousand minutes.  That's enough for the family of 4,000 messages.  That's got to do fine.  And I'll get two gigabytes of data because we like to use.  Maybe let's go all the way.  Four phones, $107 a month for four phones.  And if I don't use it all, I get a refund.  They've got some great phones too.  Now I have to, this is the, I'll tell you the negative.  They're not subsidizing the phones as heavily as some of the companies, other companies are.  But they do have great phones.  There's feature phones as well.  They have data devices.  They're running on the Sprint network.  So you know you're going to get great service if you get great service in your area.  Samsung Transform Ultra.  That's nice.  200 bucks.  Galaxy S2, $485.  And you could save $50 if you go to ting.com slash twig.  This is the way phone, I hope phone companies will operate in the future.  But right now they're the only ones that do.  Ting.com slash twig.  No overage penalties, great rates, multiple devices on a single plan.  Great for businesses and families.  And no fees or limits on how you use it.  That is just the way it is.  Very, very simple.  Thank you Ting for your support.  Thank you Elliot for doing such a great job there at Two Counts.  All right, we're talking Google I.O.  Gina Trippani is here.  Jeff Jarvis taking the day off.  Kevin Marks is also here.  Thank you for coming up.  Both of you.  I know you'd like to be back at Google I.O.  finding out about that API that they're never going to send you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A friend of mine is in one of the sessions.  I guess they're handing out little red cards with plus ones on them.  If you like the session, you drop it in the box at the end.  I like it.  It's a real life plus ones.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's cool.  I'll tell you what, I plus one.  Wow.  So Vic Gundotra is talking on a little bit, a little droning on about events.  This is a new feature in Google Plus.  And all of a sudden, Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google says,  wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm going to let you talk in a minute.  But first, Beyonce.  No, no, it wasn't that.  It was.  But first, let's show.  This is a time critical demo.  Yeah, that was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you ran on stage breathless, wearing the Google glasses and just like,  hey, you know, I hate to interrupt you, but just got something going on.  It's a little time sensitive.  And up on the screen, you see kind of an air balloon or like a zeppelin kind of hanging.  And we're like, my first thought was, oh, it's a Google Maps flyover.  They're doing something crazy.  It looks like that 3D thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it was actually skydiving wearing Google Glass Project Glass.  It was amazing.  Now, some people are saying, well, that must have been scripted, right?  I don't think so.  I think that that was time that the Hindenburg or whatever was called the zeppelin.  It's probably not the right name.  The zeppelin was right over the Moscone Center and it had to be when it was there.  Right.  I don't know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can steer it a bit.  They're not blown by the wind.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, why do you think it was so critical then that they do this at the exact time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they do at the exact time.  I mean, yeah, I mean, maybe they had to have gotten some sort of airspace regulatory kind  of permission for these guys to drop onto the...  So they...  That's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did they get permission to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had to.  So the four skydivers in a plane wearing Google Glasses jump out of the plane and land on  the roof of Moscone.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which was...  While doing a hangout, by the way, there's five divers and they're in a hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was one of the most incredible live demos.  Gutsiest.  Gutsiest.  I mean, just ambitious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, Sergey said this might go all...  This might go...  Here's the interrupt.  Wait a minute.  Let me...  You can take it from my screen if you can see my screen.  Can you see my screen?  Wait a minute.  Let me go back a little bit.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sergey.  I have a really cool event for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Sergey Brin wanders out in the middle of Vic's speech.  Guys, we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's not seen in public without the glasses now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to do something pretty magical here.  And we have a special surprise for you.  We've got something pretty special for you.  It's a little bit time sensitive, so I apologize for interrupting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The good news is that Vic is very poised and he can handle this kind of thing.  I don't know.  There's a lot of presenters who would have been completely thrown by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was actually really neat to see the difference between the two of them.  Yeah.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the reasons I like Google's keynotes, they're very real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They know they're talking to developers.  They're real.  They're genuine.  And the developers, I think, appreciate that.  They don't want to be marketed to as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they had these guys up in this zeppelin.  I'm told it's a zeppelin because it's a rigid frame, not a blimp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we can see that on screen, but they actually jumped out of a plane.  I think the zeppelin must have just been there.  No, no, no.  Oh, they...  Because I thought you could see the wing when they were coming out of it.  No, no, I think they jumped out of the zeppelin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the gondola underneath.  Because they were hovering.  Okay.  See, the wing is probably that little fin there.  So they have a couple of guys...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, you're right.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We just saw the shot up.  ...in the zeppelin.  And they had a hangout.  And they have squirrel suits.  They have those flight suits.  I know, those flight suits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those are so cool.  Yeah, those are so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They must have been able to steer that way a little bit.  He said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said, we can steer a little bit.  We've got to be over the top.  They did a perfect landing on the roof.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then they biked and rappelled and ran into the main hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here, I've got it on my screen here if you want to chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ...which is great for their landing.  I let you down here, and I thought maybe you guys could show us a fun time on the way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They skipped forward a bit because they took a while to actually jump.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looks like a long way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yes, somebody in the chat room was saying the quality looked too good for it to be Google Glasses.  But they had someone with a camera on as well.  You could see that they were cutting back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They cut to a much better quality picture.  The glasses do not have 3G or they're Wi-Fi only right now.  And so this is clearly not Wi-Fi.  I would guess that the glasses were connected to a pack that had 3 or 4G built into it.  Here he is.  They had to.  Coming down.  We speculated that it was maybe a live view, which we've used.  They have a very small unit.  It could have been.  There's other companies making something similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought I saw some wires kind of coming off the back of the ear that went down.  It's a very good image though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is from the glasses.  And then when they go to the ground, they cut to...  Then they have... you can see that's the camera guy.  And you can actually see the camera operators running around a little bit.  Here are the people landing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At this point in Scone, the whole hall was just like...  Like losing it.  Everyone was losing it.  But it was this like tense silence.  I mean, it was just... the energy was just ranked up.  They didn't know they had made it.  They didn't.  Well, it was clear.  Sergey, it was clear that he was not sure that this was going to work.  And he was amped and kind of breathless and excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is why you should do stuff like this.  Take some chances.  Absolutely.  Then they hand off the glasses to some acrobatic bicyclists on the roof who were going to...  Who actually took my breath away because they ride to the edge of the roof to a ramp.  This was crazy too.  And they jumped to the next building.  And they jumped to the next building.  Wait a minute.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  And you could tell the audience is kind of going, whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At this point, we were all just like, holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the best... there's never been... and now they're handing off the glasses.  Now, it's funny because as it turned out, this was a non-working prototype.  Sergey pulled it out of the pouch and nothing happened.  That's not the point.  Nobody's paying any attention.  So now this guy's going to rappel down the side of Moscone Center.  How did they get permission to do this?  How did they rehearse this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean...  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it seems they rehearsed it at Google.  No, I don't know.  They might have rehearsed it at...  Because they showed a video at the end of them doing it.  Yeah, doing some rehearsals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They could have done it in Moscone because it would have stopped traffic.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, look at that angle.  The guy running down the side of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sergey's telling the guy, oh no, we're not on the first floor.  He ran all the way to the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then he gets on a bike on the balcony and rides in on a bike and he runs people over in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They aren't going slowly into the hall either.  It's pretty clear that...  So this is not the glasses.  This is...  That's the glasses.  This is another stunt bike rider.  Yeah.  He now goes through...  A lot of hands.  He's running over the goes in the...  This is akin to the Olympic torch being handed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  Yeah.  And look, and they're riding through right outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm amazed nobody got clipped, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, this was kind of like me running up 4th Street on the way to the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And into the hall where you guys are.  That must have been very exciting.  It was exciting.  It was ridiculously silly.  It's showmanship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I have a press pass.  I'm sitting in the press section.  I'm trying to kind of keep my applause.  You know, I'm trying to be cool, right?  It was difficult though not to applaud for these people.  Pro tip.  Or if not the corporate tactics.  For a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For the human effort.  It's okay to applaud this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you gotta applaud these people.  This is not a product.  I mean, they just...  Yeah.  These are amazing.  It was an athletic feat.  And then this like, you know, crowd of glass wearing athletes kind of like strutted in  all badass and everyone was taking pictures and there were lights.  It was crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Before they do the slow motion walk video of this.  Because watch as they come in the hall, they look very studly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they do.  All of them look very studly wearing the glasses.  Yeah.  Very right stuff.  Yeah, it's like, oh, right.  That's pointing to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sergey handled this, I think, pretty well too.  He made it a little more exciting by being somewhat uncertain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he was uncertain.  He was excited.  He was...  I mean, he's...  I don't believe this is going to work.  He's a pilot, right?  He's really into flying.  So not that I've ever met a pilot that was ever in support of skydiving.  Why would you ever jump out of a purple plane?  We need the slow motion.  Yeah, but check this out.  This is...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the right stuff, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, people were going nuts.  It was pretty jaw dropping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a really good demo.  It really was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, man.  Absent that, we actually learned nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, we learned that you can take pictures.  But we knew you could take pictures.  We've been seeing pictures for months.  You can take pictures.  It's like, from your point of view.  From your point of view.  Did they mention that you can also take pictures?  Because you could just take pictures.  With your... from your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From your...  Look, here's a baby.  And that picture is being taken by the mother.  So, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the question is, how do you take pictures?  What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you just...  Right, I know.  Do you press a button?  Are you shrugging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said that it is gesture aware.  So you can go like this.  You could blink.  I don't know.  They said it's paying attention.  It's watching your gaze.  There was a picture of a runner's knees.  It scares me a lot of people.  See, a lot of the pictures from your point of view  aren't actually that interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I have to say that the baby video...  That was cute.  So the skydiving thing was great and exciting.  But not all of us are going to be skydiving,  rappelling and jumping across buildings every day.  Looking at your newborn who won't give a big bulky camera a smile.  Priceless.  Yeah, I mean that was pretty powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.  And the newborn looks back into your eyes because he's mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and the smile is because he sees mom.  Yeah, that's pretty powerful stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, I thought this might get the biggest roar from the crowd  at the very end.  And we're jumping ahead a little bit.  Vic comes back on stage and says,  oh, and by the way, we're going to let those of you here buy these.  Did you get excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was pretty excited.  I want to put those glasses on.  I was less excited when I heard $15 to $100.  When you heard the price, I was like, we're buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then $1,500, it was like...  Yeah.  And he said, it's not going to work very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, not going to work very well.  We only want people who really care enough about this  or as you said in the car up here, or who are really rich to try them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't even want to buy...  I'm thinking, can I expense that?  And then it's next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and then it ships next year.  So you order today, you can only order at I.O.  and then it ships early next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I have a text from Jason Howell of All About Android and TNT.  He's there right now.  He says, should I get the glasses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should you take a vote?  I think that what he meant to ask was, can I use the credit card?  He says, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He says, you want me to sign up for Project Glass?  You could have mine if you want.  Yeah, with my money.  Should I say yes?  Everybody in the chat room says yes.  I think you could.  Yes.  Do they keep your money or no?  They don't bill you till later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite tweet of the entire morning was Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Order one pair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tom tweeted Eileen in all caps,  Order the glasses!  Exclamation point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then they told us the price.  And as I remember, Tom said, Stop it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What it reminds me of was way back when I used to do video game development.  They would bring out a new console and you had to pay for the development machine.  Prototypes are expensive and one of things.  This is not an early manufacturing run.  The ones they're wearing, they probably were handmade.  This batch will be an early manufacturing run and it'll be flaky.  I think it's deliberately to deter.  They've set that price deliberately to deter.  People are going, oh yeah, sure.  It's like, oh, that's like a whole new laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Delta 9 is pointing out that I could probably sell it for $3,000.  Yeah, I mean that was right.  I could make a little money on the side there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to try to use that argument with my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When we're done, we'll sell it on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll make a profit, honey. Really. It's cool.  I probably will, actually.  I look like a complete dork, but really, we'll make some money from it.  I know I'm not attractive at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, but you cannot wear these outside the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, you can't wear these anywhere where we're supposed to look nice.  People trying on Sergey's glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is the only thing.  I mean, we still don't know even, is it Android?  Is it tied to a phone?  How do you control it?  We don't know anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Besides the fact that it takes pictures from your point of view and video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It takes pictures and video.  That's all we got.  And it's a decent camera.  Decent. The photos are.  Although, you take the sensor out of any Android phone, and it's not that big.  I mean, I could fit that sensor in all the supporting hardware and a small battery,  I guess, into something that would fit over my ears, right?  I believe there are things like this already.  If all you're talking about is cameras, isn't there a company that makes something  that is basically glasses that you wear that take pictures?  That doesn't do anything else.  Right.  So I don't think that that's particularly innovative.  We'll have to wait and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we'll get up there.  The assumption is that it's talking to a phone in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's my assumption, but I don't think they've even said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they've shown that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it Android in here?  Or is it a peripheral for your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or is it an Android accessory?  The designer said they wear way less than sunglasses, so the battery isn't in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they said the battery's in them.  I think I remember reading that the battery is in them.  It's very confusing.  If the battery's not in it, then you're having a wire leading from your glasses to your pocket?  Tell me that ain't so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look.  Okay.  I don't know. I hope not.  This is Sergey with a thing plugged into a wire going into the glasses, and Liz Ganz is wearing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the pickup so that you can see the output.  You know what? Let's call Liz.  Liz, what's going on with that?  All right. There's more to talk about.  There's lots more to talk about.  This was a long keynote.  We've now kind of shown you the really most exciting thing, right?  Yeah, well, there's two other devices we haven't talked about yet.  I'm waiting, and we're going to talk about that in just a second.  Also, Google Play has encryption now.  Okay, developer, explain to me why the developers would...  Does that mean there's that for security?  Yeah, I think so.  It's not any piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said it was a sign for that one, so that basically you could only decrypt it on that device that bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. The device ID is actually...  It's DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was what the... They went over it quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did go over it quickly, right.  But it was a way to embed the device ID into the APK, which is the application package,  to say, you purchased this on this device, it's only going to be installed on this device.  Personally, I don't care about this.  I turned this off when I uploaded my app.  I'm sure Game EA wants to know.  Right. The incremental app updates, I really like.  That I was excited about.  So only the parts of the APK, which have changed, get downloaded, which is great for everybody.  Less bandwidth, less installation time.  It's just great for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I assume they're using that smart compress they developed for Chrome that's really good at compressing code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I hadn't thought about that, but yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a good technical about it.  But basically, they looked at code and said, oh, right, code is really compressible if you understand code.  Right.  And you can compress it by...  If you understand what the address offsets are, or all the pieces where the jumps are,  you can actually compress it really easily, because then you can move it about.  If you don't understand that, all the address offsets don't work very well.  So you have to turn the absolute jumps to relative jumps, stuff like that.  So there's a bunch of kind of stuff that they built for that, which is deployed in the Chrome update cycle,  which is how they can do those updates so quickly.  So I think they've moved that brains into this as well, which would be really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really nice to see these things converge and to see different technologies kind of benefit one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Darren Murph writing for Engadget says, here's what we know about Google Glass.  They were able to talk to people at Google I.O.  Engineers are experimenting with connectivity options.  Existing prototypes, including those worn in the skydiving stunt, do not have 3G or 4G connectivity.  Although it is possible such a module could end up in production devices.  The general idea is latching on to nearby Wi-Fi hotspots or relying on a wireless tether with your smartphone.  So there you go, with a smartphone.  Controlling Glass will rely on a mixture of inputs.  It'll recognize voice commands while also taking cues from the right sidebar.  We've seen Sergey do that, to swipe his temple to do things.  The touch sensitive pad on there, they'll understand gestures.  It's also probable Glass will be able to be controlled by a Viya 1 smartphone, but physical inputs would be the preferred ones.  There's an accelerometer and a gyroscope, so you could nod or shake your head.  The internal battery sits just behind the ear on the right side.  There's the battery. Nice, nice. Good looking. Yep.  Capacity and longevity not confirmed.  Glass will be able to record locally, but the idea is to have most everything streamed live to the web.  Great. Take them off before you go to the bathroom.  In an area where wireless data is not available, storing video locally would be possible for uploading later.  So that's kind of inside stuff that they have confirmed.  Now they mentioned when they were talking about Play Cloud messaging.  Now I was really interested in that. Is that sending intents through the cloud?  Would that mean that I could control an app?  I mean they're close because Play will install. I can go on the web, say install it, and my phone starts installing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't clear what they meant by that. They said go to the session and they didn't explain it.  I'm assuming it's an iMessage competitor. That was my take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did it really quickly. It was C to DM.  C to DM, so cloud messaging. They just said free for all developers, no quota limitations.  But I still wasn't clear on what exactly it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an interesting thing that lets you send update notifications to the device, but I don't think they meant that.  I think they meant individual ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android Cloud to Device Messaging Framework, C to DM.  It's a service that helps developers send data from servers to their applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So like push messages from the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a lightweight mechanism servers can use to tell mobile apps to contact the server directly to fetch updated applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basically it means your app doesn't have to wake up and poll, so it should be good for battery life.  Instead of polling push.  Your server-side app can say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry. C to DM has been officially deprecated as of June 26, 2012.  It's now replaced by GCM.  Google Cloud Messager for Android.  So this supersedes that.  It does the same thing.  This could be lightweight messaging telling the Android application there's new data to be fetched.  So hey, I got something for you.  Or it could be a message containing up to 4 kilobytes of payload.  So you could use it for instant messaging.  Or tweeting.  4K is quite a bit actually.  Quite a bit of text, not so much for images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A very short piece of audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It handles all aspects of queuing of messages and delivery to the target Android app.  That's cool.  I don't know if there's an analog in the Apple world, but I think there is.  I think when they introduce notifications, they introduce some lightweight push.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any app that was going to update with new content could benefit from that.  And then magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the deadest audience response in the whole thing.  And we've got magazines! And he paused. Everyone was like...  Magazines!  I vaguely remember those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You print something... yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Movies for sale.  Not just rental. TV as well on the Play Store.  This was all sort of built up to...  The Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're both going to get one later today.  I was hoping that you would push forward in the line and you would say,  I want one, I'm going up to the BrickHouse, I need to bring it for the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you didn't.  It is a sea of very elbow-y backpack-laden nerds down there.  And they said they were going to start at 4pm.  So that line at 4... in fact I'm probably going to wait until tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I don't know if I'll be able to wait until tomorrow.  That is a very, very fast system on a chip.  They mentioned quad-core CPU.  And what did they say, 16 GPU threads or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some huge...  And when they demoed it, it looked fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really amazing.  Real-time 3D stuff. 12-core GPU.  Gyroscope, accelerometer.  Nine hours amended by the way, later to eight hours of video playback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you go to play.google.com right now, it's on the front page.  It's for sale right now, $199.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You keep yours.  You keep mine that's yours.  And I ordered one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is Google's Kindle Fire for the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not an iPad.  But more responsive I think than the Fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Google looked at the Fire and said, that's crap.  Have YouTube rented movies from the Google Play Store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do it from Apple all the time. Every day almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From Apple. From the Apple Store.  Right, but how many times have you rented something from the Play Store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never.  I've used the Amazon one. I use Amazon quite a bit actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use the free ones on Amazon quite a lot because I've got Prime.  Why not use Play? Because you'd have to watch it on your phone.  We're going to get to the solution to that in a second.  That is a shocking price. That's aimed right at Amazon.  Available next month.  $250, $249 for 16 gigs.  Targets straight at Fire.  And obviously, unless you feel like the connection to Amazon is important for you,  it's going to be a fire killer I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would agree. It has all the Google productivity apps built in as well.  So the Fire is very much a media consumption device, an e-reader watching.  But with this, you get Google Calendar, you get Gmail, you get all the Google goodness.  Maps, you get all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Kindle Fire is not a with Google Android.  It's an open source Android, which means that they don't get all those pieces  that you get by signing a deal with Google.  So they were making a thing about that. You get the full set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it will be ice cream sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes? I'm sorry. Jellybean.  No, 4-1 Jellybean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And presumably the Kindle app will still run on it.  Has Amazon done a video playback app for Android, Android, or only for Kindle Fire?  I think just the Kindle Fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was wondering about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's a very good point. I cannot watch Amazon movies on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I watch Amazon movies on this? I don't think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a very good point. Anybody in the chat room, can you watch Amazon movies on your Android phone?  I don't think so. Or on your iOS device either. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. The only reason why I use Amazon is I can download to my Tivo.  I suppose you can, but you've got to do it for the web and with Flash.  Right. Certainly you can do it on the web and with Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can do it on Google TV, and it's Flash and it crashes a lot.  Yeah, you get the awesnap. Yeah, a lot of awesnaps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of awesnaps on that. I always download Amazon stuff to my Tivo.  Which is paying because you have to say send to Tivo, and then you have to wait for it to download.  So I'm willing to switch to Google Play Store if I can get it on my TV.  Well, get ready because for a mere $300, you can get it on your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know why $199 seems like such a good deal for the Nexus 7,  and $299 seems such a bad deal for this cube, but it does.  They're the Q, I should say. It's anything but a cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it seems like a bad deal because that's three Apple TVs,  and the other thing that's two-thirds the price has a screen.  So it's like, what did you put in there?  And apparently the people were saying the cost is they put a really good audio amplifier in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now that's an interesting point. So there's a 25-watt...  If I care about it, I've got one.  Right. Even Sonos, which is probably the most direct competitor for this,  sells a Kinect, it's $350, it's a little more expensive, that lets you connect to the internet.  Sonos uses a proprietary network, not your Wi-Fi. It uses a mesh network.  And it doesn't have an amplifier in the Sonos Kinect, but I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, Apple says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have one of those and I like it because I'm into the Sonos ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Apple says two things here. Apple sells the Apple TV, which is $99, does this, does the TV...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can't hook it up to your own speakers.  You can, HDMI. You have to use an HDMI cable and go into your TV, which is all they said this did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is how I do it.  But Apple also sells the little Wi-Fi extender thingy that has an audio socket on it that they've sold for years.  Apple Airport Express.  That you can plug any headphone jack into and plug it to speakers or anything else.  And that's analog, yeah.  That's analog out.  And that's cheaper than... that's still... that's a hundred bucks or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the reasons it's so expensive, it's made in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes it is. Made in the USA. They made a point to kind of zoom in on that label, kind of on the inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it was great. That made me really happy. And, you know, they're pushing the social aspect of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, that drove me nuts. Who... Okay, you come over to my house, I'm playing some music, you take over my playlist. That sucks!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I come over to your house and say, Leo, did you see this kitten video?  You can add to it.  That's exactly what I don't want you to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see this kitten video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you don't do that with your friends. You don't go like, oh, and pass around the little screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do it with their play, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, have you seen this thing? Okay, use it.  And then you send it to their play.  Apple already has a solution.  But it's screen sharing. They're saying this is a playlist, you can see the playlist on the screen, you can manipulate it.  So it's kind of a turntable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dave MacDee in our chat room says, great idea, I have music listening parties with my friends all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and also movies, like, oh, hey, I bought this movie on the Google Play store, it's awesome, let's watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I would guess that's not going to work because I would guess, but I don't know, that the queue is logged into your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they said that it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you show up at your friend's house with your Android device and you say, hey, let's watch this movie, it pulls it from the cloud.  On my account.  Yeah, it pulls it from the cloud, it just says, yeah, it detects you can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the queue is not registered to the home user's account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the queue is registered to the home user's account, but when you log into it on the Wi-Fi, it inherits the accounts of all the people who were there.  Yeah, like it recognizes the devices.  That's cool.  So that was the neat part, and that's the piece, you know, and...  So I could bring a movie over in a friend's house.  Right.  I could pay for the movie.  It's doing, you know, it's doing, okay, I'm going to... back in my day.  When we did...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you bring cassettes over? Here, I brought a VCR cassette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The analogy for me is the thing we did with iTunes when I was at Apple, which was you can see all the machines in the room and everyone's connection and play that.  Right.  Right? And that was very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Even if you weren't attached, you brought a laptop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that actually did work over the net, but Apple had to turn that off because the labels got grumpy.  So I was somewhat involved with that.  And the version we shipped would play anything over any URL, and so you could actually subscribe to anyone's music anywhere, but it would find the local ones easily.  And then that gradually got turned off as the labels go, you can play music from other people's houses?  What the hell is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not going to allow that.  Now, you can buy multiple $300 cues and put them around the house and plug in your own speakers.  So it could have a Sonos-like...  So if you live in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, Sonos is up against, clearly.  It's dead on arrival.  It's just bizarre compared to the Apple TV. That's the piece that I didn't get.  I don't understand it in any respect.  Apple is selling something in every retail mall in America for a third the price.  Right.  It does the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they made this $99, it might have a chance. At $300, I think it has zero chance. Am I off base on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to play with it a little bit.  It doesn't have the screen sharing AirPlay thing. They explicitly said it doesn't do that.  And that is the other... Apple TV is worth buying just for that, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, what's the screen sharing AirPlay thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Apple TV, you can, from your iPad or your iPod or your phone, you can go to the bottom and say,  share my screen to that, and it goes onto the TV.  Oh, and so then whatever you're doing can be projected over there.  Yeah, that's nice.  That's become the way we do presentations at work.  Everyone has an iPad, and we just have one of those, and you just push into that and stuff gets shared around like that.  And they just announced at the Apple thing last week or the week before that the next version of Mac OS will be able to send to that as well.  Yeah, that's nice. So it doesn't do the sharing.  It doesn't do the screen sharing. The nice thing it does is you're not having to push.  The problem with the Apple Airport Express one is that you have to have your Mac open and iTunes running to send sound to it,  whereas this one is going to just queue them up and it'll pull them and play them.  So that is actually a better decision, and I can see that making more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But wait, for $400 you could buy a pair of bookshelf speakers on the Google Play Store that will then turn your Google queue into a stereo.  Right.  To me, the differentiator is the app, right? That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but amps are not massive magical things.  They're not expensive either.  And if I am the kind of person who cares about amps, I've already got a separate preamp and a separate power system and a whole bunch of expensive Hi-Fi kit from the expensive Hi-Fi kit store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Logitech is just saying, thank God we didn't license this. That's all I'm thinking when I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm assuming that at some point they'll go, OK, we license this, and you'll get third-party ones that don't have an amp in them. They just have an HDMI cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, is there technology in here that you could like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, it's Android. They said it was Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a little Android device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said it's running the same chip as the tablet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Also, it's micro HDMI. What kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not a standard... In fact, the connectors in general are a little odd. You have to have banana plugs for your speaker wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're banana plugs. They're not cable clamps.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that means there's going to be a sudden run of banana plugs.  I happen to have banana plugs at home if anybody wants to borrow them.  Micro HDMI, which is a type D HDMI. It's not a standard.  There's plenty of space. It has ethernet. I presume it has Wi-Fi. And then it has a Toslink. It has optical out.  I don't think this is particularly competitive. I think Sonos was here first. I think Apple TV, if you're price sensitive.  I just don't see this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure where it fits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially with Google TV.  Right. Which we'll see presumably tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, presumably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other piece is kind of a bit weird.  But this is the first device they said that Google has designed completely from the ground up.  You know what? It is pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got 39 LEDs that you can program to do anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do we say? It looks like the training device? The Jedi training device?  Yeah, who said that? That was a good line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a good line.  That looks like the ball that Luke Skywalker used to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or the Death Star, depending on how you want to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Use your mind, Luke.  There, it looks even better with the banana plugs in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have enough...  That looks like an Ood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a little scary looking. It looks like something's going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you remember the Ood? You've watched Doctor Who?  I don't watch Doctor Who.  They squid-like things like this and they carry...  You've watched Glee? Because that's a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why do you think you've watched Doctor Who?  Moving on. I'm skeptical about the Q.  The Nexus 7 does look like that. It's a winner.  They did add events to Google+. I've looked at them.  I'm not sure how that is compelling, but what it does to me, say to me,  is that they really are going to slowly make Google+. a hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything that deprecates Evite and Facebook events, I want to succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is their response to Facebook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's definitely their response to Facebook events.  And it looks pretty cool. What I like is that...  It's prettier.  The before, during, and after the event modes.  I like that a lot too.  If you're at an event with a bunch of friends who have Android phones,  then you can turn on party mode and everyone's photos get automatically updated  or uploaded to the event page, which is pretty neat.  Yeah, it looked nice. Hopefully it's less annoying than Evite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unfortunately, you've got to get all your friends on Google+.  I think that's really the deal here, is that they're just making it more and more compelling,  hoping that more and more people will get on+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can send invites to people by email, so you don't have to be on+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you won't get that cool picture sharing, will it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. Right, no, you won't.  But what's nice is that the Google+, app is going out for iOS and Android,  so it's not just... That'll work no matter...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to see what the emails invite someone who isn't running Gmail.  Yeah, I'd be interested.  What does it look like if you're Yahoo or Exchange?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, well, let me start one here.  The event is Let's Go Shoe Shopping.  Because apparently that's what the image is.  Unless that's elegant.  Shoe Shopping.  There's my Ood.  Oh yeah, with Thulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the Ood, but they have these orbs attached to them.  The Oob Orb. Yeah, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Location. Where should we go shoe shopping?  I don't know. I give up. I don't even want to do this.  All right.  You're asking me, Leo. You're in big trouble.  Zappos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should have made an event for this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I should have made a Zappos. You're exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should have made an event for the show so we could all be invited to it.  Oh, what a night to think of that. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There we go.  Let's see. Anything else to talk about?  The Wired magazine, I don't know how they did this so fast,  has a teardown already of the Nexus Q.  People leap into action.  And it's beautiful.  Are they starting a whole stage?  I don't know how they got it.  Oh yeah, that's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they must have.  There were a couple of stories that published about the Nexus Q before  that they started talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  32 LEDs on the circuit board here.  And that does the dancing lights.  Oh, and what did you think of the music visualizations?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trippy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Trippy. That's the word that left a mind.  Yeah, finally a parody with Windows Media Player.  So thank god we've got the Winamp module built in.  Anyway, Google Maps.  Well, actually right now already there's considerable updates.  I've got about a dozen new Google apps on my phone, including updated G+.  I don't like it quite as much.  It's not quite as pretty.  I like the kind of the slot look of the Google Plus on Android before.  Now it's a little bit more spacious.  We still have the kind of wacky animations.  It's kind of laggy.  I don't like it.  I really didn't like that.  It's now the sidebar instead of the slide.  Right, you like being in the middle.  This is more standard, I have to say.  I'm getting invitations.  And by the way, if you want to participate in these invites,  you do need to update the app because the old app did not do it, of course.  But now I can say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My Gmail inbox is packed right now with just all Google Plus invitations.  These are just folks that are...  I tried to put it in the app.  Yeah, there's going to be some cleaning up.  4,000 people are trying to organize lunch.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone I never heard of has invited me to chat.  Yeah, I'm getting a lot of invitations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ASD, ASD, ASD.  Jeremy's invited me to his birthday beer bash,  Richie's invited me to testing Google Plus events,  Robert's invited me to Fringe Circles,  Fringe Season 5 begins.  Look at all of these.  Yep.  Oh my goodness.  These are all invitations, folks.  Oh my, oh my, oh, oh, oh.  I don't think I can get to the bottom of this list.  I think it's a bottomless list of invites.  It looks like Kevin's notifications.  Holy cow, this is worse than Kevin.  Look, I'm only halfway through, folks.  Wow.  Oh.  These are the new notifications, actually.  It's not just invitations.  So I like the old Google Plus.  Yeah, you like the other one better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the old one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure I like this one as much.  Anyway, that'll be updated on your phone.  They also updated Maps.  Now has the offline feature.  And Google Earth now has the 3D feature that they talked about  just a couple of weeks ago.  That's already built into Google Earth.  It's a kind of update, but it just managed to not update G Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and lose it.  I just had a ton of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you know, it's been a little weird updating for Google Plus.  But I just had a ton of updates.  YouTube got updated.  All sorts of stuff they didn't even mention got updated on Android.  New York Times brings its content to Flipboard.  I mention that because Android now has Flipboard.  In fact, all Androids have Flipboard, right?  Right, right.  Which, that's to me what you're competing against when you're doing  magazines on Play.  Well, that thing looked very Flipboard-y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a little Flipboard-y, yeah.  Except its scroll was rather flipping.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like Flipboard.  I'm a big fan of Flipboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really didn't like that last iteration of G Plus when they went to everything  being like CinemaScope.  Yes.  It was like you were looking through a little slot at everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So apparently you're not alone because that's now gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But also I don't like the way that text is like third class citizen on there  and you can't read anything anymore.  Right.  It feels like a photo sharing app.  There's any notifications I've got popping up with tweets in I find really useful.  The G Plus app used to have the text bits being in text and you could actually  scroll through it and then pop them.  Now it is.  And now they're like, oh, we haven't got a picture.  We're just going to put some crappy text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, it's very image centered.  And truncate it.  See these nice green tiles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do feel a lot of pressure when posting to G Plus to have this like very  rich media post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess these are pictures that haven't loaded.  I don't know what they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read a huge rant about this in December I think.  Whereas I was saying because of G Plus, because of Facebook favoring images,  because of Twitter favoring images, we have these plague of infographics.  Right.  Giant bitmaps.  Right.  Anyone who wants to write an article has to put a photograph in it.  And you end up with this, you know, we're throwing huge amounts of bits  across the wire to say less.  Half the images you see in Facebook now.  Worth a thousand words though, Mckevins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Worth a thousand words.  You know what Trey Ratcliffe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're like 15 words badly rendered in a stupid font.  You're just an old fart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In fact, Trey Ratcliffe says something very interesting.  The photographer, and who has taken great advantage of Google Plus,  he thinks that in fact we are moving into a post-verbal world.  You're going to hate this, Kevin.  But then in fact images, which for, you know, hereditarily were very,  always very, very visual, important to us in a pre-literate society,  it's coming back that we're, I don't know if we're post-literate,  but that we're going to start using images to express ourselves more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, people already are.  That's true.  You know, there are people...  Who are much more visual than we used to be.  People were easy to do.  You can just pull a face at things.  You can do back or you can use my face when or wage faces or things like that  to send little emoticons.  But to the point where all the text that's being written is being rendered as images,  that's the point where we've gone too far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  You're posting text.  You post a picture of text.  Oh, I hate that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Instead of writing an essay, you create an infographic,  which is the essay with some really bad pie charts in it.  Right.  I see what you're saying.  I agree with you on that.  And it's not readable.  It's not, you know, it's not searchable.  It's not accessible.  You know, it's making the web worse.  And this feedback has been encouraged because all these sites haven't done the effort  to make good previews of web pages.  Right.  And if you post a web page, they give you like half the first sentence and a link.  But if you post an image, they go, oh, I'll take the whole image.  Beautiful.  So the feedback is fed the wrong way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google Plus app on Android is exactly that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you know, there is a role for that.  You know, Pinterest does that really well.  It says, we will express the web in a visual form.  And it makes sense in that realm.  But to inject it into these other things that are more texty seems like you're missing something there.  Right.  OK. Yeah, I'm a texty person. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Twitter's still my social media network of choice.  And that's text.  I mean, you know, they if you expand an image, they might show an image in line.  But that's just text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple wins a bid to block the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  That happened Tuesday.  California judge inshuted injunction banning sales of the Galaxy Tab in the U.S.  This is at the request of Apple, Inc.  Judge Lucy Koh wrote that Apple had made a strong case that Samsung had violated its design patent,  which describes the front, back and sides of a device that looks like the iPad.  It's the first injunction Apple has been granted against Samsung in the U.S.  Trial is coming July 30th.  This is the older older product.  The court said Samsung has been banned from importing the device or any other product that is no more than colorably different  and embodies any design that infringes Apple patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is depressing because I really had like thrown a spike in this last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought so, too.  But Posner is I think maybe swimming upstream.  He's a different. Well, he wasn't even working as a circuit court judge.  I think he was he was slumming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Apple has rights to the rectangle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently, Apple owns the four three rectangle.  The ban will go into effect after Apple delivers a two point six million dollar bond to cover damages.  Samsung would suffer if the court later finds the injunction was issued incorrectly.  That tells tells you how many pads they plan to sell.  It's only two point six million dollars.  Very. Yeah, it's I think it's a little disappointing.  And once again, the IP and patent wars go on.  We're to take a break. Come back with our picks of the week.  Gina Trapani is here. Thank you for coming up.  Really, I'm grateful. It's so cool to be sitting next to you.  Yeah, first time in the bridge house. Skype in San Diego.  Hey, also here, Kevin Marks, who is this your first time here, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, I've been to the college before. I haven't been here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. Well, we'll just have to have a party.  It's an upgrade. Let me send you an invite.  Meanwhile, I invite you to try Squarespace dot com.  Everything you need to create an amazing website.  And what I love about Squarespace is they make it really easy to try it out.  Let me explain, though. I think it's really important to understand what Squarespace is.  It's hosting and a content management system tightly integrated.  So a Squarespace site is always updated. It's always secure. It's always on.  You cannot bring a Squarespace site down because they're using some very sophisticated Java based virtual server technology.  That means they can turn on bandwidth as needed.  So it's I mean, it is the best hosting out there. I could say that unequivocally.  And the software is so cool. You get templates, eighty five plus professionally designed style variants from big name designers.  And the nice thing is that you can point and click your way to a unique looking website.  You don't have to be a CSS wizard to do this.  However, if you do know CSS, it's even better because they have a built in CSS editor with code coloring.  It pops right out. I mean, you could do anything on here. I love it.  They have the Google Web fonts, 300 plus Google Web fonts integrated in.  So you're you know, it's funny how what a small difference of a unique font can do to kind of make you stand out.  Most people use just a generic for fonts that you know, your browser is guaranteed to have.  These give you 300 plus new fonts.  They've got a great iOS and Android app that allows you to post, moderate, update, even get stats about your site all from your iOS or Android device.  It's a really, really nice device.  A really nice program, by the way, with full site previews. The works. You can really do it all.  So here's the deal. Go to Squarespace.com.  I don't even need to give you an offer code, just that green button.  And you don't need to give them a credit card, just your name, an email address, a name for your site and a password.  And you're ready to try Squarespace free for two weeks.  You have virtual run of the entire Squarespace feature set.  And then if you decide you like the site, it's very affordable.  They've simplified their pricing now.  They're standard and unlimited. That's it.  Now, standard is as little as eight dollars a month when you buy a year package.  But my recommendation is take a look at the unlimited.  For 16 bucks a month, it's hosting.  You get unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth and unlimited storage.  Plus, they'll do the domain name for you and hook it up so that it automatically goes to your site.  All of that. And if you use our offer code TWIG6, you'll get 10 percent off that first purchase.  So buy the annual plan and save more.  So buy TWIG6 for the month of June.  That's the offer code Squarespace.com.  The secret behind some really gorgeous websites, including our own inside blog, which we really have just loved using.  Gina Trapani, do you have a tip this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the tip.  Use E-vites. No, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Use Brightcove. Right. Right. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We already kind of covered this, but if you haven't checked it out already, like I said,  anything that deprecates E-vite and Facebook events on force.  Why do you hate those?  Well, I hate E-vite because they at one point, at least they spam.  Like I used a special kind of E-vite only address and then was receiving spam.  Facebook events just bugs me because I just feel like it feels spammy.  It just feels like I get a lot of notifications of things that don't really matter to me.  And they're also just not integrated into my regular kind of scheduling apps. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is nice because it works with Calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, right. It's integrated in Calendar, which we hadn't covered earlier.  So if you go to plus.google.com slash events, you can create an event.  You can check to see if the people who you want to go to the event are also free using Google Calendar.  It all integrates in your Google Calendar.  So once you've created the event, you can view the event on your calendar.  You see, you know, avatars are your friends who you've invited right there built in the calendar.  And like we said, you can invite people who aren't necessarily on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been invited to Wichita, Kansas for the Spider-Man premiere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, you can also spam your friends with lots of good vibes like that.  I've received quite a few invites.  Yeah, yeah. So maybe not today, but...  Don't send me an invite, please.  Oh, Google I.O. after hours at the training, Paul Oakenfield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now that's the one they talked about. That's pretty cool.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't get an invitation to that.  Right. That's going to be the first live...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I did.  You did. Yeah, you did.  Oh, good.  That's going to be the first live Google event.  By the way, 916 people are going so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, there you go.  Out of 3,000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure there'll be plenty of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Should I... Can I forward this to you, Kevin?  Can you forward?  And this is nice because you can check availability.  You can actually load your calendar.  This is only going to conflict with the virtual coffee party  that somebody's throwing in Wichita, Kansas.  So I think I'm okay.  I think you're all set.  I'm ready to go for a night of interactive simulations, hands-on experiences.  This is nice. I love the themes.  Look, they even move because that's the...  What do they call it? Cinemagraphago?  Yes.  Cinemagraphs, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's ridiculous.  Let's not make up a new word for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Shall we?  It's a cinemagraph.  That means there's a moving part of the picture.  It's an animated clip.  Yeah.  Yes.  I could stare at that for hours, but...  You're being hypnotized.  It's a record.  I'm hypnotized.  It's nice.  I like this.  Look at that.  Ooh, it's like a real paper invitation.  It's got a fold-out.  It's got a little piece of string you fold.  It's got a little piece of...  It's very skeuomorphic.  It's got some wax on it.  Yeah.  No kidding.  I want to seal.  It's got a map, and I can get directions.  This, to me, in a lot of ways, shows you how Google really doesn't tend to leverage all  of its assets.  This is actually a really useful idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem of moving stuff between email and calendar and all the other bits and pieces  drives me mad half the time.  Right.  This solves it.  Yeah.  And Microsoft has a solution from 15 years ago with Exchange and Calendar Integration  that kind of sort of works, doesn't quite, and drives you mad when you try and use it  on other devices.  So yeah, that's why I was saying, I want to know what this looks like on a computer.  I want to know what this looks like on Yahoo Mail.  I want to know what this looks like on an Exchange server.  So if I send these to people who aren't using Gmail, it'll still work.  That's the actual challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would guess this is HTML5, and probably is very similar, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the question is, what is the experience like?  Does it force you to sign up for G Plus to say yes to it?  Ah, that would be bad.  The thing that always bugged me about Evi is Evi was like, someone's invited to do something.  I'm not going to tell you where or when until you click on this website.  And I was like, well, screw you.  I'm not going to go then.  Right.  Whereas the Facebook ones work because they're integrated in the flow there.  So you can invite people there.  It always has a sense of who's there.  You can see the updates.  The model works for Facebook invite.  So I found myself using those to invite people to things because they work.  If I wanted something like this, I'd use Eventbrite and say, OK, I can invite a bunch of you here.  And you can say yes or no.  But it always feels more like I'm inviting you to something you're supposed to pay for,  because that's their default model.  So I think there is space to do this right.  And what I saw looked good.  And I'm waiting to play with it a bit and see whether it behaves well.  And there's a little bit of doodle.com in there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can see, like, show me the times when my friends are available.  Yeah, like it'll check on people's calendars.  Yeah, free busy.  Yeah, free busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all you get from the exchange thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some people did say that, well, I can see, for instance, that when I look at who's not going to this party,  that one person not using Google Plus is not going to the party.  So I don't think you have to join Google Plus.  Now, they don't have a picture.  They don't have any information.  The sad blue default.  Just a sad blue outline.  But at least they were able to respond without, presumably, without joining Google Plus.  So that's a good sign.  Some people said that this kind of replaces Schemer.  Do you think that that's the case?  I don't think it's the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Schemer's more like bucket list.  Bucket list, yeah.  Yeah, bucket list kind of things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and I will look forward to seeing all the photos for the Google I.O. party.  That would be kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be cool.  So you can sort of experience the event if you're not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm going to say, no, well, I could go.  Maybe I should go.  Now I'm tempted.  Sounds like a good party.  Jason's not going.  I can see who's going and not going.  Yeah, come down with us.  Yeah, screw the show.  I'm just going.  I'm taking off.  You have a number in place of Mr. J.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to throw something else into, which was the face recognition of the cats.  Did you see the story this week?  Cat face recognition?  What is the world coming to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Put the link in the notes so I can look at it.  It sounds right up my alley.  I could look on it, but I will click on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a paper that Google released this week where they're trying to do some fairly  low-level brain modeling research.  So they're building a neural network and they're training on images, but they're not giving  it a feedback loop.  They're just saying, here's a randomly wide neural network.  Let me show you an image.  Let it relax.  Show you another image.  Let it relax.  This one has a face.  That one's a dog.  That one's a frog, whatever.  They're just ...  So it doesn't learn at all?  So it learns, but it's not ... It hasn't got a training set.  They're just feeding it random images.  After they've fed it lots of images from YouTube, they then look at the neurons and see what  the neurons are specialized to.  They found a neuron that ... You can see the picture there, that looks for faces.  Basically, that's what it responds to.  So they actually created a neuron.  So they looked at all the neurons and then they fed it things like, what is this one  responding to?  Oh, that one's found faces.  They did a map of what its response wiring looked like, and it found that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Now, this is a machine, right?  This is not a human or a cat.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a better picture of this in the Google blog yesterday.  This is the cat face neuron.  The cat face neuron.  And the human body neuron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the cat face doesn't really look like a cat.  It does in the Google blog.  It's just not a very good image on the PDF.  The body, you can see, it has a very genericized human body.  So what have we learned here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not so much what we've learned.  It's that they've got close to modeling how the brain works in a useful way.  That's the piece that's kind of interesting because there's the better cat face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it does look like a cat.  Oh, where is that?  That's in the Google blog.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically ... It looks like a tabby cat, doesn't it?  So there was a long-held theory of brain research that you have specialized neurons that will  fire when certain things happen.  And you'll have one for faces and one for your mother and stuff like that.  And they found one for human faces, they found one for cat faces.  And by throwing them random frames from YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what you're saying is that this was a clean slate.  This thing had nothing.  There was no pattern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't like the thing in your phone that says, I'm looking for a face.  A face has two circles and a line.  And then when the thing underneath is curvy, that means it's smiling.  It wasn't a thing like that.  They had a template.  A template.  They just showed it lots of random frame grabs from YouTube.  And one of the things they found was the one that was looking for faces, another one that  was flying when they found cats.  And they wouldn't fire every time, but they were fairly good at detecting them even if  you were rotated a bit or doing something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it turned out 70% improvement in accuracy doing this over ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Over the previous attempts to do this kind of thing.  Wow.  So that's interesting.  And the other thing that's set off in my head is, right, oh, right.  And then when you're carrying a camera around on your head that's looking at everything  all the time ...  It's doing a lot.  There's a big data set, isn't it?  You can join a few dots up there and go, oh, right, Google's going to work out what everyone's  looking at all the time and decide which one's a cat and which one's a face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I think Google has to get a little more sensitive to the creepy factor.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They need to understand what real people might think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The glasses demo was very good at suppressing the creepy factor.  Right.  You know, the shots they carefully chose.  It was babies.  It was nice babies.  It was babies and pelicans flying past and people skydiving at a zipline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if Google knows you're shopping for pants because it can recognize pants, only because  you were wearing those glasses all the time.  Right.  And if you suddenly ... it will have a high creepy factor if you don't understand how  Google knew I was shopping for pants.  That's what makes it creepy, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, true.  The other thing they said about the Google Now thing was that it would ...  Based on your searches.  You have to tell it what your favorite sports teams are because it knows what you've been  searching for.  That's not ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's ...  And they have tone deaf to how creepy that sounds to real people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if they show you in the interface, this is how we know, you know, like you're based  on your last search.  Like, I feel better when I know, you know, why am I seeing this ad?  Right.  Why are you suggesting this to me?  How did you know that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is how I knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is better than ... yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm not saying it's bad.  I'm worried about what their AI will think about stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they were saying things, oh, we worked out what your commute to work is and there's  a roadblock this week, so you should go this other way.  They're starting to give you stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, there's a creepy factor to autonomous vehicles too.  I think somewhat Larry and Sergey go, yeah, we understand it because this is new and it's  creepy because it's new and ill understood and you're perhaps anthropomorphizing it into  being a human being that's actually looking at you and you'll get used to it.  You'll get ... same way you'll get used to a car driving itself.  Right.  And in the long run, it will be better, safer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, one of the things they cited in this paper was trying to tell the difference between  a motorbike and a car.  So it's something they're thinking about.  That's probably part of that as well.  So you said a number of the weeks, the number I've got, which was a BBC news story, was  that patent trolls cost US companies $29 billion in direct measurable costs last year.  There you go.  There you go.  Dad?  They looked at all the lawsuits from the non-practice entities, the patent trolls.  Appalling.  Worked out how much that cost and that was the ...  If it's one billion, it's too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a lot of potential startups.  29 billion is a lot.  Exactly.  There's a lot of potential startups.  Think about how much innovation can happen with that money.  That's a lot of innovation.  Not to mention the chilling effect that we can't measure.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just the ones that they could measure.  This is actual costs.  They say that.  You could multiply that up.  So that was my ... I'm going to do something about these patent stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff tries to give us positive numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a downer, Kevin.  I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one of them up numbers.  I don't know where to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are so many new tools and new exciting things.  I don't know where to start.  I would say immediately if you're using Android, go out and update your Play Store because  there's a lot of new updates on the apps.  All the Google apps have been updated.  I'm hoping that we will have a seven because I have a feeling that may end up being a really  cool device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a note in the dock for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a note in the dock for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  I have to do an ad.  I thought you were going to say something about how cool it was that there was a Nexus  7 sitting at the door for me or something like that.  No, I do want to mention backing your data up with carbonite.com.  I don't know how I forgot about that.  This is the ideal way to back up because it's automatic, it's continuous, and it's online.  Plus, it's cloud storage for less than five bucks a month for everything on your internal  drive.  $59 a year.  That's how much it costs for an individual computer.  They have plans for external drives, multiple computers, small businesses.  Here's what I would suggest.  Go to carbonite.com.  You don't need a credit card, just the offer code TWIG.  You can try it for two weeks.  Mac or PC, see how you like it.  If it's doing what you want, if you feel good about that, then when you sign up with the  offer code TWIG, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12, like 59 bucks a year.  Awesome.  Carbonite.com.  The offer code TWIG.  If you're not backing up, just do yourself a favor.  Just go there right now and set the backup up.  The piece of mine is fantastic.  You will have a crash.  Chad says, thank you, Gina, for not letting Leo forget that.  That's my product of the week.  Darn it.  Carbonite.com.  Thank you, guys.  We do have Jason and Eileen and Ron from All About Android are at Google I.O.  They're going to have a very good All About Android show, and I do think they're going  to come back from the event with some stuff, maybe a little ball-shaped force field tester,  I don't know, and maybe a little tablet.  They gave you a Nexus.  What are you going to do with a Nexus phone?
