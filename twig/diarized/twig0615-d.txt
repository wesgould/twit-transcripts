Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Make it so.  Does he have a nice kitchen?  A particularly nice kitchen?  Oh yeah.  Well you say that as if, oh yeah of course he does.  Well what do you expect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's going to have a crappy kitchen?  Well I don't know.  He might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm thinking.  It's unchanged since the icebox.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm just thinking Craig Newmark doesn't eat in much.  If I were Craig Newmark I'd be living at Cirque.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well Eileen Newmark has tastes.  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh there we go.  There is a lady of the house.  There you go.  There is.  And then there's Anne Pruitt of Hands On Photography, fametwit.tv slash hop.  Hop.  How you doing sir?  And I'm Craig Newmark on this show.  It's good to see you.  I'm wonderful.  Saw you this morning.  Sneaking out of the building.  It's nice we're slowly getting people to come in, come back.  I'm very happy about that.  I had a good Floss Weekly this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Who was on this one?  And I don't mean Floss in my teeth.  Talking about our show.  Floss Weekly.  Who was on Floss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That is the first place my brain goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well that's kind of the pun.  That's why I named it Floss Weekly.  I thought oh get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So this was a guestless show so it was just the three of us.  Oh just the news.  Quite a spirited conversation between the three of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Aaron Newcomb who's wonderful.  Sean Powers, Doc Searles talking about lots of stuff including higher education and Anom.  Which is the name of the encrypted messenger program that was actually being run as a honeypot  by the FBI and the Australian Federal Police.  They busted a lot of people.  Although get ready because it's been such a success that the federal government in Australia  is already saying hey this really worked well.  We should really have a back door to all encrypted messenger programs.  It was only a matter of time.  I expect the same things from the FBI.  It's a clever idea and it basically plays on the idea that crooks are dumb.  I remember a security service agent told me that some years ago.  We were talking about how do you get the passwords?  How do you get them to give you the passwords?  And he says most of these guys just give it to you.  You hear about this.  Isn't that crazy?  There are a handful of cases where people are holdouts and stuff and they go to jail  for years because they're not cooperating.  Most of the time they just say yeah monkey one two three go ahead have at it.  Law enforcement officials said users had flocked to the app after other encrypted messaging  services like EncroChat which was widely used by all kinds of criminals.  In fact that's the one we showed you with the Stilton cheese and the fingerprints.  Oh yeah.  It was shut down by authorities and now it comes reinstalled on phones.  This is why it worked with phones you buy in the black market.  You know kind of burner phones.  There were what's interesting is the FBI was charging for this six months contracts up  to two thousand dollars.  Lots of money.  Maybe that made people feel better like all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey Joey we're going to use this encrypted app.  It's got to be good.  It costs four thousand dollars a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There were twelve thousand Enom enabled devices.  In fact the way you got it you had to have an existing user invite you in.  Very smart right.  Oh this is so smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I love it.  It broadens the network.  It's network effects for law enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Joey Cannon Ball's Graffitooli said it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I'm in.  I got it.  It was cooked up in 2018 by US officials and Australian officials.  They actually were encrypted but there was a master key a back door so that the FBI and  Australian law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What made them because of the indictments they had the jig was up on the app and they  couldn't keep using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I guess.  Well it's funny because they just arrested everybody in a big bunch.  Well why is it this entrapment?  It's not entrapment because they know.  I said why.  It's not because.  Okay why.  Because they didn't solicit anything.  They just gave them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh okay so entrapment.  Okay I got you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They didn't.  It wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The cops going home saying I left a thousand dollars in my sack drawer if you want to steal  it.  It was here.  You know they didn't even say you know.  No I don't think it's entrapment in any way.  It's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It wasn't free either.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  And Riff Raff come in and you listen to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Welcome Riff Raff.  Hello Riff Raff.  Welcome to the Riff Raff Bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The place for Riff Raff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Anon was available at first in a limited number of countries.  Eventually though in 90 countries.  Most users in Germany where they're very.  Right Jeff.  Very privacy focused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Garten schutz.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Crazy.  Crazy.  And Serbia.  An international coalition all at once arrested 800 people.  Everything from triad.  The triads in Asia to South American drug cartels.  In one of the largest operations Operation Ironside in Australia.  224 people were arrested on 525 charges.  They shut down six clandestine drug labs.  21 threats to kill.  Including one that saved a family of five.  So it.  And look at that marijuana.  I'm so glad they're still arresting people for for smoking the wacky weed.  You know you must you really.  It's got to feel bad if you get busted for pot in New Zealand.  You know it's like.  But wait.  It's legal in the US.  Cases from Europol the European police agency said.  8 tons of cocaine were seized.  22 tons of cannabis and cannabis resins.  Two tons of amphetamine and methamphetamine.  Six tons.  You get 18 tons.  What do you get?  Synthetic drug precursors and firearms to 55 luxury vehicles and 48 million in worldwide

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  currencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So wow.  Clarence sports car.  Handguns rifles with scopes.  All sorts of stuff.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  All that is in the bad boy handbook.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Bad boys bad boys.  Don't use a nom.  Apparently what the biggest catch was a guy who's been on the lam for 10 years.  He's suspected of being a high level drug trafficker who controls the flow of imports  from Turkey.  Hakan Ayik.  He has not been arrested but they were able to dupe him into becoming an early adopter  of the app and promoting it to others in his network.  Hakan says this is the greatest.  He essentially set up his own colleagues.  By the way even though they haven't arrested him yet he's living a lavish lifestyle in  Istanbul where he got plastic surgery so they can't recognize him.  But they're telling him you know all those people you told you should use a nom they're  coming for you.  So they're urging him turn yourself in before you could become a target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that.  Don't be holding up any pictures of Stilton Blue Cheese.  No whatever he is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So anyway I thought I actually did not plan to start with that but it is a big story.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We have found out that the president is former president.  Well might be president again in August I'm not sure but anyway the former president former  until August will be suspended from Facebook now for two years.  Facebook responding to the oversight board which said OK the suspensions OK but you really  should have had a term a limitation on it.  So they've decided two years tonight.  Do we do this last week.  No we didn't because last week you had the false rumor that he was already up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I fact checked while we were on the air.  Thank you.  And it happened the next day I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The next day they said so it seemed like it was I don't know it was related I don't know.  Anyway so he will two years so the initial suspension was January 7th the day after the  insurrection this year.  So January 7th 2023.  Just in time to run for president he will he will be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe and maybe they say unless he continues to have to they have to judge his behavior.  Yeah.  Two things about this one Facebook has always said we don't judge behavior off platform  but because he's off the platform and they have to know how else they can back they can  only judge his behavior off platform.  It's very interesting.  Yeah.  Second you know this is a case where I think the original decision was better.  I thought indefinite was much better.  See how you behave.  It's up to us whether you come back or not.  But it was the oversight board that insisted that was awful.  And so now there's a date set where they'll have to judge it and it's just going to string  it out I think in another way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But Jack Dorsey glad there's no Twitter oversight board because he did in fact say he's never  coming back.  Yeah.  Facebook at the same time announced the politician.  This was a stunner.  Politicians posts were exempt from Facebook rules preventing users from engaging in harmful  speech.  You're a politician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Well it was the news where the argument is it's a new and the same argument was was was  debated at all the platforms.  The news were the argument says the public has a right to know their miscreant ways.  Yes.  And I kind of understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  But they're using it to incite.  That's different.  You're inciting people to do bad things.  Clearly there's a responsibility on the platforms part to keep you from doing that.  But if you're like the Nigerian president who said you know you should kill all the  people in the south of the country I guess that's inciting to Twitter in fact pulled  down the his that tweet not the account but pulled down that tweet and is now banned in  Nigeria as a result.  So I think incitement is a good reason.  If people are going to get hurt because of what you say that's a good reason.  So let me ask you a question.  Anyway Facebook's reversed that policy.  They say politicians are will no longer be exempt.  But as you know everything's spongy and soft with Facebook.  Oh absolutely.  It gives them room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about a garden party standard that you don't have to incite people to imminent danger.  Obedience.  But yeah just to say no this is no I don't want that here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here's the example I'd give you.  If you're if you're a politician and you're an elected politician and you're in office  and you say a bunch of dumb hateful stuff.  I think the electorate needs to know you're saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you agree with the newsworthy and a standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  In the sense that as long as you're not telling people go do don't hurt somebody or go you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  know tell your spreading lies about hydroxy chloroquine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well I don't mind a warning on it.  That's different.  But what if you say I think you're saying I think black people are dumb.  I think the electorate has the right to hear you say that out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't you think.  But then again I agree with you on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You would want to know that right.  Right I want to know who I'm voting for who I'm not voting for not just based on what  those ads show and promote all of the warm and fuzzy stuff.  I'd like to know some of the other things.  You know who Louie Gohmert is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know who Louie Gohmert is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to send him into orbit sir.  Can you stay off the rock and just send him up please and not back one way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You lived in Austin.  Was Louie well respected in the Texas politics representative from Texas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No all of our politicians are bad.  Sorry I can't say that word.  This is an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He's in the House of Representatives.  This is an example.  He's this is during a House Natural Resources hearing.  Listen to Representative Gohmert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so is there anything that the National Forest Service or BLM can do to change the  course of the moon's orbit or the Earth's orbit around the sun.  Obviously that would have profound effect on our climate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wait what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would have to follow up with you on that one Mr. Gohmert.  She's laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A first grade teacher.  She's laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is like this is the face that they made when Trump was like could we just like inject  bleach at people.  This is crazier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah you like change the orbit of the Earth or the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They're kind of equally crazy but yes I'm not saying.  I can't evaluate those crazy statements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  In any event I think that this is not harmful.  It's not like there's going to be some coalition to move the Earth.  You found an example.  But I think people who elected Louie Gohmert should know that this guy they elected to  the Congress thinks you can change the orbit of the moon in some way that would be beneficial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When I first read that tweet I thought he was saying Black Lives Matter was trying to do that.  Yeah Bureau of Land Management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I will say there are people in Texas and there are plots of movies and science fiction shows  where you throw a nuclear bomb at like a comet or something and it evades the Earth.  So I can see people thinking that is not as crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacy you're being far too nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No I literally just had a conversation with someone who kept talking.  We were talking about the M1 chips.  They were like now that Apple's building their own silicone and I'm like and I didn't want to correct them  because it's not a hill I'm ready to die on.  I would say oh yeah.  But he just kept going.  He was he was really into silicone.  I know it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I just say bless his heart.  There you go.  That is what that phrase is for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Bless his heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bless his heart.  You've learned your lesson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Silicone is for breasts.  Silicone is for computers.  It's very simple.  Don't confuse the two.  I'm sorry I said that.  I really am.  And you could just say bless his heart.  He's just clueless.  That's like the people who say I don't want the vaccine because then you could follow me around.  Wow they carry a cell phone and a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's like okay.  Yeah.  And they post everywhere that they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't want you to follow me around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Having coffee at Starbucks right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Twitter blue is official.  We thought it was just a rumor but it is it's already happening in Canada and Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay.  I was like it's not here yet.  Now I'm really curious.  It's like even with the tips and things like that and I actually just saw my first instance of hey if you want to see this person's tweet it was part of the replies that I would have to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's super follow.  That's another thing.  Oh something else.  So Twitter blue is a $2.99 a month.  Well we don't know it'll be in the US.  It's $3.49 in Canada.  $4.49 in Australia.  We don't know what it'll be in the US but the rumor was $2.99.  It is gives you three three four things a bookmark folder.  It's like the stupidest thing ever.  A bookmark folder so you can organize tweets you save like a little wallet.  Maybe I'll give you a little like I say my books behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can have a shelf for my tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now this might be useful reader mode that makes it easier to read those silly long threads.  Okay.  Yep.  You can customize the Twitter app icon on your phone.  No make it green if you want access to color themes for the Twitter app.  No.  And if it forbids dark mode only sir and dark mode only no dark mode and dedicated customers customer support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus I thought the undo tweet the under tweet under tweet undo tweet which is basically delay tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah it's just like on Gmail you get a timer up to 30 seconds.  It's like it's like a nanny like OK count to 10 before you tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's not a bad idea actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It is a great idea though.  Would you pay them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No because I well I don't if I'm drinking I don't tweet and thus I don't ever have a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No drunk tweets or if you're if you're I don't follow that rule.  No meat sweat tweets either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Jeff I don't think you're I don't think your drinking is going to change from the irascible tree tweets that might come out when you're upset.  Hey who you calling irascible.  Oh you are charmingly irascible.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Irascible is such a good word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I once got someone mad for calling him irascible and then he was very irascible.  It was amusing.  You know so when years ago when when we started Epicurious we were thinking about trying to create some premium products.  I remember the brilliant editorial head Joan Feeney was thinking about all these features and all these features and all these features and all these features and finally she just realized the thing that's valuable is the recipes.  Either we charge for that or we don't.  That's a good point.  Good point.  I sense that Twitter is trying to say what else could could be of any value.  What's value.  Yeah what's value.  And some of it is things that you know a better layout for conversations.  Why would you charge for that?  Everybody should have it.  So I'm fine to imagine I value Twitter greatly.  I can imagine paying for Twitter and being happy to do so.  I don't want a premium Twitter for everybody.  I don't want a paywall around Twitter.  That'd be ridiculous.  But I don't know that this catalog of goodies is itself motivating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I liken it to our Club Twitter where really the whole point of Club Twitter was support Twitter.  Seven dollars a month and it helps us out.  But we thought you throw in you've got to give people something so they get your pitch.  Your pitch is supported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And then you get ad free versions.  I mean there's something for everybody the discord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But I got to tell you sir we're offering more at Club Twitter than what this is proposing.  Oh yeah.  We offer for three dollars a month.  Yeah but we cost twice as much.  And we're offering a lot more.  Ant you have Leo Laporte who you can't get on Twitter.  Ant's making the case for ten dollar Club Twitter.  I value Twitter but three dollars a month is just that's not doing it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But how about just to support them because you think it's a good thing and if you don't support them there you're going to be out of business or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Or aren't they getting support from me based off of my behavior activity.  This is a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Somebody made this point on Twitter on Sunday.  Is but wait a minute.  That's one thing you know if sub stack or whatever charges for this.  But the Twitter's whole business there their recipes are my tweets.  Exactly.  They're selling my content really.  So you're asking me to pay so I can post my content on your site is a little backwards maybe.  Well here's the other the other thing that Twitter is going to do which is called super follow.  This is what you were thinking of.  Offer your followers something extra and earn money every month.  They get access to a more personalized experience with bonus content and you get paid for what you create.  It's a win win situation.  Basically it's it's you know like Patreon or anything else.  Special labels on the profiles and tweets of your paying fans so you can see that and you may answer them more readily.  It'll highlight in your answers bonus content that you can say oh you only you will get my exclusive tweets and newsletters.  Notice we knew that Twitter was looking at this because they acquired a newsletter company and further options are coming according to Twitter profile badges.  Perhaps other connection options you know other ways to to to DM.  Twitter will also display an earnings estimate to lure creators with a slider showing how many of your followers you'll need to sign up to earn a certain amount of money.  It also shows how much money out of this that Apple takes.  So if you're any question about how much of that's going to Apple there are you choose a category.  By the way there are adult content categories because that's what makes money on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yep yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So basically it's Twitter going after only fans I think there are a lot of people on I heard I've heard people have told me there are a lot of people on Twitter who post post nudes of themselves or semi nudes saying for more follow me and only for you.  Oh yeah that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's totally a thing.  And there's a whole class of yeah and there's a whole class of they're not really startups their features that offer you a bio page where you can send because like on you can't stick URLs and things in your Instagram.  Right.  Yep.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  People use Instagram tick tock and Twitter basically promote their their nudes on only fans I think that's I see a lot of that on tick tock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't see anything man my tick tock for you page is so wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's because tick tock knows you Stacey.  No seriously.  No it knows because it's very much watching what you're watching and how long you watch it it pays attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh no I know but it thinks I am the see I get a lot of and I don't mind this but I get a lot of content for for gay women.  I get a lot of content related to animal.  Do you drive a Subaru?  No.  No well I live in the Pacific Northwest so that is my next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's actually really interesting that tick tock thinks you're a gay woman maybe that's so that's not what I understood tick tock's algorithm to do which is is based on what you look at.  But maybe it's collecting information maybe I mean it shouldn't be on your location.  That's silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean I do follow people who are gay but mostly because they're hilarious and they're not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well they don't know why you're following somebody so that could be you're setting a lot of language content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They don't make it a decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Sorry it's still hit or miss on me far as what my likings are.  I don't care for all of the what is it the duets and stuff like that that people do I care for the lip sync.  You would be like that.  You would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That to me I feel like I paid him to that's that's premium.  I need to come out I pay them.  Harris with music.  Yes.  Yes.  There you go.  Now that's a business model.  And he's see shandy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think unfortunate in fact I took tick tock off my phone because and I'm going to this is a confession here so.  Don't mock me.  All right.  Oh yeah.  Oh is that a rattle or cantankerous which is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh thank you.  Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  By the way.  Honorary ornery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

I'm not saying they're wrong.  I'm just saying I don't in my mind I don't want my TikTok feed to be lots of people in  bikinis.  So that's why I got rid of TikTok because.  So what am I supposed to do.  You're supposed to as soon as you see it you have the discipline to do that Jeff.  You go no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  I don't want it to do that.  I know I don't want it to do that.  It does do that.  I'm afraid it's somebody who may be underage or something.  I know I don't want to see it.  Yucky.  You can't hide your eyes.  So what do I have.  I have a really cute dog running into leaves.  I have another cute dog singing.  I have a guy brushing a bull's chin to make him pretty.

Transcript:  Yeah he's got a quarter million likes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Twenty nine thousand followers.  One of his one of his videos has has close to a million views.  Seven hundred twenty five thousand views.  So you know he he really wants to make this work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is that?  That's what I get on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh Lord.  But if you look who I follow on TikTok I don't follow anybody in bikinis on TikTok.  I follow you know interesting stuff.  So Jackson Brown you know I mean so Roger Roger Waters is my husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Get your feed from this more people like the ones that you follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But but I have to tell you TikTok it's not who you follow.  Maybe it somewhat is.  It's really what you do when you're they know that your true self comes out when you're scrolling at night and three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think what happens to me is sometimes I get caught up watching a train wreck.  So they'll exactly train wrecks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Exactly.  And so what they're playing on is the natural sad but natural human rubber necker instinct.  Right.  If you know you're looking for an accident and so I don't.  Anyway that's why I took it off because my train wrecks tend to have clothes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Rick Codd's.  Rick Codd just sent us a train wreck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  He said here he says this is this I can't if I see this I can't stop watching.  I have to just have to see it.  Yeah.  By the way he is very good.  He's very quick on the animated GIFs.  He's like I'm depressed.  Gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gifts.  Animated GIFs.  I'm crying on that hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Gifts.  GIFs really you think?  I'm pro GIF.  Yeah.  Here's.  Stacey and I.  GIF is a peanut butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For peace in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Otherwise something may explode and change the orbit of the earth and we can't have that.  The only thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay there's a couple of problems with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't first of all think we can change the orbit of the earth or the moon.  I don't think we have the ability.  But even if we could would it be good for climate change or bad?  Maybe it'd be bad.  Maybe you'd send the earth out away from the sun.  Yes we wouldn't have global warming.  We might have global cooling.  I'm just saying.  It's tricky.  I mean.  It is.  Yeah.  This is.  It's tricky.  You got to be very careful if you're going to change the earth's orbit.  You got to be very tricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And where does astrophage come into play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  We'll look into that for you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What a shock.  So, Stacey, I'm sure you had some thoughts about Apple's WWDC.  We were all excited.  Maybe they're going to announce new hardware and stuff.  In fact, they didn't.  They just talked about Mac OS Monterey, their new version of the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Do they ever launch hardware at WWDC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  65% of WWDCs they launch new hardware.  More than half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Wow.  Okay.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I was like, huh.  No, frequently they do.  I was associated with October.  The phones in the fall, the laptops and stuff, yeah.  But I think actually in hindsight it's pretty obvious.  They only did that because, you know, well, they have a few events.  But now they can do events whenever they want.  They had, you know, they had an event this year.  They had like four last fall.  And they're doing quite well.  And they're doing fine.  So I think that they realized, you know what, we don't have to do this now even because it's not going to be ready until the fall.  So we'll just, I suspect new hardware won't come now until the fall.  But they did announce some very interesting HomeKit changes.  They talked about Matter, which is this former chip alliance.  Were you impressed?  Did you feel, Stacey, that they kind of were being all in on home automation and cooperative with the other players?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They actually did more than I thought they would do.  And they were the first person to say a big thing, which is that any Matter-supported device will work with HomeKit.  It doesn't actually need to be HomeKit certified, which is a big deal.  Google hasn't even said that.  They've just said that certain of their devices will work as Matter-compliant devices.  So that was a big announcement.  They actually also made another really big announcement for the smart home, which is in access control and locks.  They said they were going to use NFC on locks, which is a big deal.  Because if you can do NFC on your locks, you can actually have secure opening capabilities with your phone.  And you don't have to have all this like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and all this.  That goes by the wayside.  And you can just use your phone to unlock your door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and now they're using UWB as well, the ultra wideband, which allows you to see in space where these things are.  So I guess that's proximity of...  I thought they were using UWB for the locks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So they might be using UWB.  It's unclear.  They're definitely using NFC.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And that's interesting because I don't think they said NFC.  They said UWB.  Oh, that's interesting.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I feel like...  Doesn't NFC come with a negative connotation though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Maybe that's the only drawback to NFC is it's very short range.  You almost have to touch the device with it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So maybe that's how they're using UWB.  And maybe there's Bluetooth in there.  But as a default, NFC...  Because the problem is not every phone has UWB already in there.  Well, Apple doesn't care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Apple says late model iPhones and the Apple Watch support UWB.  So for instance, Hyatt Hotels is going to support UWB keys.  They said a thousand properties to start.  That's UWB, not NFC.  So that means as you approach the door, it'll unlock for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right.  And that's a little bit different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They say Schlage, Assa Abloy, Latch, Atrium, Evergreen, all will support UWB specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They will support their...  Okay, that is big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is the graphic that they put up for UWB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I did see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Okay.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know if I want that.  I just approached the door and it opens.  It makes me a little nervous that we've seen...  Yeah.  There's Bluetooth now, right, Stacey?  There are Bluetooth locks.  There is Bluetooth.  And that makes me a little nervous, like you could be hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So I will tell you that everybody who researches Bluetooth locks, they research it from the  standpoint of...  Because here, you and I might be nervous coming outside the door to unlock it, but the big  fear is if I'm on the other side of the door and I can't get out and respond.  No, no, no.  If I'm coming close to it on the other side of the door, it'll unlock just...  There's a bad guy on the outside.  Oh.  Right.  Even Bluetooth doesn't do that.  So that's something that they figured out.  It has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You have to open the phone and explicitly unlock it?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You just have to...  They figured out how to tell if you're on the quote unquote right or wrong side of the  door.  Oh, that's interesting.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's been something that...  Well, that's one reason you might want to use UWB because it's very much location aware.  That's what they're using with airtags.  It's much better at it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was thinking about this.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hallways?  What did you just say?  Like when I'm traveling, as a woman who wanders through hotel hallways, I'm thinking about  how I want...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You don't want doors to open as you walk up the coffee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, so I do pay attention.  If I get off the elevator and there's a single guy behind me, and he's walking out the hallway  too, and I'm walking down the hallway with my luggage, and I'm like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So turn left, not right.  In other words, don't head towards your room because the door is going locked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I will bypass my room.  But if my room automatically unlocks, is I get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's not good.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  Maybe it won't...  I have to experience this in action.  I know that's a really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The same thing if, let's say you're running from a bad guy and you run home and want to  go in real quick.  I guess, unless he's right behind you...  Then I would want that to work.  You would want it to work.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay.  So that's a tough thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way, what's interesting is that these credentials will be stored in your Apple Wallet.  Apple's really trying to make the Apple Wallet do a lot.  They say the TSA is going to use Apple Wallet so that you can show up at TSA Checkpoint  at an airport, and the TSA can say what information it needs.  Your phone can automatically share that.  They say that some states...  They didn't say which.  Some states will allow you to put your ID, your state ID, your driver's license in the  Apple Wallet so you don't need to carry a physical card with you.  I think that's great.  What are the negative consequences?  What's the dangers of something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The danger is if someone steals your phone, but then they can't really access it.  Well, it uses Face ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I would imagine to unlock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm just thinking out loud.  If someone takes your phone, they have access to your ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The question is, can I just walk up to a TSA Checkpoint and it'll see I have an iPhone  and a wallet with the proper credentials and just automatically walk through it?  That would be incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That would be nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I guess you'd have to pause so they could at least look at the picture and make sure  it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They have to look at your picture and write something on your ticket.  Yeah, circle your ticket.  They have to sign something on your ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way, if they ever write SSA on your ticket, do not just go home.  No, I'm just kidding.  But that's where you get the special search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought it was just SS.  Or maybe it's SS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  What is the special search?  Secondary Security Screening Selection.  You don't want to be an SS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They go through your bag.  You're at the gate.  You think you're home.  It's for SS.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You think you're home free.  No, no, no, no, no.  You go over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They search you at the gate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the gate.  And people are loading and you lost the good overhead rack and you're getting...  Oh, wow.  ...see how neurotic I used to be.  You might be interested in this.  ...no, not every wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This was leaked by WikiLeaks.  CIA assessment on surviving secondary screening at airports while maintaining cover.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Wow.  This document was created for distribution within the organization and other officials  who hold appropriate clearances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look, they have a beautiful picture.  Surviving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Surviving secondary and identity threat assessment of secondary screening procedures.  Wow.  This is our tax dollars at work, children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, no.  This is... you're an agent and you're an interviewee.  You're a spy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're a spy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So...  ...before you go through, Jeff, just in case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just...  Ken Tancred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Jeff doesn't have a cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What's your cover?  His cover is professor.  That's, by the way, widely overused.  You should really get a better cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  So I'm a journalism professor.  Podcastor.  How about netcaster?  Nobody knows what the hell you are.  There you go.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Trust me.  I used to try to get into Canada saying, I'm a podcaster.  I'm a netcaster.  They go, what do you really do?  What's your...  Are you undercover?  They probably thought you were a comedian.  Oh, yeah.  You're a comedian.  I get it.  So, by the way, I forgot to mention this when we were talking about TikTok.  The president of the United States of America has revoked the TikTok ban, which was never  enforced.  You might remember that President Trump signed a number of executive orders banning TikTok,  saying nobody could invest money in TikTok, et cetera, et cetera.  The courts prevented it from being implemented, and now the Biden administration has revoked  it.  However, however, it does say that we want to have the Commerce Department investigate  any threats, any security risks from Chinese and other foreign-owned apps.  But because the executive orders of the previous president were effectively unenforceable because  of the court rulings...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they still want to say to China, you know, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Josh Hawley, you might wonder what he thinks about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does he want to change the orbit of Mars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, he tweeted, this is a major mistake, shows alarming complacency regarding hashtag China's  access to American personal information, as well as hashtag China's growing corporate  influence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why do you need the hashtag China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I guess so you can find out what else people think about China.  I don't know.  Okay.  Hmm.  So you know, I actually understand his point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The former and would-be-again president also says that he regrets not having followed what  the Nigerian president did and just banned some services outright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Could you?  No, you can't though.  In the United States, we have this thing called the First Amendment.  You can't say you're banned, Twitter, you're banned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we also have a constitution, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, that.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  So, whatever this conversation is for you, Bob.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bob's already gone.  Oh, man.  Long gone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hi, Bob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Just for the record, I went through my TikTok and the first three videos were animals, Red  Panda, Golden Retriever, Flamingo.  And then my second video or my second set of videos were dancers.  And there's this, I will say there's this one dude, he like dances on ice and he is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Ice dancing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Now that you've watched...  Well, no, he's like an ice skater and he like does some serious dance moves.  So...  Okay, back to home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If there's one thing worse than TikTok, it's having somebody describe their TikTok.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me tell you, years ago when I started TikTok...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let me out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm a podcaster.  What is the name of that show?  I'm a celebrity.  Get me out of here.  Get me out of here.  I'm a podcaster.  Get me out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The final thing I was going to say about Apple...  Oh, yeah, we weren't done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I actually wanted to know more.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I didn't mean to cut that off.  No, no, no, no.  That's okay.  I love what they're doing with using UWB, the watch and your phone to understand context  clues for things like how things will respond in your house and even things like grouping  devices in your home.  So when they showed that your Apple TV is going to be able to show, work with devices  that were proximal to the TV in that room, I was like, baller.  That is excellent.  That is one of the best uses of context I think I've seen.  And I think Apple, it took them a while to get here, but they're really...  I think in the next two to three years, you're going to be like, holy cow, they have defined  the smart home for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Somebody had to, right?  It's interesting because Apple makes no smart home products except for maybe the HomePod  Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And they don't really care about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But things like they did announce they're going to support unlimited storage of HomeKit  camera videos on iCloud.  They don't make a camera, so they're going to support other companies' camera videos,  which I thought was very interesting.  Google charges a pretty penny to store Nest camera footage, but Apple says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They charge a pretty penny for Nest cameras too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  You would look at what Wyze charges for what probably is the same camera.  It's like, oh, so there's a little bit of profit in there.  They also said that Siri Voice was going to be in some devices, but I think I misunderstood  that when they said it.  It's not like you can get some devices now that have Amazon's Echo in it.  It's not like that.  It's going to still connect to your phone.  The phone's going to do the Siri stuff.  But I thought it was local now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's local processing on the phone in some devices.  They have the capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They showed an Ecobee thermostat.  Oh, she's gone.  She doesn't need a wireless cam.  She has a dog.  So I'm going to wait until she gets the dog fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The TikTok listens and knows that she likes animals, and that's why it gives her animals.  Oh, that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They hear the barking.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's probably what it is.  I need more barking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  She's going to keep barking until they come in.  So I feel bad.  I like barking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So the Ecobee does have Siri built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So they actually put out a press release too about this, or a blog post.  If you have the Ecobee hardware that speaks with Madam A right now, because it has the  existing microphone and speaker in it, it will add Siri.  So that's what they're saying.  So these are two announcements.  The Siri Local is one announcement.  Siri being on other devices that have the capability to do other HomeKit devices that  have the capability of using, that can use a voice assistant, they will also get Siri.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, but you will need, apparently, at least it's unclear, but it looks like you will need  a HomePod or HomePod Mini on your network to route those voice commands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't think it will act as, like you're saying it will act as Siri's brains.  Yeah.  Like my Ecobee could become the brains for Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, more like the input to the Siri.  So like the Ecobee will hear you, take what you say, send it over to HomePod Mini, which  processes it, sends it back to the Ecobee, which speaks.  That's what it looks, that's what the SDK does, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  I'm not 100% sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not either.  It's very unclear because if you look at Ecobee's announcement, it looks like they're saying,  in fact they say the words built-in support for Siri.  So that sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Then Siri would actually do, well, today even the built-in support for Madam A on the Ecobee  does go to the cloud.  So not all devices that support Siri will do local processing.  So it may support Siri, but not support local processing.  They're going to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So Ecobee says, if you have a smart thermostat with voice control, as you said, but you also  have to have a HomePod or HomePod Mini.  So, I know that's kind of weird.  Okay, that is weird.  So it's a gateway to the HomePod.  But the HomePod is the, you know, remember the Apple TVs, iPads and HomePods can be our  HomeKit base stations in effect.  It's very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Gateways.  Gateways.  So, they're on Thursday, they're having a session all about their smart home stuff and  matter and that sort of thing.  And you'll be watching that, I'm sure.  Yeah.  I'm like, I will be paying attention then, but I have more I don't knows for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  It's really interesting because Apple, which is really in many ways thrown up more walls  in their walled garden.  I mean, really a lot of what Apple showed is a message to people, just use all Apple stuff.  Forget anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Just stay in your ecosystem and stay here.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's beautiful.  But in some ways, they also broke down some of those walls.  Things like allowing third party devices access to Siri.  FaceTime will also be now on Android and Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It will work on the web if you're on one of those devices.  Yeah, some sort of WebRTC solution.  That is not, I'm like, I mean, it's nice.  Well, but that's more than it did before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If you had an iPhone and you wanted to make a FaceTime call, you could only call other  people with Apple stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think that's more a response to antitrust concerns than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and the success of Zoom because they basically are turning FaceTime into a Zoom  clone.  You can send out invites to a FaceTime meeting.  So you don't want to have to say, well, I'd like to send Aunt Maude an invite, but does  she have an Apple device?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right.  Well, and I think that's part, they realized that they are, I mean, I will say the people  who aren't in Apple's ecosystem today are probably people who are just never going to  want to be in Apple's ecosystem.  Right.  I don't know if you can sweeten the pot enough to get us over there.  And so I think that like Jeff saying, uh huh.  They're like, here, here are the minimal bridges.  They're not going to be like super nice bridges, but we're going to build a couple of bridges  because even our own customers are kind of like, you know, Jeff is always telling us  FaceTimes because blah, blah, blah, rassable Jeff, you know, and they're like, okay, here's  a bridge to Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Jeff doesn't like bridges.  I just want to warn you.  He's not a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that is true.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You're very rassable.  All right.  One more Apple thing and then we're going to move on.  But I wondered what you thought about Apple mail eliminating the hidden pixels.  In fact, I saw you tweeting about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I was like, please don't, don't, don't go away from that.  Cause I wanted to get her thoughts on this with newsletters, Brandon and marketing 101.  You get email addresses.  Check.  I got it.  I'm good to go.  And then you find out just how many people actually open those emails and you take that  number and you can use that to talk to sponsors and things like that.  And how, how, how are you, what are you thinking about this and how you feel it may affect  say your newsletter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I am.  Yeah.  There go my newsletter stats, which is what I tweeted.  Your initial tweets.  You were very disappointed.  Yeah.  I was like, bummer.  Now I will say when I first dug into my newsletter stats, I was appalled at what I could see.  Like I could see, I mean, I was, I was like, who do you use Mailchimp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So if I constant contact Mailchimp, sub stack, everybody does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They all do this.  That's how you get stats on open, open rate.  It sounds like you could tell which articles people read too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I can tell.  So I can tell you, I can tell you add an individual email level, what articles you individually  read, right?  I can tell you what ads you individually clicked on.  I don't look at that personally.  Cause I don't, I don't need to.  My sponsors, if I did that deal with them, which I don't, I could do a deal and they  would pay me a lot to give for me to give you their emails from that particular campaign.  They've asked.  But what I am saying, so I feel like, man, could we do it like at a less granular level?  Cause what I look at is what percentage of people opened my emails.  I look at their IP address information, which Apple was like, and we hide your IP address.  Like it's nefarious, but I do, I look and see things like 30% of my audience is outside  of the U S sometimes it's up as much as 40%.  So I look for like when I'm scheduling things.  And then I can also see, like, I can see who specifically read articles, but usually what  I'm looking for is like how many people clicked on this particular article, you know, that  sort of thing.  So just so I can say, Oh, people really don't care about my obsession with, I don't know,  machine learning at the edge.  Nobody's clicking on it.  Let's, let's dial back that coverage.  Right.  Yeah.  Or vice versa.  I will be sad if that goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So Casey Newton has a big thread about this on his platformer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Cause of course, Casey Newton just got into the newsletter business.  Just got into this business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And you know, so a couple of points.  He says 93.5% of all email opens on phones come in Apple mail on iPhones or iPads.  So those you've lost stats about them completely.  93.5% of all.  On desktop Apple mail on Mac is 58% of all email open.  So it's more than half of all.  Is that for his newsletter?  No, no, this is market share numbers from Litmus for May 2021.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I was like, I know my newsletters are not quite so high, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, yes.  So it's everybody, not just you.  Now he then quotes Alex Kantrowitz, who is also a newsletter guy.  He left to create big technology.  He's been on our Twitch podcast many times.  He used to work at AdAge.  So understands the ad business.  And this is what Kantrowitz says.  The advertising industry has addicted itself to tracking, prioritizing bottom of the funnel  metrics at the expense of great content and creative.  It's tragic.  And it's why people hate advertising and ad companies.  Both Casey and Kantrowitz say at what somebody said on Twitter on Sunday, you know, yeah,  you're going to lose this.  There are other ways to judge your audience.  Casey uses surveys as does Kantrowitz.  You're going to have to give it up because once Apple does it, others have done this.  I mean, I've used email clients that blocked those pixels for years, but it was always,  you know, we're only a percentage.  When Apple does it, it's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, can I ask you a question here when you're done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  He said, I'll play right into your wheelhouse because he says the media business changes  so quickly.  I don't find it at all irrational to read about a move like the one Apple made this  week and assume it will be bad for journalism.  But Newton says in this case, it mostly strikes me as a false alarm.  There are many or any number of changes that major email providers, including Apple, Google  and Microsoft could make that would make life more difficult for newsletter based businesses.  In the end, though, I don't think blocking spy pixels is one of them.  Now your turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if we could, oh, I don't know, move the moon and go back a few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Superman has to spin the earth backwards, I believe is how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  All right.  That's what it is.  And forget all the cooties that pixels and tracking and surveillance and everything have.  Early early days of podcasts.  If you could do it all over again, and if there were a tracking bit in a podcast that  for sure that somebody listen to her or listen to the end or whatever.  Would you wish for that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  In fact, I wish fervently that this ad tracking stuff had not come to podcasting because it's  my opinion that what we offer advertisers is a very specific niche.  Now I admit if you're a, you know, if you're Will Ferrell doing, you know, the Anchorman  podcast, you don't have a specific niche.  So you might have a stronger reason to try to understand your audience, but I don't need  to understand my audience.  I know exactly that the people who listen to this show and all our shows are very much  tech enthusiasts.  That's why this network is very, very focused on tech enthusiasts.  And I know that that makes it a good avenue for a certain kind of advertiser.  And then the only thing I really think an advertiser should look at is return on investment.  Did the sales increase justify the ad spend?  Period.  But advertisers from day one, and this is classic in all sorts of new media where they  want to do direct response, they want to get some idea.  So when you first, you know, new cable channels like Tech TV, when it started, you see all  these, use the offer code Tech TV 20.  You still see that in a lot of cable channels.  That's called direct response advertising.  And that's how advertisers have in the past responded to this.  It's a very imperfect method.  It's particularly bad on our network because most of our users are smart.  Technology wise, this is the disadvantage of this audience.  And so they'll just they go, oh, I heard an ad for Casper.  I'll just go to Casper.com.  They don't, right.  They don't go to the special URL.  They don't remember the offer code.  They don't care about the offer code.  And if they do an offer code nine times out of 10, it's just twit.  We already know this.  We've surveyed it.  We've found out they just use twit.  In fact, we try to tell advertisers don't use twig.  In fact, you'll see a lot of our advertisers now just use twit as the URL or the offer  code.  We tell them, don't try to figure out which shows working for you.  You can't.  They're going to almost nine times out of 10, people are just going to say, well, I  heard it on twit, the twit network.  It's twit and use that offer code.  But even then, I don't want tracking.  I know our audience hates it and I don't think you need it as an advertiser.  You should just be looking at did the ad work.  And if your business went up, good.  Keep advertising.  But no advertiser works that way.  Yeah, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody wants to re-educate the person who has the checkbook.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, we try.  Lisa spends hours educating people all the time.  Andrew does have, and we have the benefit of...  You have the same thing, a targeted audience.  Andrew explains things to people.  And I also have an audience that spends not $1,000 on a mattress, they spend $100,000 or  $1 million buying a service provider.  So it's a little different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Notice a lot of our ads are moving towards enterprise for that exact reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And they should.  You've got an educated audience that people want to get a hold of.  Remember Spiceworks?  I think they're still around.  They were a great company because they created these forums for crazy IT people who wanted  to talk to each other about problems.  And all of a sudden they were like, we are sitting on an enterprise ad network gold mine.  And it was a brilliant business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What happened was all of those freebie magazines like PC Week and InfoWorld, which were given  away to executives in companies, went away.  And that was how enterprise reached those people.  And now they're desperate to find ways.  So your newsletter benefits, our podcast benefit.  Yeah, I used to read them too.  And they were give gimmies.  But remember how you got PC Week?  You had to fill out a big questionnaire to prove that you were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Do you make decisions about technical products?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  It was worth it.  You could lie, but it was worth it because it was a great magazine.  Dvorak was in the back.  Spencer, or it was Spencer the Cat and InfoWorld was Dvorak.  Anyway, the world has changed a lot.  And the problem is advertisers are like crack addicts.  Once you give them the first taste of metrics, of analytics, they go, that's good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I want more of that.  If we all know the world is changing, why don't the ad agencies see it the same way?  TV today is not the same as TV 20 years ago.  So I'm sure they're not selling this.  Because they don't have to yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The pain hasn't gotten bad enough for them to change their business models just yet.  And their clients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they make money by placing ads.  So they're getting the piece of the buy and making the buy more efficient isn't good for  them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know, I think about what Mr. Laporte said a few minutes ago saying don't use those...  I don't suggest using these codes because you're not going to see it right out the gate.  People listen to podcasts regularly, but that doesn't mean they listen to them on a regular  schedule.  Like today's show is probably not going to be listened to until next week for a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  people.  We have to explain that all the time because agencies call and they go, you're at Rand

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  yesterday and I didn't see any pump.  It's like, no, no, it's not.  It's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You're not buying CNBC.  You're not buying television.  It's a whole different monster.  You're buying a podcast.  We literally tell them six weeks before you'll know whether the ad had a result.  But unfortunately, Lisa tells me we cannot sell ads anymore without having Chartbeat  or Podsites or one of the analytics companies doing essentially what those invisible pixels  do.  It's basically an invisible pixel.  They even call it a tracking pixel even though it's not.  But when we did that, we tried really hard to make sure that information did not go  to the advertiser.  It doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And there are places that do.  Like I have contracts for events or other things.  They will just give that email address up and poof.  I've explained it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's kind of complicated, but we send them our logs in effect.  They see the IP addresses that downloaded the show and then the advertiser puts a tracking  pixel on their webpage.  They send them the logs of the people who went to the landing page.  And then Podsites or Chartbeat matches it up.  And they say 43% of the people who heard this show went to your landing page.  And they don't get any other information than that.  How successful is that campaign?  I feel like that's a very minor...  It's not an intrusion at all.  We of course have to ask these companies, there's two of them, Podsites and Chartable.  We have to say, you've got to preserve this.  This is private information.  You can never send this information to anybody else.  And they say yes.  And plus advertisers do not share their information back with us.  So we really try to keep it isolated.  But still people don't like it.  And as a result, by the way, one of the downsides of it is a lot of ad blockers now block the  downloads of our podcasts.  I have to explain to people all the time, you have to unblock Chartable and Podsites  and Megaphone in your ad blocker or on your router or whatever it is you're using your  pie hole.  Because pie holes will block us.  You can't download our shows anymore.  So it's very frustrating.  That's why we created Club Twitter, frankly.  So we can say, you want a tracker free experience, no ads, seven bucks, that's it.  That's exactly why we did it.  So to answer your, this is a long answer to your question, Jeff.  No, I hate it.  I don't want to do it.  I would never accept that.  In fact, my attitude has always been, and Lisa says I'm a fool, my attitude has always  been tell them no.  Sorry, we're not going to do it.  We give you great results.  Trust me, you're going to get great results.  If you don't, no harm, no foul.  But I'm not going to give you any information about our audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So back to your question.  Hey, I have these same conversations.  Of course you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Toe the line, hold the line.  But you know what, it's a, I don't know about newsletters.  It's an eroding shore, my friend.  In podcasts, it's an erode.  Because of Spotify and all these other companies, there's no way we can win this.  All the ad dollars will go to companies that give the advertisers that information, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And some years ago, not too long ago, I had a meeting with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Good job.  I'm really getting wasted now.  I'm hurt.  I'm actually quite hurt.  No, no, no.  We love your stories.  I was teasing you.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Oh, I do.  No, I want to...  I'm going to cry myself to sleep.  I really want to know what happened in the entertainment we've been 22 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I need to know that.  A few.  A few.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you ever work for Gannett?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just out of curiosity.  No.  No?  Because we're trying to find out.  Is this on this show?  How you pronounce Gannett?  Gannett.  Gannett.  Oh, no.  I didn't work for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can know that.  You can just ask me the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I do that.  Was it this show, Ant, or was it on Twitter?  No, sir.  It was on Twitter, Sunday.  We were going back and forth because both Florence Ion had worked for them and so had  Roberto Baldwin.  And he said Gannett.  I said Gannett.  And she said Gannett.  I worked for him, she said.  I don't think it was Gannett.  Sorry, Flo.  Okay, Flo.  Sorry.  You lose.  Go on.  I'm sorry.  Tell me what happened years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't get all sensitive on me, Jeff.  I am sensitive.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm telling you.  I love you.  I'm not mad at you.  I love you.  Please don't get sensitive on me.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So one of the founding parents of programmatic advertising scolded a whole bunch of media  properties in my space and said, why are you using this?  It commodifies you.  You shouldn't be doing this.  Tell the agencies.  Tell this and that.  And a chief revenue officer from one of the media properties, online digital pure place,  said, uh-uh, I've got to go to where the dollars are and the ad agencies are all putting their  dollars into programmatic.  That's where I have to be.  And nobody changes their path.  And you have a bunch of media people in the ad agencies, when they're buying big buys,  they're just going for the data.  That's all they've ever done is go for the data.  And so that's the way it is.  And it's very hard to change that.  The question is, I think we need advertising forever in media.  Media will never be self-supported without advertising.  We need to sell these eyeballs.  Sorry, folks.  We got to do it.  It's the only way to support and give you the things you want for free.  But we got to reinvent advertising.  We got to rethink that too, because it's bored.  I think surveillance is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If I could wave a magic wand, I'd say club twit, just join club twit.  We don't have advertising anymore.  But I will say it limits your audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We get a lot of questions from people who are high schoolers who are interested in IoT,  which is weird.  I agree.  I'm with you.  I need those people to be there.  They're my audience coming in.  And it's hard to...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's long-term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, free is democratic.  I completely agree with you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay.  Maybe we should do a Tom's model where you buy one, give one, and then you're just subsidizing  the next generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If 10% of our audience paid, the other 90% could freeload.  It would be fine.  It's like the Guardian.  We only need 10%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Six to 12% of public radio pay for public radio.  In addition to sponsors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I was going to say, but there's also sponsors and government funding for public radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay.  And by the way...  Lock Jeff Day.  Is that on the calendar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I just want to say, public radio has more ads than we do.  Way more.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Which really bugs me.  Speaking of pronunciation, ready?  Yes.  Is it Carnegie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Carnegie.  Carnegie.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Which is it, Jeff?  You're the arbiter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've always said Carnegie, but you're right when you hear the announcement.  But you hear NPR.  It's Carnegie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, it might be like Pulitzer.  Like there's the Pulitzer Prize.  Oh, it's Pulitzer Prize.  It's Pulitzer Prize, but the Pulitzer family likes Pulitzer.  So it might be like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, so it's like GIF and GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's not the Nobel Prize though, I'll tell you that right now.  That's a really interesting...  So it might be that the Carnegie Foundation is different than Andrew Carnegie or Carnegie  Mellon, because I know it's Carnegie Mellon, not Carnegie Mellon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right, but his family founded all of them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay, sorry.  That total non sequitur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what?  If they're saying Carnegie on NPR...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I feel like they would know, right?  They're paying for NPR to pronounce it correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  And the money came from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The Carnegie's.  Carnegie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll switch to the British pronunciation on top there.  You think it's British?  I don't know.  I'm just curious what it says.  It's Scottish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Carnegie.  Carnegie.  But you know what?  Scottish might be Carnegie.  Carnegie.  Carnegie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I play golf and I hate...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good, who started him going?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You did.  I want some whiskey.  It's pronounced iske-ba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's dun-uh-no.  Dun-uh-no.  Wait a minute.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  English with Julian.  How to pronounce Carnegie correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are looking at how to pronounce this name as well as how to say more interesting names  in English.  So make sure to stay tuned and consider subscribing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What language does this guy speak?  Carnegie.  Carnegie.  Pretty straightforward.  Once you know Carnegie.  So he sounds like he's from some island.  And now you know.  What the heck is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Something's happening with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's been in a bottle.  If it's pronounced Carnegie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What else does he tell you to pronounce?  Does he have a whole site of his?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, Julian Mikkel.  It's his whole site.  It's all...  Oh my Lord.  Yeah.  It's probably telling you how to pronounce Moet and Chandon.  Here we go.  Maybe he's French.  Oh, he has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Julian Mikkel here of Social Vignerons back.  Oh, he's French.  This is how to pronounce Moet and Chandon.  And more importantly, why you shouldn't pronounce it any other way.  There is an eternal debate on whether you should pronounce Moet and Chandon.  I thought it was Moet.  So let's clear things up once and for all.  Here's the one I want to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are looking at how to pronounce the name of newborn baby of Canadian singer Grimes  and Tesla CEO Elon Musk spelt X-A12.  It isn't clear at this point if this is the actual name of the baby and how the parents  will want it to be pronounced if it turns out to be.  Congrats to Grimes and Elon in any case.  Some have speculated it might be a code tweeted by Elon to say the name is Xavier.  Others wonder if it might be a joke.  For what we know or can speculate upon, this name could be pronounced as X.  Do you want to know how many views this video has?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just out of curiosity.  You want to know?  1.19 million views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Clickbait.  We were discussing this earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The thing is that the AE is pronounced Ash and I think that's the name.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you know that?  Ash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Ash.  No, the X and A12 is just extra crap.  Ash.  I think they're going to call it Ash.  Anyway, wait a minute, wait a minute.  New York Times weighing in Michael Pollack in the New York Times FYI.  I always thought the concert hall on 57th Street was pronounced Carnegie Hall.  Now I hear announcers on national public radio refer to the Carnegie Corporation.  What did Mr. Carnegie himself prefer?  The definitive New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mr. Carnegie was of course born Scottish and the Krennic pronunciation of his name is Carnegie,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  says Susan King, a spokesperson for the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Scottish.  Oh, and it was seconded by Carnegie Mellon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That pronunciation was seconded by a spokesperson for Carnegie Mellon University, Angus MacTavish  McGee, who checked with a linguist on the facility.  So he was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, which I'm sure I'm saying wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you didn't pronounce that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Dunfermline.  Dunfermline.  Laddie, say it right or you don't get no scubba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Susan King is the dean at UNC's School of Journalism who's been trying to give tenure  to Nikole Hannah-Jones.  Oh.  The heat of all that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know about that story?  Interesting.  No, I don't know about that story.  Oh.  You know who Nikole Hannah-Jones is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is really going to upset Bob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Who's Nikole Hannah-Jones?  I want to say the University of Maryland has now jumped in and tried to back up this professor  because of her lack of getting tenure.  Is that right, Mr. Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I started a letter actually with 300 journalism professors who cited in protest to the Board  of Trustees at the university, and I then had a conversation with the head of the Board  of Trustees, which was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So she's an African, a black African-American investigative journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She created the 1619 Project of the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, I love the 1619 Project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Bob's not going to like you for that, I'm telling you.  Bob's going to be very mad at you for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  As I said, Bob stopped listening, as we now know.  Before we were on the air phone.  Although you know people who said Bob was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There is our show title, Bob is Unimpressed.  Bob is unimpressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So the premise of this is because the 1619 Project was in some way not historically accurate,  which it was, but some people feel it wasn't.  Actually the argument isn't really about the facts.  The argument is, would it be better not to dwell on the fact that this nation was born  in slavery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We have not been dwelling on it for a while, and we have not gotten very far.  So I think it's time to actually acknowledge that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't think anybody debates the fact that slavery existed, and that George Washington  and Thomas Jefferson and Madison were slaveholders and all of that.  But the people who don't like 1619 Project say, well you shouldn't be saying the founding  fathers were pro-slavery.  They didn't want to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the funder to the Hussman School of Journalism, who runs a paper in Arkansas,  and gave them money on the condition that they would chisel his words on the school,  literally.  Hussman sent letters of complaint to the Dean, Susan King, and to the administration and  board of the school, which is not a cool thing for a funder to do, let us be clear, in which  he said, well, she didn't give enough credit to white people.  There were a lot of white people who helped out.  She said that black people had to do this alone.  That's just not true.  There were some Jews who helped too, he honestly kind of said that.  And that's kind of what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But what, are there any Scotsmen who helped?  That's what I'd like to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So Hussman owns newspapers and anyway, yeah, you're right.  A funder shouldn't get to say what the university's ethics are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I know, nor should advertisers, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Sorry, that was hilarious.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What did Ant say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I missed it.  Well, I missed it because I was saying what Ant was saying.  Lots and lots and lots of people...  Oh, I'm supposed to listen to the show now.  ...supported Nikole Hannah-Jones.  And there's a list of like 30 petitions and letters from universities, from the students  at the school, from faculty at the school.  They're enraged that the board of trustees has not offered her tenure.  So, yes.  Yeah.  So...  One of the stars of the field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, if you get a chance to listen to 1619, you really should.  I think it's an important part of every American's education.  Not to say we're a bad country and we're bad people and all that, but you got to know our  history.  We also have to know what's built in.  It's a shameful history in many respects.  We know the history and evolve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So that we can be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So that we can do better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you can never...  I mean, unless you review your mistakes, I mean, look at air reports and engineering.  Unless you review your mistakes, you're never going to be able to fix them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think that's fair.  I'm sorry, Bob, but it's the truth.  Well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had a colleague try to argue that, you know, objective journalism and we just tell people  how a bill passes.  I said, well, if you're going to tell them how a bill passes, then you better talk about  the fellow buster and its racist roots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, it's funny that I think for years people didn't really think about that or the  Electoral College or the Senate and the real reasons why there's a North and South Dakota  and a West Virginia and a Virginia.  And I think that that history needs to be explained because otherwise you say, well,  no, we've always had the filibuster.  We haven't.  No, we haven't.  We haven't.  And we certainly have not always had the email filibuster, which really is kind of appalling.  You don't even have to...  At least Jimmy Stewart had to go out there on the floor of the Congress and get a horse  talking and talking and talking.  I think honestly, probably that movie...  What is it?  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington?  That movie single-handedly made the filibuster part of the American mythos, right?  Because he filibuster, but he actually had to speak.  Now you can send an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Mine was when Leslie Knope had to filibuster.  Yes.  On roller skates, no less.  On roller skates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now that I want to see.  Was that at the town, the city council meeting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yes, it was the city council meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I didn't know they had the filibuster.  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  He very famously...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mr. President, I wish to ask my distinguished colleague, as he wants crap of evidence to  add now to the defense he did not give and could not give at that same hearing.  I have no defense against Ford's paper.  Commit your rule otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So towards the end of the filibuster, he's really tired.  He's been talking for hours and hours.  It's a Frank Capper movie.  Let me see if I can find the end of the filibuster.  Because Jimmy Stewart sprayed his throat with something that would make him hoarse.  So that, you know...  Oh, wow.  You know.  I don't know if I can find that clip.  Everything's...  Yeah, here he is.  Everything's on YouTube, which is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And sometimes that's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So he's on the floor of the Senate filibustering.  It's been hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is why we think...  Leslie Knope's filibuster was about voting rights in Pawnee, Indiana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There you go.  There you go.  But I swear to God, this is really where our sense of history comes from.  The movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Narratives are so powerful.  I'm serious.  Nobody's in that room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody's in that room in real life.  Yeah.  He's speaking to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, look at their...  It's standing room only in the Senate in the movie.  You know.  Anyway.  Great movie.  But maybe not the best argument for a filibuster.  Let's take a little break.  We will come back with more...  Actually one more...  There is one more story because we're talking about advertising.  I should probably mention that Google, this is from the Financial Times, boosts Android  privacy protections in an attempt to rival Apple.  Remember Apple got a lot of heat from Facebook for allowing you to turn off tracking.  Android users can do that in the settings, but developers have been able to circumvent  those settings by relying on alternative device identifiers.  Google's now cracking down on that.  They announced today in an email to Play Store developers that they wanted to provide users  with more control over their data.  So following the overhaul, developers who try to access the advertising IDs of people  who have opted out, actually this was last week, of people who have opted out will receive  a string of zeros instead of the identifier.  So Google said we can do that.  We do that.  It's the same thing though.  We've said this before.  Google, Apple, Facebook, they're all first party and all you're blocking is third party  at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been saying that for years.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can tell you the first time I started saying it.  For all the years.  I caught you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I was like, Oh no.  Was it at a board meeting of the Knight Ritter Foundation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Jeff please.  I'm so sorry.  I don't mean to hurt your feelings.  I love you.  I love your anecdotes.  I think you're the greatest.  Oh, I feel bad now.  I feel bad.  Let's take it.  No, I seriously, I do.  I was joking.  I was teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I can't tell if you guys are like being real or not.  It hurts my very sincere little heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I am sincere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, no, I am being completely sincere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, I know you're being sincere, but I'm like, is Jeff sincere?  Does it really hurt?  Oh my God.  What if we hurt Jeff's feelings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I hope we didn't hurt your feelings.  Jeff.  Look at that face.  It's still pink, but he does seem sad.  You actually do that really well, Jeff.  Yeah, I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My acting career is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, apparently your Scottish accent is better than mine according to the chat room.  No, I was wrong.  Probably somebody from Scotland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was Carnegie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Carnegie is correct.  You know, I'm glad we found that article because that's actually a really interesting question.  That was, by the way, in the New York Times in 2004.  So it has been resolved for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  NPR is doing it right and none of us are going to change our ways.  This is going to be the gift, Jeff.  No, no, we're going to sound like we're NPR snobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I go to the Carnegie Library.  They say Carnegie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Jeff, we already sound like NPR snobs.  No, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I have no reason to say Carnegie or Carnegie, hardly ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But Aunt, you now live in Petaluma where there is a Carnegie Free Library.  Did you know that?  You got to come down to that.  Oh, I have seen that.  Yeah, it's a beautiful building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an important part of history, which I would go into, but I don't dare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I remember when Steele, Barron, Andrew Carnegie decided to...  Anyway, that is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He supported libraries across America.  He built free libraries everywhere.  He needed literacy in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because he felt so guilty about his rapacious career as the creator of US Steel that he  felt he should do something to make it up for it.  And he did, just like Bill Gates.  He did.  Free Library is beautiful.  It still says free public library in the face, but it's now...  It's really too small to be a decent library.  It's tiny.  But it's now the Petaluma History Museum, which is perfectly sized for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's only so much history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's not a whole lot.  Chickens!  Look at the chickens!  They don't even know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I was about to say, are there chickens at the museum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Definitely, undoubtedly.  They don't even know where the name Petaluma came from.  They have no idea.  Really?  Yeah, they don't.  It's probably an Indian word, but they don't know.  That's sad, isn't it?  It was like 150 years ago, and they don't know.  Nobody wrote it down.  Our show today brought to you by...  Oh, I'll tell you something.  This advertiser loves us because...  No, not Jeff Jarvis.  This advertiser loves us because...  Do you have it?  Nareva!  Because we send people to Nareva in droves.  This is an example of...  Yeah, we're a good network with good ads, and I do a good job.  But honestly, if you don't have a great product, it doesn't matter.  Nareva has not only a great product, but a product whose time is right.  People are going back to the office, right?  But we know that the way we meet is going to change.  Distancing can have big implications for meeting room audio.  You're going to probably have to change your room configuration, assure social distancing.  But you still want good mic coverage when people are distanced in a meeting space.  That's why you need a Nareva microphone.  Nareva audio is amazing.  It's not a beamforming system.  That's complicated.  You need to get a technician in there.  Plus, you're going to have to put marks on the table because people are going to have  to sit where the beam forms.  Tabletop systems, you could have lots of mics, but then they have to be sanitized between  meetings.  Again, they're going to require people change their behavior.  They're going to have to sit in predetermined spots.  You're going to have to face a certain way.  Wouldn't it be awesome if you could get clear, reliable audio, but your team could act naturally,  feel safe, be separated appropriately?  One analyst called Nareva audio the first socially distanced mic system.  It's super cool.  Four patents on this technology.  They call it microphone mist technology.  It's designed specifically for distancing.  The Nareva is a sound bar.  It's a speaker plus microphones.  You can mount it yourself on the wall, but it fills the room computationally with thousands  of virtual microphones.  The audio will automatically adapt to any configuration.  It doesn't matter where people are sitting, standing, facing.  Every one of them is on mic.  The HDL300 system, this is their big system.  It's the first microphone and speaker bar to be certified for large meeting spaces up  to 15 feet by 28 feet.  You could have an all hands meeting with this thing.  There it is by the way on the wall.  Look how good it looks.  You'll get full room coverage.  People could be heard from anywhere in the room.  You don't need to bring in technicians.  You can install it yourself.  It's easy to do.  Nareva console comes with every Nareva system.  You puts device management into your hands and on your terms.  You can adjust settings, install firmware updates, check device status and more all from a secure  cloud based platform.  The console by the way comes with every Nareva audio system.  By the way when you enroll your system you're going to get an extra year of warranty absolutely  free.  Nareva audio products, they've won awards.  The HDL200, the medium sized system got the top new technology award at ISE 2020.  But they have a full line of systems for small, medium and large spaces.  They use it at HubSpot.  Jimmy Yan, who's HubSpot's principal collaboration engineer said, we were so impressed with the  sound quality, the ease of install and the ease of use of the HDL300.  They got the big boy.  It was a no brainer for us to adopt it.  I think you know it's exciting.  We're getting to come back to work but you still have to protect your employees to learn  more about how Nareva audio is a simple cost effective way to let your teams distance in  meetings and still act and converse naturally.  Visit nareva.com and you are EVA.  Nareva.com slash twit.  Nareva.  When you have the right product for the right time, you're in the right place.  Nareva.com slash twit.  We thank Nareva for their support of this week in Google.  Notice, see they're smart.  They're using the slash twit.  But I hope you will use it too so that they know you saw it here.  That's important to them.  It's important to us.  Nareva.com slash twit.  And now back to the waffles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I can see everything, Stacey.  I know what's going on.  That looks really good.  Is that an Eggo or is that homemade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think it's an Eggo.  We found that the Safeway signature brand is different but also good.  This is an Eggo.  It's sweeter I think.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I have one of those Belgian wafflers that you flip over.  Of course you do.  I have one of those too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have a waffle maker.  We use it often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So great.  I love waffles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can't eat them but I love them.  I like doing that in hotels.  In the breakfast bar of the hotel.  It feels like it's on vacation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I remember when some time ago.  Are you going to remember something now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes.  You're going to go back in memory banks like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think I've already told this story so I'm going to tell it again.  Because not everybody listens to every show.  We know that.  I was in Tasmania in Australia traveling with a group of photographers about 2009.  Did I mention this?  The hotel, I did mention this, had a bread maker in the room.  When they made up the room they would replenish the bread maker with flour and water and then  you'd set the timer and 7am instead of an alarm they sent a fresh bread.  Wake up to bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's the only place.  You have talked about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I want to go there.  I know.  Isn't that awesome?  Yes.  I don't know why more places don't do that.  That's the best alarm ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Please and thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And then when they're making up the room they just take out the old bread and they put in  fresh ingredients.  All right.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  Many years ago.  How many years ago was that?  You and I were peas in a pod.  That's the problem.  That's really the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  More like oil than water.  German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But with oil and water you know what you get?  A delicious salad dressing.  Salad dressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yes.  People love salad dressing.  Let me tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oil and vinegar anyway.  Google News Showcase targeted by Germany anti-trust chief Andreas Mundt.  That's a great name.  What are they mad about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google requires people to do things to be in the like have fast pages to be in the showcase.  I'm not sure what the purpose are.  Oh you have to be amped or something like that.  No no not anymore you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But that's fair though that the page should load quickly and shouldn't be paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah and so you know if you imagine if you're Google you just say okay fine fine let's be  Australia let's just get rid of the news.  You guys are too much trouble.  You're not worth it.  Fine.  We'll just get rid of it.  That's what's going to happen at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well they haven't they're just going to check to see if Google offers unreasonable conditions  to publishers involved and whether they hamper them using extra copyright introduced under  a law passed last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well that's that's the other thing is you have the ready for it.  Leichtung schutzt recht.  Leichtung schutzt recht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is that moral panic in German?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's pronounced Carnegie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there a pronounce for Leichtung schutzt recht?  Oh sure there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah L-E-I-C-H-T-Z-U-N-G-R-E-C-H-T am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Every time I try to say that I have to wipe my mouth afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Beard gets a little drippy.  It's T it's like S-T.  Leichtung schutzt recht.  You would think that Google would automatically correct me if I got even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't you just say pronounce if you had the word pronounce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah but I have to type that Leichtung schutzt recht thing first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't this exciting radio people?  This is great.  Pronounce spelling time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh yeah look look look look there is such a thing.  No there isn't such a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay never mind.  So yeah this is this is that they were saying that you know if you if you so much as take  a picture of me you've stolen my soul and my value and you owe me money and it's the  ancillary copyright regime which existed in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh it's an additional copyright that's then that's interesting.  Oh boy.  Yeah isn't that funny there is no pronouncer for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't think that maybe no German wanted Google to suck out their soul or their privacy  by pronouncing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way that's the problem is I'm using Google to find it.  Yeah.  Chris Ray the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait wait wait wait wait I got here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hold on hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leichtung schutzt recht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Leichtung schutzt recht.  That's just exactly like you say it.  Nice.  See.  Yeah.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Huh?  I was not assuming you were saying it wrong I might have I might have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh you're just trying to be nice now that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Should we do Google changelog?  Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Bring it bring it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There is a new Google undersea cable.  Does that count for a changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No no Jason sorry.  No I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Jason did not put it in there.  I was thinking if he did not specifically put it in there he put it in the regular news  but I was thinking this should be in the changelog.  No no no no.  This is to handle a data surge between the US Brazil and Argentina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a possibly interesting story but it's not a changelog.  It's totally an interesting story.  What affects your life on Google in La Vida Google.  This is a corporate story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Actually it's actually I would say it's a trend story because think about data cables  as the opening of a new shipping lane.  So you're being able to see where goods and products are flowing.  These are just digital goods and products.  And there's demand for underwater mud landslide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You see that story this week.  No.  So it turns out there was a huge underwater mud landslide and they only knew about it  because it cut off a whole bunch of cables.  Oh yeah that makes sense.  Cables actually get cut often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Vikash Kohli who is the vice president of global networking.  VP of global.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have a telegeography submarine cable map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I know I want that map.  I love that map.  I had one.  Changes every year.  Yeah that's the problem.  Mine's out of date.  Vice president of global networking at Google says and this is a great quote.  Internet infrastructure is not in the cloud it's under the ocean.  Oh that is a good quote.  And it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mine's out on that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well we always think of it as the cloud but honestly there's no wires in the cloud.  All those interconnects are either underground or under the ocean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Or they're in a giant data center somewhere near you.  Yeah but if they get somewhere it's yeah right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  98 percent of international data travels on submarine cables draped across the bottom  of the oceans and the seas.  Basically as it does with Google doodles according to CNET Google plays homage to  notable figures with its submarine cable names.  This cable named Fermina.  They named the cables?  Yeah this is Fermina.  That's Josie the cable?  Well I don't think they got one named Josie but maybe the pussycats.  I don't know.  The fiber optic line is named after a Brazilian abolitionist.  Her full name which I will find out in a moment because it's in this article is Maria  Fermina dos Reis.  A mixed race author wrote about the lives of Afro-Brazilian slaves in her 1859 novel  Ursula.  Google had a Google doodle about her in 2019 on her birthday.  There's a subsea cable called Grace Hopper.  They're in alphabetical order so Fermina will be followed by Grace Hopper.  Earlier Google cables are named Curie after Marie Curie.  Do not?  I don't know who do not is.  Did he invent the donut?  The do not?  The do not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No that was Duncan.  It's a cousin to the curler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Duncan do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  In 1858 Queen Victoria sent the first transatlantic telegram to James Buchanan, president of the  United States, Morse code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  New York Times at the time said that New York went cable mad.  Oh wow.  People took off of work, that there were fireworks set off, that there were parades down Broadway.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Can you imagine what a shift?  Because before you'd have to put it on a boat and it would be days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then about a week or two later the cable broke as Stacey was saying.  It's almost like oh never mind they didn't get it back for ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The rate of that 1858 cable was one word per minute.  The do not undersea cable connects the US and France and transmits 250 terabits per  second.  Enough to transmit the entire Library of Congress three times a second.  250 terabits.  It is a record breaking cable so that was D. Then there was Equiano, a subsea cable from  Portugal to South Africa.  These are all these are all Google's putting these in.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Those are all Google cables.  Yeah so what happened is about 10 years ago all of these big Facebook, Google, all the  big cloud companies they were like oh crap you know we need to own this infrastructure  so they started investing and building and going in on their own subsea cables with like  NTT DoCoMo and other companies who are doing them.  And now they're they're doing so much traffic that they can actually afford I don't know  how many.  Do they charge?  Is Google doing this on their own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Are they going?  Yeah this is 100% funded by Google.  But do they charge for interconnects or I mean they must right?  They must make money on it.  So here's the map of 14 undersea cables from Google.  Dunah, Equiano, Monet, Curie, Junior, Tanat, Indigo, SJC.  So Equiano which is interesting is named after Olouda Equiano a Nigerian born writer and  abolitionist who was enslaved as a boy.  So another yet another abolitionist.  So that's it's really amazing.  That's got to be a huge expenditure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It is they're multi-billion dollar things.  Are they really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Cables.  Wow.  Well you got to get a boat to go and lay it and then you have to keep it up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well it's not a rowboat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So this new undersea cable Fermina we didn't say the capacity but it carries data on 12  pairs of fiber optic lines.  That's not very much.  I mean it's a lot of data but it's not a huge thick bundle 12 pairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No the undersea cables if you look at pictures of them and you can Google that and find them

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  there they're fat cables but they're not like most of it's not like a culvert like a giant  culvert.  Most of it is the sheathing.  Yeah I bet.

Transcript:  There's the sheathing and they're sheathed actually in flexible stuff and they get cut  all the time right where because they all come up on land in like huts on beaches.  They're getting more secure now because there was a whole I don't know if y'all remember  there was a spate of internet outages where people were attacking these huts basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Probably thought it caused COVID right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No but they did think that it would actually change the orbit of the earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They contract this out to a company called Subcon that designs and manufactures the cable  in Newington New Hampshire.  They'll install it next summer.  One unusual aspect of the cable according to CNET is it can be powered from either end  increasing reliability on more common designs that rely on power from both ends all the  time.  Oh that is interesting.  So they call it single end feed power.  18 kilovolts which is a lot more than conventional designs.  It'll be the longest cable to use that technology.  So there you go.  That's not even part of the changelog but that was a very long bit on the cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You see that's why it didn't fit in the changelog.  It was a story of interest.  It's more a story.  No I agree.  The changelog is a little thing you might want to know about your life with Google changing  this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Neither of you thought this was interesting a few minutes ago anyway.  No no no I said it was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't changelog.  It was above changelog.  I did not say it was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I just said it was new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you say it's interesting now?  That's not that interesting.  And for all that you think it was interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I just said it was new.  I didn't say it was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Android 12 beta 2 comes out today.  Finally you're going to get the wallpaper based material U color themes.  It didn't come with the first beta, public beta.  So if you're in the public beta update so you can get that material U color themes.  I am sad because my Pixel 4 phone, I have a Pixel 4 XL I didn't upgrade to the 5, is  delaminating.  The back is coming off and I'm worried that it might be the battery swelling but I don't  see any swelling.  But it is starting to fail.  I didn't think about the battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I saw it Sunday in the studio.  I was shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It didn't look good.  But I want to keep it because I want to keep playing with Android 12.  Google has unveiled a $99 Pixel Bud A series.  Upgraded connectivity.  It doesn't have the volume swipe gesture but it is inexpensive.  You want to try it again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is my question.  So here's the...  Do I order before the show is over?  Do you reverse the O on me?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No.  No.  If they were $79, yes.  Do you need them to be wireless?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, now that it's getting really hot, I'm wearing my headphones and it's a little  sweaty out there walking.  Not that you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So you do or don't want wireless?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I do want wireless.  Yes, I do.  We all want them to have wireless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So there are some really good but they're more expensive than $99.  You don't want me to have sweaty ears?  Wireless headphones.  Sony just came out with a pair that's getting very good reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's like $280.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem.  Decent headphones are going to cost you more than $99.  I'm listening to books.  I like my Jabra's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So the Jabra 65Ts are the old ones that I have had forever and ran through the washing  machine and the dryer twice.  They sound good.  You can buy those now because they're like three years old but they sound good on calls  and they play very well.  They're like $200 I think, right?  No, no, no.  The 65Ts now are like...  Oh, because they're old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How much are they, Jeff?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I have.  Oh, oh.  Yeah, they're good.  They're okay.  I really liked the design and the sound of the buds.  I just got so mad at them because they didn't work.  And I think they've said, there was a story somewhere, I think they went down saying,  this is how we fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Supposedly, they don't have the disconnect problems going through people with meaty heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, now you're calling me...  My head is meaty.  I'm irascible and I have an old fart or toe.  You're both irascible and I have a meaty head.  This is what makes me irascible, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  His lower third continues to grow, folks.  I have ordered...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I ordered a pair of...  Scott Wilkinson recommended Sennheiser, but they're wired headphones, the IE 300 earbuds.  How much were those?  They were 300 bucks.  They're really expensive.  Yeah.  But they sound so good.  I've ordered these.  They're the new wireless.  They're 250 though, the Momentum 2s.  And I hear very good things.  But wait till I get them and I'll let you know.  It's a big investment.  It's expensive.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But if you think about how much...  This is my argument for paying a lot for a mattress.  But if you think about how much you're on the phone and dealing with calls or listening...  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But I have to say, twice bitten, third time shy, I'm not going to buy the Pixel Buds.  The Samsung Galaxy Buds are great.  Florence Ion still uses them.  I still use mine.  Those are pretty old too.  I bet you can get those cheap.  According to Google, they fixed the audio cutouts, which is the thing that bothered  you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How did they do this?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh boy did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Did they say anything about how?  Yes.  So they say the Pixel Buds, the new ones, the A series, don't do it.  They tried to fix it in software, but the problem is clearly hardware.  So nine to five Google asked them.  Google said one key change was made to avoid the problem where the original Pixel Buds  would connect one earbud to the phone and then relay the signal from the first earbud  to the other through your meaty head.  The A series connects both to the phone.  Doi.  So the problem was this transmission through your head wasn't working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why was it worse when I was outside and walking?  That's why it never made any sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Maybe you're breathing more.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe you're...  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Anyway, because each pair is separately.  I think everybody else does it this way, by the way.  Yeah.  I think so too.  You don't have that problem.  I remember Google was kind of making a big deal about the fact that, oh yeah, we'd send  it through your head.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's a bad idea, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Bad idea, Google.  Stadia is coming to Chromecast with Google TV, the newest Chromecast, and select Android  TV devices June 23rd.  So originally it was for one particular Chromecast, but now you can do it with a new...  It was weird because they released a new Chromecast, the one with Google TV, and they said, oh  yeah, but Stadia doesn't work on it.  Well, good news.  It does or will soon.  And I have that.  Actually, it's really great.  It's like 25 bucks.  I mean, it's nothing or 30 bucks.  I really like it.  Stadia will also become available on a handful of Android TV and Google TV devices, including  Walmart's $25 O&N dongle, the Hisense Android Smart TVs, Nvidia Shield TV, yes, Shield TV  Pro, that's the one I have, Philips, a number of Philips OLEDs, and regular TVs if you've  got Android TV in the Xiaomi Mi Box 3 and 4.  Stadia is...  That's good.  I like Stadia a lot.  You still need to get the Stadia controller, really, but now you at least you can maybe  do it on the device you already have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  If you need a Stadia controller, give me a holler.  Really?  I have one that I'm not using.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You never use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's still sitting down there in front of the television.  Oh, that's a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way, that's not the only update to the Chromecast with Google TV.  They're improving Bluetooth latency.  In fact, the update is big.  It's 83 megabytes.  It's a minor software update, but that sounds pretty major to me.  This is coming out June 23rd.  Improvements on Bluetooth latency for speakers and headphones.  Apparently there was some stuttering and latency is, of course, terrible and something like  that because the lip sync is so important.  Advanced video settings don't reset after reboots on some TVs and additional bug fixes  and performance improvements.  Download the update on your Chromecast with Google TV.  Every month, Pixel does not only a security update, but a feature drop, the June feature  drop includes, you'll like this, an Astro photography video and that Photos Locked  folder that Google talked about at Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I didn't have much to say about the Photos Locked folder, but the Astro, this is actually  compelling to me compared to the photograph that it creates because the photograph is  more of a simulation.  It's not necessarily, but from a video standpoint, I think it would look pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's going to be a time lapse.  So if you wanted to get an eclipse or sunrise or sunset to sunrise or something like that,  you'll be able to do a time lapse, which is really, really cool.  These pixel drops are free.  They just, it's basically adding to the features of your phone.  Photography will now include night sight time lapse video.  You'll obviously need a tripod or something steady to put the phone on.  And you'll need a Pixel 4 or newer with a night sight clip automatically generated.  Three new Pride wallpapers, Pride themed ringtones, I'm proud, I'm proud, a notification sound  from LBGTQ Plus artists and YouTube creators.  And the new Google Assistant can now pick up or decline calls.  When your phone is ringing, but you can't reach it, you can answer or reject a call  with Assistant.  You say, hey, you know who, answer call or hey, you know who, reject call.  You can shout at the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Love that.  Reject.  After copying text Gboard, the Google keyboard will surface key snippets, phone numbers,  email addresses, and URLs with custom icons or pills in the suggestion strip.  So that's kind of neat.  If you copy the text, you can kind of see it.  It's a little bit of a small screenshot, but you can kind of see it here in this nine to  five Google article.  See these little pills right above the keyboard?  It said, you know, you should copy that or you got that message.  This was a phone number or, oh, this was an email address.  So that's kind of neat.  I like that.  There is now car crash detection in the personal safety app.  I'm sorry.  There has been.  It's now coming.  It's already been in the UK, Australia and the US.  It's now coming to Spain, Ireland, and Singapore.  Somebody spent some time at Google and coded a new feature to digital wellbeing to detect  when you're walking and looking at your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The phone will periodically remind you, Hey, hey, look where you're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Pretend it's a city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I love that idea.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I love that.  It's called, it's part of the heads up.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I just asked, I asked, does it do it in Fran Lebowitz's voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Pretend it's a city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That'd be great.  That'd be so great.  I love that.  Weirdly, this is really not, this is a change log of the sense that it's something that's  going away.  Google which has already given up on cardboard and the dream, whatever that was, 3D viewer  and all that stuff is now Daydream.  That's it.  It's now pulling the plug on the measure app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I've used it twice.  Yeah, but ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You could just leave it.  I've used it a couple of times, but it's useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was useful when I needed it.  Most of the time I just grabbed the tape measure that's right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But this way you could be looking at a banana on your desk and point the phone at it and  know that it's seven and a half inches.  I think that's useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So we talked about this a little in the show.  I think it's weird because Google's backing off AR when everybody else is really investing

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  in it.  Yes, it's so strange.  We talked about that on Windows Weekly today.  Apple's like all in on AR all of a sudden.  Both Microsoft and Google are just kind of, it was fun, but we don't need to do it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Microsoft is actually investing in AR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  HoloLens, yeah.  But what we were talking about is, and you may not remember this, you'd have to be following  Windows very closely.  But one of the Windows updates about two years ago was called the Creators Update and they  showed how you could get this 3D object and it was easy to capture them and you could  put it in 3D paint and they killed 3D paint a couple of months ago.  A lot of those features have disappeared.  I think Microsoft thought everybody would be using 3D.  And no, the HoloLens is real and it's being used in a variety of applications, but it's  not like a whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Apple focuses more on the creator than Microsoft does and it seems like it's always been that  way.  So they're going to continue to push this, especially on the video standpoint with the  way they handle XDR displays and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think the difference is between an industrial use and a consumer use.  And Microsoft's very much gone to the industrial uses of HoloLens.  Google seems to have given up completely.  And Apple's very much...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, that's because there are buyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They're bigger fish to fry with other revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And then Apple's very much all in on it, but they have a phone.  So Microsoft doesn't have a phone.  It's kind of hard to do consumer grade AAR without some sort of mobile device.  You know, HoloLens is what?  Wait, no, they bought Nokia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Say that with a straight face.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I couldn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I couldn't do it.  Yeah, whatever happened to that?  It's so hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It was a phone or something, wasn't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Whatever happened to that?  Yeah, they had the Lumia line.  And I know of one person shooting that still uses that Lumia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It was a great camera.  It was superseded by the iPhone and the Pixel, but it was for its time the best camera.  Yeah, for its time it was pretty high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It was like 40, I think it was 41 megapixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The Nest Hub browser.  There's three words that don't go together.  I've never used the browser on my Nest Hub, but apparently it's gotten better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I've never used a browser on my Nest Hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I know.  Is it just like when you ask for something and it shows it to you?  There's actually a keyboard pops up and you could type in searches.  What?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Who is that targeted for?  Is it targeted for the grandkids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Why would the grandkids use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think about my mom.  She has one of these devices.  I don't know which one it is.  Every now and then, not our kids, but little kids are over there visiting her and they  like to talk to Google.  I don't know, maybe they get a kick out of being over there to tap the screen and pull  some stuff up that they're looking for based on some weird card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I called the keyboard to search for YouTube videos when Google just would not give me  what I was asking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I've done that.  Right.  Yeah.  I've done that.  Apparently, there was a browser.  Now it's a little bit better and maybe that'll make it more usable.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You know that room you never go in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We painted it.  It's coming right in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's really nice now.  It's really nice now.  And that's the Google change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I think there's a rule here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Leo.  Are you done?  Are you experiencing the Stacey hunger pains?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just got tired all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, that's exactly how I feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, I'm actually looking at stories to see which one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The more stories there are in the rundown, the fewer we do.  It's an inverse proportion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's a direct inverse proportion.  So I have left behind many a story and I probably should go through all of these.  Oh my God.  There's page after page.  Thank you, Jason.  I appreciate it, Jason Howell, doing a yeoman's job of putting stuff together.  Ohio is suing Google wants to declare it a public utility.  This is dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Let's not talk about it.  No, Common Carrier doesn't apply to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You saved me.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is a stupid story.  Let's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, it's not.  I mean, it's a stupid idea, but they're doing it.  It's your assertion that the courts will laugh them out of the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But on what basis?  We can't even go ahead, Jeff.  No, I was a question on what basis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We haven't even been able to establish in the court system that broadband companies  are common carriers.  So I don't see how you could say that Google isn't anything except an information service.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's pretty hard to believe.  Google's response.  Ohioans simply don't want the government to run Google like a gas or electric company.  This lawsuit has no basis in fact or law and will defend ourselves against it in court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I would love it if they hired the same lawyers that AT&T and Verizon hired.  Or actually, it was Verizon that sued for the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They did in fact go through this, didn't they?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, Verizon did.  Verizon and I think it was Timo sued over the first neutrality order that Google called  for.  Google's talking points are the exact same talking points that AT&T and Timo.  I like how you have a pet name for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I have pet names for everybody.  This is a bizarre story.  We talked about this on Windows Weekly.  are joining forces to make extensions compatible across browser.  I use extensions.  Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge all will be able to use the same.  Well, we'll see, but this is a W3C consortium with the goal of making it easier for developers  to write extensions because there'll be a shared standard, a common browser extension  standard.  That would be very interesting.  I think it's a great idea.  Yeah, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you were an Amazon shareholder, would you be upset at the idea that Jeff Bezos is  going up in the space?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think this must be why he retired.  Otherwise, the board would say, I'm sorry, you're running the company.  You ain't gone up in a spaceship.  Have you lost your damn mind?  So Bezos announced he's going to be a passenger in the very first manned flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like getting the first pixel buttons.  You know, that's a mistake.  You might have to wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  He and his brother, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Their first manned flight.  I don't know how risky this is.  You know, there's always a risk when you strap a million tons of high explosive to your butt  and launch yourself into space.  And then land with a parachute.  This is scheduled for July 20th at a West Texas because East Texas is busy suing them.  No joke.  He posted this on Instagram.  He said he'll be one of the inaugural passengers on the New Shepard spacecraft.  He and his brother, Mark, will be on board.  I guess, you know, it's a good move if he makes it because, you know, it shows, it asserts  his belief in the safety of what they're doing.  He on his Instagram post, he says, well, maybe we could play the audio here.  Let's play.  Let's play Mr. Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it's a thing I've wanted to do all my life.  It's an adventure.  It's a big deal for me.  I invited my brother to come on this first flight because we're close.  We were drunk.  I want you to come with me.  Would you?  Are you serious?  He would be meaningful.  Have my brother there.  Only if you came off the dumb hat.  I was expecting him to say that he was going to be on the first flight.  And then when he...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, his brother's a firefighter.  That's cool.  I was just awestruck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seriously?  If you're willing, if you want to.  Yeah.  What a remarkable opportunity not only to have this adventure, but to be able to do it with  my best friend.  I'd say yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Aw, that's really sweet.  What would Lisa say if you said you wanted to go on?  She would let me.  But she'd make sure my will was completed before I could.  She would have all the red tape squaring away.  She'd make sure I made sure all the insurance was in her name and so forth.  But it is risky.  And I think if he were still CEO, the board would say no.  Oh, yeah.  No, absolutely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  That is definitely beyond...  They would have to.  You can't send your CEO into space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No bungee jumping.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm sure most contracts have provisions like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, they do.  They have prohibitions against certain, like skydiving, that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  New Shepard has made 15 uncrewed test flights.  So, you know, it's survived all 15.  Of course, as the Wall Street Journal points out, most commercial aircraft don't carry  passengers before undergoing an intensive series of hundreds of piloted flights.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little scary, but you know what?  Good for him.  He's gutsy.  Well, something equally scary I put in the rundown here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Banana peel bacon.  Ooh.  The new thing on TikTok.  Oh, of course it's on TikTok.  Of course it is.  Hey, watch it, Ant.  There's a new musical called In the Heights Out.  I could be pulling up things from that.  That's a great musical, Jeff.  It's an old musical.  It's an old musical.  It's a great musical.  It's a great musical.  It's a great musical.  It's a great musical.  It's a great musical.  It's a great musical.  It's a great musical.  It's a great musical.  It's a great musical.  It's an old musical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's an old musical.  It's an old musical.  It's an old musical.  It's an old musical.  Yes, but it's now a movie.  That's what's new.  Banana peel bacon.  So this is the Washington Post.  We made it and we're not convinced.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I say ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Ooh.  The rubbery casings have long been used in cooking in India, sometimes in curries.  There's a South Indian stir fry called toran.  All right.  I'm willing to try it.  You're going to try it?  All right.  I'm willing to try it.  So how does it work?  It's the origins of the dish, writes the Post, are murky.  A 2019 recipe for a faken, like a steak-um, but a faken, posted on Lifehacker calls for  frying the peels first, then glazing them.  But a popular and much cited iteration making the rounds now comes from Charles Hunter III,  a personal chef and food blogger at The Salted Table.  He took his inspiration from a video posted by vegan TikTok star Tabitha Brown.  Her carrot bacon, I see carrot bacon I could dig.  That makes sense.  It was a viral hit.  She didn't like the banana version she attempted.  Her verdict, quote, it ain't right in my spirit, end quote.  Okay.  He ditched her air frying method, experimented a bit.  Here's how he does it.  You marinate the peels in a mixture that mimics the flavor of bacon with liquid smoke  and smoked paprika, and then you crisp them in the pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why not just have bacon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well thank you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Because it's vegan, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Maybe that.  All right.  Maybe that.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never mind.  Stacy, Stacy, would you ever try it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't think I want to eat a banana peel.  Yeah, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Honey, it's my birthday.  My birthday.  It's my birthday.  My birthday.  Ooh, it's my birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I certainly wouldn't eat banana peel on my birthday.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  In who?  Because it's my birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I said to myself, self, she said, girl, what is going on on this day?  I said, girl, it's my birthday.  I want to try something that I had seen, but I want to try it my way.  I want a good old BLT.  Y'all know I'm a big fan of the TTLA, but I've been trying not to eat as much processed  food lately.  There we go.  Who knows?  So y'all been seeing the folk making bacon out of a banana peel.  Now when I had first seen it, I got to be honest.  All right, I had enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Have you had enough?  Yep.  This is longer than I thought.  I thought it was a TikTok-length thing.  Yeah, but it's 22 minutes.  Oh, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is like those recipe blogs where you're like, and here's the story of how it came  by the recipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, that's too much.  Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, and ingredients here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is why TikTok's great.  It's a minute, right?  It can't be longer.  That's great.  It shouldn't be long.  Nothing should be longer than a minute.  Did you get two minutes?  Even so.  I don't know.  I feel like some of them feel a lot longer than a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay.  Then they're just bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We got a whole bunch of TikTok stories.  I'm just going to skip them.  I'm just going to skip right through them.  The feds got the money for the colonial ransomware attack.  We're not sure how.  There is a warrant.  It looks like, I'm guessing, either one of two things.  They convinced somebody who knew the password to the Bitcoin wallet to give it to them,  or, and I suspect this is what really happened, the ransomware people had set up what's called  a custodial wallet with an exchange so they could buy money with the Bitcoin, and the  exchange got the subpoena and handed over the ransomware.  But anyway, the feds recovered two million bucks.  I bet they keep it though, don't you think?  They don't give it back to Colonial.  They just go, yeah, yeah, we confiscated it.  Colonial CEO said that the password was very complicated.  No word about it.  Is that funny?  Yeah, I don't know what he thinks is complicated.  You know what it might be worth talking about?  He says it was not a Colonial 123 type password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay, that's a big difference from that to very complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Complicated, yeah.  When all of this stuff went down, I was on vacation and I'm sorry the garbage truck shows  up right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you were cleaning the house.  There was a little vacuuming going on there.  Is it, it's all right.  He's muted.  Any day now.  No, yeah, that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We like to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's life.  But yeah, this happened during my vacation and when I was back in South Carolina visiting  my mother and I really wasn't paying too much attention to the news other than the show  and went to go somewhere to, you know, go take some pictures and I stopped to get some  gasoline and it was this long line.  I'm like, what the heck is happening?  And there was no gas anywhere in my mom's place.  And it took me, I want to say it took about three days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  About three days to get gasoline.  Wow.  No gas, so I pretty much stayed on the couch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a little scary.  You forget how reliant we are.  Yeah.  Final story, then we're going to take a break and get your picks of the week, but because  Stacey's very excited about our pick of the week this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Look at her.  For those of you on audio.  It looked like an empty chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She's getting it.  She's getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's in a big box.  Oh, she's getting it.  All right.  But last story.  My pick of the week came.  Yay.  Oh, see, that's what I've been delaying for.  El Salvador, which used to have its currency, the US dollar.  This is like lazy.  We don't want to make up a currency.  We'll just use yours if that's all right.  They have now become the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.  Good for them.  What could possibly go wrong there?  They voted by a super majority in favor of the Bitcoin law.  The price of Bitcoin went up as a result.  Oh, rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It was only about a 5% uptake, so not that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Prices can now be shown in Bitcoin.  Taxes can be paid with Bitcoin and exchanges in Bitcoin will not be subject to capital  gains tax.  Did you see how much tax the top billionaires?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't get me started on this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, no, I have a new toy.  I want to show everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  OK, OK, OK.  It's not a tech story, except it's a lot of tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That story is click bait of the worst.  Oh, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, they paid more tax than that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  OK, no, I have a new toy.  He's paid a billion dollars in taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He paid a billion dollars in taxes.  But it wasn't his income tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he paid a billion dollars in personal.  So it's wrong.  Found a year or two when he didn't know.  They're just trying to argue.  They come up with a whole new structure for taxes saying that these guys should be taxed  on the growth and wealth.  Well, that's ridiculous.  What happens when it goes down the next year?  Right.  What if you own a farm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's what you know.  If you're rich, you're usually your tax bill is not your income.  It's you know, your income tax is like anybody else's.  But the capital gains tax is much lower.  A lot of what rich people make is capital gains, not not income.  That's straight income.  So and yeah, I mean, I don't want to get in that.  So let's take a break.  And when we come back, it's time for Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to torture Stacy and get as long as we can to get to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, this ad is going to be long.  You know why?  Because it's for my favorite sponsor, Audible.  Well, I love them all equally, but I am a big Audible fan.  I've been an Audible member since 2000, 21 years.  Forget about last summer.  We kind of missed last summer, but this summer, we're going to get some beach towels.  We're going to stock the cooler.  We're going to escape.  We're going to the beach, celebrate the best season of the year like never before with  great stories and programs from Audible.  Now is the absolute best time to do it because Prime members, if you're an Amazon Prime  member, you can save 53% off your first four months.  I was a Audible member before Prime existed, before Amazon existed.  But if you, for some reason, after all my exhortations, have not yet started to listen  to audio content from Audible, you better get doing.  You better go.  There's Andy Weir's Hail Mary.  I love that.  That's right on the front, right in the middle.  That is such a great audio book from Audible.  Audible has it all, not just an unbeatable selection of audio books, tons of binge-worthy  podcasts, exclusive originals, all available to download or stream.  As an Audible member, you get to choose a title a month, like the latest bestseller  or the hottest new release.  It's yours to keep forever.  But here's the best part.  You also get full access to Audible's streaming library.  That's the plus catalog.  So you never run out of great audio content.  Discover your next podcast obsession.  Take that audio book off your bucket list.  Get lost in a world of original content from celebrity creators, bestselling authors, leading  experts.  There's Matthew McConaughey's new audio book.  I just finished the Barack Obama audio book.  Covers his first term in office in his early life.  It's amazing.  Oh my gosh, I love that audio book.  So good.  But that's the problem.  There's so many wonderful audio books.  By the way, Barack reads his audio book.  So it really feels like you're there in the Oval Office with him.  It's really neat.  What's great is with Audible Plus, you can stream all you want as much as you want.  So even if you've finished your audio book, your title a month, you've got plenty more  to listen to.  Audible is the perfect companion for summer because no matter where you're going, no matter  what you're doing, you'll always have just the right thing to listen to at your fingertips.  for road trips, lazy days, beach days, long bike rides, barbecuing in the backyard.  I honestly listen to Audible while I'm gaming because I want to make sure that that's not  completely wasted time.  I got through an entire 26 hour audio book just the other day playing it while I'm listening,  playing Valheim while I'm listening to The Wheel of Time.  The first, somebody in the Discord recommended said, you've never listened to The Wheel of  Time series from Robert Jordan?  I said no.  It's like a 28 hour.  29 hours and 57 minutes.  Let's call it 30 hours.  But that's the thing.  I did it listening to them playing Valheim.  So it was great.  And by the way, there's 15 of them.  So I'm just getting started.  I've just started the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Some of them are longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Most of them are longer.  They're long.  I know.  But I love it because it's immersive.  So this is an interesting thing.  Some people like longer audio books because you get immersed and you become a part of  it.  Sometimes people like short stories.  I mix it up.  I'll listen to nonfiction then fiction.  I also like the great courses.  I love the music stuff they do.  There's so much great stuff on Audible.  Broadway shows.  It's just fantastic.  Look, I don't know how to convince you.  Become an Audible member.  If you're an Amazon Prime member, there's no better time to do it.  If you're not an Amazon Prime member, well, go to Amazon and sign up so you can get this  deal, right?  And so much more.  Get more out of summer with Audible.  Take advantage of this incredible limited time offer.  Go to audible.com slash twig.  And if you're listening after the deal has expired and you're a new member, try Audible  Plus for 30 days with the free trial.  That'll be there too.  Audible.com slash twig.  Or text twig to 500-500.  Text TWIG to 500-500.  You'll get a link.  You can put it on your phone.  The app is great.  I live in the Audible app.  In fact, I love it because I have carplay in my car.  I get in the car.  My book starts up as I'm, the minute I'm in the car driving home.  I listen all the time to Audible.  Audible.com, A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com slash twig.  Thank you Audible for more than two decades of fantastic content and for supporting TWIG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm about to finish what they really call it part four of five parts of my German and  boy am I learning how stupid I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Which German?  Are you doing the Pimsleur?  Which one are you doing?  Pimsleur.  Yeah.  That was your tip.  It's a great way to get Pimsleur for a lot less through Audible.  I've got to learn Spanish.  We're going to Mexico in October and I've just got to learn Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pimsleur is great because Pimsleur also is about the pronunciation.  So you're going to sound better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Silently think of the answer to the question asked.  You need to speak the answer out loud to set up a circuit of the language you are learning  to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the key.  So you listen but you speak along with it or something.  I do it in the car mainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we're walking, I kind of mumble it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to do it.  I have two credits from Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Pimsleur Spanish is very good.  I'm just too dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, I just I really enjoyed the visual of Jeff running around with his sweaty earbuds  or sweaty earbuds yelling at people in German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That would be funny.  That would be funny.  Yeah.  You know what?  That's a good deal.  I've got the credits.  I'm going to do it.  Put them both in my cart.  That gets me through 15 lessons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You do a half an hour a day.  That's the deal.  And then they would say don't do more.  No mas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Solamente.  Oh man, I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Una hora.  No.  Demi hora.  Demi hora.  No entiendo.  No entiendo.  Stacey, your thing of the week.  Okay, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Box opening.  Yes.  Box opening.  Look at her face.  She's just glowing with excitement.  Oh, Nanoli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Today's present is the Nanoleaf Elements.  It's made out of wood?  Please hold up.  Dang it.  I didn't open this part.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So we know the Nanoleaf.  We've talked about it before.  Micah has them in his house.  What is that?  Octagonal?  What's the shape of that?  This is a hexagon.  Hexagon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Six.  Okay.  It is a hexagon and it is made of faux wood and it looks really nice and when it's lit  up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is great because you don't look like you've got plastic things on your wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Exactly.  You've got these pretty things on your wall and they glow very nicely.  They only glow in the whites and they are very expensive.  So the starter packs comes with seven and the controller.  Let me grab the controller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is why I never had the Nanoleafs because I don't want plastic pieces on my wall but  if it's wood that might be kind of nice.  You can make a shape with them, right?  What shape?  Here comes Stacey.  She's like, where are you going?  She sounds like Fibber McGee's closet.  What are you doing?  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  All right.  So here's the controller that you plug in.  I'm going to show you everything.  Oh, it looks like another tile.  Yeah.  It's got the faux wood too.  I just turned it on.  I can't, you can't, my light is too bright for you to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So it's not a bright light.  It's a glow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So each panel gives out 22 lumens which is not really enough to give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You couldn't read by it but it's good for watching TV or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  Ambiance.  I'm using it for art.  I have a giant wall.  It's 11 feet long by that tall.  And so I, what I've got is I got the starter pack which is $300.  So $299.99.  This is not cheap.  And that's seven panels which is a good size but I have 15 of the older panels and that's  a really good size.  It gives you a lot of variety.  Each expansion pack is going to be $99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, that's not bad.  Oh, we only get three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Leo's like that's fine.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So what they did is they've got these will like work with sound like the other Nanoleafs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, so like pulses to your music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Your music, clapping, your voice.  I'll show you.  I can show you a demo in a couple of weeks.  But the other thing I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's about how big is that?  About eight inches something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is eight by nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Eight by nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Let me give you a hexagon.  Oh, here it is glowing.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You can see it.  Yeah, it's a nice warm glow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's nice.  And the color temperature ranges from 400 which is pretty cool all the way to like this  really warm ember thing.  This is the cool light.  Okay, so in the back mount it mounts on your wall using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, it's still plastic isn't it?  It's just wood grain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, it's faux wood.  Yeah.  Oh, so you you mounted on your wall.  This is the command tape from 3N.  What's nice about this is you want to take it off your wall.  You pull this off.  Oh nice.  And then you can pull your tape off this way.  So it used to be that you had the tape kind of around the edges here.  Yeah.  And that was kind of gimpy looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it doesn't peel off your wallpaper or your nobody has wallpaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Theoretically I have when I have taken these off before not these particular ones but they  have taken some of my wall texture with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I just scared my dog.  So I purchased these and then I purchased an additional five expansion packs and I'm  going to make a 21 because that is the maximum number I can stick on the power supply that  they sent you.  So 21 is the max.  Well you can buy a bigger power supply if you want more panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So if you want you can spend thousands of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yes they will take your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it works.  It works with HomeKit.  Oh yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is a good part y'all.  I forgot about this.  Okay.  Works with HomeKit, Google, Amazon and it will act as a thread board.  It will be a border router when matter comes out.  No.  Yeah.  Okay.  You're being sarcastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No.  I know.  That's very cool.  That's very cool.  No.  I'm sure that's wonderful.  If I knew what it meant I'd be really excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  When you have matter, what used to be Project Connected Home over IP Project Chip, matter  is going to support Wi-Fi and thread.  And so thread is for all of your like sensor nodes because it's low power, it goes directly  to the internet, it's mesh network.  But you're going to have some things that control those thread devices that also speak  Wi-Fi.  Right now you've got like a HomeKit, HomePod mini.  We don't know if the Google stuff is actually going to be act as that bridge basically between  Wi-Fi and thread.  So right now we don't know what devices will act as that.  But these definitely will.  So that's why it's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Do you feel it's lovely?  Is it really a beautiful thing that you have on your wall there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay, so I do.  These are way prettier than the other ones.  I liked the other ones and we use them as art.  The reason I'm buying this is because I can spend $800 on these and build something that  is pretty, that is not a gallery wall and is not fancy expensive paintings, which cost  me way more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, I mean it's certainly less expensive than paintings.  Yeah, okay.  But it's like abstract shape just on the wall.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That glows and it has light patterns like you can set it.  It glows.  It glows.  No, it's really like it's very, I'll just, okay, I'll show you later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, we've seen, no, we saw your old nano leaves.  I remember you took us downstairs to look at those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So I'll show you this when I get those up.  I'm just not hip enough for this I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That looks good.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  See, I mean think how nice that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's flickering with a fire.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And they have this, I like the cool flickers actually.  Like this is one of my favorite patterns right here.  Not that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's kind of the future.  I feel like I'd be living in the future if I had these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It feels like if IKEA married a Phillips Hue, this is what they would make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, it looks just like a firefly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, that's just cheesy as all that.  My neck in the woods now, cicadas.  Oh, are you getting the cicadas now?  I was in Princeton yesterday.  They were thick.  I'm 25 miles north.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So is it a mating season?  This is the season when they breed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, not season, it's every 17 years.  Yeah, that's what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like only, wow.  So this is it.  This is the year they breed.  Is that true all over the world or just in New Jersey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's some 13 year cicadas.  There's some 17 year cicadas.  So weird.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's just a weird thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're just thick.  Yeah.  Somebody said, actually, it's professors come out to finish their books and have sex once every 17 years also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But they don't make that annoying sound, or maybe they do.  Yes, well they do.  Actually, we drone on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Nanoleaf element, nanoleaf.me if you want to find out more.  Now in wood grain.  Is it all the same kind of wood?  Is it all the same kind of wood or can you get birch, cherry?  It is all the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is why I feel like it's Ikea because it's a very Scandinavian choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's a birchy kind of color.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's a blonde wood.  And the starter pack has seven and the expansion packs have three.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Thank you, Stacey.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, I'm going to do two real quick.  One is to mention very quickly the year 1478.  That was when Oxford University.  I remember 1478.  A few centuries ago.  Yeah, it was the beginnings of printing at Oxford University.  They just announced they are shutting off their presses.  Oh no, the Oxford University Press?  Well, the press stays alive, but they're not going to print themselves.  They're going to job it out.  So they were actually printing their own books.  Oh yes.  Wow.  Or some good portion of them, yes.  I had quite a few Oxford University Press books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, so do I.  Unfortunately, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're beautiful.  Speaking of printing then, we have very much excitement the Lego typewriter, line 196 there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What is a Lego typewriter?  It's a typewriter you can make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't really work, but it's out of 2,079 pieces.  This is supposed to be a number here.  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This cookie, this cookie, boy, that was a big cookie banner.  This is made out of Lego?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, 279 pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  All the custom Lego pieces?  That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would just love to have the key top Lego pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's pretty cool looking.  That's a classic manual typewriter.  Oh yeah, there's the letters.  That's neat.  That's nice.  I don't think this is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, it's so tidy.  Look at it.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, it's so cute.  Jeff, you want me to send you my tiny typewriter?  Is that Mr. Lego?  Oh, here's building it.  That's cute.  Oh, you have a tiny typewriter?  Oh, look, it actually, the keys move.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And if there was paper in here, it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, it works.  Well, I don't think you can really type.  You'd think you'd break it if you really typed, but still, that's cool.  That is a hipster right there.  Right there, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a typewriter planter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What the hell is that?  Is there a planter there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It looks like something bad happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It really does.  It looks like one of those old adding machines, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You may want to know that the same person was the inspiration for the first successful typewriter and for the London type.  I've been researching this.  James O. Cleffane was a stenographer to Abraham Lincoln, and he wanted a typewriter.  And the guy who invented it, Scholes, agreed to send him one, and he'd try it out.  And he'd bang the hell out of them and send back and say, here's all the problems with it.  He did that seven times, drove the inventor insane, but that was the first sellable typewriter with Remington.  And then he met Ottmar Murgenthaler, and he was the buddy who kept that process going and leading to the line of type.  So you can thank for the typewriter, James O. Cleffane.  Wake up, wake up.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yes.  I was going to say, what now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Wow, I'm sad about Oxford University Press.  That's sad.  Let's do an ant thing.  Ant Pruitt.  What do you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know, selfies are pretty daggum popular, even though I can't stand them.  I'd much rather you have a self-portrait.  There was a story over on Reddit of what could possibly be the first selfie from back in 1952-ish.  A gentleman was out in Korea with this camera.  He's trying to figure out, OK, I need to go ahead and use this film up and decided to just snap a cool photograph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And then he wrote on the back, there was no one around to take the last shot on the camera.  So I held it up in front of me, outstretched arms and snapped the shutter.  Don't shut her wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But it's a pretty cool shot.  It's a selfie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's no doubt about it.  Yeah.  I would love to get this old school cool for sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It was on Reddit and I want to say somebody else wrote about it.  Headtopics.com, they actually wrote a little bit more about it.  I just thought it was pretty cool.  And then lastly, well, no, not lastly.  Another one is this is for our editor, Mr. Kevin, not the editor of this show, but Mr. Kevin edits a lot of shows.  And he's a shark.  He loves the shark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He is shark weak.  You can't even get him out of bed.  He just loves.  No, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, Baby Shark, I found out about this through one of my friends.  He's been working with this team of developers and they've come up with their own cryptocurrency.  Oh, Baby Shark token.  And it's pretty funny.  I laughed at him, but I've been talking to him more and they've actually been doing some pretty pretty nice work and trying to actually raise money to help do some conservation stuff.  They raised, I want to say about three grand at one point and gave it to the University of Miami for for some of their aquatic stuff down there and shark conservation.  And then they raised another 10 grand.  Wow.  And they actually started doing this for the Ghillie shark preserve, I believe is what it's called.  And it's fully documented and they sent them the money and they just want to continue to keep doing stuff like that to help preserve our oceans and actually help tell people to hey, start cleaning up the land too because there's a lot of parks out here that are just flat out filthy.  And they're also just continuing to leave a bunch of trash out and you know, so they're just trying to raise some money to help, you know, get that stuff cleaned up around around the world.  I just wanted to give them a shout.
