Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So she was staring down at Trump.  There's a great picture.  Somebody put up on Twitter right behind her of her just looking at Trump and you  could imagine the evil eye that she properly gave him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cause he called her what a spoiled little girl.  Just stay home and watch movies with your, with your friends.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the, but the, but the word is all of Davos loves Trump this year.  Yeah.  Stock market's good and they think he's just fine.

The queen of IOT, Stacy on IOT.com at Giga Stacey.  Is it, should I, would it be better to call you the king of IOT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I accept the queen of, I've been the queen of the cloud, the queen of  something weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't mean that in a diminutive way.  I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, of course not.  Queens are very powerful in their own right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just look at Elizabeth.  We have the longest reigning queen in the history of Great Britain on the,  on the throne is as we speak.  Perhaps the world.  Perhaps.  We don't know.  No one knows because records haven't been kept since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just finished, uh, two books, one about the life of Charles the fifth and one  about the Philip the second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Charles the fifth is the one they named the Spaniels after, I believe.  Yes, I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all I know, madam.  You like Spaniels.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the holy Roman.  Elizabeth doesn't get a corky named after her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She should.  She should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She should have Queen Elizabeth corgis.  I think she should.  She's definitely.  She did a lot for the breed.  She's done so much for corgis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, and the most poignant thing is that she decided to stop having them  because she knew that she was going to leave them and didn't want to do that.  Oh, I didn't know that.  So no more, no new corgis.  No new corgis.  Are there any corgis left?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  Too old for new dogs.  She hasn't outlived them yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, there are no corgis left.  There are only two dorkies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dorkies?  There are dorkies, dachshund and corgis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's not a good mix.  If you could make corgis legs shorter, would you really?  Alphabet is now.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the newest member of the Quattro Cama Club.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A trillionaire, trillion dollars.  So Apple did it.  Microsoft did it.  Now, now Alphabet's done it.  That's a silly number.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's, it is amazing.  You know, from, from what was going to be a pizza delivery service in a dorm room.  Was it?  Wait a minute.  What?  Yeah.  What?  That was their first idea.  Their first idea, Larry and Sergey was to do a pizza service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess I'm sad that they didn't.  Yes.  It would have been the best ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pizza service.  Yes.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Actually, Punter Joe's explaining that dorgies, that is dachshund and corgi mixes are,  think of it as a stretch corgi, the showy limos of dachshund.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Amazon hit a trillion before Google.  Oh, Amazon did it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah, I forgot that.  All of the companies that Elizabeth Warren wants to break up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another, it's a shorthand way of referring to it.  Anti-success, anti-capitalism.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm still now, now she's back at it, but yeah, I disagree with her there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, I don't know what to say.  I feel like, you know, there was this congressional hearing in Boulder,  Colorado where they ganged up.  Did I, do we talk about that?  Or was that on Twitter?  I think, I don't think we talked about it on this show yet.  They ganged up on Google, Amazon, David Hannemeyer Hansen said the  most unlikely thing ever, help us Congress.  You're our only hope.  They got the guy who invented pop sockets to come in and said, it's  just hard to do business on Amazon.  We tried to get off Amazon, but it cost us $10 million.  So it's so hard for us to be on Amazon.  Which it sounds like Amazon made him $10 million, but that he's not happy about it.  Yeah.  Uh, the complaints from tile, which makes those, what are those little Bluetooth  trackers, Apple had the temerity to put, find my iPhone in the iPhone instead of  saying, well, you can get the tile, just glue a tile to the back of your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The iPhone doesn't allow devices close access to the radio on the phone.  So that that works with an iPhone though.  It does.  I'm just saying that there there's a little bit more subtlety to  this complaint, but keep going.  Well, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing about the complaint is, um, and this is her, you know,  historically been always the people complain about windows in the day that  they had secret, uh, routines that the only Microsoft could use on their apps.  And this was true.  And, but Apple has an even better excuse than Microsoft does.  Which is we want to lock up the radios.  We want to isolate apps from one another.  We want to lock our phone down because it's better for security.  Yeah, sure.  On Android, any app can access these radios and that's the Apple says, and I  think with some justification, a security flaw and it has caused Android problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's not, it's not crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway, these, these were, it reminded me and I even attempted to  pronounce like son, jeez, right.  Which,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's a new version coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is what it reminded me of, of all of the publishers in Germany,  going to the EU saying, Oh, this Google, they're competing against us.  Please do something.  It feels like the, that these companies, the headline in the post companies burned  by big tech plead for Congress to regulate Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google.  But it's not completely clear to me that these companies are stomping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God didn't give those companies the revenue they had.  They lost it.  Better competitors came along.  This happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sonos is suing Google saying they copied their, you know, multi room place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of being pissed at companies.  Are you, is your Sonos stuff going to be obsolete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So no.  So, but I think what they did is wrong.  So the way it worked is they offered a 30% off to upgrade my existing Sonos to  the new Sonos with new capabilities.  If you accepted that they then pushed an update down to the Sonos that  bricked these speakers.  It made them, you couldn't even use them as external speakers.  You couldn't be said, well, we don't want to see all this.  I've never liked this company.  I have never liked this company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've always been overpriced.  They've always been selling, you know, air.  Um, I know you guys liked them and all along, but I, I, and I never took you on it,  but I resisted them.  I just didn't like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now you don't need them anymore.  Cause their secret sauce, whether it was stolen or copied or reinvented has now  propagated to the rest of the world.  It was their whole thing was they were the only system cause they had a proprietary  net wireless network that you could have speakers in every room and they would all  be playing and there wouldn't be out of sync.  There wouldn't be this weird echoey thing.  It would sound like one giant house speaker system, which was awesome.  Really awesome.  And nobody had done it in wireless before, but they're saying the Sonos guys.  And by the way, I don't think it's correct me if I'm wrong, Stacy, but I don't  think they've backed down on this.  The Sonos guy said, we don't want to see all of these old speakers on the aftermarket.  People buy them expecting the modern Sonos experience and they can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I obviously have lots of feelings about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause you have lots of Sonos speakers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I spent $2,000 in the last probably two, no, not two years since 2009.  I've spent about $2,000 on Sonos equipment.  All of which is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a punter.  John, how much did we spend on Sonos equipment?  I mean, I think zero.  Oh, they gave us, okay.  Nevermind the studio speakers.  They gave to us my speakers at home.  I've bought more, almost $5,000 with Sonos speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Stacy, were you just saying that's what you were.  You just saying it's now obsolete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, yours aren't obsolete.  Okay.  Here's okay.  Let's start from the beginning.  Let's say what's happening.  That's where you like to start.  I do.  I like to start with the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like, it's like, let's, let's, shall we sing this out of music?  From the very beginning.  A very good place to start.  It is indeed.  That's why Stacy starts there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Sonos sent out an email yesterday and they said, I haven't seen the new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I, they sent out, Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You didn't get the email.  Then your stuff may not be obsolete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't, I didn't.  Well, I haven't looked.  I don't look at my email, but once every month or so.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?  I don't like email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next, he's going to give up email.  He gave up Twitter and Facebook.  Next, he's going to give up email.  Yeah.  Watch, just watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm pretty good.  Sonos on Tuesday, everybody got their email saying end of software updates.  So what is happening in is if you have a product that was introduced between 2005  and 2011, and there is a list of products and Sonos tells you which of your products  will be affected.  Those devices after May will not receive software updates and new features.  So Sonos has said though, that they're looking at a way for you to create a legacy  network where those devices will work, but they will no longer be part of a whole home  system if you have newer devices in your home.  Yes.  The other thing to think about is those legacy devices.  If like an API changes, like a Spotify API or title changes something, it won't be  updated.  So it's possible that your Sonos and likely that over time your Sonos gear from that  era will become less useful to you.  It will gracefully degrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gracefully or not so gracefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's graceful in the sense that it's not going to shut off in May.  Right.  They're not.  But over time it is going to become less useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then they offer for discount on new stock.  OK, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  And then they offer they have the options.  You have options.  Continue using legacy products.  Yeah.  Scream on Twitter.  Or that is not an option.  Trade up legacy products.  Save 30% on the new product when you upgrade through the Sonos trade up program.  Right.  Then it's subject to terms and conditions.  Some of those terms and conditions are not awesome.  But the reason why and this gets to something like I sold my Play 5, my original Play 5  studio device a month ago online.  That person's pissed.  Exactly.  And I'm really sad.  So I understand why they don't like if I were not an ethical individual, you know, and I  told my husband, I was like, don't recycle.  Don't don't do that because you're going to screw this person over.  So just sell it and make sure they understand that they're buying a first generation product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just looked at the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many things are yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Connect in the Den, the Bridge, the Bridge, the Connect living room, the Play 5 bedroom,  the Play 5 bathroom, the Play 5 kitchen, the Play 5 bedroom, the Play 5 kitchen.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  Oh, nine.  In fact, I think of all of the Sonos devices I have, only a handful will continue to work.  No, no, they're going to.  So they're going to work.  They're just not going to.  They might degrade.  See, this is the OK.  So this is the disconnect because I thought many did.  We were buying speakers.  We weren't buying speakers.  We were buying computers and like any computer, like a Chromebook after eight years, like an  Android device after three, like an iPhone after a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They go out of date.  Was it a proprietary Wi-Fi or was it?  So that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was. And that well, no, that's the only way they could do that at that time.  That was their secret sauce.  They later on, when they did the Play 5, built a whole new speaker system and chip for that,  which was really exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So those will presumably last longer, but there's still no guarantee, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, there's no guarantee.  And here's here's the issue.  Or here's one of the issues.  Speakers and audio are actually media is difficult because codecs change all the time.  So it's not like all of the other like if you release a product, how long do you want to be on the hook to support it?  And that that's a legit question.  And people think of things like speakers, thermostats, light switches as devices that should last forever.  And what we're running into is the fact that they are computers.  So what do you replace and how smart do you want this to be?  A standard will help here.  So I was talking to somebody about the idea of the connected home over IP standard that Apple, Amazon and Google said they're going to work towards something like that.  Wouldn't help exactly in this situation.  You'd need like audio standards.  But I also think like.  Is it possible for Spotify to say, hey, X percentage of our listeners listen on Sonos devices, maybe we'll keep a version of that API stable for Sonos users.  Like this gets into this idea that what we're actually building are services, not individual products, and that they're part of an ecosystem of relationships that need to be maintained over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this is something you deal with all the time in IOT.  And these are these are really just early IOT devices.  There may be among the earliest of the IOT devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So did you see Richard Lawler's piece on a gadget?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His headline is the morning after Sonos legacy plan makes smart homes look silly.  They put that on there.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because we're all good.  This is going to happen to everybody.  Right. For every.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is for years.  This is why I've been asking companies and we did this on the show today.  So if you listen to my show, you're going to hear this all over again.  So skip ahead in either show.  I don't care. Companies have been telling people that connected devices are amazing because you can add features over time.  Yes, your oven gets better.  Your Amazon Echo gets better over time.  The flip side of that is at some point in time, it will get worse.  And companies need to be mandated to tell you when these things expire.  Because right now we don't have a standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking. I bought two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you bought it two years ago.  Oh, and it's being end of life because they're saying if you bought it from a Sonos, like a legit Sonos dealer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have you see this is this is why I should be shot.  I bought way too many.  So I have four, five modern products and 11 out of life products.  I bought way too much.  Wow.  So but now I'll never buy.  I'm not going to upgrade these because it's just going to it's going to happen again.  You just killed me as a customer.  So I was dead.  I'll write this one down and I'll never buy another Sonos product again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jim Laramac went crazy on Facebook about it.  He was just so enraged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have never seen so I mean, this has happened a bunch of times.  Also in the the breaking the great breaking of yesterday,  you a Under Armour said they were going to break their Under Armour Connect devices.  It's a scale.  It's a bunch of other stuff.  And they weren't going to let people export data, which is a problem.  And then last week we had Comcast not sorry, sorry, Charter Spectrum say that they were going to kill their smart home security service,  which includes thermostats, sensors, cameras, et cetera.  And people who invested in least that equipment, they were like,  they're obviously upset because they're out thousands or a couple hundred.  How many people have taken advantage of the trade up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because yeah, it's 30% off.  It's not much on these expensive devices.  That's the problem with this stuff.  It's always been overpriced.  And by the way, some of this, like, I don't think they even make some of this stuff.  I don't know what I would know.  Some of them they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because remember, and I think we talked about this a year ago, they stopped making,  I think it was the connects.  I have a bunch of connects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have boosts and I have docs, which they stopped making also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey is so right that what there should be is an industry principle of ethics.  I've given you some kind of warranty of what you're going to get.  Note that Google just said for new Chromebooks, not all of them though,  the Chromebooks, they're going to update for eight years.  Yeah, I think it's even longer than they need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Microsoft does Windows 10 years, but there's no end of life on the hardware.  It's just on the operating system.  So you could then put Linux or even a newer version of Windows on there.  So wait a minute, seven devices ready to recycle.  Should I push this button?  No, no, no.  Because it'll brick them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think you have 38.  You're not going to operate, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, they're all in operation right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, then let them be.  Let them be.  I just want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the thing.  I want to know, well, what is it going to be replaced with and how much is that going  to cost me?  Do I have to brick it before I could find out?  Because they haven't told me yet.  I've just checked all the boxes and then it says recycle.  No, no, no, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stop.  Don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  But I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop.  Dr. Strange Love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to know what it's going to cost me to replace these.  Then stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go look online for products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what do they propose to replace the Kinects with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  That is a decent question.  What is it?  The Kinect function ties your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It basically means you can use your own speakers.  It's the Sonos part of the Sonos system minus the speakers.  So you connect it to the internet and you connect it to your speakers.  And now it's not an amp.  It's just an interface to streaming music.  But I like that I have that in my living room and I have on my stereos, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  So Kinect.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kinect.  That doesn't matter.  The point really here is if you're using...  The smart thing to do is replace this with 10 Google Home Maxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God.  No.  That is stupid.  Replace it.  I just said that so she could say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just wanted to see.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the Amazon has a speaker input thing.  So you could buy that and that's like 25 bucks a pop.  But does it work with Sonos?  Oh, you want it to still work with Sonos?  Well, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have this whole Sonos.  John, we're going to have the same problem.  These are all Sonos Play 5s.  They're all going to be out of date.  He doesn't care because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again, they'll keep operating.  They just won't update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we don't use them with Spotify.  We use them with our own music library.  So who cares, right?  Yeah.  They'll still work as speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, if you're running this against like a NAS drive or something, you're fine.  Then it's fine.  Okay.  I feel like the Sonos amp is what you would use with your speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But that's a little more than a Kinect because it includes an amplifier.  Yeah. I know it's a little more.  I think that's your option.  Yeah. Yeah, I know.  You know what?  This has honestly been brewing for a while.  Sonos had discontinued the dock, which I used with my...  I had a 30-pin dock for your iPhone.  And I had an adapter to work with lightning.  But I guess it kind of works.  And then, yeah, these Kinects, they never replaced them.  The Boost, I don't think they ever replaced the Boost.  In fact, they don't even know I have a Boost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're like, what is this weird product?  It's an unauthorized Boost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were throwing some stuff against the wall and it never really...  It slid down.  Nowadays though, correct me if I'm wrong, Stacey,  there are a number of devices that duplicate this whole house music feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yes. You can get lots of devices that do this.  This isn't hard to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of knew when I was spending thousands of dollars for what was, let's be honest,  only an okay speaker system that I was getting hoodwinked.  I knew that even then.  It just was convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was convenient and the value was...  I mean, when they created Sonos, it was really exciting because  the internet was...  I mean, this was the early days of the internet.  You got to...  I mean, this was 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I had some great parties because we could turn all the speakers...  I had two great parties.  We could turn all the speakers on.  And the whole house was rocking.  That's why I ended up getting those outdoor Sonos that they just offered,  which I have yet to use.  They just kind of sit on their charging stands because nobody ever comes over anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sonos stock is down 2.3% today, but it's still higher than it was a year ago.  Why? Considerable amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. That's only because until recently, everybody thought this over for Sonos.  Everybody.  I mean, because they don't have any secret sauce anymore.  And everybody assumed that Amazon's Echo and the Google  Assistant would kind of eliminate the need for Sonos, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's the great update that they think that they're going to make  that makes this worthwhile pissing off all their customers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, they just...  No, no, no. What's the thing that Sonos says?  They're adding Echo capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can talk to my Sonos now.  I have Google Assistant and Echo in it.  That's the new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've also expanded their product line significantly for things like the IKEA line.  They have the IKEA line of connected speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do I look like somebody who would buy IKEA speakers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they're cute. Although Kevin's... I mean, the bookshelf one is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do I look like a college kid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's Sonos speakers.  I'm just teasing. I buy a lot of stuff at IKEA.  IKEA is the reason we went to Sweden on vacation. I was so amazed with it.  Oh, IKEA is amazing. And those meatballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meatballs are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So good. Do you have... Do the speakers come in a flat pack and you have to assemble them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they just... They're already made.  Look, Google the IKEA Bookshelf speaker, Sonos speaker. They're cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it would be, though, in hindsight, a bad idea to buy any more Sonos speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in that... I mean, I don't know...  They are cute. They're little lamps.  Oh, no, those are hideous. But the lamps are... But the bookshelf one is cute.  The Symfonisk bookshelf one.  Symfonisk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They always have to give them weird Swedish names.  Swedish names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't like the lamp?  No, the lamp is hideous. What is that? No.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like how they put it next to a bunch of candles that actually have been used, which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You asked me an actual question, but I don't remember what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because we keep interrupting.  We were having IKEA fun.  We were having too much fun with IKEA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, West Elm sells Sonos gear. Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're pretty inexpensive. There's a West Elm just down in San Rafael here.  So...  So, but I'm just... What is the... What am I going to get?  A raspberry pie and some Klipsch horns and do it myself?  What is the alternative? Put it on an open hab?  Wires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. Well, first for speakers?  Wires.  Yeah. Is there...  Okay. So yeah, there's the echo input.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I could put those all over the place and those drive...  Those will drive a powered speaker system.  You could then get nice powered speakers, which will never become obsolete because  they're just speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And that's the idea. That's kind of like why I don't want a smart TV.  I like having my own coup box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Because you can upgrade that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's this for Google. Google doesn't have anything like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, the Google Hub Home Max is a really nice speaker.  It's a great speaker.  It is as good as any of my Sonos speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But aren't they already built in?  Aren't you... I'm trying to help you use your existing built-in speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I could still use... If I don't do the trade-up, I could use all of the  Sonos speakers as plain old speakers, right?  John, I'll just connect them as we're going to do here and have the source be Spotify  until that's deprecated or whatever.  And then I'll use something else.  I'll use my own music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's a company called Blue Sound that does wireless sound around your home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I suspect there will also be...  When the Pebble went out, there was a Rebel, right?  This third-party firmware that you could try to keep your Pebble watch working.  Well, and that's...  There'll be Ronos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ronos.  These are expensive, but the Blue Sound system has something called the Node2i.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, that's going to have the same problem, isn't it?  Because it's going to be some proprietary protocol that will someday be obsolete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. This you connect to an amplifier of AV receiver or any powered audio.  So this does...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And then you would replace the Node sound.  This is the Roku in your analogy, basically.  Right.  And then you use... Oh, it's $549.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is expensive. Yes.  My caveat here is these are high-quality audio products and priced as such.  I mean, when you get into that... I remember my dad buying a Rotel amplifier, I think it was.  Yeah. Oh, I had my Rotel.  God, I wanted to go to college, dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's a Rotel, honey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had a Rotel amplifier with a Proton television. That was the state of the art in 1980.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And junkyard is that it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it is really kind of foolish to say, oh, Sonos, how dare you obsolete these.  This stuff, it's electronics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it goes back to your original point, which is as these companies are whining about Google  and Facebook and Twitter, they're doing things themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. They're all just as bad.  Sonos is suing Google because they dared to compete with Sonos by creating full house sound.  For $25.  Yeah. Yeah, that's really true.  In fact, really... And maybe you can help me with this, Stacey.  At some point, I think I'm going to give up on the whole idea of, you know, chip this new alliance  and all that and just pick a winner and say, I'm going in all in on Amazon or I'm going on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you pick a winner, my suggestion to you, do you have an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. I also have an Android phone.  Do I have an iPhone?  Yes, every phone ever made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't have any phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I would say if everyone in your house is on an iPhone, pick HomeKit.  It's local.  HomeKit.  It is the easiest to use. I personally don't like it just because I have issues with Apple,  but from a user usability...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Siri is so stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that does leave you with Siri.  But you can do a lot just from your phone and you could just set the automations  and then you can have your Googles for useful things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, they're very good with the automations. The shortcuts and everything actually are better  than anybody's, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. So if you set that up, most of your stuff and a lot of your HomeKit  capable stuff can be also linked to Google.  So you could have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because I have Google Nest cameras, Google Nest doorbell.  I have Echoes everywhere, but I've kind of duplicated functionality in every room,  so there's an Echo sitting next to Google.  In some cases, next to Cortana.  In some cases, next to a home. My kitchen has all four in the kitchen.  What's your electric bill in a month?  Oh, you don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I should plug my Insight switch in and see how they don't...  I don't think they use that much electricity.  But this is... Well, I don't know about the else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like this is all inevitable. And I understand  Jim Louterback's anger. I'm a little miffed because we all spent a lot of money on Sonos,  but really we were the suckers even then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I said. I never bought them.  You're right.  I didn't say anything to you guys. I had to make fun of you, but I always thought this  is over for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm being honest when I said we only use the whole house sound  right very rarely, once in a while. And in that case, we're listening in a single room  when anything would work fine in a single room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's possible that this is their attempt. So Sonos is having trouble competing against  Amazon and Google. And it's possible they need to rally the troops, condense their resources,  bring all their resources in-house to focus on some sort of strategic differentiation,  at which point they looked at supporting all of this and said, hey, that's going to cost us  X dollars a year that we just don't have. So we're willing to take this hit now, jettison  the legacy stuff that we don't have the means to support and then push forward with something else.  They just might be between a rock and a hard place. And again, when we say obsolete them,  it's really clear. I mean, it's important to say, and that's why I would like for you to  keep yours going, Leo, is we don't know how it's going to fail and how long it will take.  It may not take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why throw it out if it works? It still works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it may just be a feature you don't care about.  I don't use Spotify.  Any feature you're likely to care about, Amazon's going to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that may be when you want to upgrade and you may like the next Sonos that they're like deciding  to like focus on and build may be so amazing that you're like, holy crap, I'm back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlikely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think you're going to have, we're going to see this debate play out  a hundred times in the next few years as consumers run into these walls.  Phillips Hue has already told people that they are not going to support their hubs beyond three  years after purchase. So a lot of the smart home companies are coming out and saying, OK,  this is how long you can expect us to support this. And I think that's a mature,  like that's a maturation thing. And we all need to figure this out both as the buyers of this stuff  and as the salespeople.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Feels like it's just another nail in the coffin of home automation and IOT.  Like I think consumers are kind of aware now. Oh, I mean, this is  Microsoft pissed everybody off because they said, yeah, we're not going to update Windows  7 anymore. And people went, but, but, and I hear people complaining about eight years on Chromebooks.  I hear people complaining about three years on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Complain about eight years on a Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the expectation. We're changing our expectations right now about  and where we should stick smarts and computers in our products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's why it's offensive in general and offensive to me is the physical hardware is fine.  It's not worn out. The speakers work, the Chromebooks work, the phones work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's, it's economically, it's ecologically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an ecologic nightmare. They're all going to landfill, even though  see a car wears out, a refrigerator wears out. These things are not worn out. They're pristine.  In most cases, they have not in any way gotten worse. In fact, you could probably argue the  speakers actually sound better. What's worn out is the software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, they're arguing, and I don't know how true this is because I'm not seeing their  update sizes, but they're arguing that there's not enough processing power in memory to do some of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the new features. So that's the same argument with why, why they, why Microsoft doesn't support  Windows 7 is that times have moved on. And so we need to move on. We need, we're not going to  support the old stuff because we want to do new stuff. And that's the, that's the, that's technology.  I just think that consumers, yeah, it may be that our primary of reference is, is old school. Oh,  it's hardware. It shouldn't wear out when it should be, oh, it's software. Of course it wears out,  but it's somehow offensive. I think to a lot of people, certainly me.  Oh, it's totally offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's perfectly good hardware.  And that's why I think manufacturers have a huge role to play in changing the conversation and  talking about expiration dates for these devices. Cause otherwise people buy it thinking they're  buying hardware because people, I mean, we're smart, but we don't want to think, I mean,  when you buy something like this, when you buy a speaker, you don't want to think about all of  this. You don't want to think about privacy and two factor in, you know, how long it's going to last  and when's my next software update. You want it to work. And that this is a huge branding challenge  for the smart home and all the companies building these products. And the challenge also is if  Sonos comes out and says, Hey, we're going to support our speakers. If you buy this today,  this has a 10 year useful life. Let's call it. I'm going to look at that. And then I'm going to look  at like the blues, the blue speakers, whatever the blue sound stuff. And if they don't have that same  information, I'm probably going to buy the blue sound because I'm like, well, they're not going  to stop supporting in 10 years when maybe they only have a five year term, but they, they bury  it in terms and conditions. Plus the company can just die. Yeah. I don't think Sonos even knew  that this would happen. No, this was not. Well, I think they knew that people were going to be  unhappy about this. I don't think going in when they decided to start it. They couldn't say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is only, I'm only going to support for 10 years. They didn't say that. Right. And they  didn't, but they could have designed differently. They could have designed more modularly, you know,  modular. You're right. And that's kind of what you're talking about. Keep the speaker plug in  this, you know, more memory smart TV, because you can, it's cheap to upgrade a Roku while the  screen's still good. It's because we still have this durable goods mentality that there's some  things like a television and a computer are durable goods. Like a refrigerator are durable  goods. Those things should last. Software is not a durable good. So make it modular. You know,  though, I bought a Samsung OLED TV. It was $10,000 when the OLEDs first came out. It had  no electronics inside. It had a box that attached to it. That was in theory upgradeable, but of  course they never updated it. They never upgraded it. There is no replacement because by the time  they were going to do that, well, there's better OLEDs now. So much cheaper, cheaper than that box

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  would have cost you. Yes. I actually wrote about this in the newsletter last week. There's a story  about it's actually chips that are upgradeable inside. It's basically creating silicon that you  can upgrade. You can turn on more memory or turn on more processing power. I saw that at CES and  it was pretty compelling for things like exactly the Sonos issue, right? But ironically, John  McFarlane, who is the former, he's one of the founders of Sonos, former CEO there. He tweeted  at me, he's like, this is just an effort by Qualcomm to charge people more. And I hate it.  Which I thought was, I mean, it's, it is a point. This will be, this kind of flexibility is going

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to be more expensive. You'll pay for the upgrade, right? You'll send them money and they'll turn on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  more features. Right. And this is, this is a common model. I mean, remember when we had this whole  like core debate for software and you were like, oh, now I'm going to put my software on more seats  or I'm going to, I need more cores. You know, I want to put it on more cores. Look no farther

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  than your Tesla. Elon does that all the time. Right. Except Elon's smart. He gets the money  upfront. There you go. He's charged a lot of people $5,000 on the promise that you'll be able  to upgrade it autopilot. When, I don't know, maybe you will. I don't know. Did you, you didn't buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that when you bought your model? No, because my Model S was not capable of being upgraded to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but when you buy, that's the thing. You have to buy it when it's new. If I were to have bought  a Model 3, for instance, I would have had to make that decision. Do I pay an extra $5,000  for what Elon said would full self-driving? Oh yeah. We'll have full self-driving in a couple  of years, but you, but it'll cost you a lot more if you get it then you have to get it now.  Have you traded in your Tesla yet? Oh yeah. It's gone.  What is? Yeah. What are you driving now? I only leased it. It was a three-year lease.  Oh, three-year. Okay. And that's, you know, at least it insists she won't let me buy a car  because of the, for tax reasons and business reasons. And honestly, she was right about  any, any electric- Oh yeah. For a Tesla?  For a Tesla, because there's so much improvement down the road and so forth. So,  so yeah, I'm driving a gas vehicle, but at the end of the year, I've mentioned this,  at the end of the year, Ford is coming out with its first real electric vehicle. They call it a  Mustang, the Mach-E. It's a crossover. It's got every feature I want. So I've already put the  deposit down on that. I think that- What's the, what's the likely price on that?  59,000 for the one I'm getting, which is first edition. It'll go, you can get it for less. I  think, I think this starts at 39,000. I saw the vault. What's the Volvo new brand?  That's nice too. Yeah. They have a funny name. Polar is that? No.  No. What is it? Polestar. Polestar. It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I like Volvo's. I don't know. I could live in a Volvo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could live in a Volvo. I could literally live in a Volvo. And honestly, when you're in podcasting,  it's probably prudent to buy a car you can live in. Unless, unless you get bought by the New York  Times. What did they just buy? Don't tell me I'm going to cry. Well, they're looking to buy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're looking to buy the makers of cereal. Kellogg's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought Gimlet produced cereal. That's what I thought. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't Spotify buy cereal? No, Spotify. No, it's not by Sarah Koenig. And-  Oh yeah. I wonder what the tax is going to pay. I wonder too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spotify is rumored to be buying Ringer. So that's Bill Simmons Sports Com Culture Network.  It's gross. Its revenues are not that much more than ours. They're very similar. Same size company.  I bet you they get sold for $100 million. I'm just going to ride.  This- Everybody-  Twitter is like Sonos. Twitter is like Sonos. I'm going to ride it down to the ground and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we'll recycle. Sorry people, stop listening now. We're going to be obsolete soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we will work with your ears forever.  Yeah, it's really an interesting shakeup in the- But didn't Jeff, this happened in blogging as  well where there were a lot of independent blogs and then they just kind of all got-  A little bit. Then there were plenty more.  But you don't see that same kind of fertility in the blog space these days.  No, no, not at all. I was going to let it go. I was going to let it go.  I'm like, you know? A thousand flowers blooming in the early days of bloggery,  which was what? 95 to 2005, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So US podcast advertising revenue was about 678 million last year, according to eMarketer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say that that's a complete guess. No one knows.  Yes, no one knows. No.  We made last year almost 9 million in revenue.  Wow.  According to- Yeah, I know. I don't know where it went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To Sonos, that's where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I bought a lot of Sonos here last year. Actually, that's off from our peak,  which is almost 10 million. But Ringer was 16 million, they say anyway.  And I bet you, Gimlet, I think the reason Gimlet got sold for 230 million  is because they had no revenue. You get much- Because what happens, companies do a multiple  of EBITDA. And if you have EBITDA, then there's a multiple. If EBITDA is zero-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  EBITDA is earnings before income and taxes.  Yeah. It's what you make your profit.  Income depreciation taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so it's maybe, I don't know what, five to 10 times EBITDA. But if your EBITDA is zero,  if you're losing money, like Uber, like everybody in Silicon Valley, then the sky's the limit.  You're literally worth more if you're losing money than if you're making money.  Well, it's for many years on the case of Amazon.  Yeah, if growing, we lose money, but we make it up in volume.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those losses just get bigger and bigger over time.  Yeah, we lose more money.  Every person we add, we lose more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Buy more Sonos. It'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a very strange world we live in.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's based on, and these are serious questions we should be having, right?  It's based on the current internet business model, Google's business model, eyeballs.  So if you think about that, as opposed to like a product-oriented one or a subscription-oriented  one, and what's happening is we're coming to this era where we're like, holy crap,  there's so many crazy business models, and we're just now uncovering how they're  working and the repercussions on us when historically we've pretty much, if you see  something you like, you buy it.  You take it home with you and you own it.  And maybe you rent something, but now we've got software as a service, so maybe you rent  something as needed. Maybe you rent it one time.  Maybe it's a constant. Maybe you're buying a product and you're also sharing data because  you're not buying the product at full price.  I mean, it's crazy and we just, we don't know yet.  We haven't really lived that for long enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's true. It is early days, damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  I love it though. I mean, that's for me.  This is our bread and butter.  We love the uncertainty because it's fun to talk about it.  For instance, who knew that New Jersey had a Twitter account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a brilliant one it is.  Yo.  Yo.  It is a brilliant Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For instance, somebody tweeted, who let New Jersey have a Twitter?  It's at, by the way, if you want to follow them, it's at njgov.gov.  Who let New Jersey have a Twitter?  A guy named Gary wondered.  Your mom replied the state of New Jersey.  By the way, that tweet, half a million likes.  So they're clearly, they're clearly speaking the speak, the talk.  Oh, and they're verified.  They're verified. Of course they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. As to whether or not there is such a thing as central Jersey,  which I believe we are, I'm in it.  There's a huge fight about this.  No, no, no, this is north and south. This is central.  And so there's a constant fight on here.  They have a video of Bon Jovi confirming that there is a central Germany, Jersey.  By the way, our official state dog now is the scene.  Hi, dog.  Is that really true?  Yeah, because Morristown is the headquarters of the CNI.  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have guide dogs who are trained here in San Rafael, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so great. You go, you watch these dogs,  you don't have to talk to them, but the dogs are being walked all over,  being trained all the time. They're wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the state of New Jersey clearly is doing this right.  I mean, this has got to be the only state that has baby Yoda as its avatar.  The official Twitter of the Garden State, all Jersey, all the time.  You have to have dark mode. Jesus.  You don't let your dark mode.  What's wrong with dark mode? This hurts my eyes.  The white mode really bothers me to let New Jersey have a Twitter.  New Jersey becomes the first state.  Every female rapper ever heard from New Jersey got bars.  I don't know what this is.  There it is. John Bon Jovi confirming the existence of central Jersey.  Let me turn on the audio so we can hear.  Hey, John, does central Jersey exist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. I'm proof that it exists.  We are central Jersey.  That's our new sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the gang sign.  That's my gang sign for central Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are central Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the C for central.  Other, another, another just random tweet from NJGov.  Take the next jug handle.  I don't get it. Is that a Jersey thing?  You don't even know what that is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, what's a jug handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New Jersey. Well, New Jersey had two things that were unique or  special to New Jersey in traffic.  One was we had the circle,  but we were smart enough to get the hell rid of it.  And Boston still has those stupid things.  And then the other one is the jug handle.  You never take a left turn in New Jersey.  You always go around.  A Jersey jug handle.  A Jersey jug handle.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my.  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.  Wait, are circles like rotaries?  Take the next jug handle, it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?  Are circles rotaries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Circles are rotaries.  We think they're dumb.  We used to have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, rotaries are quite effective.  Oh, they're brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, people get killed in rotaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Oh, in New Jersey they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You drive like you do in Jersey.  Yeah, you shouldn't have a, yeah.  You shouldn't kill the rotary.  We, we just started putting them in.  I think they're great.  They're also less expensive to build.  You don't have to put it in streetlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that, isn't there's a word for the left, not having a left turn.  It's like a, it says like a Massachusetts left or a something left.  What am I talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hudson County, New Jersey, they have a different constitution.  It says the people turning left have a right of way over all forms of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, well done, New Jersey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got a whole article in the New Yorker about it.  So I guess they must have done something.  A little late, but that's fine.  Yeah. Oh, really?  So I'm just catching up now.  Yeah, I put it, I put it in that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's not in the New Yorker, I can't be expected to know about it.  Okay.  How am I to know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You young people, Google has just released a high-res brain map of the fruit fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The most high-res brain map ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like it's Skittles.  It looks like the fruit flight, the rainbow,  25,000 neurons, which sounds like a lot, but it ain't.  Nope.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought we already mapped the neurons of a rat and a dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To date, only the roundworm C. elegans has had its brain completely mapped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder what Dermidro was mapping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bit, a little bit of a dog brain.  Rat brain.  The connectome is actually a word you should get to know  because, and this is from Neal Stephenson's last novel, The Fall,  they talk about the whole issue of putting your brain in a machine and all of this.  What they finally, in the book, conclude is you don't duplicate the brain.  You merely map its connectome.  That is the connections that are stored with it.  Is that a made-up word?  No.  Or is that a real word?  No, that's the word they use now.  So mapping the connectome, in fact, it's called connectome.  Connectome.  Connectomics.  Connectonomics.  Connectomics.  So that's the internet.  Connectomics.  That's the internet.  We're showing you a Wikipedia page.  But in fact, even the Verge calls it connectome.  I'm not saying the connectome is the model of internet.  It uses detailed imaging techniques to map the physical pathways of the brain.  This map is only one third of the fruit fly's brain, so only C. elegans,  which has apparently even less cognitive ability than a fruit fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, roundworms, very dumb.  Dumb.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  When we dissected roundworms in science, you had to be careful not to hit the brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Drosophila hemibrain.  25,000 neurons, 4,000 distinct types.  Here are examples of the type grouped by functional compartment.  I love neuro talk.  Central complex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So are we going to call the connectome that is replacing the whole concept of neuromorphic  computing, which used to be such an exciting thing?  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you can simulate the connectome.  You cannot simulate a brain.  It's very hard to simulate a brain because of the way, the massively parallel nature of it.  But you could simulate the connectome.  And so it's conceivable that you could store a connectome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.  This kind of gets into my whole like, do not ask me why I was thinking about this.  But I was like, you know, we're really going in space exploration down the wrong track  with mechanical survivability of people in space.  We're going to have to do some crazy gene editing to make ourselves more adaptable to space.  Why were you thinking of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Daniel Suarez.  You know, I don't know.  Daniel Suarez talks about this in his most recent book.  We had him on Delta V. We had him on triangulation a few months ago.  He said the whole notion of going to Mars is holding on musklets colonized Mars  is insanely difficult.  For instance, Mars is covered with dust so fine that if you inhale it, you're dead instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see the Scientific American article about radiation on Mars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, another reason one wouldn't want to move there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like you would never want to live there.  You would die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The prospect of making Mars habitable is almost insurmountable.  So this is a whole, you know, MacGuffin, you know, Greta is right.  Let's fix this planet.  This whole escape plan is not going to really be viable for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could we still send some politicians up there anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good idea.  You know what?  That's how you save the planet.  Yeah, move them to them.  That's what they did in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  They created, they said all the planets over.  Oh my God, we've built a giant space transport.  We're going to send you to another planet.  But they, so they sent all the telephone sanitizers, all those useless people,  hairdressers, put them in it and sent them off.  And they went, oh yeah, we're going to the new world.  And then we stayed.  Shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they died of an infected telephone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  Oh, nice quote.  Good.  That's right.  God, Douglas Adams is missed.  Speaking of somebody missed, Terry Jones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Terry Jones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to be sad having to tell my daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As John Cleese tweeted now, there are only four pythons left.  Graham Chapman passed away in 85 at a very young age.  And then now Terry Jones at 77.  He had been diagnosed with dementia a few years ago.  Oh no.  Passed away at the age of 77.  The great Monty Python.  And if I showed you a picture, in fact I will, of the young Terry Jones,  you'll recognize him immediately if you're a Python fan.  And he was the director of?  Life of Brian.  Thank you, Life of Brian.  Life of Brian.  He was, he was Welsh.  There's an older picture.  Let me see if I can find a younger.  Oh yeah, here he is.  No one expects the Spanish Inquisition.  That's actually another old picture because that's a recreation.  But yeah, what a wonderful, funny.  I was like, that's not him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The New York Times on their obit has a picture of him where you can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me go back here.  He has the BBC.  Oh, they probably have something.  Yes.  And look back at the comedian's life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There he is.  That's Terry Jones right there.  So very sad to lose one of the great comic minds of our time.  And kids, have you turned your daughter on to Monty Python?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yes.  Yes.  We were doing the Ministry of Silly Walks when she was like, oh.  Oh, I love it.  Oh, and her favorite sketch is the hit on the head.  I can't think of the actual skit, but.  Argument Clinic.  Any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Argument Clinic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, the Argument Clinic.  So any time anything hits her in the head, she goes, ow.  And then she goes, wah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good for.  Oh, you are raising that kid right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We had fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watch sometime the 1985.  Paul Therod turned me on to this earlier today.  Eulogy that John Cleese delivered for Graham Chapman.  It is marvelous.  It is very funny.  Terry Jones was, of course, the very, very fat man in the meaning of life who explodes  That is a disgusting picture.  Here he is on the right in Life of Brian.  What a talent there is as a gesture in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  So he was also, this character was called, the fat character was called Mr. Creosote.  Let's get that right.  And what did he have?  He wanted one more little.  A wafer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a mint.  Wafer thin mint.  Would you like a mint, sir?  It is wafer thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wafer thin.  God, you got to go back and watch all of those.  That was good TV.  I was watching, I am watching, I bought a, God, I bought a lot of them too.  A bunch of DVDs of the Dick Cavett show.  You won't know who that is, Stacey.  No.  But Mr. Jarvis will remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I certainly do.  It was that defined erudite in our generation.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At the end of all the shows, it says Mr. Cavett's wardrobe provided by J. Press of New Haven.  But it is fun to watch because he interviewed everybody, of course, in the 60s and 70s.  And I was watching his interview with George Harrison.  And this is probably six, I don't know what it was.  No, it was 72, something like that.  And Harrison says, have you seen Monty Python?  It is hysterical and nobody in America had heard of it yet.  I think George Harrison was instrumental actually in bringing Monty Python to a broader audience.  He produced, I think, I remember he produced some of their movies.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Time Bandits, maybe.  I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, Dick Cavett interviewed Howard Stern and was befuddled by him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I bet he was.  My entire career is modeled on Dick Cavett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Have we talked about Google much at all?  Yeah.  Oh, so much.  Okay.  No, I'm just checking.  I'm like, wait a second.  Wake up, Stacey.  Wake up, Stacey.  You just had the fruit fly brain.  We've done like an hour of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just did the fruit fly brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was-  People being pissed at them.  Oh, that was Google.  And the trillion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Yes.  I feel better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did we mention last week that Google is killing third party cookies over the next few years?  Yes, we did.  Yeah, we did.  But we didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a thing I put up on the run now.  The one thing I wanted to mention is-  Kind of a follow-up.  How much is this going to hurt publishers?  Is this a wonderful for Privacy Act or is this a form of industry capture?  That's the latter.  Absolutely.  Yeah, Google wins and little guys lose.  Now, I've been screaming at my industry, screaming at them for years to no end.  Nobody listens to me.  That's because you're a crank.  Well, the need not to go list.  But screaming that they had to develop their own first party data.  They had to build products that would enable that because you build products that were  targeted to interests and needs.  That's right.  That you could use that across your services and then you could build commerce around that  and so on and so forth.  And they don't do it because they still will only think in terms of a mass product.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the New York Times is doing an okay job with like the Wirecutter and-  Yeah, the New York Times is the brand essentially everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just announced almost-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every other newspaper thinks they can be the New York Times and they-  Sorry, guys, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More than 800 million dollars in subscription revenue last year, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, no.  And the Washington Post is doing well, but they are national publications.  Right.  They are.  Look at the LA Times was trying to go from 150,000 to 300,000 subs.  They got 50,000 but lost 35,000 and netted only 15.  Right.  So that's where that and the LA Times is like the next biggest paper in the country in terms  of market.  Nobody else in the New York Times.  Nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Local is the victim of the internet because you have to have scale.  It shouldn't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's the opposite, I think, Leo.  I think the problem is they're still trying to get scale at a local market.  They should have been local and targeted.  Super serve.  Yeah, they should have been super serving.  So-  And that was their opportunity and they missed it because they still thought that they were  the monopoly in the market at scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Case in point, and this is a little bit inside baseball, but bear with me.  I do my radio show for the largest radio company in the United States.  I heart radio.  I heart media now.  They're syndicated.  Syndication Arm is premier.  That's who does my radio show.  They have been over the last week laying off dozens of local small radio hosts and  program directors.  The list is staggering.  These people were all laid off in the last few days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they going to go with just vanilla national programming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my guess.  It's not clear.  I heart has really not really addressed this.  What a list.  This is a list from radioinsight.com.  It's being updated continuously.  Dallas, Dayton, Defu-  Well, I'll give you Austin's in here and you, Stacey, probably know your local host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet Stacey hasn't listened to broadcast radio in 20 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So every market has had one, two, three, sometimes more than layoffs.  Your first inclination is, well, I blame I heart media.  Maybe you would, Jeff, but I would say this is the internet killing radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's also radio kill radio.  Radio was crap.  If you go to Europe, radio is still popular and love it because they have decent programming.  Part of that's because they have government subsidized media as well.  Since the day Howard Stern left Terrestrial, I haven't listened to Terrestrial.  Well, and you're not alone.  That's why I listen to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This has been good for podcasting.  People don't-  Very.  Used to be you'd turn on the radio in the car, you'd push one of those five buttons,  you'd listen to that station.  Now it's on.  This is what you listen to in the car for most people.  I take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to listen to radio for one other reason.  I had to listen to the absolutely billyus NJ-1015 because they are the only ones who had traffic.  Traffic on radio is the stupidest thing ever invented.  You have millions of miles of roads.  I know.  And all you get to hear is-  30 seconds is going to tell you what happens in a few of them.  It is just an awful, awful thing.  And when Waze came along, it saved me from those bozos and made me really happy.  Yeah, it's the internet, but it's the internet writ large.  Well, I think the same thing is happening to small town newspapers that's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to small town radio stations.  The problem is we lose who's going to cover the city councils,  who's going to give you the local story.  There is something amazing going on in every small community,  and small town radio and small town newspapers covered it.  But what is the problem, Jeff?  We invent.  We invent journalism.  Can podcasts say this?  Should podcasters go out and should there be a Petaluma podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a tough business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I figure all the retailers who bought ads on the local radio stations-  They're dying.  They're dying too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're dying, number one.  And number two, if they're not dying, they can advertise on  TripAdvisor and Google and so on and get a better deal.  And so the business, I heard from a local blogger, I think is a really good guy.  He's a little cranky, but that's what makes him survive.  And I thought, okay, he's an example I've been giving for some time of somebody who's doing  a good job.  I'm not going to say who he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We still have Petaluma Patch.  He's not doing that well.  Is Patch-  And Patch is what it was.  Yeah.  It seems there should be a model, but I don't know what the model is.  Maybe there is no revenue in that hyperlocal.  You always use that word hyperlocal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love hyperlocal.  I wrote a whole thing and I was completely wrong about it thinking that hyperlocal blogs  were going to save us as a building block.  I was utterly completely wrong because the work is too hard.  And Programmatic came in and took away a lot of that advertising where even  Aunt Emma's Jam can sell on Programmatic and Google better than they can in a local  publication.  Local retail is dying rapidly and there wasn't the market for it.  So we have to rethink around community-based things and service-based things  and knowledge people.  And so-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it hits me because in 1976 in college, I fell in love with radio  and all I ever wanted to do was radio.  I dropped out of school to do radio.  And if not for the grace of podcasting, there go I, a thousand local small town radio hosts.  I probably would have been one of them out of work.  And it's not like you can go to the other station across the street.  Those jobs are disappearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the people who made fun of me for being internet back in newspapers,  I became the assistant managing editor of the Duluth Daily Disgrace.  And Jarvis, where are you working on People Magazine, you slime.  And now they're all unemployed.  And I don't say that with any glee, but they all kind of said, oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I mean, I don't want to portion blame.  It might just be this is economics.  They may be the buggy whip makers of the 21st century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so I just was writing the part of this part of it.  So when Gutenberg, oh, when, when so Gutenberg and and Foost and Schaeffer  were the two first printers, the printing shops in the world,  together they did the Bible, they split up into separate shops.  And then there was a war in their city of Mines.  And they all got banished for about two years.  And that's what spread printing around the world.  Because the printer, there are people who work in the print shops,  said, well, they'll work here.  So they took their matrices and their knowledge and they went elsewhere.  Right.  And they grew it.  But at the same time, the new Archbishop of Mines said,  I want to have printing because I see how powerful this is.  Before the war came, there were pamphlets.  One of the first things printed on these presses were pamphlets,  news pamphlets, polemics from both sides in the war.  And so propaganda was one of the first things printed ever.  And so one of the winners said, I want that discontinued.  So he got a he got a monastery to get its own presses and print stuff.  Right.  Because I'm going to support this.  And it didn't work as a business.  It just didn't work.  Right.  So government support didn't work.  We've tried to find these models through time.  It took a long time.  1605, the first weekly newspaper, the first regular newspaper ever published in Alsace.  He wanted a monopoly, didn't get it.  Thought it'd be a great business.  Turned out to be a crappy business.  And it takes time to reinvent these models and figure it out.  It's going to take a long time to rebuild from the ashes.  Sorry.  End of Gutenberg spiel.  You can put your glasses down now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I and then, of course, later Jefferson Starship did that great song City of Mines.  All about this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a reference.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never forget it.  What about this Jeff Bezos story?  What do you think about this?  Jeff Bezos today tweeting a picture of him at the memorial for Jamal Khashoggi,  the Washington Post journalist who was, I think, killed by Saudis in the Turkish embassy.  And then, of course, the latest, and I don't, I mean, it's wild, is that apparently Bezos,  we were wondering where, remember the National Enquirer tried to blackmail Bezos, said,  we have pictures of you and we'll publish them unless you lay off the president or something.  I can't remember what the quid pro quo was.  Not that that ever happens.  But Bezos, of course, then went to Medium and said, well, okay, fine, let's get on with it.  The question was, where did those pictures and the texts about him and Lauren Sanchez, his girlfriend?  Somebody presumed that his phone got stolen for a while.  And then for a while everybody seemed to think it was Lauren Sanchez's estranged brother.  Brother, right.  This is the news story and it's a shocker.  Apparently Bezos was in a WhatsApp conversation with MBS, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  And at some point in the conversation, bin Salman sent him a file which hacked his phone within  minutes all of the data on his phone is exfiltrated, including, I presume, those pictures.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So didn't Bezos, didn't his security officer actually talk about Saudi being the source of the hack  around that time and everyone made fun of him?  You're right.  And what's the thing I took away from all of this, including the tweeting of the picture,  Jeff has turned into a master social media user, just excellent.  Or his team is using this very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's almost as good as New Jersey.  Well, that tweet, and let me go back to the Axios story of this tweet,  it has just one word, hashtag Jamal.  It is very somber.  It's a beautiful tweet.  And talk about subtweeting.  That's all you have to do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One word, hashtag Jamal.  And wow, the UN is now calling for an investigation.  That lends it some credence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And MBS met with a lot of people.  He met with Bush, he met with Mark Zuckerberg, he met with lots of people.  Well, he's invested lots of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Saudi sovereign fund is one of the primary venture capitalists in Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I imagine everybody's looking at their WhatsApp chats and replacing their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it's like everybody's also pretending they don't know MBS.  And it's like Jeffrey Epstein all of a sudden.  I don't know.  Who's that?  Never heard of him.  Never hung out with that dude?  Never hung out with that dude.  What plane?  It's just, I mean, I just want everybody to know I did not take any money from Saudi Arabia.  Okay.  I'd take it if they sent it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I have somebody I know in a business who  lots of not that long ago took money from Saudi sovereign fund.  I think that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Five years ago, I think if you did it today, it would be like, come on guy.  And you can't but you can't send that money back.  You spent it.  Right.  Right.  The UN report details a forensic investigation into longstanding allegations by Bezos that he  was a victim of a cyber attack by the Saudi regime as part of a complex series of conflicts  among Bezos, the Saudis, President Trump and the National Enquirer.  It is one of those.  It is what has become a politics in Washington under Trump.  It's a transaction.  You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.  And by the way, MBS doesn't need the money.  But he was doing favors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So one lesson here is never give your actual phone number to somebody who has a government  intelligence agency behind them.  Number two, people are talking about the encryption of WhatsApp.  That's utterly irrelevant here.  He said a an MP4 file, supposedly, and didn't matter how it got sent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once you open it, your WhatsApp is encrypted in transit, but it's not encrypted in your phone.  So if your phone is hacked, it's all there.  And incidentally, if you back up WhatsApp with on an iPhone with iCloud, it's also in the cloud.  We should really emphasize, I keep saying it, but I just want everybody to know  iCloud is not encrypted.  Apple has the keys to it.  And in this Pensacola case, in the San Bernardino case, the FBI screwed it up.  But in the Pensacola case, Apple sent a lot of iCloud data to the FBI.  We talked about this on Tuesday with Renee Richie.  The impression most people have is that your iPhone is encrypted and your data on the cloud  is encrypted.  Your iPhone is encrypted.  But if you back up your iPhone to the cloud, which everybody does, that's not encrypted.  But not the case with Android, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you back it up to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, OK, yes, let's talk about that story because I'm it's a little unclear.  I would not assume anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to hear you explain it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Android.  Explain this.  So Google offers end-to-end encryption for Android backups.  So there was a story that Apple wanted to do end-to-end encryption on its backups.  And the FBI said, please don't.  There's some lack of credibility, by the way, in that story.  It's probable that the six sources that writers quoted in this story, at least five of the six  were FBI employees.  One of them was a former Apple employee.  Renee Richie said, I remember those times.  So did John Gruber.  Apple made the decision not at the behest of the FBI, but just because if you did offer  encrypted backup and people lost their password, you wouldn't be able to help them.  And so while Google has decided, OK, well, we just tell people, hey, you lose your key,  you lose your password, you're out of luck.  Apple was unwilling to do that.  So apparently, Google does do that.  Apple did not switch.  I still would not assume that anything that you're exfiltrating or backing up to the cloud  is private, just in case you want to know.  Apple's rules are very arcane.  And Apple really kind of, I think, fosters a misimpression that they encrypt everything.  According to Android Central, back in 2018, Google quietly enabled end-to-end encryption  for Android backups with a Titan security chip housed in Google's data center, ensuring  data integrity.  This is starting with Android Pie.  I'm not sure what you have to do to make sure your PIN or passcode is a decryption key for

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  the Titan module.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Without it, you won't be able to access your data.  But it only works for, this is important, and this is the problem I have with Apple, too.  It's not immediately clear what's encrypted and what's not.  The backup, Google backup, is only for application backups.  So your WhatsApp would be secure, but not anything you store in Google Drive.  That, as always, is unencrypted, is available to you.  So you can't just go to Google Drive and say, OK, I'm going to use this.  Unencrypted is available to law enforcement.  If you want to secure data in your drive, you need to encrypt it before you send it up  to Google Drive.  So that's why it's confusing, right?  And Apple does offer, by the way, fully encrypted backups.  You just have to do it to hardware.  You have to connect your iPhone via cable to a Mac or a PC with iTunes and say, I want  an encrypted backup, provide a password.  That is fully encrypted.  Apple doesn't have access to that.  But if you use iCloud to backup WhatsApp, and we know this because Paul Manafort got  bit by it, Apple has unencrypted versions of the WhatsApp messages.  So WhatsApp is not as secure as one might imagine.  Use Signal and turn off iCloud backup.  And don't ever click on a link from a Saudi prince.  And especially if you're talking to MBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do not.  You know, I would throw in, you know, a Russian oligarch.  Yeah, there are lots of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chinese, Turkish, Hungarian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Perhaps US, depending on your political orientation.  Yeah, could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm in a WhatsApp right now with President Trump.  Should I get out of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm in one with Don Jr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The funny thing is OpsSec, with anybody in the White House, there is no OpsSec.  There's no OpsSec.  There's no OpsSec.  They're not there.  You know, they don't care.  But maybe they should.  Maybe they shouldn't.  Maybe it doesn't matter.  Maybe there's maybe they're untouchable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Y'all are depressing the heck out of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you stay up till like one in the morning last night?  No.  It was a little boring.  I cried.  A little boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Schiff is very good at presenting.  His talk today was very well done.  But what can engage you for 12 hours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've watched billions for 12 hours.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that that's I want to say that's kind of intentional because  I don't think I think there aren't a lot of people who would prefer that you do not watch.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think I mean, I'll be honest.  I don't think that many people are watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the Senate controls where the cameras are, how they're pointed.  I think they're intentionally pointing them in.  They're making this doll.  I know a little bit about this.  You want to get some shots of the chamber of senators sleeping.  They're all walking around sleeping.  Yeah.  You don't just lock the one camera down on the person reading and just leave it there.  I mean, this isn't C-SPAN for crying out loud.  Oh, it is.  Supreme Court has declined to hear a Facebook face recognition case.  Is this the Illinois one?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or the Indiana one?  It's Facebook versus Patel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It hinges on the question over whether Facebook violated Illinois law when it implemented a  photo tagging feature that recognized users faces.  I'm reading from the Hill and suggested their names without any evidence.  And suggested their names without getting adequate consent from the user.  High Court rejected Facebook's bid to review the case.  So Facebook will now be facing a multi-billion dollar class action lawsuit in Illinois.  In other words, the Supreme Court, by declining to review it,  did let it go forward.  So that's bad for Facebook, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  They'll either have to settle or take a judgment.  Or it's a state case.  It's an attorney general, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  The Ninth Circuit Court ruled last year that Facebook had to face the lawsuit.  Facebook appealed and the Supreme Court said, no, we're not going to overturn that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is a state law, I mean to say.  Yeah, I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not seeing why, what reasons the Supreme Court passed on this.  Facebook said the class action case should not be allowed to proceed  because the group of users have not proven the alleged privacy violation resulted in  real world harm.  There's a doctrine.  There has to be some harm or you can't sue.  You can't sue just because you don't like it.  There has to be some harm.  The Supreme Court rejected that argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now harm is going to be, it's like the UK harms report.  It's going to become feelings, nothing more than feelings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a privacy intrusion.  I don't know.  This is why I just prefer to stay off Facebook.  I understand.  I know that's podcaster privilege.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just need to have cards that Kevin can play.  I quit Facebook.  Mine says moral panic.  Stacey says, oh, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then punches me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, don't I get something at least decent other than oh, Jeff?  Pick something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have your others which you star.  You see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about this?  This is a story from the San Francisco Chronicle.  Let me see if I can summarize this case.  The FBI in August of 2018 raided Omar Amin's Sacramento apartment,  alleging that he was in fact an ISIL member and had hid his ties to the group  when he fled Iraq and came to America.  They want to deport him.  In fact, he could now become the first person in US history ever to be extradited to Iraq.  However, his attorneys say that there is evidence in his social media that he was 600 miles away  from the murder that he's accused of in Iraq.  Additionally, an Islamic State Twitter account that the company suspended  as well as a suspended Facebook account could be instrumental in proving his innocence.  Neither Facebook nor Twitter will cooperate.  The San Francisco Superior Court Judge last year issued a scathing critique of those  companies' policies, finding Twitter and Facebook in quote,  inexcusable contempt for refusing his order to release evidence in a murder case.  Judge Charles Crompton wrote, Facebook and Twitter appear to be misusing their immense  resources to manipulate the judicial system in a manner that deprives two indigent young men  facing life sentences of their constitutional right to defend themselves at trial,  but Facebook and Twitter have made it clear they're unwilling to alter their behavior  regardless of the harm to others or the rulings of this court.  They're citing the Stored Communications Act, the 30-year-old privacy law that didn't even know  about digital, to withhold information. Apparently, this is not at all unusual.  They frequently do this. San Francisco Chronicle writes that social networks routinely use their  vast legal resources to fight defense subpoenas, which by the way, we encourage them to do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. This is the default because you don't want to... Yeah, I'm just curious what the  rationale is. I'm sure there is one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if somebody's wrongfully accused of a crime and you have information that exonerates  them, it seems ethically problematic that you would release that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, which is unprecedented. Benedict Evans, who I think is a brilliant analyst,  talked this week about how people cheered the LinkedIn decision that says,  you can scrape, you can scrape. Well, now it means you can also scrape everybody's photos,  which led to the New York Times story now. There's unintended consequences.  It's so complicated.  It's wonderful on one end and then on the other end we say, oh.  So complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Things that make you say, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I really love this and I recommend everybody read it.  That could be your sound.  We're a big fan of Bruce Schneier. He is one of the premier security researchers in the country,  a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. He said, you're missing the point by merely banning face  recognition. Face recognitions are a small part of these overall technological capabilities to  identify you from afar. He said people can be identified by their heartbeat, by their gait.  Cameras are so good that they can read fingerprints and iris patterns from meters away.  We could be identified because our smartphones broadcast MAC addresses.  Other things identify us as well, our phone numbers, our credit card numbers,  the license plates on our cars. China uses multiple identification technologies to support  its surveillance state. He says there's an entire industry of data brokers who make living analyzing  and augmenting data about who we are using surveillance data collected by all sorts of  companies then sold without our knowledge or consent. His face recognition, that's just  the tip of the iceberg. Today, facial recognition technology are receiving the brunt of the tech  backlash. Focusing on them misses the point, Bruce Schneier writes. We need to have a serious  conversation about all the technologies of identification, correlation, and discrimination.  That's what you want to talk about, I'm sure, Stacey, and decide how much we as a society want  to be spied on by governments and corporations and what sorts of influence we want them to have over

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  our lives. Go ahead, Stacey. No, and I was going to say, so in some ways I get frustrated when  people are like, ignore this, it's a bigger problem. I'm like, yes, I get it, and I do it too.  But it's still a problem. But it's still a problem. It's also people tend to look at what's  the populace as we are, the mainstream world. We look at what's bothering us now and what we  understand and what we know is widely deployed. I would argue gate recognition is actually  used apparently by the CIA, but the laser understanding is still a DARPA research project,  so I'm less worried about that. But the discrimination issue is a real problem,  and understanding how we apply these technologies is really important. Someone told me, and I think  this is really accurate, when you have the ability of almost omniscience, the laws you choose to  enforce and who you choose to enforce them against become incredibly important. And that's where we  need to be dedicating a lot of our conversations and resources, because right now we're not,  if I got robbed or mugged in the street, they might use all of the available technologies  to find my assailant. And you'd be happy. And I'd be happy about it. I would. If an  African American woman who is poor or a prostitute gets assaulted in the streets, they probably  wouldn't use their resources at all, even though they have them. And that becomes,  in a lot of ways, it's not justice. The disparity between who technology works for and doesn't  is still something we have never addressed as a society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I go back to, sorry about this, Mainz in 1462 and the Archbishop's War. And the pamphlets for the  two sides came off the same press. So that same argument where we're presumably,  Fust and Schiffer were arguing that their technology was neutral. But it also created  a fight that might not have existed. Maybe it led to war. Maybe it delayed the war.  There's no telling what happens without these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speculative.  I'm going to do one more story that I want to take a break and then we have a big change  log. So I want to make sure we have time for that. And then we'll wrap things up.  The Intercept last year in Brazil published articles based on leaked cell phone messages  that raised questions about the integrity and the motives of key members of Brazil's justice system,  in particular, an anti-corruption organization. Glenn Greenwald, who writes for the Intercept and  wrote these stories, has now been arrested and accused of being part of a criminal organization  and cyber crimes. I have mixed feelings about Glenn Greenwald, but this sounds very much,  Greenwald, who is, of course, an ardent opponent of Brazil's president, the authoritarian Bolsonaro,  is now in facing some serious jeopardy because of his work as a journalist. What do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I share with you, I think that, and Snowden was also Greenwald's story,  and Snowden came out and said, beware here. And I agree. One thing we haven't grappled with in our  field is what if somebody did steal the data, not Glenn Greenwald, but somebody else, what is the  issue of using it? And what journalists like Greenwald say is, it doesn't matter where the  information came from, the public has the right to know the information once it's there. Once we know  it, we have an obligation to share it. And that's been his pretty dogmatic view. And  I think I have to, by default, presume Glenn Greenwald's side on this.  Well, partly because of the environment.  And because he's a journalist.  Yeah, the environment he's working in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  He hasn't been detained. He says, I will continue to publish and cast the case against him as a test  of Brazil's democracy. We will not be intimidated, Greenwald said by these tyrannical attempts to  silence journalists. Prosecutors say they intercepted messages between Greenwald and the  hackers saying the journalists played a clear role in facilitating the commission of a crime.  Incidentally, that's exactly what US prosecutors are saying about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  WikiLeaks.  Oh, Julius Saunders.  Julius Saunders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is he in prison in the US or he's just a warrant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he's still awaiting extradition.  He's still in the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was about to say, he's in the US now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he's in the UK still, but they're trying to extradite him. And that's the accusation is,  not that he accepted these documents and published them, but that he encouraged  Did he encourage  Chelsea Manning to do it?  Yes.  There's similar to these intercepted messages, there's chat conversation.  Very, very troubling. At the same time, I think that a journalist should not  encourage criminal activities. I don't know. Jeff, you're the professor of journalism. What  would you tell your students?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to encourage or take part in a criminal activity.  Yeah.  So you don't break the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But wait a minute though, Daniel Ellsberg broke the law when he sent the Pentagon papers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Daniel Ellsberg wasn't the journalist. Daniel Ellsberg was the whistleblower who then came  to the journalist.  So Daniel Ellsberg was the criminal journalist.  Knowing that it was stolen, still said this is a public interest. Now that you have it,  yes, we're going to publish it. That's been the way of journalism since then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a fine line, but you're not allowed to say,  Daniel Ellsberg, go steal those Pentagon papers, Xerox them and send them to us.  But you can accept them if Ellsberg on his own does that and sends them to you in an unmarked  package and you open it up and say, oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or even if he comes into your office and says, I just stole this and you can have it.  Even then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in our terms that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you're buying stolen iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the question. So Brian Lamb, Gizmodo, iPhone is left on a bar.  Somebody finds it, calls them up, says, hey, I got a, it looks like this is the new iPhone.  You want to buy it? That's breaking the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depends. In that case, did Lamb know?  He didn't think it was stolen. He thought it was found.  It wasn't stolen. It was unauthorized, but it wasn't stolen.  Yeah. So that's not breaking the law or is it?  I don't think that was this much breaking the law. That was when Apple said their own police after  him. Literally their own police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could argue that paying for it, I mean, is that wrong of the journalist? I mean,  his story in the U S at least we don't pay for content.  You wouldn't do that.  No, I wouldn't, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, nor would I.  I honestly, from time to time I'm offered leaked photos of phones and things. I honestly do not  accept those. I say, don't send me that. I don't want to know about it. Partly because I don't,  I'm not in any race to get scoops. Yeah, I'm not in a race to get scoops.  And I don't think anybody should be because that's where bad stuff can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think scoops, true scoops, not just like I'm releasing. I found out about a product,  you know, two days before, but a true scoop is worth it. If you can find out something that  something that someone doesn't want you to know that is again in the public interest,  not just period, period, period. I can never say that word.  You said it perfectly.  I think that's important and you should be focused on bringing those to your readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if you get papers that say Vietnam was a farce and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, even something as simple as, hey, I'm talking to developers off the record and they're  saying to me, you know, Apple is telling us we can't work with this company anymore.  That's of interest to anybody who's working in that community or, you know, so those are scoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And.  Part of the reason I don't want the leaked photos or leaks of any kind.  And I can't remember if it was Evan Blass, one of the guys who routinely publishes these  kind of sounded like he was having a mini crisis of conscience on Twitter. He said,  you know, I just found out from a guy who leaked me some phones that he was fired as a result.  His, you know, he's unemployed, his family is, you know, destitute. I feel a little guilty.  And then he. I don't know if it's ever leaks or who, but anyway,  he continued doing what he was doing. I don't want to be responsible for that.  But maybe that's I'm in the position where I don't have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do I feel a bit of sadness when someone says something they absolutely should not have said  to me that I'm going to report? I do. Yeah.  Yeah, because I don't want to.  It's also Stacy's right to test his public interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The test of public interest.  Is seeing a phone two days early public interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Yes, that's right.  No. However, if you find out something scandalous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just read today there's a story, the Grammys organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my God, that is such a cluster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me, dude. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The head of it was put on administrative leave with allegations of some kind of improper conduct  to an employee. She before this had said HR is scathing memo saying there's huge problems here,  sexism and stuff. And I was being personally harassed by a board member, she said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And voting irregularities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This was wasn't just this. And then to me, I will say it looks like the Grammy,  they went by this same old school playbook of shutting down a woman  and by saying she was a bitchy boss to a particular employee. And  when her complaint looks pretty strong.  I mean, it's really. Yeah.  But it is a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Timing wise is kind of a problem, too, because aren't the Grammys this weekend?  Yes, it's right before. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoops. So it's an example of something that the Grammys public interest.  In one hand, no, they're just the Grammys are a stupid award.  But on the other hand, they say a lot about the culture and they indicate misogyny and racism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was no law breaking here. That's just her EEOC complaint, which is public.  So this is not related to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Board members, including those who represent or have relationships with nominated artists,  sit on the secret nominating committees. Indeed, it is not unusual for us to have relationships  with board members and who ranked at the bottom of the initial 20 artists list to end up receiving  nominations. That's the irregularities you were talking about. You're right. Who cares who wins  a Grammy? Except, well, I guess the record companies do. But it's but if you go on TV and  say, you know, here in a secret ballot, our members all agree this is the person who should win  and it's not the case, then I think, you know, if there's irregularities, that's that's in the  public interest. And you're right. Nobody had to break a law to to exfiltrate that information.  OK, I think you've you've given me a good moral framework for my future work as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  pretended journalist on this show. You can't you can't go with the don't be a dick kind of  perspective. No, you can't. Because sometimes you need to. But you can be don't be evil.  If evil considers looking out for, you know, you could argue the mores of your audience or you could

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  argue general moral ethics. I just don't want to be a dick. I'll give you another example that I  use all the time with my with our social journalism students, because we we we push the line of  advocacy in social journalism. You know, you you you observe and listen to a community. You  understand this community and you empathize with this community. You reflect the community.  Then how far does that go? So I think I can say his name was public event. Yeah.  So Zach Seward, who's now the CEO of Quartz, who's a wonderful journalist when he was the  Wall Street Journal, he was doing a story about a Ponzi scheme. And he realized at some point in  doing the story that as soon as he wrote in the Wall Street Journal, this was a Ponzi scheme,  all the people he'd been talking to were going to lose all their money.  Right. So that's what the students to say. If you if you think you serve just that community,  then what do you do? You you don't tell the world. Right. But you serve a higher goal. You serve a  higher truth. You serve the next person. You serve a greater goal. And so you do reveal. And yes,  people get hurt along the way. And they maybe helped you hurt themselves. But you had a North

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Star. Yeah. But it's not easy. And sometimes it's horrifying. And that's why it's nice to  have editors and people in your newsroom that you let them blame them. I don't know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate it. That's why I love blogging. I love it. I had to do the like newspaper call the family of  the flight attendant after the plane crash kind of thing. Oh, no, no, no. I've always been a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  business person. I had to do that. Yeah. Oh, I did do an internship on the cop shop beat at like two  in the morning. But that was just listening to the police radio and writing up blurbs for the most

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  part. Hey, there's one other smart home story. I'll go and then and then and then honestly,  we're going to take a break and come back with the change log. Charter is shutting down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's what we talked about. Oh, you already mentioned this. I mentioned that in the breaking  section. Yeah. But it was a aside. Yeah. Just so you know, ours actually has an excellent article  and they it is theoretically possible on some of the equipment that you will be able to use a Zigbee  or Z wave capable hub to work with things like your thermostat and maybe your lights, a few other

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  things like that. People who bought hundreds and hundreds of dollars of home security stuff from  Spectrum and and they've been out, you know, I guess charter inherited it  and and they've decided they're going to shut it down. And according to charter,  maybe you can repair some of repair re dash pa ir pair once again, some of these to another hub.  But but charter saying most of these things are just they're not going to work anymore.  It's very much like the Sonos situation. So yeah, excellent. Ours article highly recommended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is can I mention a related story? Yeah. Bad cable companies. Yeah. So Frontier is evidently  headed toward bankruptcy imminently. Yeah. How can you go bankrupt when you're monopoly ISP  and cable company? I really honestly don't understand that. They debt in one word,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  debt. That Okay. And this is the real this is a big problem in this country in general, by the way,  I heart media love the company love working for him. I hope to continue to work for them.  But like many of these giant radio conglomerates, they had huge debt in order to acquire all these  stations. And, and in fact, charter basically was faced with bankruptcy, just was able to re  negotiate and really, you know, lower their debt. And so they survived. They have great cash flow,  they just had insurmountable debt, you know, you can at some point owns oh, so many billions of  dollars that you can't keep up with the interest payments, even if you're cash flowing and a  profitable business. And that's essentially the position that we're in Frontier communications,  which took over, you know, it's funny, because when this happened in LA, they took over cable,  I think they took over spectrum cable service for a lot of people became the incumbent phone company  and the ISP and much of LA, people were furious service went down, quality went down, people hated  frontier, they were very upset. Now they say, Well, yeah, we have a lot of debt. And so we're  looking at Chapter 11 bankruptcy couldn't happen to a nicer company. I just feel bad for all of  the customers. 29 states. Yeah, thank you. Yeah. 500. I'm sorry, $356 million in debt, which comes  due in two months. That's the problem. I hard had the similar problem. They were able to negotiate  with creditors and which is what's happening with every newspaper company. Yeah. Clot McClatchy is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sadly probably soon to go bankrupt. Yeah, because this is why people hate private equity firms.  Yeah. And they do what they do. I was an advisor to what was then called the digital first media  under a brilliant CEO. And he always warned us he said the hedges will do what the hedges do.  They're they're built to do one thing and we got to beat the clock to them. But at the end  of the day, they're going to do what they do. Well, that cherry note, I feel like some trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not yet. Oh, must advertise. We must. Meanwhile, I'm just weeping reading the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the story about cereal being bought by the news. I put that in. See, speaking of cruel journalistic  acts. That was mine. There you go. Yeah, I put that up there. I wanted to see you cry and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  okay. Get some good color for the story. It's fine. What are you going to do? Right. Good for  them. I'm happy for Sarah. I'm happy for all the people making a lot of money. This happens all  the time in the in tech in general, right? I don't tell anybody I call it dumb money.  I mean, when you look at somebody like Mark Cuban, who got a billion dollars for broadcast.com  from Yahoo, that was instantly shut down instantly shut down complete waste of money for Yahoo.  He thinks he's the smartest guy ever because he tricked a company to spending a billion dollars  for his company. That's I call it dumb money. And boy, I'd love some but you know, it's fine.  It's life. If you had taken investment. Oh, I could have done everything so differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but investment can it investments tough, I want investment for that reason. I didn't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anybody to tell me what to do. I'm we are super happy. We love where we are and what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if anyone has like 100 million, maybe 150 million and wants to buy Leo, you just go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking you could talk them into it. You could you could convince them. Yeah, just try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the tough thing would be working for somebody for and because usually you get locked  in for you'd have to be well, especially this company because you're the core of it. I'm sure  Bill Simmons would get locked here. The chief twit Spotify, whatever. Yeah, that's all right.  We're very happy. We're doing fine. Thanks to people like Mint Mobile. I actually think this  is an amazing thing. Sometimes the big companies are not the best companies when it comes to cell  phone service. Wouldn't it be nice to get the same services a T-Mobile customer gets because  you're using T-Mobile's towers, but for a lot less. Enter Ryan Reynolds company, Mint Mobile.  Yes, it's owned by Deadpool, which is the craziest thing ever. But I just love this.  Mint Mobile saves money because they don't have retail stores. They don't have to mark it up.  They don't have hidden fees. What they do is they're an MVNO for T-Mobile and get ready.  You get the same premium network coverage you're used to, but at an amazingly low cost.  They're saving on retail locations. They're saving on overhead and they're passing those  savings on to you. Right now you could cut your wireless bill. To put this in perspective,  think how much you pay a month for wireless. Mint Mobile, unlimited talk, unlimited text,  3 gigs of data, which for most people is plenty. LTE, high speed data, $15 a month.  I went there and I saw this. This is for their three month introductory plan. When I went there  and saw this, I said, wait a minute. Okay, that's a good deal. So I want more data. I want 12  gigabytes. If I pay ahead for a year, it's $25 a month, unlimited text, unlimited phone calls,  12 gigabytes of data, more than I would ever use a month, $25. There is nobody even close. This  is amazing. You got to go to mintmobile.com slash twig. Give it a try. Choose between three,  eight and 12 gigabyte plans, 4G LTE data. You can bring your own phone. They have a little  IMEI checker on the site to see if your phone's compatible. They also sell your phones. Ditch your  old wireless bill. Save so much money. When I look at all the money I spent on cell phones,  it's like, I'm going to move them all to Mint. Mint Mobile, they'll send you the SIM. They don't  even charge you for the SIM. Other companies will charge you for the SIM, not Mint Mobile.  And you put in your phone, suddenly $15 a month, they have a three month introductory plan.  Mintmobile.com slash twig. Mintmobile.com slash twig. Thank you, Mint Mobile, for believing in  this week in Google. And thank you, twig listeners, for using that special URL,  because that way that's how they know. I'm not tracking you. I don't know that you went there,  but if you go there, they'll know. Mintmobile.com slash twig. By the way, we do every year an  annual survey of our audience. I want twig listeners to get in on this. We want to get  to know you better. Because we don't track you, we don't do what a lot of these other  companies do to try to figure out who you are. This survey is the only way we can do that.  It really helps people do it. It helps the company. Great thing to do.  Mint Mobile will say, well, how many men listen? How many women listen? How smart are they?  How smart are they? So this way, it's completely voluntary. You don't have to answer any questions.  You could skip questions. You don't have to do it at all if you don't want to. We don't collect  personal information. This is just in aggregate. It also helps us with programming. So we understand  what shows you like and that kind of thing. twig.to slash survey 20. It's our annual  survey for 2020. The twig 2020 audience survey. twig.to slash survey 20. If you don't get the big  Spotify money or the big New York Times money, you got to do it this way.  You got to go the hard way. Spotify says we're going to track people. They  say it. We're going to have exclusive podcasts and we're going to offer advertisers all the  information we know from people who use our app because they know exactly how much you listen to  when you stop listening to all that stuff. Who you are, what demographic, where you are,  all of that stuff they want to give to advertisers. And it's like, no, I'm not going to do that.  All right. Now play the trumpets. It's time for the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a big change log. Get ready. I'm going to run right through this.  If you are a Verizon Fios subscriber, get ready for your free $130 value Stadia gaming kit.  You'll be about the only people who can actually play game, get Stadia because you have fiber.  You'll get the Chromecast Ultra, the Stadia. I think this is a good promotion.  So when you sign up for a gigabit plan, you'll get the Stadia premiere edition in a three months,  not a year, but a three month Stadia pro subscription starting January 29th.  I would get fiber so fast if I could, but I can't. Google's Pixelbook Go is finally available in pink.  I'm waiting for Fiesta Red, man. Oh, red's nice. You know, you should look at that Samsung.  The Samsung, that's what I'm saying. It's going to be Fiesta Red. That's a beauty.  Did you see it at the show? I did. What'd you think?  It's beautiful. It's a, oh, yeah, I'm a fan of the Samsung Chromebooks. I owned the plus  and the, I didn't get the pro, but I liked the plus. In fact, I bought two pluses.  My daughter still uses her plus. Those are great Chromebooks. They make very good ones. Now it's  not going to be inexpensive, but neither is this Pixelbook Go $849 if you want pink.  Pink took them three months. I don't know. $849 for an M3. Oh no, I'm sorry. I5 is 849.  They don't have the M3 for pink. That's why. I was like, yeah, yeah. It's really,  I don't know. Google gets away with it, I guess. Google Classroom  is another tool that Google offers. Very popular in education. It goes with those Chromebooks.  Google is, I don't even know what this means, so I'm just going to say it. Google is launching a new  rubric and originality report tools for all G Suite for education customers. There I said it.  I like saying the word rubric. Oh, that's nice. A lot of classrooms,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I assume that's rubrics that you can share with your students so they know how to define what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're using. Yeah, that's great. Rubrics are what teachers use to kind of define the assignment

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  clearly, right? It's really helpful because they say, hey, we're going to grade you on  clarity. Do you do this, this, and this? And then they'll, yeah. My daughter, I'm jealous that I  did not have rubrics when I was being taught. I know. It makes it much easier to do an assignment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google offers rubrics that actually this was in beta that's now exiting beta.  So, with when starting assignment rubrics can be easily created by teachers and made available to  students. They can be reused as well as exported and imported. The rubric will then appear for the  teacher during grading so that they do know what is expected. And they're also expanding a test  that allows classrooms to sync grades with school information systems. CapitaSIM's Infinite Campus  and Skyward SMS 2.0 right now and more coming. I'm not an educator so all of this is Greek to me.  Actually, I know Greek. It's not even Greek to me. Google Podcasts.  It's not even Greek. Google Podcasts lets you share time stamped podcast episodes. You know,  that's a nice feature because then you can say, hey, listen to this part. Listen to this person  say something crazy at this point. Yeah. You could do that with YouTube.  You can actually tweet with a link that jumps right to Moral Panic or Mines. Listen,  you won't believe what Jeff said about Mines. So there's now in the Google Podcasts,  there were always a share episode. There's now a share from current time. That's just exactly  like YouTube. That's nice. It embeds the current time in the URL. Google,  how can I do a show called This Week in Google and not be able to pronounce the word Google?  Google Duo on the web no longer requires a phone number. Hallelujah.  I didn't know it did. Well, I think it was tied to your phone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't. It has to be about Google calling, messaging, hangouts, messages, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so complicated. It's crazy. Google is now, remember we were mentioning this Chromebook  eight year timeline. Now they've set a final timeline for killing and replacing Chrome apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had an immediate reaction to that like, oh no. Then I thought, I haven't used a Chrome app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. It was a kind of kooky idea. Chrome first had extensions and then they said,  I never really understood the distinction, but now this is an app, which means it kind of lives  by itself as a standalone thing. It's not an extension. Citing substantial progress since  apps were introduced in 2013, Google believes modern browsers put the web in a good position  to answer the vast majority of use cases. In other words, you don't need a packaged app anymore.  If Google earth, for instance, Figma and PWAs are still around. This does not affect PWAs  are the future. I think. Yes. So that's apps written with the same technologies as the Google  apps, you know, HTML five, CSS, JavaScript, but they can be, they look like standalone apps.  They have service workers, which means they operate offline. There's a lot of benefits to  program. I mean, progressive web apps. The best is that it's cross platform. It helps Google,  but also works on Apple, works on, you know, desktops, works everywhere. We were talking  about this on Mac break weekly yesterday because Apple is going to be facing a separate this US  Supreme court over monopsony. The monopsony of the app store. And I think this is their  best argument against it. Well, you could still get a PWA to run from anybody. So they told  Playboy and Playboy said, Apple won't let us have a nudie calendar app on the iPhone. It's too adult.  And Apple said, well, you can still do a web thing. Do a web app. I imagine those will get  better and better on iOS as an alternative. What else is going on? Oh, this was the best story.  Are you going to go and get a special envelope for your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, come on. So actually I was, oh, go on. Tell them what's, I was going to give you my tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Google. Oh, was it going to be your tip? No, no, this is not my tip. No, no, that's not my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  carry a microwave around with me and put it in there. Google releases three new experimental apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to help cut down on your phone usage as part of their digital wellbeing initiative.  Number one envelope. It only currently works with the three a there's a reason it's not just any old  envelope. You can still dial. So, so to get started, you print out a special PDF provided by the app,  fold it into the shape of an envelope, seal your phone inside, and then use it through the paper,  only having access to two things, the dialer and the camera.  And then it will tell you you've used the envelope for eight hours today.  Place your phone in the envelope and seal it. You can lock and unlock your phone using the  fingerprint. Uh, well that's kind of cool. I don't know. What do you think? No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  PDF have a hole for your camera must. That's really complicated cutting. Oh yeah. I failed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  scissors when I was, you know, yeah, it's going to look pretty bad. I mean, it looks, it looks good  in the picture. Well, yeah, it's going to look pretty bad when you do it. Right. Um, okay. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  my thing is, you know how you guys told me that I could turn on, do not disturb mode if I flip  my phone, like on the ground face down. Yeah. They said, God, I love that. I've never on my phone  unless I want to be. And it's just amazing. And all these annoying people who try to call me,  I don't have to hear from them. I'm facedown right now. Cause that's my default setting. And  like when we go out to eat or something like that, if my phone is out, which it usually isn't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's facedown. Although then I can't listen to music. I turn do not disturb on all the time. I  just have a thing that goes from 11, what is it, from midnight to 11 59 PM. And so I'm always in  do not disturb. Cause I don't ever want to talk to anybody. Well, that's true. I think maybe that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  being my mom or my mom. My daughter did tell me that I was just old. Well, I was like, I don't  want to talk to people. She's like, it's cause you're old mom and cranky. It's all relative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's right on all counts. To me, you're young to her. You're old. It's all relative. You're just  and cranky to me, to Jeff and me. You're like our junior member. I'm your junior queen. She's going

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to hit me. I think you're going to get, yeah, punching. I'm like somewhere. There's something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to be punched about. Just teasing you. Activity bubbles. This is, there's three different things.  Activity bubbles. This, uh, every time you unlock your phone, your wallpaper creates a bubble  on the, on the wallpaper. And then, uh, the longer on your phone, the bigger the bubble.  And then when you lock it, the bubble stops growing. By the end of the day, if your phone is full of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bubbles, you've been doing it too much. You've been doing good things with your life and you made  your own damn choices in your adult. And this device should not be telling you what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like this. I do think this helps people who may not be aware of how much time they spend on their  phone. Yeah. Or how often they unlock it. Cause a lot of people just, it's a deep, they're not even  interested. They just do it totally. Like I sometimes watch my husband, like he wakes up,  he picks up his phone, he looks at it. He like pushes some things. I'm like, what are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's like, I don't even know. Activity bubbles is already available in the app store. As is the  envelope you can download. I'm going to download it right now on my, uh, pixel three XL. What do you  talk? What'd you talk about Willis? How about a pixel four? Let's try that. It says new in Android  six. What are they talking about? All right. That's I'll do that later. Finally. Oh, I like this  screen stopwatch, a giant live wallpaper. I guess you can't use this and bubbles that displays your  phone usage in real time. Exactly how many hours, minutes and seconds you've spent on your phone  today. When your phone's locked, the counter stops every time you unlock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, uh, that's that. Can't you go into your phone and just see how much time you've spent on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's in there, but now they're, they're surfacing it. Right. That's the idea. I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  actually like to, so I, like an idiot, um, thought that when my daughter went up to her room to read,  read, I didn't realize she was stealing, um, what was she stealing? Like the iPad  and just watching more Netflix. So she and I will watch a show, but she's always very good about not  needing to watch. Like she's like, Oh, binging is boring. I'm going to watch one or two episodes.  And then I go away. But then she goes upstairs and watches something else. Shocked. I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  shocking dereliction, which would you like? I think I like the bubbles better than the timer,  but you can, you get your choice. All of these get off my lawn.  Jeff, you just, you don't, you, you can't deal with it. Can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just, I know I do deal with it. I just, I choose what to use. I don't want anybody to be my nanny.  Well, I do have a hard time. Yeah. Some people want that, but, but you don't see that's, that's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's right. No, I think some people are unaware of the time they spent on their phone. And if  made aware of it, they might be like, Holy crap, I'm spending six hours a day. Do it. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could be your number, Jeff. Let's think of that. No, I'm trying. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  not my number. Oh, are we, are we done with the changelog? We are done with the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to run downstairs to get my thing. Go run downstairs while you're running downstairs. I  shall turn to professor Jeff Jarvis for his thing of the week. So I was in best by today,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hoping that soon I'll see the Fiesta red Chromebook and it's not there yet, but I did see that there  were a Lenovo Chromebooks, uh, selling normal price now for $139. And I thought, wow, wow.  Wow. And then I went back and I looked at the, remember the one laptop per child thing,  Nicholas Negroponte, one in my office. I do too. Yeah. Now defamed, uh, MIT media lab, uh, did,  and how that was the, it was an unbelievable goal to get a laptop down to a hundred dollars.  And we're pretty much, the market's pretty much about ready to be there, perfectly workable  and connected to the whole world of information. And I just found that amazing, even a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  inspiring. That's all. I agree. That's a really good point. And I think in many ways it's probably  more useful than the one. I tried to work that device. Uh, it was, everything was in scratch and  it was cute looking. Hey, one more thing I'll add to the change log. Thank you. Scooter X. I didn't  know this, but I forgot PlayStation is phasing out. It's over the top TV, uh, uh, service called view  YouTube TV is leaping into the gap. It is now or will soon be available on the PlayStation four.  So if you're using PlayStation view, I think you only have a few weeks left. Uh, YouTube TV wants  to be your alternative. Look, I, I put the little, there's only one little bubble on the bottom. It's  bigger. It's getting bigger next week. I'll show you my bubbles. Oh, can I mention one more thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my friend, Samir Aurora, I mentioned this, I think two weeks ago has a new company called  Sage, which is not public yet, but I wrote a post about it as a, an expert network.  And he's starting with travel because it's, the entities are very clear to work with  and they hand selected a hundred experts for the sites that they had. Then those people then  selected a total of a thousand. And then that was a learning set for the AI to take over.  And now they have 5 million verifiable restaurants, hotels and such, and the opinions about them. And I,  I believe that he's onto something here and that the next  generation of the net that we need is one that brings in expertise and authority.  And that means you've got to figure out what, who's an expert and who's not, who's full of  s and who's not, but that's the challenge. No, no, no, no, no, no. How does it monetize?  You're going to be able to, uh, the service will let's say you're an expert because you're an  expert in many things. Leo is free to you. You can, uh, uh, have many business models with your  fans. Advertising is not on it yet. It may not be, but you could, you could, I could just be your  fan. You could send me to your website. So I would be curating, uh, content exactly. Or, or you could  do it on, on, um, Sage and you could charge me a monthly fee. You could charge me for a one-time  product. You could charge me for an event for a consulting thing, for a chat. Um, it tries to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have a wide canopy of, of business models. I don't need no New York times money. I could just do this.  Right. That's the idea. So, so here's very smart. Is it available? I'm looking at this, uh,  from the presentation. So there's a curated experts web. There's a social, that's, that's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's, he's talking about, this has kind of been the progression of the web as a whole. Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the past. This is the past. Going from the bottom to the top. We're now at the experts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  curated web. Right. That's what he's building now. Cause that's what you always do when you make a  PowerPoint is you put yourself on the top. Yes, of course. Uh, so it's not there yet. A little  frustrating cause you can't play with it yet. In fact, it's for iOS and I'm, of course I live  the V to Google, so I couldn't fully play with it yet. I spent a long, a long time with him and his  team to get, get the sense of it. And I think he's onto something very important here. So a little  preview for the world. This hasn't been written about anywhere else yet. Oh my God. It's a scoop

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's a scoop of store, but it's, it's fired because we've revealed this. I don't want to do it.  It's a friendly scoop, friendly scoop from Samir. And I have no business with Mark. He bought me a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cup of coffee at a very good, nice place in Palo Alto. That was it. What happened to glam? That was  his other company, right? Yeah. It imploded in, um, investor politics and programmatic advertising.  And it was such a good idea. It was a blog that will Samir and I bonded. I make reference to the  world's history is ugly as PowerPoint slide. Cause he came in and I was talking about networks,  networks, networks, and he came in and he talked about glam, which was an open network of,  of fashion blogs versus I village, which was a closed media company owning it and how much  better the network is. And that's where he and I bonded. Cause we believed in the network model.  And I still do. Um, I think we all do. Um, it was a former Obama guy. Well, uh, he also, uh, the  problem was bored of the German publisher, uh, invested in it and got cold feet. And, but he  also bought Ning for man, Greason and recent was on the board. So it was an idea that you could build  your own community, but he's, uh, uh, uh, Samir did net objects way back in the day. Oh, okay. So  he's always been about building tools for creation. So he's a friend and, uh, I'm impressed where he's  headed. And so take a look at that folks. Nice. Stacey, what's your thing this week? Today's thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is, oh, I know what that is. Is that from Casper? It's a glow. I recognize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bought it a while back here. I'm going to do my camera down so you can see the glowing orb. Oh,  okay. I'm going to have to move the glowing over up. All right. So this is brighter because of her

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  camera. It's not that bright. It's not blindingly bright. Oh, it's not doing it. Oh, I'm doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the wrong way. Sorry. I'm looking at it and I'm having a hard time. So when I turn it, it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it dims. It's just on a charging stand by the way that you can lift it off. Yeah. And when I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  lift it off of it, I turn it off by flipping it over. I turn it on by flipping it over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, you have such power. You have electric hands. But it's, this lasts for six hours. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on a timer. So if I want to, and I can turn it off by, can I turn it? Oh no, that stops it when I tap  tap it, but you can, um, it's just a fun little, uh, sorry. It dims down over a set period of time.  So right now I think it's set to 30 minutes where it'll over 30 minutes. It gets softer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's such a brilliant idea. And we should mention Casper's a sponsor, of course. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they are still, I didn't know that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We love I didn't realize that we mentioned  them when they filed last week for their S one. Um, but, but yes, so I just wanted to show this.  It is $129 for one or $229 for two. I find that it is not awesome to read by.  No, it's not quite bright enough to read by. It's all right, but it's not, it'd be good to browse  a magazine by. Yeah. If it's, if it, if you're not, if it's not the New Yorker or the economist,  I will say, which is what I read before bed. What you need is three glows and then you could read.  And you can sync. If you have multiple ones, you can sync them via Bluetooth. I got this as a  Christmas present for my daughter and she freaking loves it. Oh, that's really sweet.  How does she use it? She uses it. Actually, she finds her alarm too jarring in the morning.  Yeah. So she uses it to wake up as a wake up. And then she also uses it just like,  just around for fun. We also, when the power went out for 17 hours last week, we used it then.  The only complaint I have is that it charges, it's got a, the charging cable. I would like this to be  micro USB so I could charge it in other things, but that's a pretty small niggle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or type C even better. Yeah. Or type. Yeah. I don't care. Whichever.  I brought this home, you know, I reviewed it and I, and I, like you gave it a positive, I love it.  I think it's great. But my wife really didn't like the, she doesn't want any light in the  bedroom at all period. She doesn't want to see you. Okay. Well, that is, yeah, I was like,  this is her dream date right now. All the lights are out. Oh, did you, oh, someone,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  are you asking me to wiggle the light? Wiggle it. What happens when you wiggle it?  It's supposed to go lower, but it's not going lower. Yeah. I think it's when it's off.  It has to go to the bathroom. Yeah. And you wiggle it. Then that it's the,  now it's pulling, but you really can't tell. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, what if I turned off my light?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. We're getting fancy with the production now.  The camera just adjusts. You don't even need that light. The camera goes, oh, it's dark. I better

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  turn myself up. Sorry. Yeah. The camera's compensating. Oh shucks. I want to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  uh, we haven't had Kevin Marks on in ages to talk about the,  the free and open web. We'll get them back on soon, but I want to give a plug to software.  In fact, I interviewed the guy who invented this software many moons ago in triangulation,  Ward Cunningham. I want to give a plug to Wiki software. The idea of Wiki,  it comes from the Hawaiian Wiki, Wiki buses, the fast buses that go around  Honolulu. The idea is it's a fast and easy website to create and then very easy to edit.  In fact, I have been, I, I call my Wiki, it's our family Wiki, the 4am Wiki,  cause I got up at four in the morning. I didn't know what to do. So I made one.  It's so, it's that easy to make. It's a very easy thing to do and anybody can edit it. You don't  have to be an expert in web technology. There's some basic markup. The syntax is fairly simple.  And then, uh, you can, and they even have, this one is called docuWiki, but there's thousands,  well, maybe not that many, dozens of different Wiki platforms, including the best known Wiki  in the world, Wikipedia. Uh, we even have our own Wiki and I might as well mention that as long as  we're talking Wikis that you can edit if you want wiki.twit.tv. It's our official Wiki.  And it has a lot. Wiki, I love Wikis. It's an easy way to create content. You can open it to  the public like Wikipedia in our case too, because we don't have a lot of editors and Wikipedia does,  we ask you to request access. So if you'd like to contribute, there's a form you can fill out and,  uh, and, and Patrick Delahanty will just say, okay, fine. But you know, that way we keep spammers out  that kind of thing. But it's a really great, you know, there's a this week in Google page on it.  It's very easy for people to edit it, add material and so forth. And I just, I really am a fan of  Wikis. So I just wanted to give a little plug. And in this case, the Wiki was very easy to set  up because I have a Synology NAS and Synology has docuWiki as part of its, you know, one click  installs. It's very easy to make it. Now this is not public. This is something that Lisa and I use  because we're planning upcoming travel and I put stuff in here that I want to keep track of,  but it's very easy way to have a webpage. It could be public. Oh, with Yale people. Oh my,  Oh, that's going to be fun. Yeah. We're going on a river cruise. You, you would, you would enjoy this.  I would, my wife would hate it. Uh, we're starting in Budapest. We're going to Bratislava, Vienna,  the Wachau Valley, Melk Abbey, where they're famous for their apricot liquor. We get off in  Passau. We go to Salzburg where Mozart was born. Oberammergau. This is the thing that your wife  might enjoy, which is every 10 years, a little medieval town of Oberammergau would, uh, prayed  during the 16th century that if you pass us over with the plague, we will dedicate in your honor,  a, every 10 years, every decade, a passion play. And they've been doing it ever since the 2020  version is coming up this summer. 2000 residents of the town all participate. And I imagine there's  like a little, uh, fist fight to get to see who gets to be Jesus. Who gets to be Jesus. Yes.  That's probably murders over that. Yeah. And then we're going to go to the, uh, the famous mad King  Ludwig's, uh, castle. Do you get to go to Mainz? Uh, we'll look for Mainz as we pass it on the river.  And then we're ending up in Munich. We're going to, oh, we're not going as that far. We're on the  Danube and then we're going into Munich. I've been to Mainz last time I was on the river cruise.  And we're, and we're going to take, uh, we're taking our 17 year old and we're going to take  him to Dachau. So he gets a little, uh, history. It's very hard. Um, yeah, so that's going to be  fun, but you see, isn't this nice? And then he can go here and he can, he can find out what we're  going to do. There's a little calendar on here so he can see all the little, the different things  we're going to be doing day by day and stuff. I think wikis are really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think I've ever thought that much about wikis. Well, now you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Indeed. This is my 4 a.m. wiki. Well, you use Wikipedia all the time. That's a wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I know. And I go on wikis for various TV shows that I like. I mean, I just have not spent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a lot of time thinking about wikis. It's just a long ago. The, what went in the early days,  the early innocent, wonderful days of the internet, the Los Angeles times decided that,  there's this new thing called wikis. Let's do a wiki toriel. It was an editorial on a wiki.  And they chose as the topic, the Iraq war. Hey, crowd source this editorial. You know how quickly  it went completely to the dogs because they didn't understand that wiki was about consensus,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not about fighting. That's one of the most amazing things about Wikipedia is how well that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's so Jimmy Wales saw that at the time and I blogged it and Jimmy came in and said,  oh yeah, you're right. This is completely and he tried to get a hold of it. And he said,  fork it, have two sides present their best arguments. That's the way to use wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they did. And in fact, breaking news on Wikipedia is amazing. It's a great way to hear  both sides. Yeah, it's just really well done. I say fork it all the time. In fact,  I'm going to say fork it right now. Do you watch good place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This? Yes. That's what I was thinking too. I was like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because she can't swear because she's in the good place or not. I don't know where she is,  but she can't swear. And so every time she tries to swear, it's kind of these funny  family friendly versions. My daughter always wants it. She's like, what's up my benches?  I wish that would spread. I love that. I love that. That's great. You know what? From now on,  when I swear here, I'm going to say the things I have to watch the good place first and make a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
