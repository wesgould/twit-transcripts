Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google. Stacey Higginbotham, Ant Pruitt, Jeff Jarvis.  The whole gang is here. We'll talk about Google's  flock. They're replacing it, but is the replacement any better?  The IRS wants to use ID.me for your face scans. Is that a good idea?  And why is Amazon getting behind the legalization of marijuana?  It's all coming up next on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by Compiler, an original podcast from Red Hat discussing tech topics big, small, and strange.  Listen to Compiler on Apple Podcasts or anywhere you listen to podcasts.  It's time for Twig this week in Google. The show where we get the  latest from the world around us. How about that? That's really what we're doing.  Taking a look at the world around us with Waldorf and Sattler.  Here's my Sattler, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jeff Jarvis. Hello, Jeff. Hello.  Is that the grumpy one?  I think they're both grumpy.  Both grumpy.  Oh, okay. Well, then I'm fine. That's me. Yeah.  The Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Looking good today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wonder what my family thinks outside the door there.  They hear you making that racket.  Ow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's not on with the BBC.  People watch this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also here, Ant Prut. Prut Grutt from Hands on Photography.  He's the Community Manager at our wonderful Discord.  You did a bunch of stuff this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been a little busy. We got an event coming up with Miss Georgia Dow.  It's going to be a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'll be fun. Yeah. And we got Mike Elgin coming up in a couple of weeks.  And it's going to be good.  Oh, the Discord's back home.  Yeah, Discord was down today. The API was broken.  Yep.  How does that happen when it's distributed?  It's not distributed. That's the illusion that you have.  Everybody has a server, but they all run on Discord.  Discord's own hardware. So it's really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I never understood that.  Yeah, I never understood it either until I got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I realized, well, it's just, you know, it's all running on their hardware.  Yeah. Okay. Got it.  So it's like any other...  It's just like Twitter. Yeah, but it's just like Twitter, really.  Anything else, right? You just can have a closed little club, which is great.  Also with us, she's back. Stacey... Well, she wasn't gone last week, but she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was about to say, I was here yesterday or last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last week. Host of Stacey's Book Club.  Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on iot.com and the IoT Podcast with Kevin Tofel.  Hello, Stacey.  Hello, y'all.  Half of your eyes look one way, half the eyes look the other.  Her husband did her right eye today.  In a beautiful moment of togetherness. That's really sweet.  I should get Lisa to do my eye makeup sometime. I think that's a nice idea.  Do you do eye makeup?  No, of course not. I did used to for years.  I was about to say you do a TV, right?  I have my own makeup kit with... I know what my shades are and all that and my contour and fill.  The minute we'd started doing these podcasts in video, I said, I am never... I'm not wearing makeup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.  I did my eye makeup today too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You look fabulous. Did you paint on those eyebrows?  I think you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  You painted them.  That's just focus peaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were you around, Leo, when HTTV came in and started doing the airbrush thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was doing live with Regis and Kelly and the makeup artist, you go there, you get made up  before the show, the makeup artist said, we're using airbrushes today.  And she painted my face with an airbrush.  If you just use regular foundation and powder, you can see it. There's enough detail. You can see the  powder. Apparently Kelly had brought that on. She had a TV show. I can't remember the name of it,  but she had a primetime TV show and they were using it there. So they wanted to try it on.  They didn't stick with it. It was back to the old...  No, I haven't seen it in a long time.  Yeah. You don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had my makeup done for Fox TV once and oh my.  Did they paint you right?  I looked... They did, but I walked out looking almost the same as I normally do, but a little  better. They took like 45 minutes. I still don't understand what all they were doing with my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We used to have hair and makeup at Tech TV. It would literally take you 45 minutes. You'd  have to come an hour early to get hair done and makeup done and then they do your nails.  They do the whole thing. Nails?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we were showing stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Showing products.  Oh, I see. You're a hand model, George.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't George. No, it was Kramer. Kramer was a hand model.  Yeah, Kramer used to lotion his hands. So I got good at going, you rub the outline. If I were  showing this phone, because you don't want to just go, look, there's the phone. You go like this.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Vanna.  Spokes model training.  It's your Vanna.  It's like the price is right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're just slowly stroking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You folks have no idea how many times Queen Pruitt gave me crap for doing-  Bad fingernails?  Yeah. If I did a product demo and we do the B-roll of me showing the product, then I don't  have the manicure done.  Okay. You want a tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She let me know.  You want a tip? I'll give you a tip. Everybody, this is going to be your tip of the week.  Because for a while with Tech TV, I would go and I would get my nails done.  I went to a place, it was 20 bucks. Eventually they stopped. They said, you're paying too much.  You need to go to the $5 nail salon. I said, I'm not going to the $5 nail salon. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Funguses and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said, really 20 bucks a week, you're not anyway. I stopped, but I did it myself.  I asked and they said, look, all you need to do, the manicure said, get a good nail brush  every day when you shower or whatever. You use the nail brush, scrub, scrub, scrub. Then you put  nice little cuticle oil on your cuticle oil and you're good. You can cut obviously, but you're  good. That means your nails will look good enough that you can do the hand modeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you maintained this twilights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still do this. Yes. Every morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get lax on it and she lets me know because we have all of that stuff here with that being  her profession. She does manicures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I first met her, she looked first at my nails and commented on that before anything.  I was grateful. I had just had them done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's done my nails actually. When she was at the manicure shop down here, I went down  and got my nails done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who would think this would be our topic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The lead story today, I don't know how we got here.  You know what our lead story should be? Goodbye, Flock. Flock you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We never got to say hello to Flock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Google says, and I think this is really an interesting story, said yesterday,  they were going to replace, as you remember, they had announced no more third party cookies.  Everybody hates them. Good. That's fine.  But we do need some way to sell targeted advertising.  We're going to have the federated learning of cohorts, which was a kind of retronym,  awkward retronym because everything in this area had birds, bird themed.  So this flock would essentially watch what you do, just the same way as Google always did.  But instead of having a unique identifier for you, they would put you in a cohort of people  with similar interests. They never really explained how big this cohort would be.  But the thing that I think upset people was then when you go to a website,  your flock cohort would be sent to the website.  Like, you know, hi, here's Leo. He's 3994-7.  And people didn't really like that. It wasn't clear how big the cohort would be.  I think there's also, it's funny because they're in trouble with the EU.  Akshay Springer, our favorite heavy, has sued them for ending cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Springer is the one who led the fight against Google, used their political clout,  got the EU to go after Google. Everybody's screaming privacy, privacy, dot and shuts,  dot and shuts, get rid of cookies, they are evil. And then Akshay Springer says,  oh, we can't target any ads. No, don't get rid of cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The EFF did not like flock because there was this concern that, as always with these things that  are so-called anonymized, it's possible to de-anonymize. And they were a little worried  that if people started combining your flock ID with other profile information, they might actually  be able to figure out who's who and all of that. So Google has, I think in response to the EU,  I don't know, really, in response to privacy advocates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there was a lot of reasons because a lot of people were unhappy with flock.  Yeah.  So they're coming up with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Topics. It was just a proposal. I mean, they never implemented it. It was only in beta.  So now it's topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Topics are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Ben Galbraith, who's senior director for product, acknowledged privacy concerns with  flock, said topics was easier for users to understand. It would also make it easier for  Google to remove sensitive topics from being targeted. So topics  lets advertisers target online users based on a topic they might be interested in, fitness or  travel. Chrome does this automatically. Now, by the way, this is all proposal, not implemented yet.  Chrome will generate five topics based on your browser history with, and this is important,  participating websites. It then sends three topics, one from each of the past three weeks  to participating sites to share with their advertising partners.  Topics like flock are not permanent. In this case, they're stored for three weeks,  then deleted. There are 350 topics. But Google's saying by doing this,  instead of saying what your interests are in flock, we're saying what your interests are,  but we can also just ignore things like, I don't know, whatever is, you know, mental health issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My searches for mental health resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, guns, that kind of thing. So topic data is stored on your device.  Manicures.  Manicures. This will be a good test. If I get a bunch of manicure information in my  Instagram feed, I think we'll know. So it's never stored on Google, unlike third party  tracking cookies, which allow companies to use tracking pixels so they can go cross site. This  can't really go cross site. You will be, unlike flock, you'll be able to see what topics you are  being, you know, flogged with, they're being sent to sites. If you don't like a topic,  I like this. You can remove it.  This is great.  Yeah. You can say, you know, I'm not interested in tennis racquets. I am interested in pickleball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For my wife and I don't play tennis. Yeah, I'm too old. I play pickleball and yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google says users will be able to disable the feature completely, which is really interesting.  I think Google does. Google wants to maintain its ad model,  but they really do want to respond to people's privacy concerns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a way to add. It's a value add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead. I'm sorry, Anne.  You said this is stored on the device and Chrome is just reading it that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Chrome generates it and then stores it in its, you know, store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wherever it stores cookies.  Back pocket.  In its back pocket.  But it's stored locally on your device. It's not sent up to the cloud like associated  with your IP address. Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they announced, yeah, that's right. That's the key, right? It's anonymized.  Yeah.  Although it is in a way associated with your IP address because when you go, let's say you go  to, what's the, you know, some bass fishing place and it sends out, let's, you know,  you go to Dick's Sporting Goods website and it's going to say, well, here's the three things,  here's the three topics Leo's interested in. But Dick's is getting that plus my IP address.  So that's why they have to expire them on a regular basis, right? So they can't start  building a picture of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other interesting thing here is what could be done. Go ahead, Stacy. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say Google says they also are going to send fake topics to about 5% of  the websites to make sure the topic generation is actually random, which I thought was kind of like,  does that mean like 5% of your ads aren't, are they going to give people a discount of 5%?  Oh, from the business perspective.  I get where they're coming from, but it's kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have, I mean, I'm a little, I'm a, of course, I've been a little skeptical because Google has  its own way of tracking who you are and all of that. But I think that Google is really,  is I'm going to give them credit for trying to find a system that users can tolerate that gives  the advertisers some of the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which might actually give you more relevant advertising. Here's a question.  Do you, did you receive anything, whether, whether an advertiser can do a not,  that's how it got abused on Facebook, right? If I, if I, if I decide I want to advertise this thing,  but not to people who like hip hop as a way, you know, this job as a way to not kind of red  lighting, in other words, that kind of stuff. Right. And the not was an issue there.  I'm sure it was the primary one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that Google can control the not because they're going to send,  here's a, here's on the Google keyword block sample. They're going to send out, you know,  this, you know, Jeff's interest in autos and vehicles, books and literature, comics and  animation, rock music, team sports. There's no reason that Dick sports couldn't say,  oh rock, I don't want anybody's interest in rock and just say, you know, we won't advertise  to that person. The point that Google's making on this graph diagram is you don't know, you can't  tell what's in that cookie. It's a, you know, it's code, but you can see very clearly cause  Chrome will show this, what your, what interest is sending to advertisers. And you see that X,  you can delete them. So I think this is, I like this solution. Let me, here's Google's  one minute video to describe this here. Are you getting audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You didn't test your audio, Leo. Left, left, right, right. Left, left, right, right. Yeah. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  maybe there's no audio in it. We, we heard the tick tock. Okay. Introducing topics,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  privacy sandboxes newest proposal to help you preserve your privacy online while enabling sites  to show with topics, your browser will note topics related to participating sites you visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For example, if you've recently visited sites about sports, the browser may note that sports  is one of your topics. Your topics will help determine the ads you see.  And as I won't need to know who you are to show you an ad about sports, they just know you like  it. You have no control. Oh, sorry. You do have control over your topics and you can  remember topics in the browser or you could turn them off altogether. I'm cold reading it, man.  With topics, the specific sites you visited are no longer shared across the web like they might  have been with third party, third party evil cookie. We're testing topics soon to get feedback  from the industry so that it works together with all of the other privacy sandbox proposals  to protect your privacy and keep the internet a valuable source of free information  for now and the future. And that's the balancing act. They want to support advertising, which  is what supports free internet content, but they also want you to feel comfortable with the  information they share. I don't know negatives, Stacy, can you see a negative here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, no, I mean, I think it's mostly positive, especially if they make it easy for you to look  because then you can also, I mean, the negative for an advertiser is I could go in and I could be  like, I'm so sick of seeing all these high price coats because I keep buying them. So then I'm like,  I am not interested in high fashion. And then I would stop buying high fashion because of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  advertising. Google has published interestingly on GitHub, the details about the API,  if you want to, if you want to start getting ready as a, as a web site designer to, to support this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's, um, I think there's a further opportunity is to let me pick my topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, isn't that interesting? I want the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you might, I mean, I will say that as I, so especially because it's short range,  like three weeks, let's just go with every time I binge watch a show, I start Googling like mad  to hear like, who's the actors? Where have I seen this person? So it captures, it captures that,  which is a very fleeting interest, but might be interesting for an advertiser.  And then it goes away when I'm probably no longer interested in it. If I had to manage that, I'd just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  be like, I'm interested in IOT in close. But the interesting thing too here is Google's always,  always sussed out topicality right from the very, very beginning of advertising.  So how are they going to know an expensive coat site? I guess that's pretty obvious.  They're coats and they're expensive, but how, you know, what, how does the topicality, uh,  determined is going to be interesting to see? Cause we've never had transparency on that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why does ad appear on this page? It would almost make it look like they have access to the history,  even though they say they're not looking at your history. Of which the user or the site and the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  user. But they, they are very obviously looking at your history. I mean, if I look at like my  Google newsfeed, for example, I mean, all I have to do is search like one freaking, I don't know,  like hot tub chemicals. And for the rest of my life, I'm reading stories about hot tubs.  So I assume this is going to be built on, I mean, that's easy for Google, right?  Yeah. Yeah. It may not be accurate. So I can go in and be like, please stop showing me ads for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hot tubs. I mean, Google, look, Google is not going to make privacy advocates and advertisers  happy. So it's a con it's like any compromise. There's, it's not going to be perfect. I think  as a user, I'm satisfied with this. Will advertisers feel like they're getting enough  information? I mean, honestly, if, if your Dick's sporting goods and it says you're interested,  I don't know, pickleball is probably too granular. That's the problem. So it might say you're  interested in racket sports. Then I mean, maybe they'd like more granularity. I don't know. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  haven't heard from advertisers. I don't know. The other interesting piece here is, is the  correlations that occur. I remember early on, I'm forgetting the name of the company that was bought  by a well long ago. They found, for example, that service people in the army and Navy and so on,  well, correlated very highly with big screen TVs.  So you might be wanting to advertise a big screen TV, but you go toward military interest  or vice versa. Right. And that's because you have your own data as an advertiser  that says, these are, these are the useful correlations that we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's okay. I mean, that's been happening for a while. So I don't have issues with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think we've got to work cool with that. Right.  Right. We are, but we got to think about, you know, how does this let's, let's here's the test. I  think if I'm a job site and I'm advertising jobs, am I using some topics to get rid of,  oh, people who may be less desirable for my employer, people who are on a culture fit?  Um, yeah. Right. And, and so that's gonna, Google's gonna have to test out and they're good at this,  right? Going back to Matt cuts, they're good at sussing out bad uses of things, but far better  than Facebook ever was, um, of seeing how could this system get misused? And, and it will be,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it surely will be no doubt about it. Okay. Anyway, I can, I commend them for trying to  find something to make people happy. Uh, and I'm sure the, I haven't seen the EFF yet. Let me see  if the EFF is already up in arms over this. Well, but also the Washington post to the New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  times, I put it in this tweet. It's rather than saying a new way to target ads, a new way to track

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you. Yeah. But remember, that's a problem. I think it's important to explain to people that these  companies are tracking them. I have a really interesting tracking story, but it's not on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thing. But let me just say this and then let's do that. But it's not tracking the common person's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  understanding. I disagree with you on the New York times headline scaring. Well, but, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  let Leo defend me. I'm going to defend you because it, so third, so cookies, as Google pointed out,  track you in the sense that you, the Facebook like button sees multiple sites that you've been on.  This is a very different system where the Chrome browser, which sees those sites anyway,  then extracts from that an interest, five interests, which you can see what they are.  You can turn them off and sends that to the website. That is not the same thing at all. That's  not really tracking you in my opinion. Now, maybe do you think Stacy consumers will see that mechanism  that the browser then says, this is what you're interested in. Uh, is that, will that be seen as  tracking? I don't feel like that's tracking. It's not following you in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anytime something pops up and tells the average person, Hey, I think you like this or I know you  like this. Right. And they're correct. That creeps people out. They don't care that it follows them  other places. That's a real subtle distinction. Most people don't care about. They should,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cause that's the problem. That's why we, that's why we don't like third party cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how sophisticated does someone have to be to, so, okay. Can I tell you my tracking story?  Cause I think this is interesting and it ties to this. So I read it. My daughter is a sophomore  in high school. So she's looking, we're about to start the whole college thing. So we, we got a  book by a wall street journal reporter about like getting money for college. And in that book,  he talked about how colleges are now using pixel trackers on emails to track when applicants open  their emails, how quickly they respond, how many times they open it. And they use that information.  Okay. But they use that information for getting a sense of how interested someone is in the school  and for allocating scholarship money. And I was like, Oh crap, I got to get my daughter proton mail  because I don't want, I don't want her casual searches or interests in something to cost us  money. Right. And so I think it's old news that yes, there are pixel trackers in email, right?  We might all be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. But when you think about how those are being used,  it's kind of like, Holy crap. In ways that might surprise you. It's fully, and that's what I mean.  Like people are not sophisticated or it's not even not sophisticated. We just don't think  everything through to that level because my God, we'd have, we sound like paranoid, crazy folk,  I guess. But anyway, that's why I've been thinking. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Air quotes, normals. We do sound paranoid when we start talking about privacy and security,  even though it's pretty blatant what's going on. I think Google has an opportunity here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is me just speculating to your point, Leo, about the awareness of people in New York,  point Stacey and Ant about the nervousness is to be very strong of saying control your advertising,  control what topics you have, control what topics you don't get. I've always argued, I wanted on the  sites that I ran when I ran them, I wanted the opportunity for somebody to say, don't show me  this advertiser and sell that data to the advertiser. These people don't want to see you.  You figure out why, but that's valuable. You're wasting your money trying to get to these people.  So stop going to those people. Right. I think there's an opportunity to become,  I hate to use this word, very proactive and allow users to in fact, not just feel in control, but  be in control. It's going to generate more data that is actually valuable because it comes from,  it's a permission to system that says, yeah, I am looking for a car right now.  No, I was looking for my daughter. She already bought the car. Stop with the car ads, please.  Stop wasting your money and my eye space. There's a lot of opportunity there. I think they won't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and there's always people who are going to be like, not everybody wants to be proactive  with advertisers. Many people might be like, I'm going to tell it. I want data about that's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  my thought is that really the people object to this. It's not about tracking. It's not about  cookies. It's not about any of this. They object to advertising and they just, they don't want  advertising that knows anything about them, which has never been, by the way, never been the case.  Advertising is always targeted to some degree. If you buy Better Homes and Gardens, you're targeting  the readers of Better Homes and Gardens. If you buy ads on this show, you're targeting them  based on their interest in this show. So I think where people got upset is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they just don't like advertising. Well, I think advertising has gotten more manipulative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's not more micro targeted. Think about the advertising, you know, in the TV ads where  your coworker put a bottle of scope on your desk, they didn't want to tell you you had bad breath.  I mean, it's been manipulative since four out of five doctors recommend bacon for breakfast.  I mean, it's always been manipulative. I think it's maybe less manipulative now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, sorry, Stacey. No, no, go ahead.  More than half the ads in newspapers in the early days before the linotype and the explosion,  more than half in major newspapers were for patent medicines. Advertising was crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. From the beginning.  Feeling tired?  Yeah, you need snake oil. So yeah, I mean, I understand why people hate ads. That's probably  part of the reason people hate ads. But ads, we even do ads. You know, marketing is important  to businesses. Somehow we have to get the word out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. It's not the ads. So advertising, yes, is manipulative. But I think the fact that it's  coming at you in so many places in ways might feel more manipulative. And I say that because,  again, I'll just use my fancy coats as an example. I can watch the fancy coats on television,  but when I'm watching them on the internet, they're chasing me over every freaking story  there is, right? So the ratio of time I spend looking at fancy coats is pretty high. And  maybe that's what feels so manipulative. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so really the debate is how sophisticated are people when they say,  I don't want to be tracked. And I think, you know, the people who listen to this show are  the privacy advocates who are into technology are really saying, I don't want cookies tracking me  from site to site. I don't want my location information to be available. I don't want you  putting little sub pixels in my email so that you know I've opened it. That kind of thing is  the intrusive tracking people are talking about. And I don't think this is not that. They may still  not like it, but this is much more benign. Will they do a good job of explaining this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to the public? Or will the public and media? Well, again, as I go back to the narrative is  going to come from the Washington Post and the New York Times saying, they found a new way to track  you, evil Google. And it's going to be real hard to say we're actually trying to improve

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  advertising. And if we don't, media are borked, folks. So what if we say a less intrusive way to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  track? Well, here's the headline in the Times. Google introduces a new system for tracking  Chrome browser users. Washington Post is worse. And if you, well, but even if you just read the  headline, that's, yeah, that doesn't sound so good. Right. Yeah. And it blocks so-called cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, oh, why don't you put scare quotes around cookies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. I will tell you though, when I ask normal people every now and then I'm like, hey,  you know what a cookie is? They're like, oh yeah, it's that thing that it's on the web. It,  it follows you. It keeps popping up on the screen. Here's the, I mean, seriously. Yeah. No, here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the, here's the Washington Post. Google proposes a new way to track people around the web again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not even accurate. Wow. Yeah. It's good old click bait right there. Yeah. Yep. Moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I gave you the warning. It was time for the more part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's producing the show, Jeff. Come on, man. I'm not, I'm not producing today. No, he's not. He  had plenty of time to do it. He pushed the button. Nevermind. I was trying to help you, Ant. There

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was a changing of the guard at the TriCaster and they didn't catch it. So Ant, would you, Ant,  would you push the button again? And the, and the folks who push the buttons on the other side of  the room, maybe they'll push the button at the same. There we go. I feel so good. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And his, it's a bow on the top of the discussion. It does need a sound effect because remember most

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of the audience is not looking. They're only listening. Yeah. So they only know we laugh  to work on that. What would be the, it's all music. It's gotta be real. No, it's more like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  boom, boom, boom. It's, it's jaws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll dig through my library of sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here, turn that up, Burke.  Is that sinister enough? Do it again here. I don't hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Moral panic. Oh yeah, that's good. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll buy you that. Here's another one. Let's try this here. One more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Moral panic. I think you need a little more panic in your voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, I think you need the more, and then the, oh, time it better. I think, yeah, time it.  It's a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Moral panic. Moral panic. Moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll work on that. We'll workshop that. I like giving Leo notes. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have way too much fun on this show. We have way too much time in our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was about to say, I think it's.  Moral panic. Moral panic. Moral panic.  Oh, this is making me so happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we need to cut the sound a little short and then we'll get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will fix it on my end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When will we three meet again in fire, lightning, or in moral panic?  Okay. You want a heartbeat and a shark sound and yeah. All right.  We can, I can work on that. I was a radio production director for many years. I could  put something together. We'd get that. We get those notes from the morning guy.  I need a moral panic sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got it for you. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I feel like, you know, a lot of people listen to the show. We should be aware and try  to give them some fun as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, the other Washington post headline that caught my eye, why Amazon  is ramping up its push for legalizing marijuana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there. Now that's link bait. I clicked on that one right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It also explains, I think this story explains why they stopped testing their employees for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  marijuana. Who cares if they're high.  Nice angle.  Let them be high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, why?  Well, there's a business angle. What's the go? Explain that story to Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Legalizing pot could also open the door to a lucrative new market for the online retailer.  But Amazon says it's not interested in selling pot.  They just want to remove hiring impediments, which disproportionately impact individuals of color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they want to sell a few bongs and a few bongs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bongs? Yeah, there are more. We can't.  Petaluma has not allowed legal marijuana is legal in California, but they've not allowed stores  to open selling pot in town. But there are about 800 bong stores.  Go out of town, get your dope, but come back to buy the pipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go 10 minutes away and then come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm deeply Elizabeth Warren. I'm deeply skeptical that Amazon's lobbying is anything  more than a self-interested move to monopolize another market. Wait a minute, wait a minute,  potentially blocking black and Latino entrepreneurs from an emerging industry.  Oh God.  Why are people associating race with marijuana use? That seems not so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it certainly has been happening in the justice system where people who are  thrown in jail for marijuana sales are disproportionately people of color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure.  For instances of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, in Washington state, many of the owners of the marijuana dispensaries are not people of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  color. Yeah. And that's the issue is people suffered from this industry when it was underground  and now the opportunity should be given to those communities that were made to suffer  by the justice system. Oh, that's interesting. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. That seems, yeah. It's a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think that's what she's saying.  A little convoluted.  That's what your point. Yeah, it is. It is a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think, Ann?  I mean, you are a person of color.  Sorry, I muted myself.  Seems like, yeah, were you swearing? Okay, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. It is totally disproportionate. I want to say I mentioned this the other week where  if somebody gets in trouble for a marijuana charge or what have you,  they literally get the book thrown at them and they get these ridiculous sentences.  Sentencing is disproportionate.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, prosecution too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Flock, here's one from Protocol.  Flock is dead, but Topics won't fix Google's ad targeting problems.  It just seems like rearranging deck chairs on the sinking ship of targeted ads.  I like that headline better.  Yeah, it's not as bad. Is the ship sinking of targeted ads? I guess maybe it is.  Well.  It's listing to port heavily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. I can use my number now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially with more regulation. Oh, go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. All right. Thank you. So, and I've talked about this before, but Instacart  under Fiji CIMO, former head of the news feed at Facebook, the new CEO there is going to go  heavily into advertising. Makes sense, right? It's a low margin business and we can push you.  No, buy the Pepsodent this week. Right? So advertising there makes sense.  Amazon has built tremendous, quietly built a tremendous advertising business that's  challenging Google. Best Buy now sells floor space, rents out floor space as marketing.  Best Buy is an advertising medium.  They've always done that. Grocery stores have always made more money

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by pricing products at eye level or in caps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But now there's new players. Instacart is a new player. Amazon is a new player in advertising.  Best Buy is a new player in this way. TV set makers. We talked about that in the show.  What finally occurred to me today in Twitter was that all these industries are going into  advertising as media is leaving advertising. The media said, oh, we give up. We're going to put

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  paywalls on. I'll give you a different perspective. All these industries are going  into it as margins from their primary business drop. Yes. Yes. And what they're doing is they're  saying, well, look, people will buy more TVs if we can charge a third what we used to charge.  We'll make up the difference in putting ads on. And I understand that. And it's kind of in a way,  consumers are telling them that. Drop the price. We'll put up with the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're meeting consumers where they're shopping. I mean, if I'm no longer, if Instacart,  if I'm using Instacart, I'm not seeing what the in caps that people paid so much money

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to Kroger for getting their stuff there. How much of this also comes from, to your point exactly,  Stacey, people under 30 don't watch TV anymore. They don't read newspapers. We get advertisers  because there's no e-week or PC week for enterprise companies to buy ads in. They're trying desperately  to figure out how do we reach our customers? I understand that. That makes sense. So it's coming  in from both directions. Companies trying to lower prices, find another way to make money,  and advertisers desperate to reach an audience that's disappeared. Right. And so rather than

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  fixing, rather than coming up with new models that make advertising work, the ad, the media business  is basically giving up. They're all acting like Apple. Ah, screw it. And so you have  Wall Street Journal and companies like that trying to make it more difficult around advertising  that's why they're ganging up with odd bedfellows here. And media should be in the business and say,  no, let's find new services for marketing to hold on to that subsidy. But they've just surrendered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's an interesting time we live in. We've always been ad supported, but as advertisers  COVID kind of drove advertising down, diversity in podcasts drove audience numbers down.  We've seen dwindling revenue. That's why we started Club Twit as another way to support us.  And it's interesting because we kind of consciously said, well, if you don't like ads,  would you be willing to pay seven bucks a month for ad free content? And to this day, it's still  only a few percentages, maybe 2% of our total audience that is willing to pay not to have ads.  So, and I'm not sure if that's a reflection of what's even funnier is those that signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We still get a large percentage of them to say, we want the ads. I know that's the funniest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know that cracks me up. I love the ads. It's just like, we want more. So is that the wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pitch? So some people want to support us. Well, the pitch is to support us as well as if you don't  want ads that we don't, if you give us seven bucks a month, we don't need to play ads for you  because you're giving us what we would make for you from an advertiser. So that's, you know,  but it's such a small percentage. I have to think it may also reflect the fact that people  have figured out how to skip ads. People are pretty not seeing or hearing ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  PR stations get six to 12% of their audience giving money to the station.  That's a huge, that took a long time to build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a huge, and they only do it by bugging the hell out of you a lot.  Exactly. So, so it's the free tote bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could you get to 5%? It's the free, it's all about the free tote bag.  You know what? I want a sweater vest. I want a twit sweater vest. Then I'll give money to you.  Trust me. I want to walk around proudly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, could we all get twit sweater vests and bow ties?  I'm bow ties. Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be so adorable. I think we might get Miss Ashley on the horn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, how cute would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I first started working in radio, I worked for a funky little station  called KLOK, Clock Radio, right? Clock Radio.  And it was all men. This is, you know, it was all men. And so the, the, the man, the men from Clock  and they all had mustard yellow jackets with the Clock logo on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Elitist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there'd be billboards of men from Clock and their mustard colored blazers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm going to say no to mustard. That is an unflattering color on a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'll wear a blazer.  Thank you, Miss.  Fezzes. We could all wear Fezzes if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like that could be culturally appropriate. We'd have to investigate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  After Ataturk said we don't want them, I think we can, anybody there, they're open to all.  Well, yeah.  Open to all. I want to take a little break, come back with more with this.  In fact, I am going to do something unheard of. Stacey picks the next story.  Wait a minute.  Oh, you can do it later.  Is this a democracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's a Staceyocracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a Staceyocracy. That's the best kind ofocracy.  Staceyocracy coming up next. But first a word from our sponsor.  And the other thing is I like to choose sponsors that we like, that we have a relationship with.  And I feel like it's not an ad to kind of twist your arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to talk about IDME and the IRS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perfect. That's exactly what I was going to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good, because it's really confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the IRS, and they've kind of backtracked a little bit on this, but I don't think the  backtrack is real. It's a little confusing. I've seen on the site even, if you go to IRS.gov,  they say coming this summer, there's certain things they want extra security, right? So this  is the troubling thing. They've contracted with a third party, a company a lot of states are  working with called ID.ME. The states are doing it to try to eliminate fraud in things like  COVID loans and unemployment. ID.ME is a way of authenticating yourself.  Okay, so there's kind of the synopsis. Tell me, Stacey, what you think of this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, originally, I was like, what the what? Because at first, it sounded like the IRS was  going to make all of us upload our biometric information. And I was like, this is a bad plan  for so many reasons, right? And now it's coming in.  Yeah, I'm like, oh. And then now they're saying, no, you can still pay your taxes and do things.  It's going to be a little bit more onerous, but you can still not use this. But in totally separate  news, and I'm still trying to figure out what the heck ID.ME is actually using. So they're saying  they're not using facial recognition. But they are. And this is where I'm like, this is why we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  talking about this, because I am still trying to figure out things they could be doing with the IRS.  You know, they're saying you take a selfie and sometimes they want to be moving, by the way.  So it's not just a picture of a picture. So a selfie, hi, it's me. And we will use that picture  of you to verify that it's you. But then they were accused, that's called one to one face  recognition, right? But then they were accused of doing something that is much more disturbing,  which is called one to many face matching steps, which means it's the kind of thing that  Clearview AI was using, where I take a picture of Stacey and then I try to match it in a database  of many people. And that's a lot more concerning because it's not then just about authentication,  you're being added to a large database. So in his LinkedIn post, Blake Hall, who is the CEO of ID.ME,  the CEO says, he made it clear as mud, we avoid disclosing methods we use to stop identity theft  and organized crime because it jeopardizes their effectiveness. Okay. Criminals are constantly  getting a lot of excuses. ID.ME uses a specific one to many check on selfies tied to government  programs targeted by organized crime to prevent prolific identity thieves. In other words,  they're going to match your picture against a database. It's almost like going to the police  department and looking through the mug sheet to see if you're a member of organized crime.  He says, this step is internal to ID.ME and does not involve any external or government database.  It occurs once during enrollment and exists to make sure a single attacker is not registering  multiple identities. That kind of makes sense. The one-to-one would not register that. It wouldn't  know if you've done this 12 times. This step is not tied to identity verification. It does not  block legitimate users from verifying their identity, nor is it used for any other purpose  than to prevent identity theft. Data shows that removing this control would immediately lead to  significant identity theft and organized crime. The one-to-one face match step is the only step  we use to verify identity. It sounds to me like he's also saying, but we're also going to do the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one-to-many. Here's what I'm wondering because Brian Krebs went through the process to register  his face. As part of that, there was a person who actually registered. That's the one-to-one.  Now, Brian Krebs has his IRS ID.ME profile. What I'm guessing is if Brian Krebs were a fraudster  and tried to do it again under the name of Pete Johnson, Pete Johnson, when he went to try to do  this, that would be a one-to-one, but they would have to check the face of Pete Johnson against  their one-to-many database. They would recognize that Pete Johnson is also Brian Krebs. That's  what I'm hoping they're trying to say. I think that's what they are saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is okay. That's not terrible. This is my problem. Every single time I set up an ID.ME  account, which I'm going to need to log into the IRS for certain things like paying your taxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or getting your refund. You don't have to. The IRS has said that you don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you're going to be more convenient to show them. This is confusing unless they've changed  your policy because here's the page Brian Krebs publishes. If you have an existing IRS username,  please create a new ID.ME account as soon as possible. You won't be able to log in with your  existing IRS name and password starting summer 2022. Now, maybe they've changed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gizmodo's story has an editor's note saying that you can still file and pay taxes without logging  into an IRS account or providing biometric data, which contradicts information an IRS spokesperson  previously provided. They also pointed out that this was a really frustrating correction.  I think the thing is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pay taxes. Fine. If you're going to give us money, fine. You want to claim a refund,  you're going to need to use ID.ME. I think this is the weasel words. There are some things you  don't need to use ID.ME for, but there are also some things you must use ID.ME for.  My problem, there are a couple. One is it's a third party. They're going to have a lot of  face recognition information because with a one-to-many system, they have to store everybody's face.  With a one-to-one system, they don't. With a one-to-many, they have to store everybody's face.  That means they're going to have a database of every single person who logs into the IRS

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  using the system. ID.ME has that, not the IRS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's my problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. No, no, no. I get it. I get it. ID.ME already has this database because it already  has many people in the database. Well, until you get your ... Okay. Your issue is you don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to use internal companies. IRS used to use Equifax to do this. That was a problem. They got rid of  that because ... And here's the problem. Why did they get rid of Equifax? Because they had a  massive data breach. So now they got ID.ME. And a data breach here would be 10 times worse  because it wouldn't just be your social security number. It'd be your social security number and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your face. You're right. It's still unclear if the IRS ... I think what's happening is there's a lot  of backlash and the IRS is suddenly like, I don't know if we can force everybody. Because you have  to pay your taxes. You can't ... Basically, you're legally now requiring ... Well, no. That's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're saying you can pay your taxes without it. They never implied that you couldn't pay your taxes.  It's if you want to ... There's some things that you have to do it for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is a good system for verified identification? Well, this is the problem. This is a good system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Ideally, would you make the underlying security aspects of it  not open source? I mean, yes, you need a database of faces and information if you're going to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  faces for security. Krebs looked at their security and he said, they do all the security in depth  stuff, blah, blah, blah, blah. So maybe it is secure. Here's the real problem. You can't change  your face really or fingerprints. When you're giving people biometrics, you're giving them  something permanent. Even a social security number can be changed. But when you give them biometrics,  that's it. It's over. And if that leaks out, that becomes ... And if it's used as a basis  for transactions. An unfixable problem. Yeah. It's an unfixable problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem is that it's not the data breaches. Everything is breached. The problem is using  bad structures for transactions. And then that's the problem. It's like the social  security number wasn't supposed to be used for everything, right? But it became used for  everything. So what if the face ends up being used for every banking thing and then it gets misused?  That's where the problem comes in. There's a further issue because ID.me looks like they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not been fully transparent on this. At first they say, oh no, it's one to one. And they say,  but we have to use one to many. Oh, now we're not going to tell you because we don't got crooks to  know. And this is what Caitlin Sealy George, who's the campaign director for Fight for the  Future says. We already know this company is willing to say anything in order to get more  government contracts. The CEO of ID.me has been peddling erroneous numbers about unemployment  benefit fraud. But the fact that the IRS knew about this discrepancy is a big problem. The  only responsible thing for the IRS and any other state or federal agency using ID.me  to do is to stop these contracts immediately. So that's the part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the CEO is a liar. Well, here's my big worry and issue. And we're already getting there. But  if you have a government entity, sure this is the kind of services side of the government,  but having a database of your face and all the relevant information about you  and that it becomes centralized, that can be used across. My worry is it can be used across all  government agencies to find you or to like, technically, I guess it already can be. And  we're already seeing that with like the nationwide ID programs, but understanding who has access to  your face data and all the personally identifiable information associated with that and what they  can use that for. Can they use it for tracking you if you haven't paid a parking ticket using  like city cameras? Can they sell that to a private company to track like what stores you go in? I  mean, like my concern is this is really rich, valuable data. And I want to see really hard  rules about how it's stored, secured, and then limited in use. And I think that's the biggest

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  problem. I think if it is breached, what could be done with it? What else would depend upon the  same data that could then be misused? Well, I actually don't think being breached is the worst  case scenario. I think the worst case scenario is the government has given all this valuable data

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to a private company, but they don't have the data to do that. And I think that's the biggest  the worst case scenario is the government has given all this valuable data to a private company  who could then turn around and sell that data to, I don't know, somebody who like  makes traffic cameras and then you suddenly have like parking lot cameras. So you know where  Stacey Higginbotham is based on camera data wherever I am in my day, for example.  And I mean, it's kind of like location data from phones, which we might talk about later  because there's a lawsuit about that. That's more my concern. I mean, yes, it probably will get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  breached. But yeah. Yeah. And will the government's database, would that be any more secure than  id.me? I mean, I think a lot of this comes. No. I mean, that's part of the problem. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We keep assembling all this valuable stuff and we're like, yeah, we know that security is not 100%,  but hey, let's take all of our gold and stick it someplace right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Throw the government a bone. They may secure it. I mean, we just had the whole  COVID testing site go up that was hosted by the government that didn't crash as soon as we  launched it. So maybe there's hope on security too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and you know, the government may already have your photo because they use DMV photos.  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they started now taking your DMV photos and creating the nationwide database. Remember,  initially it was statewide and then several states signed up to participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  21 states, 641 million drivers license and ID photos from 21 states went to federal law  enforcement databases and then we shared with other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We only have 330 million people.  Why do we have so many drivers license?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point. There's more drivers licenses than there are people.  That's not right.  This is consumer reports. I trust them. I don't know.  Federal agencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Sorry. No, I'm just like, wait, we don't have that population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks for the sanity check. Yeah. I don't know.  Well, I mean, how many pictures have you had taken over the years?  About 2016, the center on privacy and technology reported about half of all American adult faces  are already in police facial recognition databases. So maybe it's silly to worry about this because  this ship has sailed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then we have to figure out rules for how they can use that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FBI uses DMV photos. ICE uses DMV photos. I mean, it's not.  Oh boy.  Yeah. Yeah. And actually this is an article in consumer reports from three years ago,  but they even address this thing about the difference between a face ID on a phone  which is one to one and one to many.  What we do on a phone is authentication. We're simply comparing two face images,  but when law enforcement is searching for a person of interest, the system has to search  against a large database of millions or even a hundred million photos.  And that introduces this problem. The accuracy of facial recognition goes down  as the size of a database increases. That's one of the concerns about using it for criminal law  enforcement. And we've seen this. People going to jail incorrectly because they were identified  in a digital lineup.  So anyway, I'm glad you brought it up because that is exactly one of the topics I wanted to  talk about. And I don't know what I think. I mean, we certainly want it to be more secure.  Maybe the government already does have all those photos anyway.  So, but should this third party ID.me be allowed to collect all of these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much fraud is there now? What's the problem they're trying to solve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently a big, according to, well, and this is the other thing. ID.me CEO says,  Oh, it's big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Big problem. We're just here to solve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of fraud for parents committing tax fraud against their kids. So they actually,  but this wouldn't solve that. Cause if you're the first person to authenticate,  is like if I authenticated as my daughter, for example, then I become the canonical image for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  her. ID.me has said there's been massive unemployment benefit fraud. They say 30% of states  have seen, what is the number they said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Washington lost like a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Many states, this is from last year, are seeing a 30% fraud rate according to ID.me.  And of course this is self-serving information. And that's one of the things  that she was referring to when she said that he's been kind of misleading about this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did get a lot of fraud. I mean, there is a lot of unemployment insurance fraud, but  I don't know how much IRS fraud versus unemployment fraud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ID.me says $400 billion in pandemic unemployment fraud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's another case. Yeah. Well, that's another case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unproven, but that's the kind of stuff that the states are using them for.  We had at least a billion.  We gave Axios. Yeah. $400 billion is a lot of money by cyber criminal gangs.  And then that number, by the way, then parodied by the top Republican on the House Ways and  Means Committee, Kevin Brady. So it suddenly becomes truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Oregon paid only $24 million in fraudulent unemployment benefits during the pandemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The total amount of government payouts was $800 billion. So they're saying half of that  money was fraudulent. It seems like a large number. California says $20 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $20 billion is what they paid out in fraud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. Fraudulent unemployment payments during the pandemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  11% of what it paid out overall. Yeah, we had $650 million in Washington. So that's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hall, by the way, says to this day, it's accurate, according to Bloomberg Business Week.  He said, it's confirmed in patterns the data the company has gathered through its work for  California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and 22 other states.  He says, if state agencies are reporting far lower levels of fraud publicly, well, they're wrong.  Okay. He says, this is the largest cyber attack in terms of fraud in American history.  And that's what's giving some people a little bit of qualms about ID.me.  Are they overstating this to get this government contract?  Yes. Would be surprised. I know, but we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know. That's marketing, right? That's sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ID.me began 12 years ago as TroopSwap, a Craigslist knockoff for the military community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a pivot. Then they turned it into a Groupon-style discount service. Then they realized

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the real asset of TroopSwap was the software which allowed veterans to prove their eligibility  without presenting documents bearing social security numbers. They said, hmm, hmm.  Hall and Thompson, both ex-military, but neither of whom had a tech background, saw an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always, anybody who does a lot of deals with the government, I'm always like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  your sketch. The Obama administration, this is all from Bloomberg Business Week,  the Obama administration had announced the national strategy for trusted identities in  cyberspace, a push to get private sector companies to develop ID verification technologies.  The TroopSwap team bought the ID.me domain rebranded and won a $2.6 million grant from  the Commerce Department's National Institutes of Standards and Technology.  Anyway, there's more to this. This is a deeper story. I'm sure we'll be reading more of this.  It's interesting. And, you know.  Yeah.  Yep. There you go. There you have it.  What do we think about the end of the line for Google Cloud's G Suite free edition?  If you have a G Suite free edition, you're going to have to upgrade to a paid version  starting July 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They should have long ago. And this is true for me because I pay already. You hear me  complain about it all the time. G Suite is now built for big companies. They should have a light  individual or family edition of it that says all you want is your own domain, some email,  here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's what it was used for, right?  That's why I'm there.  Yeah, you'd have a custom domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then they've overcomplicated the hell out of it on the high end. They've taken away  features because it's so complicated. We can't get as Google users. And they shouldn't treat  the individual who was grandfathered now like a company. It's only six bucks a month. It's not  that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They stopped offering the free tier 10 years ago.  A long time ago.  Yeah.  But you were grandfathered.  But you still had it. So there's people who have been all along. They got a domain name. It's just  them.  That's my wife.  They got a smaller version of G Suite. So she's going to have to start paying in July.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How does she feel about that?  She doesn't know yet. She'll roll her eyes and say, what did you get me into? Me and Jake.  No, I mean, that was a good idea. I'm kind of glad I didn't do that. But we,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twit pays the, you know, we have, we use the workspace.  Because you run servers and things.  Yeah. So we pay the six bucks per seat and everybody's got an ad. And twit.tv is through  that. That's the email, not the website, but the email. And, yeah. And we use G Suite.  I'm sorry, workspace. I'm using it right now as a Google sheet that we use to share the  stories with all the hosts and the following stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Simon Bodger sent me a thing from GitHub, a G Suite migration plan that goes into some  detail about this.  What line is that?  It's not yet. It will be in a second.  What good are you?  150. So I'm going to make you scroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Why you make me, why you make me scroll? Okay.  Cause it's fun to watch that.  GitHub G Suite migration. So this is a software that'll just move you over to a paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't think, no, this is the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh God.  Yeah.  It's not, doesn't look simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a typical Google process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  Gmail, migrateable? Yes. Gmail rules? Yes. Google talk hangouts? No. This is sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's cause they killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Google drive? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But migrateable to what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, you get Google drive if you pay the six. Oh, this is if you don't want to pay six bucks.  Yeah. Yeah, I think so.  If a G Suite account remains unpaid, Google will convert the account to a Google identity.  This is an incomplete Google account, which does not include Gmail and calendar,  but for some reason includes Google drive. I'll tell you why they don't want to delete your data.  While many Google services work with Google identity, its usage is inconvenient  and one will be required to be logged into several accounts to use free Gmail.  So you're going to have all sorts of identities.  So this is how to get out of G Suite Google to free Google accounts  and what tools you'll need and how you will do it.  Ah, I see. Okay.  It's quite a few.  A lot of steps there.  Quite a few steps. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So six bucks a month. I think I'm missing the opportunity just to do a different offer.  Fine. Charges for the services.  Give him for a buck. If you only have one person using it, you know, a buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We pay what? We pay $6 a person? I mean, you can't pay $6 or I mean, you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get a lot for that money, by the way, I should say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You get like 15 gigs.  So yeah.  So I think if you're sad...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You also get complications. Now that's my problem is because you entered in,  because then when I use this against my Chromebook and I want to add something, oh, no, no,  you must get the administrator to do this. And then I start screaming on Twitter and  people have to calm me down and send me drugs. Yeah. I am the administrator.  I'm an idiot. What are you doing to me? And so that's the problem, Stacy, is that it's,  yes, six bucks a month and you get a whole lot of services. Absolutely.  But you also get headaches whenever Google introduces something new and you can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could most... I mean, like I'm our Google G Suite administrator for Stacy on IOT.  So there's four licenses out and I am the person.  You're a genius.  And I have the same frustrations you have, Jeff. I don't yell as loudly on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I should point out that there are still... This is not changing the free Gmail,  the free Google Drive. I mean, this is only if you want to use a custom domain.  So I have my name at gmail.com. I have a Google Drive under that name and all of that stuff.  Which you should pay for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's free.  No, I'm saying people wanting to go custom should be cost on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually I do pay for it because I have a Google One plan, which means I...  So I have two terabytes of Google Drive and Blum. Because what do they give you? 50 gigabytes  or something. It's not usually... You can run through that if you have Gmail alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google probably just feels like if you're sophisticated enough to run,  to own your own domain and to want to run that through them.  That's pretty sophisticated.  Yeah. I mean, because you also have to have a server. So you're either running your own server,  you're going to hire someone to do it. So that's pretty sophisticated. They figure you could be  your own IT administrator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are a lot cheaper ways than six bucks a person per month if you just want email at  your own domain.  I also want my Gmail. I like Gmail.  Or if you want to use... Well, I can still use Gmail. I just have it forward to Gmail and then  log into my Gmail account. You can still use that. So I have my own custom domains. For a long time,  email to me would go to my Gmail account. And actually, I had a really complicated set up  because I did that because Gmail was good at spam and then I would have it forwarded  from my Gmail account to another mail server. So I was kind of running my mail through Gmail for  the spam filtering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You and Dvorak. Dvorak was insisting that he had better spam. I never had any spam. And you said,  no, I got Gmail. It works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He used some guy service. I get no spam. I think we even had a song.  I get no spam. Yeah, he was famous for that. I'm sure he must have gotten spam, but who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, Gmail was very good. Actually, I stopped doing that because Gmail spam filtering is not  that good.  It's still good. Oh, it's not? You don't think so?  No. I get so much spam. My biggest problem is that it was Laporte at Gmail and that sounds French.  So I was getting not only spam, but I was getting a lot of French spam.  Oh, right.  A classy of you.  Actually, what did I get the other day in French? Oh, from my employer. Iheart sent me an email.  They do every six months, even though this is no longer the recommendation. They  change your password. They expire your password every six months. So annoying.  Because I only log in once like every six months. So they sent me an email. But what was weird is  they sent it to me in English and French. And I was trying to figure out, do they think I'm French?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clearly they do.  Clearly they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to know all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some sort of Canadian thing, but they're not a Canadian company.  Are they a French company?  No. It was an odd thing. I have to ask my boss, why did you send me this in French?  Changez le password.  How about this? Actually, let's take a break. I have a lot of how about this coming up,  but I want to talk a little bit about my food. Tomorrow our Imperfect Foods box comes.  You said, Stacey, somebody was using Imperfect Foods. I love Imperfect Foods.  I have done it in the past.  It just blew me away. So Imperfect Foods, you can put the lower third up. It's okay.  Imperfect Foods. This is an ad. There you go. That's it. This is an ad.  Imperfect Foods was started because they noticed that a lot of foods were thrown away  because the grocer wouldn't put it because they want that beautiful display of perfect apples.  But as you may know, if you've ever gone to an apple orchard, most apples aren't perfect.  And in fact, I'll be honest with you, the small ones, maybe those are the sweetest.  Those are the best apples because we used to go. We used to pick our apples. I knew which ones to  get. Not the perfect ones that have been stored in a refrigerator and bread so that they could be  stored in the refrigerator six months before they go on the grocery shelf. So Imperfect Foods said,  we should really solve this problem because it turns out, I didn't realize this, about a third,  more than a third, 35% of the food supply in this country goes unsold, uneaten,  and because it's not perfect. So Imperfect Foods was started as a delivery service so you could  kind of be a good person and get delicious foods. I have to tell you, we've been subscribing to  Imperfect Foods for some time now. I've never had anything I wouldn't go, that's great. Sometimes  I thought we were going to get a lot of food that looked like Richard Nixon, like carrots with a  big nose and stuff. But no, there's a few sometimes. Or the pomegranates aren't as big as your head.  They're only as big as your fist, things like that. I think those are sweeter anyway. Now  Imperfect Foods does a whole lot more. They do meats, they do dairy, they do snacks, all of it,  food that the grocers, they overproduced it or they didn't want it. It's great. You'll reduce  food waste. It'll save you time in your grocery shopping and you will eat more fresh, delicious  food. Plus you're really helping the environment. So not only does that food not get wasted,  right, but you're also because instead of going to the grocery store, Imperfect Foods delivers,  they bunch all deliveries in your neighborhood together on the single day. So everybody in our  area is Thursday, one truck. That means there's 25% to 75% fewer emissions than if we were all  going to the grocery store. That's awesome. On average Imperfect Foods customers save six to  eight pounds of food with every order. But I don't want to emphasize that you're going to feel good  about doing good, but you're going to get great food too. Look, go to Imperfect Foods dot com,  check first to see if they deliver in your area. I don't want to oversell this if you can't get it.  I don't want to make you feel bad. But if you can, trust me, you should do it. Sign up. You  could personalize your weekly grocery order with fresh seasonal produce, pantry staples,  yummy snacks. It'll arrive on the same day every week. Won't necessarily be Thursday. That's just  my neighborhood. But it's nice because you know that box is going to be there. They're really good  on packaging too. That's the other thing. Unlike some grocery delivery services where you get a  hundred plastic bags, you could say goodbye to Packaging Guilt. Imperfect Foods is the only  national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return your packaging after every order.  We do that. They don't do a lot of plastic bags. It's just, you can tell it's thoughtful.  It's thoughtful. And that's why I really like it. It is a great grocery delivery service that you  will love. And I want you to try it. In fact, we've got a deal for you. Get your first four orders,  20% off, 20% off, not just for the first one, but for the first four orders. When you go to  imperfectfoods.com, but you have to do this for me, use the promo code TWIG to get that offer.  T-W-I-G. That way they know you saw it here too. 20% off your first four orders. That's up to an  $80 value at imperfectfoods.com when you use the promo code TWIG. We love it. From my family to  yours, I think you'll love it too. Imperfectfoods.com promo code TWIG. Good way to really feel good about  what you're eating and it has helped the environment and get delicious. I think it's perfect,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  personally, food. I want to see Hank do an Imperfect Foods challenge. Oh, he should. Here, Hank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a box. He should. What can you make with this? Exactly. I'll tell you the one thing I really  love. They have a heritage chicken, which is a little smaller because it doesn't have the big  breasts. It's not the Dolly Parton of chickens. It's not all hormones. It's like a traditional  small chicken. I made it last night. It's so good. I roasted it at high heat using the Cafe Zuni  roasting recipe. It is so good. It's my favorite thing. Anyway, that's free. I'll give that to you  for free. This was a weird one from zippy.com, which says an SEO company. We studied 81,000  page titles. Google rewrote 61% of them. Google did? Yes, in the search results. Here's an example.  I don't understand this at all. Here's an example. Zippy product guides. There's an href title.  That's your title for your... Tags. Yeah, it's a tag in your HTML. They rewrote it to support  and product guides zippy SEO, which probably is more to what you want, but they're just doing it.  They're not asking. They're just doing it. Apparently, if it's too short, they'll rewrite it.  If it's too long, they'll obviously truncate it. Is this for ads? No, this is in the search results.  Search results. Ask Andrew about this. He must know about this. We mapped 80,000 titles by the  number of characters to determine the likelihood of Google rewriting each one. Google rewrites both  long titles and extremely short titles over 95% of the time. Where's the data from? Is it other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  metadata in the page that they just grab instead? That's an interesting question. They must.  It's a computer doing it, not a human. That was one hell of a job. Rewrite that headline, Joe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said, we found a number of common scenarios in which it became more likely for Google to  rewrite titles. I guess the moral of this is check. Look at your search results. Length,  if it's too long or too short, using the same keyword more than once. They'll just take that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  second version out. People were trying to do that to boost. That's probably where it started,  is they were trying to boost the SEO by repetition. They don't like title separators like dashes or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pipes. They'll take those out. Titles with brackets or parentheses. Identical blur or plate used across  many titles. Missing or superfluous brand names and more. That's actually helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's, I'm sure, the goal. Absolutely. It's helping you out, but at the same time,  dang, who gave them the right to just go in and change my stuff like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's another one where they took bracket updated 2022 and replaced it with parenthesis  2022 update. It's weird that they're doing this automatically. This is a good article, zyppy.com.  You could read it. It's in their blog. How you could use h1 tags. Google considers other  HTML elements when crafting page titles beyond title tags. Chief among these are the h1 tags.  So strategic use of h1 tags might solve that as well. Interesting. I just thought that was an  interesting insight into some of the things Google... Can you imagine the scale that Google does

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this? That they're doing that? It's amazing. How quick is this done? How fast does this go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  through their process? Oh, it's instant. It has to be because they're constantly updating.  Let's see. What else? Can I raise one? Oh, I'm sorry. It's not just a Stacyocracy.  It can be a Jeffocracy as well. What would you like to talk about? I meant to put these two

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  stories together in the rundown and I somehow screwed this up. I'm fascinated by the auto  driving cars. Two stories of different views. One is that, and I think we might have mentioned  this last week, I can't remember that a driver was charged. Yes, we did. Right. But then tie  that in a British law group now recommends immunity for drivers of self-driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I said this when we talked about the story last week. The guy who was charged with,  I think, vehicular manslaughter was using Tesla's self-driving. This was some years ago that he did  this and it went through a red light and killed a couple of pedestrians. But at the time he was  using it, even though Tesla said it's full self-driving, it didn't stop at lights. The  whole time I had my Model X, it wasn't supposed to stop at lights or stop signs or anything else.  If Tesla's to blame is by calling it full self-driving, it should be really driver  assist or, because on the highway it's great where there's no stop lights, it's great.  My Ford does the same thing, my Mustang does the same thing, but I would never take it on a city  street because it wouldn't stop. So I think he's right to charge this guy. He was misusing the  product, but Tesla does bear some culpability, I think. So the British didn't use the name.  It wasn't full self-driving in the, I'm sorry, it wasn't full self-driving. Tesla called it autopilot  in those days. But that still implies that something's going to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tesla really oversells what they're doing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I apologize. Not full self-driving. That's what Tesla's doing now. And it does stop,  theoretically, at stop lights. So that's the bigger question. And this guy's saying,  indemnity. The bigger question is, if you trust what full self-driving, that claims to be full  self-driving, and it isn't, and it does something stupid, are you liable or is it liable? That's an

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting question. Right. So the Brits, and here's my, get ready, my moral panic analysis of  this, is that they love trying to blame technology for everything. So, and so, I ruined my own punch  line there. But should I get the scary music? It's a reflex to say, let's blame the technology company  and make the driver blameless. Well, no, there's got to be some shared blame here in terms of,  if you have the ability to override, you see something going on, you're still responsible,  your car. And for the Brits to come on and recommend the law commission, the commission is  multiple, to recommend that drivers should not face regulatory legal sanctions if something goes  wrong. Okay, there's liability on the software that screws up, but there should be on the driver as  well. And this is a really odd thing to come out with. Well, it depends on how we view self-driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I'm in a, I mean, especially because the auto industry is pitching level five self-driving is  something that won't even have a steering wheel, right? We're all just hanging out.  So I feel like, and people are people. And this is why Tesla, I have so much ire for them for the  way they've pitched autopilot, because people, if you give them the opportunity not to pay attention,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's the concern. They're going to take an ad. Do we say that's okay? Or do we say, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're still responsible? That's why that guy should be charged. That's why the Brits are saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the Brits are saying it's unrealistic to expect someone who is not paying attention to the road  to deal with, for example, a tire blowout, T Y R E I love it when they do that. So pay attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so Stacey. What they're saying is they're saying for, they're, they're putting this there  because then the automotive people have to be much more realistic about what they're promising. I think  they're saying, look, the blame is not going to be on consumers. It's going to be on you guys.  Then they can't go to the consumers and sell them something that isn't actually.  Okay. I think I'm the sales side. Here's what Pete Buttigieg says. He's the secretary of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  transportation. He told the verge this, I keep saying this until I'm blue in the face.  Anything on the market today that you can buy is a driver assistance technology, not a driver  replacement technology. I don't care what it's called. We need to make sure that we're crystal  clear about that. Even if companies are not. And actually this is part of an article from the verge  talking about how the self-driving car industry is abandoning the term self-driving. They don't  want to use it anymore. Waymo, Ford, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo are saying, we're not going to use it.  The problem is Tesla is going to keep using it. And there's some concern that they'll kind of let  Tesla own that market, even if it's just a marketing term. But if Tesla is legally liable,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  then they might start. Maybe they will either stop selling it that way or they'll actually deliver  high quality stuff because they don't want to be. And they can't right now because it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really up to, and I'm trying to remember if it's the NTSB or NHTSA, but it's up to whatever  that federal aid, there is one of those two federal agencies. I think it's NHTSA that says  what is full self-driving, what's not. It's up to them to say that you can't use that term. They  could do that by the way, but federal regulation doesn't require a law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's like level five. That's not like normal language. So like level five is us sitting in our  car as a living room. Level four is everything up to level four is driver-assisted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's no such thing as level five right now.  Right.  And so to call it level five and apply full self-driving is level five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Tesla doesn't call it level five. They call it autopilot.  No, they call it full self-driving, FSD. That's what they're selling.  Okay. Yeah. But they don't call it quote, unquote level five, which is the actual words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. But doesn't full self-driving imply level five?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. If it's synonymous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would argue that, but a lawyer can get away saying, I mean, that's the issue. So you've got  to really- Is there something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like Waymo, several years ago, this is from the Verge article, Waymo considered developing an  advanced driver-assist system like Tesla's full self-driving version of autopilot, but ultimately  decided against it having become alarmed by the negative effects on the driver. Drivers would  zone out or fall asleep at the wheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there something in the bill of sales that's fine print that says, hey, you still need to be  alert when engaging these? Then they said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they still have the thing on the drivers so you have to touch the steering wheel every now and  then? Is that still a thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what's really interesting. I can't remember what- Somebody in the chat room will tell us.  We don't have FSTRIF Tesla's, but on the autopilot, yeah, you had to torque the wheel  a little bit. Ford, GM and others are coming out with their new self-driving where you don't have  to have your hands on the wheel, but in all those cases, there's a camera that's watching your eyes  to see that you're paying attention that you're there. I don't believe Tesla's doing that. So I'm  not sure how Tesla's verifying that the driver's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say they're not doing that.  I think that's-  Even in the signing of the contract that you allegedly read your contract and it says,  hey, once I engaged this, I am responsible for paying attention-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they pop up things on the- They tell you. Yeah. I mean, I don't think it's enough to put  it in the contract or the owner's manual. You've got to pop it up on the screen,  but they can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This gets to a problem we have, which is we're making driving more boring by doing this. This  little mid-level where highway driving is relaxed with a Tesla and highway. I've rented cars that  have this and it's fine, but as a person who I need to be really stimulated when I'm doing  anything to keep paying attention to it, so it is a real problem for me to actually zone out.  It's much easier for me to zone out if I'm in a half self-driving thing. So I get it. I think  it's a really dangerous time to be driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's what Tesla says right now. Autopilot and full self-driving capability are intended  for use with a fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to  take over at any moment. While these features are designed to become more capable over time,  the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That documentation doesn't cover them legally from a liability standpoint?  I don't know.  It's not in the UK.  I mean it says it right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're ever going to want to regulate technology, this is the one to regulate.  This is the one to set guidelines about.  Yeah, I'm amazed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you have to touch the wheel or not.  Does anybody have a FSD Tesla in the chat room? I'm curious. I get the sense that you do, but  I don't know. I guess nobody we know has an FSD.  Not seeing any answers.  Yeah, nobody we know has an FSD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Retcon5 has it in the Discord.  Oh, does he?  Yeah, take a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody trusts Retcon.  Yeah, here he is driving his car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the automated traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody trusts Retcon5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's the system right there.  Right there. Dog tired. Good night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I would hope there's some sort of mechanism.  There is in the GM and Ford's Blue Cruze and GM's something cruise. There's a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would hope that too, but I'm just thinking about our legal system and loopholes and all  of that stuff. If Tesla can just put something in writing just like that, it says, hey,  make sure you're doing the right thing when you're engaging this.  Be warned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Out of sync says Tesla uses the interior camera for FSD beta to watch the drivers and will turn  off FSD if they catch you not paying attention. You have to earn FSD at least right now. You have  to have a good driving record. You have to drive perfectly and all that stuff.  The other thing is both GM and Ford will only, they won't do it on city streets. They'll only

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do it on streets they've mapped out, highways. How do you know then? Does it look like a little  light come on saying you can use it now or it goes off your cat?  Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's fascinating? I'm just going to throw this out here because it was in one of the  short stories in that book that I read about AI and the future. This actually does happen already  with automated ferries. So we'll throw that out there too. One of the premises was that for  self-driving vehicles, when they hit weird situations, they automatically go to a remote  person driver. So like a remote drone driver.  Right. Yeah, yeah. We talked about that, right? Did we? Oh, no, that was on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the one where it's like a video game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So it was kind of like, yeah, the kids, in some cases it was actual kids doing a video game.  So the car had the ability to recognize when it no longer could handle a situation,  it would flip over to a remote control operator. So then the person driving the car still doesn't  have to pay attention, but we don't have to plan for every externality, which would be impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. They showed this as CES, the Halo, H-A-L-O self-driving car. And if the Halo gets confused,  I don't know what's going on. A remote driver can take over, which is kind of cool.  Yeah, we talked about that on Twitter, Halo.car, the electric car that drives to you, but there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  human driving it. And there's a company called Einride that's doing it for trucks in Norway.  And then there's another company that's doing some ferries up there where everything's remote  controlled until it isn't. And then it's, but- See, I told you I could make a living playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  video games. I told you, mom. What do you think of this WBEZ in Chicago, public radio,  we were taught, you said about four, what is it, five or 6% of people who listen to public-  Six to 12. Six to 12, that's a lot.  Six to 12, depending on the station. That never was enough for them to be rich.  But you know what changed? That podcasting, because they could sell ads on podcasts.  Public broadcasting ads on podcasts are very, very, much more expensive than Twitter.  They're very, very expensive. Really?  Oh, God, yeah. And their minimums are huge. And I don't know if you remember this, but in the days  of public broadcasting, you couldn't have a call to action. When you were buying it, you were  supporting public broadcasting. This broadcast of Doughton Abbey is brought to you by  Archer Daniels Midland, making the world safe for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We like s-  Claw and protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But it never could say call 1-800- call Archer Daniels Midland. But that all changed  with podcasts. And you'll note all the public radio podcasts have lots of ads in them. So  suddenly I think they're flush with cash. So that's the lead up to this. WBEZ just bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the Chicago Sun-Times. So obviously I'm the one who put this in the rundown. And it so happens  last night, I talked to Matt Moog, as in Moog Synthesizer, who is the CEO of WBEZ. And so now  he's in charge of a newspaper. We had a fascinating conversation about all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now that's a no cash deal, right?  So it's not their fat wallet that's buying this, but what are they giving them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. Well, it's going to keep the Sun-Times alive. The Sun-Times, they wanted to stop the Sun-Times  being bought by one of the evil players. And kind of the employees did that. This is a safe home  for it. Well, Tronk across the street, my old stomping grounds, the Tribune is now owned by  Alden, which is the worst hedge fund. And by full disclosure, I used to be an advisor to Digital  First, which was also owned by Alden. And left long ago. And so Tribune is pretty much hated now.  So there's a fascinating opportunity now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm wrong in saying this is a sign of the times that these public broadcasting is now so  flush they're buying newspapers. They didn't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they didn't buy it. They just took it over.  They're going to run, it's a large newsroom, it's twice the size of Tribune.  So I apologize, BEZ. I apologize.  And well, BEZ does really good stuff and they make a lot of money from podcasts.  Right.  This American life being primary there.  But the point is, the opportunity is to undercut Tribune and create a free news equality ecosystem  across Chicagoland, as we Chicagoans call it, and undercut the Tribune and undercut Alden.  So it's going to be fascinating to watch in this one-to-one city. And I broke, what is,  well, you bite your teeth. No, what are you doing? You learn something.  You bit your tongue.  No, I didn't do that.  That's when you don't comment.  I cut my teeth. I cut my teeth in Chicago journalism. I work for Chicago Today,  the paper that had no tomorrow, owned by Chicago Tribune. And when I was there,  there were four papers, Chicago Daily News, Sun Times, Tribune Today.  And now it's two, and it's going to be a newspaper war of a whole new fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sun Times was storied. Andy Anacca worked there, so did Roger Ebert.  It was a storied newspaper. But hard times, I remember they fired their entire photography staff.  Photography staff, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Murdoch owned it for a while.  Yeah.  Told them, I'll use a smartphone.  Is that?  Yeah.  Is that just like?  No, those were smartphones even.  They were equipping reporters who were pretty stupid about cameras, because I'm one of them,  with cameras to go out and shoot their own stuff. Like the one-man-man so-called in TV.  The Predator, they call that.  By the car the other day, because she was her producer or her camera person or everything.  So yes, it's going to be really interesting to watch.  She's okay, right?  Yeah, she was okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, she's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I didn't realize that was because she had to do it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, she set up the camera. She did everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so sad. I see that all the time, and I'm so sorry you had to work in media in these tough times.  Philadelphia Inquirer was donated to a nonprofit by its owner in 2016.  Salt Lake Tribune announced plans to become a nonprofit in 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem with journalists though is they think, oh good, we're not for profit now.  We have no problems. No, every person I know who runs a not-for-profit,  Matt Moog at WBEZ, his predecessor, Goli Shikha al-Islami, who just left WONYC,  these people are the smartest business people around, because they've got to do it under more  difficult circumstances, and they've got to become sustainable. So you can't just say,  ah, who cares about capitalism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, you have to pay the bills. You have to run the presses.  Someone's got to buy the paper and the ink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or well, actually not that. My recommendation would stop doing that as soon as...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone has to pay the journalists to go out and hunt stories.  Oh, that.  We have to eat too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Chicago Sun-Times is a dollar in the city, two dollars in the burbs.  That's weird.  The hardest working paper in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's kind of a weird...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's more expensive because you have to pay for distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they have to drive a truck out there.  That's fascinating. So I didn't realize it was... I just thought, oh, they just had a  lot of extra money and they thought, what can we do with this American life money?  It's a rescue thing.  Good. Good. And I think that's a good thing. I mean, it's not  the end of the line. By any means, you still have to make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a couple of Spotify stories that are interesting.  Yeah, Spotify in a lot of trouble because they're a hundred million dollar golden boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Joe Rogan keeps putting people on who say like, Eric Clapton who says you're being  hypnotized into taking the vaccine. And so there's a lot of heat to it.  Ask them about the vaccine. So he gets these people on that, Eric Clapton,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  maybe you don't ask Eric Clapton knowing his future.  No, no. The guy he brought on that's controversial was December 31st is the doctor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who claims he invented the mRNA vaccine who is saying you're being hypnotized with  subliminal messages. Clapton must have heard that episode.  That's what it... So Clapton is one of the people influenced by Joe Rogan.  Oh, okay. I was like, he could just not ask them about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. He wants to. He wants to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in fact, Neil Young, who is Provax has asked Spotify to remove his music.  And Spotify just announced they would.  Wow.  So they made a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They called his bluff. No, no, no. They called his bluff. They called his bluff.  Sure.  Neil, you don't want the money? Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's what it was more of. Yeah, sure. That's one less check for us to sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  270 physicians wrote...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  270 physicians wrote...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have all that data. So it's not like Spotify is like... I mean, if Taylor Swift said she...  If Taylor Swift had said this, they may have changed the...  I like that idea. That's a different story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on, Tay-Tay. Ball's in your court now.  Up to you.  270 doctors, physicians, and science educators. I like that. Educators.  Signed an open letter calling on...  You're an educated man. I can tell.  I'm educated. Open letters calling on Spotify to take action against misinformation.  This interview with a doctor, and I put that in quotes, named  Robert Malone. He's a virologist, says, I'm one of the architects of mRNA, and you are being hypnotized.  I think Joe says, I'm a comedian. This is entertainment. It's the same thing Hannity says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but he's not doing... He's doing it seriously. He knows he's influencing people. He's a troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, a lot of people under 30, including my son, are big fans,  and probably do believe this when they hear it.  The Green Bay Packers quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.  Aaron Rodgers.  Believed the vaccine information he got from Joe Rogan and parroted it back. Apparently so does  Eric Clapton and millions of other young men. So I understand why they're upset by this.  On the other hand, it's... Didn't we talk about this last week? Or maybe we did on  Twitter. That's the problem. I confuse the two. I mean, Spotify is going to say, well, it's free  speech. Rogan can say what he wants, right? How responsible are they for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We did talk about this last week. Spotify hired him and pays him. And so,  Spotify... Where I normally say that Facebook is not a medium, Spotify is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. April 23rd, 2021. Rogan said, if you're like 21 years old and you say to me,  should I get vaccinated? I'll go, no. He also promoted ivermectin, the dewormer, as a treatment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember that. Ivermectin controversy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Anyway. I don't know what's... So Spotify said, okay, buy Neil. That's interesting.  I didn't see that they had agreed. Neil Young said, you can have Joe Rogan or Neil Young,  you can't have both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You might find also this interesting down... All the way down to line 137, I found this slightly  interesting. A list of podcasts that Spotify trumpeted heavily that haven't been heard of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  since. Spotify just emailed me again asking for information on my podcast.  Good for you.  To feature it or something. Well, no, it was weird just because Spotify and Amazon Music both  came at me on the same day. And I was like, what is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're already on both. I'm sure we are. I mean, we're on any platform that takes RSS feeds.  That's not an endorsement of Spotify. Should we say, no, you can't have Neil Young and you  can't have Twit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no. I think it's interesting that they're pushing... They've clearly...  I don't want to see you scraping the bottom of the barrel because I'm not the bottom of the barrel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're clearly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're not.  ...surely fishing the barrel.  You're not Meghan and Harry. Let's put it that way.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean...  Meghan and Harry signed a multi-million dollar pound deal with Spotify in December of 2020.  They did one show and that's it.  Kim Kardashian West announced a Podispy podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're the professional, right?  Did you take the good drugs, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. June 2020. In March 2021, she hinted she was ready to release her episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing. This is from PodNews. PodNews.net.  Anna DuVernay's Array signed an agreement to produce a scripted and unscripted podcast January  2021. Stay tuned. Yet to be released.  Warner Brothers in DC signed a deal with Spotify for a set of original podcasts June 2020.  Batman Unburied announced casting June 2021.  No show.  It takes a long time to make a podcast. I will be the first to tell you,  this show, which we are recording in 2022, won't be out for three or four years.  So much work.  Post-production. There's a whole bunch of them. Wow.  Isn't that funny?  Mark and J Duplass.  Numerous dollars.  Did they pay all these people or did they just make an announcement?  I would hope they had better lawyers than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Maybe they did in advance and so if they didn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the interesting thing is Spotify's stock value went up when Megan and Harry announced  $836 million. So they're getting the benefit of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what Churnin signed a deal in September 2020, promising more than 250 shows to transform  into podcasts. They've yet to release any shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope they get only the building though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait, wait. Variety just published a story saying Gimlet Studio is hiring in-house producers  for Harry and Meghan Markle's weekly podcast. So basically they're like, clearly we can't rely  on them to do this. We must hire more people to help them.  And of course, Gimlet is owned by Spotify. We should point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of podcasts, if you want to produce it, they're looking for two producers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for a six-month contract position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Six-month contract. That doesn't sound very promising.  Yeah, I know. I'm like, oh.  Let's see how it goes. Did you watch Only Murders in the Building?  I have watched it. Yes.  That was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was fun.  Yeah, I didn't finish it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, don't spoil it. I might come back to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't tell Steve. It's okay. It's fine.  It's fun.  It was about podcasting, which I like.  That's what I'm saying. It's about podcasts.  True Crime podcasts.  A lot of good podcasts.  Are they still, by the way, that was all the rage last year, True Crime.  Is that still a thing?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, everyone still loves True Crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All the people we talked to said, where's your True Crime show?  I said, we're a tech network. We don't have that.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some crazy crimes in the tech world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, I literally came up with a treatment for a True Crime podcast we could  produce that is right down our alley.  Wow.  But then I thought, I'm not going to pander to these bozos.  So I didn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it the Broadcom Sex Dungeon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but that's intriguing.  No, it was-  He uses dungeon sounds.  It was about, and I kind of almost don't want to even talk about it.  Adrian Lamo, who was a hacker, I knew him pretty well in the day.  He was autistic. He was kind of a genius hacker.  Died. I think it was ruled a suicide,  but there were some very suspicious circumstances around it,  including the fact that he had taped onto his thigh a phone number and a name.  There were some very suspicious circumstances.  So I thought that'd be a good True Crime podcast, Who Killed Adrian Lamo?  And it's right up our alley.  We could talk about his hacking skills and all that.  So there, I just gave it away.  Somebody should-  Harry.  Somebody's got it now.  Meghan and Harry should do it. It'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that 256 encryption?  Can you imagine that conversation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's, yeah, I just, I don't know.  We are going to cover, Jason Howell has told me he will get up at seven in the morning  because that's when it is.  Pacific time, February 9th, the launch of the Galaxy S22.  Samsung Unpacked, or whatever they call it.  Samsung something.  Unpacked.  Unpacked? Is it unpacked again?  Yes, sir.  S22, 22 Plus, Galaxy S22 Ultra.  It's interesting in the Galaxy Unpacked, the epic standard S.  Then in one of the announcements they said it's a notable product announcement.  And of course they are killing the note.  So we think this will be a note-like phone, maybe with a stylus and all that.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like eight minutes later, Stacy's like, oh, I get it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I get it.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, did you all see, what's the deal?  Because I read some rumors about Google doing a foldable phone and you know how I'm obsessed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we've been reading these rumors for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is there anything new?  I thought I saw something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, there was a rumor that they might announce it this year along with a 6A,  maybe at the same time.  But that's just rumor.  I think somebody saw something in an FCC database.  I think that's what kind of led to.  Prompted it?  All right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I mentioned it in the rundown I produced a couple of weeks ago and we skipped it.  Oh, because it was that interesting.  It's because I wasn't here to be obsessed about the phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's always so much good stuff in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't get to it all.  I try, but I don't.  North Korea maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's so much good stuff in the rundown.  Yeah.  We always talk about Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't yet.  You know what?  We haven't talked about Facebook in a week.  I know.  Today's not true.  Have you noticed that?  That I am being influenced by somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, that's not true.  That's not fair.  It's not true.  There's just not much story there.  They're kind of boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  North Korean internet taken down by cyber attackers DDoSed right after their missile launch.  All of a sudden the internet went down for six hours Wednesday morning.  It came a day after North Korea conducted its fifth missile test.  Not sure if it's related.  Hackers also took the Belarusian railway system offline  in an attempt to slow down the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  And they said it.  They admitted it.  Yep.  We infected them with ransomware to slow them down.  This is a new kind of activist hacking.  May I call it activism?  This is armies without countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Without gunpowder.  Yeah.  Very interesting.  And good guys and bad guys both that we know from our election hacking and all that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seoul-based NK Pro, a new site that monitors North Korea, reported that log files and network  records showed websites in North Korean web domains largely unreachable because North Korea's DNS  system stopped communicating the routes the packets should take.  A DDoS attack.  DDoS.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not surprised.  I've thought this for years.  I think I gave an interview like 15 years ago saying hackers are going to be the next  front line of cyber warfare because they've got the skills.  And either nation states will use them as they are or they will act on their own  as groups like Anonymous have done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You clearly did not read my book pick from several episodes ago.  Annaline Nowitz is autonomous.  No.  And this is How They Tell Me the World Ends by Nicole Perloff.  Oh.  That was literally what it was all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a good book.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's like, oh, no, no, I did read it.  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just parroting her point of view.  Manufacturers have less than five days supply of some computer chips, according to the US  Department of Commerce.  This just in time thing is not working out so well.  Wafer thin inventories leave factories vulnerable to shutdowns if shift deliveries are interrupted  by anything like weather or COVID-19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I've also seen that the production seems to be back up on chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what's happening is they're building fabs like crazy.  Intel's got a big one, $20 billion fab they're building in Ohio.  TSMC is building in Arizona.  But the problem is it takes a while, like a year or two to build a fab.  So according to the Commerce Department...  There's another problem.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the second problem is not only do they take a long time to come online,  but a lot of the shortages aren't on the most advanced chips, which is what these fabs are  going to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The legacy knows, right?  Yeah.  They're not even solving that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if y'all care about this, I'm just going to pitch.  I'm sorry.  Tomorrow's show, we talk for like 15 minutes about it.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good.  No, that's a great pitch for the IoT show with Stacey and Kevin.  Survey respondents to the Washington Post said they didn't see shortages going away  in the next six months.  Some say it could last into well into 2023.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so the Commerce Department is also...  Some of this is a little self-serving.  I know.  Surprise.  Politics, self-serving.  The Biden administration is pushing the CHIPS Act, which is a $52 billion allocation for funds  for chip development to happen here in the US.  And so that's part of what they're doing.  Some of this...  Some chip inventories, historically they have kept pretty limited inventories because the  supply chains haven't been messed up.  So in some ways, this is not a story.  And the solutions that we're proposing aren't quite the best solutions.  Simply because, like I said, we don't need new fabs.  I mean, yes, we do need new fabs, but what we really need are more transparent supply  chains. And what we're undergoing is a shift in the way the supply chain for chips is going to  be managed, I guess, is the way to think about it.  So instead of just like going to the store and being like,  oh, I want all these chips.  Now we're having to like order our chips in advance.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, did y'all go away?  Oh my God.  This happens all the time at parties when I talk about semiconductors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People just leave.  You need another drink?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks.  Oh, sorry.  Let me right back.  Keep your spot.  Keep your space.  Don't change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should do a change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, can I do a tease?  Can I do a tease?  Tease before the change log.  Yeah.  When we come back from the change log.  Yes.  And probably a commercial too.  Yes.  We could wait this long.  Yes.  We're going to find a musical that aunt actually likes.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now it's time for the Google.  Is it on TikTok?  Change log.  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You no longer have to say, hey, Google, to get the assistant to shut up.  This is an old story.  I don't know why the first just discovered this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I think that they just did a blog post.  I almost put it in.  I said, no, this is old.  They did a blog post that says, by the way, remind people, hey, you can do that.  I've been saying stop forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not.  You can just, when the alarm's going off or a timer's going off, you just say stop.  So, okay.  Ah, I see the difference.  Google's smart home devices have had a version of this feature for years.  Oh, no, no, no.  This is the verge just not using this thing.  Because, no, you've always been able to say.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of people don't know all the features.  So there's always an audience for when you discover something to be like, hey, guys,  I just discovered this.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem with a change log is sometimes it's not really a change.  There's no change.  Pixel's big at a glance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's finished.  There's no new Google.  It's over.  It's not going to change anymore.  It's over.  Rename this.  It is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  The stop worked for timers.  ScooterX says it is new because now it works for other things.  Okay.  It's still really a boring.  It always worked for alarms.  Not always, but it's been working for a while because I've been shouting at my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like when I ask Google, like, tell me about Abraham Lincoln.  You just say stop.  Abraham Lincoln was born and you're like, oh, yeah, stop.  If you're bored, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can for weather.  Okay.  That's the biggest difference is it stop has been expanded to stop it  in more situations.  And they've been rolling this out on the Pixel 6 with quick phrases.  Quick phrases let you do certain things without saying, hey, you know who.  The feature that's rolled out according to the verge on Google smart home devices is in a universal  stop making noise command for your smart speaker.  You still have to say, hey, Google, if you want to stop a song.  You can't just shout stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  All right.  Would stop already work better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like stop.  What?  You know, Lisa swears at it.  In fact, she says.  And she wasn't able to demonstrate it for me, so it might've been a one off,  but she swore at the Google and the Google said that's not nice and you shouldn't swear at me.  At which point she swore even louder and it said, do you want to file a report?  And she said, yes, I do.  And she said, I want to tell you guys back at Google.  It's a machine.  It's okay to yell at it.  You don't have to be polite.  No, you go.  You agree with that, right?  You don't have to be polite to a virtual assistant.  It's just a.  I am polite.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is coming after her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're polite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I, yeah, I'm polite to normal people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So be polite to your robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, basically if I'm talking and I've yelled at madam, a, I,  and sometimes I yell at Google when it goes on and on.  So stop is very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in general, like if I'm defaulting person, yeah, just, yeah, I'm talking to somebody.  Yeah.  I'm a nice person.  I'm nice to my little bots.  But if you know what, if you say, no, and if you say it's not the end of the world either.  So don't, don't, don't, don't give me that hard time.  Google, right.  Big pixels, big at a glance upgrade.  Are we still talking about the pixel six?  Good Lord starts rolling out with more Google clock and fitness integrations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which fitness integrations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your assistant shows you what you need right when you need it on your home screen and lock screen.  Bedtime, your upcoming bedtime.  Timer and stopwatch info from clock activity info from your fitness app.  So go into your at a glance settings and you'll see at least three new settings.  Google could, should be adding several more capabilities to at a glance at a store,  shopping lists and Google pay rewards cards, connected devices, connection status,  and battery info for your Bluetooth devices.  Apple does that nicely with their AirPods doorbells.  So as you, oh, I will like that one.  I can see who's at the door.  I think we talked about that last week.  Flashlight.  This is good.  Do you really need a reminder when your flashlight is on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess you do turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And a safety check countdown from the personal safety app.  So get ready.  Look at this.  Here's, here's a QR code with your flight information on the attic.  Lance.  That's kind of neat.  So nine to five, Google says more common.  Check your at a glance settings.  Google chat.  Yes, there is such a thing as rich text formatting on the web rolling out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who uses Google chat?  Oh, just somebody.  I use Google chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you?  I'm well, you like that.  You can make a bold word or an italic word or underline it or that kind of thing.  That's cool.  That'll be everyone.  I'll get it in the next 15 days.  Turned on by default with no opt out settings for admin.  So stick it.  YouTube music will soon work for supervised kid accounts enrolled with a family link.  Do you use family link, Stacy?  No, probably not.  Kids under 13.  YouTube music.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't use YouTube music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this was a feature that Google Play Music had.  If you were under 13, you could have your own library.  Now YouTube music will be adding this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we just have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the Google change.  Anything else before we get to our picks of the week?  We're we're getting on.  Did you see Mark Cuban?  I don't know how long he's going to stay with this.  Because he doesn't tend to stay with it.  The drug thing?  Yeah, he started his own online pharmacy.  Pharmacy thing.  Where he's charging basically for generic drugs a penny or two above the cost.  I think he's going to trouble with the name, the Cost Plus Drug Company.  There is a business called Cost Plus, but okay.  But it's the world market.  Well, yeah, but it is a market.  I looked it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no insulin, which would be a real benefit to the world.  And the price differentials aren't that great in most of what I looked at.  Okay, here's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's 15% above generics plus the price of shipping.  And it may not be that the price is much greater in many cases.  Because like a lot of like Walgreens and many of the supermarket chains as part of their  pharmacy efforts, they've been doing what he's doing basically.  They've just been doing it for their pharmacy.  Right.  Okay, go on.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, so I don't know.  I mean, he's making it like a crusade, not like a business.  Like I'm going to, he says, I'm not going to make any money at this.  I'm just a good person saving the world.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  More power to him.  It drives people to think about this issue.  There are a couple drugs that are actually like one of my mom's drugs is actually like  $50 cheaper per month, which is really, I mean, that's great for her.  That's like going out to dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I understand if you don't have insurance that covers this stuff, then it can be very  expensive.  Does your mom not have insurance or is it cheaper for her to buy it out of pocket?  Sometimes it's cheaper to buy it out of pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  And it's also just easier in some cases.  Sometimes insurance doesn't pay for certain drugs.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Insurance can be a pain.  Interesting.  Interesting.  Interesting.  Do you want to laugh at Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to laugh at Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to do a Facebook story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we want to end the show.  Oh, okay.  No, the meta ad for Horizon.  The meta ad is profunny, I thought.  For Horizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Horizon.  Not meta has built an AI supercomputer or meta is killing DM?  No, no, line 48.  You know, we do have a Facebook section.  Here it is.  The meta ad for Horizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You started the quick takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very confusing to know where to put this.  What is Horizon?  So we know.  Oh, we saw this ad when this came out ages ago.  We did?  Yeah.  No legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No legs.  What is it with no legs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the more modern versions of this have legs, don't they?  The one Mark showed us had legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think this whole idea has legs.  This isn't Kristen Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a fake Kristen Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it Kristen Bell?  Yeah, this is offensive on so many levels.  Let's go to the end of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we're not going to talk about Facebook's supercomputing, I'm not here for it.  Well, you can talk about that if you'd like.  Why are they building a supercomputer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're building the world's fastest computer for AI.  Why are they doing that?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your fault, Stacey.  Why, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why?  We'll be right back with more in just a little bit.  Our show today brought to you by Compiler.  It's a podcast, original podcast from Red Hat.  Discusses tech topics, big, small, and a little bit weird, a little bit strange.  You may be familiar with Red Hat's other podcast, Command Line Heroes,  another of our sponsors, which we love.  This one, hosted by Angela Andrews and Brent Siminoe,  is I think a brilliant idea for a podcast.  I say that because I'm very jealous that they thought of it first.  What they've done is they've actually started to look at the things that Red Hatters are asking  in their messaging platform, whatever it is that they use, probably Slack or something like that,  questions that they go, that's interesting.  What do you think?  Technology can be big, bold, bizarre, complicated.  Compiler unravels industry topics, trends, and the things you've always wanted to know about tech  through interviews with people who know it best.  On the show, you'll hear a chorus of perspectives from diverse communities beyond the code.  Red Hatters tackling big questions like what is technical debt,  what are tech hiring managers actually looking for, which I thought was quite interesting.  Episode two, what can video games teach us about edge computing?  The internet is a patchwork of international agreements and varying infrastructure,  but there's something coming to change the way we connect.  In this episode of Compiler, hosts explore what edge computing could mean for people  who enjoy video games and what this form of entertainment could teach us about the technology.  Episode nine, are tech hubs changing?  Usually you go to Silicon Valley or San Francisco if you want to get a career in tech,  but that's definitely starting to change.  The hosts of Compiler speak to a few of the change makers who are thinking outside  of the physical and social dimensions we've come to associate with innovation.  You may not need legs in the future, right?  To learn more about Compiler, just go to red.ht slash twit.  That's their URL shortener, red.ht slash twit.  It's really well produced.  I love it that it has a variety of voices talking about the topic.  Not all in agreement.  It's a very nice kind of survey.  New episodes just came out.  You can download them at any time.  So if you've heard the early episodes as I have,  maybe it's time to go back and listen to some of the newer ones.  Listen to Compiler on Apple podcasts or anywhere you listen to your podcasts.  I will put a link on the show's notes page there so you can click that as well at twit.tv.  We thank Compiler for their support.  It's nice when one podcast can help another podcast along.  Learn more at red.ht slash twit.  You can listen there as well.  I will put a link to the latest episode up on the show notes.  Thank you, Red Hat.  Thank you, Compiler.  Welcome to the family of podcasters.  Here's the picture of Elizabeth from Knoxville holding an onion  in her cloth while she was claiming to have been maced.  I was maced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was maced.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can we just mention the keyboard scarf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the scarf, Elizabeth.  Nice choice.  She looks at the onion, dabs her eye with it, then says, I was maced

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with onions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Onions are a cure for being maced.  To be honest, even if she was maced while storming the Capitol, I don't think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It deserves it.  I don't think that's such a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could have been shot for violating the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Breaking into the federal building.  If you were a black man, you'd be shot.  Oh yeah, you'd be gone, long gone.  No onions involved.  Let us start with Stacey's thing.  You want to talk about your range?  I'm going to give you a plug because you did actually do a good article about your  brand new range, which you talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show.  Actually, maybe it was last week was your pick of the week.  Last week.  Your smart range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I move quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you do.  I'm really jealous because I really want an induction cooktop.  This is actually about the pan you use with your new range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So today's thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She can't lift it because she's got a dead arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm only using my left hand and it's a heavy pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that is the big one.  Look at that.  I have the home set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're strong, Stacey.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's lighter without the lid, I got to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The lid is, well, it's just a heavy, so it's just a stainless pot.  It's a nice pan.  It's a good pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Looks like a pot.  Testen actually makes really good just regular pans, but these are the new testing cues.  And this is what we pay attention to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I can't, I might not be able to hold it in an undercut.  This guy right here is where the battery goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, my battery in your pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this pan connects to my phone and my range via Bluetooth.  And what it does is on its own, it doesn't do anything, but on the proper induction cooktop,  what it will do is it measures the, it talks to the range, the cooktop,  and it has sensors in the pan that measure the temperature that the pan has reached.  So what you can do is you can tell it either, A, I want to maintain a 240 degree pan  for clarifying butter.  And it will do that for you.  Or you can alternatively say, I want to cook chicken.  And there are pre-programmed recipes that it will just cook the chicken for you.  So we have made, Jeff, this is for you, Cacio e Pepe.  Their recipe was a little rich for my blood, but it turned out perfectly.  And we did have some snafus.  So the pan only connects to one account, which I think is a problem because  in my family, we all cook.  So we need to connect it to our iPad and we need to connect the range to our iPad.  So if you don't have like a dedicated home computer, it's kind of an issue.  So that's thing one that we learned.  But my husband freaking loves it.  He loves it because he is like the most, I cook by throwing stuff in and smell.  He cooks by following the recipe exactly.  And sometimes his recipes don't turn out always so great simply just because  they only said to cook it for 10 minutes.  I'm like, but it clearly isn't done.  And he's like, but it said 10 minutes.  So this is helpful for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stubborn engineer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, the computer told me it's done.  That's fine.  I'll take it off.  So Stacey, I don't understand one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The pot is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's a lot going on here.  That wasn't a, that wasn't like a, you're stupid.  That was like, there is a lot happening in this situation.  Oh my, oh my.  I know, no, sorry.  That was not meant to be an assault on you.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this time you've probably gone through it, but I, but I, but I, but hey, I'm on Twitter  the whole time.  So, so why would, why would the pan need to be smart?  Isn't just the stove all you need to be smart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No needs to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you want the pan knows how hot it is.  The stove doesn't know how hot it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So does the stove.  The stove is like an extra insurance policy.  But every pan is a little bit different.  Right?  So you're dealing with both the pan, the environment, the food that's in it.  And the pan has to be connected to the stove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right?  You have a pan compatible stove for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the key is you have to have a stove that's smart enough.  Heston, the Heston Q's originally came with a smart single burner cooktop.  Right.  Right.  And you could still buy that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have that.  So like, I'm not done with questions yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Tell me the cool thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here, let me answer.  So this is a good use case.  When you're heating oil to fry anything, let's say chicken, you've got your oil at a set  temperature.  But when you add the chicken, it's going to lower the temperature of the oil a little bit.  And the pan can tell that and have the oven compensate.  So that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's cool.  Go.  The oven or the cooktop?  I'm sorry.  The cooktop.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  Yes.  You threw that in to test me.  I know what you were doing.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not on Twitter.  You pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what sensors are in the pan?  What is it measuring?  Just temperature alone or anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe it's just temperature.  Okay.  That's all that I have seen it measuring.  But if someone else knows, like I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then last question, which is a lie, I'll do one more.  So how do you, is there a way to check its progress?  Right?  Because your microwave tells you something on the screen on it.  Your stove, does your stove have a screen that tells you the chicken is almost done?  Or does your iPad do that?  Or how do you know what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your microwave just tells you how much time is left that you set.  Well, it's some information.  That doesn't say the meaning is done.  It's something.  Well, if you want to do that, just turn on your stopwatch when you throw something.  But the microwave tells me when it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How does the stove tell me when it's done?  Well, finished.  All I did was what you told me to do and you're in control.  Now the pan and the stove have taken over from you.  You're now-  I'm so sorry, Mr. LaPorte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, Miss Stacy.  How do you know when the chicken's done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a Heston Q app in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. That's a simple question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was just really killing you, man.  I was just going to let it happen.  I'm like, I'll just answer later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Thank you, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you all done now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Oh, wait, I should tell you.  So this pan, sorry, one more thing.  This pan is, I think 2.99.  I got it on sale for 2.55.  This is a chef's pan.  There are five different pan options you can choose  based on the sorts of things you want to cook.  It's not a non-stick chef's pan,  which I'm feeling kind of sad about, but-  I don't think they have any, as I remember.  They have one non-stick fry pan now.  Do they?  It's an 11-inch fry pan that's non-stick.  That's our next purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I have those Heston Qs and I used them a few times.  And then I just thought, I know how to cook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not as excited about this as my husband is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. He likes to be told what to do probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the June oven. He loves that thing.  I mean, I love it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lisa came around on the June.  She doesn't like it that you have to tap like three times to cook something.  Yeah.  It does such a good job on the Brussels sprouts.  She kind of came around on the June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it kill them beyond a shadow of recognition?  No.  The only way to cook them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, it's so perfect.  She grew up with boiled Brussels sprouts and told me, I will never eat a Brussels sprout.  And then once we tried this nice roasting thing and they're crispy and they're delicious,  she said, oh, I love it.  She makes it all the time, which is too bad because it really stinks up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really cruciferous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cruciferous writ large.  Jeff, do you have a number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I kind of gave it before, but I'll do another one.  I'm going to continue a rant from last week.  Yes.  Even wordle.  I hate wordle.  Oh, I'm really enjoying it.  Why don't you play it?  Then you wouldn't hate it.  Because it spams.  No, I'm not doing that.  You're not going to pull me into your cult.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this primely?  Tell me it's primely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no.  So a bot came along to say,  Wordle later.  Yeah.  To terminate wordle.  Yes once said the bot, people don't care about your mediocre linguistic escapades.  To teach you a lesson, tomorrow's word is.  And Twitter killed the bot.  Not all the damn spam.  No, they should because that's cheating.  Twitter got that completely wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, how did it know what the word for tomorrow was?  That's what everybody knows.  Because an algorithm can do it.  It found the list probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, Kim Zetter said that you could just, because it's written in JavaScript,  you can just all, you can show the.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can cheat, but why would you do that?  You're only cheating yourself.  Because it's a dumb game that spams everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, games don't spam, players spam.  People.  Yeah.  The game is not spamming nobody.  You got to talk to people in your Twitter stream who keep spamming their wordle.  I do.  And they talk back to me, which I don't like.  You've never seen my wordle score.  John's never tweeted his wordle score.  I've never tweeted my wordle score.  I got yesterday's in two.  Oh.  You just did it, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just did it anyway.  That was a live spam wordle spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I got it in two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty impressive.  But you know what?  I have to think when you get it in two, that's just luck.  Let's be honest.  What's your first word, John?  What's the word you start with?  Do you have a regular word you start with?  It was from Twit.  What did Ashley Esquethis tell you?  Audio.  Audio is his first word.  I always use audio.  Because he uses a lot of vowels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the word yesterday was sugar.  So I got the A and the U and the U is in the right place.  So I couldn't put the A anywhere else.  I put the A where it goes and sugar was the obvious word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got sugar, but it took me four.  Oh, what did I start?  What did I start?  What's your start?  What word do you start with, Stacey?  What's the first word you use?  I don't play wordle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  Yay, Stacey.  I knew I liked you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're a member of Club Twit, you may be happy to know that there is a wordle group  in our Club Twit where you can post your wordle scores.  And what have you done?  Oh, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you know what?  Post them there.  Who did not put that there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By popular demand.  I'm happy with that.  Yeah.  It's actually kind of fun.  Look at your state.  Did you all see Primal?  They're so cool.  What's Primal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Google Primal.  P-R-I-M-E-L.  Oh, shut up, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's prime numbers.  It's prime numbers.  Okay, here we go.  Primal.  So you have to what?  Come up with a prime number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  Every guess has to be prime?  Every guess has to be prime and you have to find the prime number.  That's hard.  Oh yeah, no, it's for like the hard.  But you know what?  Our audience, I can see people in our audience.  Guess the prime in six tries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't do that.  You won't see that.  Tweet it.  But I could write a program to do it.  Maybe I'll do that.  Yeah.  Oh, look at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some people have generated, you could use a list of prime numbers.  I just thought, you know, it feels very engineering, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I can see next week's show.  Leo is going to be showing us the code he does.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to do a Primal Solver.  That's easy.  Trivial.  Trivial.  You could probably very easily generate the entire set of five-digit prime numbers.  Oh yeah, and the Solver would be a lot easier than trying to solve the words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Solver would be doing it in your head is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to.  I'll just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot more words than there are five-digit prime numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you're looking for it, y'all, it's prime EL.  So primal.  Yeah, like prime numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's at convergent converged.  That YT slash primal.  Yeah, primal solver.  That'd be fun.  Thank you, Jeff, for your whatever the hell that was.  Rant.  Rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Five.  The number was five for five letters.  Five because of wordle.  And troll is a five-letter word.  That's what everybody who sends me this wordle crap is doing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like wordle.  It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will do it first thing in the morning just to get my brain started.  I think it's a good way to start.  Antpruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's your pick of the week this week?  My pick of the week is a podcast I was a guest on.  It's called Because We Make, hosted by a friend of mine I've known for quite a while now.  His name is Vincent Ferrari and his co-host, Ethan Carter.  And Vincent says to you, Mr. Jarvis, he says hello because he joked about checking in on you with  some funny Twitter conversations of yore, if you will.  But he says to tell you hello.  But yeah, I was a guest on that.  And we just talked about some of the stuff I do here at TwiD and my show and just  being a maker.  Content creator stuff.  I love their show because it's, yes, it's geared towards makers.  I'm not a maker.  I couldn't tell you the first thing about a, I don't know, bandsaw and butt joints and none of  that.  But I still listen to it.  It's just good conversations that they have every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you want more bandsaws and butt joints, becausewemake.com.  That's the way.  The fact that you even know the word butt joint, you're way ahead of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard him mention it on that show.  And I'm like, what are you talking about?  This is butt joints and huh?  Huh?  Tap and die.  I don't know any of that stuff.  Tap and die, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tap and die.  And here's the pictures.  You put this up of the reporter getting the poor predator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because he's talking about the news folks earlier today and the dedication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're producers, they're editors, and they're reporters all at the same time.  So she sets up her camera.  She turns on her lights.  She gets the microphone.  She goes on the other side of the camera.  Camera's recording.  Or is she live?  I guess it's just on live.  It was water being break and cold temperatures.  So she's out.  Poor woman at WSAZ, Channel 3 in Dunbar, West Virginia.  She's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's her last week.  She's about to move up to a bigger station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  About time.  And there's a car just runs right into her.  She runs right into her camera.  I shouldn't laugh.  That's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I just got hit by a car, but I'm okay, Tim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The camera's on its side.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We're all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, being local news, they stay right with the shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got hit by a car in college too, just like that.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not her first time.  It's okay.  It was funny.  She's been hit more than once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This poor woman.  Isn't this awful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then she has to set this up again.  Wait what she says to the driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are so sweet and you're okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that nice of her?  She forgives the driver immediately because she's standing in the road.  But that was a dumb move.  Tomorrow morning when she wakes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, she's going to know.  Oh gosh.  I hope she gets a better job.  There you see she's moving the camera.  I hope she gets a better job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She did already.  Yeah.  She's got tons of attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but this is, I mean, one of the things I thought was interesting about this story  is this is so common now and they were talking about like some female reporter didn't want  to go out at like 11 o'clock to report on a rape in that area.  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you shouldn't have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is notorious.  You get a hurricane.  And who has to stand out there in the hurricane?  The weather guy from channel four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Location shots are worthless.  Yeah, we've talked about that for years.  There's no reporting there.  It drives me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing there.  It's just good pictures.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a visual medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One last plug for the hardhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  I just wanted to give him a shout out and say good luck.  This past weekend was supposed to be opening weekend for track and field indoor season for him.  And he sent me a picture.  Actually, he sent the family a group of pictures.  When I saw it, it just made me cry.  He's running for the University of the Pacific.  I was like, God dang, man.  That's my boy.  Great school.  But yeah, I just want to wish him well and say, hey, keep kicking ass, man.
