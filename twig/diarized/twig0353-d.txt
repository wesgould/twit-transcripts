Of course, this is Google I.O. and coming to us from the Googleplex in Mountain View.  We've got a great team. We'll start with Jason Howell,  who was of course the host of All About Android.  Last night had some great Google developers on the show and was at the keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi Jason. How's it going Leo? It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Today TNT will be hosted by Megan because you're going to spend the rest of the week there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well I'm here through Friday.  Normally at Google I.O. they give you obviously the talks  and there's a lot of people here to talk to and everything.  They also usually have a big demonstration area for things  and I'm told that there isn't a whole lot of that going on this year.  That's where I normally spend a lot of my time.  So we'll see what happens over the next couple days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember in years past at Moscone there were booths  and very interesting things to do and stuff.  It's a different Google I.O. We'll talk about that in just a second.  Also here Jeff Jarvis wearing his schwag.  He's got a do-rag and sunglasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a do-rag, it's a goo-rag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a goo-rag from Google.  But is there something particularly googly about it or is it just?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well see I was amused that Mother Google sent us all emails before we got here saying  children it could be very chilly Mountain View in the morning.  You should all bring good sweaters.  They said bring a thick sweater.  I thought well then give us a hoodie dammit.  So instead they gave us sunscreen and this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well you need that because this is the first time I can remember  a major tech keynote outside out of doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nature, we don't geeks don't do nature.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good to have you.  By the way, they're all in the same room.  So occasionally you'll hear some cross chatter.  You know who's not in the same room but has joined us and I'm so thrilled.  Gina Trapani is here.  Hi Gina.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Coming to you live from New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From New York in the white room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, the white room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually she's at her new place of employ.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am at Postlight.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now tell us.  OK.  So when we came out to New York you said just on the QT I've had a very interesting interview.  And so the good news is what is Postlight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Postlight is a new digital agency in New York.  So we do client services.  We build apps and websites and platforms and all sorts of little digital things for clients.  So some really cool interesting clients.  It was founded by Paul Ford who people here might know him.  He's the author of that amazing Bluebird Business Week piece, What is Code?  And Rich Ziati who is a founder of Readability.  And yeah, it's a really, really fun team.  I'm having a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very cool.  Postlight, P-O-S-T-L-I-G-H-T dot com.  And you're the CTO now.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a director of engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Director of engineering.  Even better.  Well, congratulations on the new thing.  Now does this mean that ThinkUp is still going on or what's the status with ThinkUp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ThinkUp is alive and well and going strong as is MakerBase.  We did write a little bit about ThinkUp on our blog, blog.thinkup.com.  You know, we have sort of reckoned with the fact that ThinkUp isn't the business model for it as a standalone product.  It doesn't work.  So we're trying to figure out, you know, how can we keep ThinkUp around and maybe pass it on to someone who can keep it going and maybe as an add-on to a different product or as an additional offering.  We're trying to figure that out.  But we wrote about it on the blog, blog.thinkup.com.  In the meantime, the services, you know, we're running ThinkUp.  We're working on it.  I'm keeping that going, Anil and I, and MakerBase as well.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I love both of them.  I think they're both great ideas.  Thank you.  One must gain gainful employment.  And it sounds like Postlight is going to be a lot of fun for you.  And of course, we love having Gina here because she was original member of the cast.  And I'm hoping we can get more time with you, although it sounds like as director of engineering, you're going to be just as busy, if not more so.  But we also love having a developer, especially for Google I.O.  So we appreciate you spending some time with us today.  Thanks for having me.  Also from the Googleplex, Mr. Matt Cutts is here.  Great to have you, Matt.  Oh, you shaved the beard.  Good to see everybody.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm good. Unmute the unmute Matt's mic.  We had muted it.  Matt's mic is muc.  There you go.  Muced. Matt's mic is muced.  You can probably talk now, Matt.  Anyway, no, no, we hear him now, Kara.  It's OK.  We got him.  Yeah.  Hey, thanks for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Happy to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was kind of exciting, wasn't it?  This is a first time ever at the Shoreline Amphitheater.  Can you remember anybody an outdoor keynote ever before?  I don't think I think we've ever done something like that.  I know Google hasn't.  I think Moses was the last time.  Moses. Yes.  I have some commandments for you.  That was the last time we had an outside keynote.  These are the thinnest, lightest commandments we've ever made.  So let's start with Matt.  Now, I know you're a Google employee,  but contextualize what we saw today for us.  What does it all mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I really like that Google is not giving up on trying to figure out getting messaging right.  And, you know, some of the stuff like Allo, I think is really interesting  because you've always got people who can criticize and they can say, oh, it's going to do this or what about this or that.  But I think it's really promising to see Google really not willing to give this up yet.  We're going to try to figure out what makes the right sense for Android and for iOS.  How do you get a platform?  And then there was also this underlying backbone of artificial intelligence and machine learning where,  whether it's Google Home or Allo, all the way through a lot of the different things,  you could see Sundar mentioning that.  And as a web guy, I was really happy to hear him call out progressive web apps and accelerated mobile pages  because, you know, to have the CEO saying, hey, this is important and here's the kind of speed improvement you can get.  I think that's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually stand corrected.  Windows 95 launch was an outdoor launch, I think, at a big Seattle event.  But what Windows 95 launch had, which the Google launch did not have,  was a bunch of geeks biting their lower lips and dancing in the most ungainly fashion possible.  That is unfortunate.  Thank you very much.  We're not going to dance.  No dancing. No dancing.  No, I agree with you.  In fact, I've been wondering for a while what Google was going to do in messaging.  You know, here's Facebook announcing bots.  Apple's coming on strong with messages.  Google kind of looked like they were hangouts, was kind of abandoned.  When I got my Google 5 phone and said, oh, don't use hangouts, use messages.  And I thought, well, what are you doing, Google?  You're leaving this on the table.  So, in fact, I would say overall, and I'd love to hear what you guys think, my sense of this is Google's in a challenging position  because they're kind of capitalizing on something that's been going on for 10 years, this machine learning platform, artificial intelligence.  It's getting smarter and smarter, but it's not like a revolutionary new product.  So it's not like they can say, hey, as Apple might, we've had this under the covers for 10 years.  Here's machine learning.  No.  But what I do think is that they're finally stepping forward and saying, you know, when I see other companies doing things with bots and messaging,  Google didn't jump on that bandwagon.  They worked on it and they had something very compelling with I think Aloe and we'll talk about it.  Same thing with, you know, I was looking at my Amazon Echo.  Gosh, you know, where's Google in all this and Apple and Microsoft and everybody else?  And they've responded.  And I think so.  These are these are evolutionary products, but they are a very exciting product.  You agree, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think it is interesting that Google is playing catch up, let's be honest, to Amazon with Echo now home to Facebook with WhatsApp.  And now Aloe and to FaceTime with Duo.  So that feels a little yucky that it's catch up.  On the other hand, if you think of the advantages that Google has in these areas that the it knows more about me and my needs.  It has the the artificial intelligence at work.  It has certainly the national language processing and the database of language that beats anybody.  And so what's really important today, I think, is Google Assistant and the fact that it it's kind of the overarching capability that's in all of these products.  What I don't understand is I guess in a sense, Google had to start Aloe.  So it had a platform for that.  But I would imagine that that that underlying intelligence, Google knows you, Google will anticipate what your needs are and be assistive to you, could occur across many, many platforms in many directions.  And that's where that goes.  You know, to be honest, I think, though, with Aloe, Aloe, whatever you say it, Aloe, Aloe, Aloe, is is that it is sorry to bring this up, Gina, but it does have a little bit of the sniff of wave.  No, in a good way, in a good way.  Yeah, in a good way.  But but it's it's kind of like do they have to go through a lot of hoops to raise this up and get their big adoption, which could lose the attention to the underlying technology, which is really good.  God, I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you're saying you're saying that we're a little snake bit from all of the great things that Google has announced and abandoned over time.  It's getting hard for Google to say, oh, we got a new messaging app.  This is the one you want to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should all use it and move all your contacts over there.  I guess I'm saying is that's going to be very hard.  So my fear is people are going to say, well, they did messaging and sure failed when that's not the point.  The point and neither is the point to shout or whisper.  That was kind of silly, but it'll be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The idea that you can make your text larger or smaller with a little slider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not right now.  We're standing around when Jason was trying to to message Colleen here to make sure we were all in sequence.  And so we said, you know, just shout it.  She'll hear it.  So my fear is that I think people will look at the numbers of alo and say, oh, well, Google tries again.  And that's not really the point.  The underlying technology and the underlying new relationship it has with me to truly be my it's the bottom all bots.  That's what it's really about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's kind of how I feel, Jason, how, you know, we've all kind of at this point kind of made fun of and experienced the Facebook bots and how annoying they feel like stalkers.  I had to kind of finally just I literally had to block that stupid weather one.  I couldn't turn it off.  I can't say cancel. Stop. Go away.  Finally had to block it.  This seems it feels to me, Jason, like this is Google has got has done it right.  This is how bots ought to be.  You're really not talking to a bot.  You're talking to an intermediary who then summons the appropriate bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to that.  I want to kind of dig in a little bit on kind of that interaction with assistant from within the messaging app.  I will say, though, that I feel a little stung at this point, kind of what you were talking about, Jeff, right?  Like, I feel like there's so many different like outside of just Google's efforts in messaging, just messaging in general.  Yes, it's super important.  But it's like even for today, just kind of coordinating this meeting.  I have so many different options.  I have a folder filled with messaging options.  Every new entrant to the category brings with it more confusion on what person is attached to that particular messaging platform.  I think that the things that Aloe is offering are new.  They're different.  They're interesting because of kind of that smart, contextual stuff behind the scenes.  I just wonder why it wasn't, I don't know, sandwiched into something they already have it because I think kind of splintering it out into its own thing might send the wrong message to people.  What do you think, Gina?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think maybe the weariness with all the different app choices might be an early adopter problem and maybe not a mainstream problem.  I mean, I get it.  I think the messaging problems, I think of people and then think, oh, are they on Facebook?  Did I hang out with them last?  Like, what was the last way that I communicated with this person successfully?  And then I go to that app and that's a problem that had a bigger, bigger than Google.  But as for Aloe, I mean, and I was saying, please don't say WAVE.  I mean, it was going on with WAVE.  They were introducing a whole new category of app.  Like, there really wasn't anything like WAVE before in that it just, you know, was a conglomeration of a bunch of things.  It's very clear what Aloe is, right?  Like, it's a messaging app.  We all know what that is.  And what I like about it is that there's some genuinely good or at least from what I could tell from the keynote, good innovation there.  I was like, oh, yeah, I want to use that.  I want to try that.  There were things about it that I really like.  So I welcome that.  And I mean, I don't know.  Google does tend to be like, all right, let's just build this new app instead of trying to improve this old one, like in Hangouts in this case.  But, you know, I think that might be just kind of part of the game with social apps.  You know, you just kind of have to build a thing and see what kind of adoption it gets and then just start fresh, at least from a branding perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the key that we all need to use a messaging app, right?  If you're using a smartphone, you have to use a messaging app.  And Google has made it possible on Android to use I'm using Google Messenger as my standard SMS app, which means I can I use it for SMS and have some of those features in SMS.  But then I can also use it as a data only messaging app with other people who use Facebook Messenger, kind of like Apple's messages.  Isn't that kind of make it a little bit different because you have to choose one.  And if Google starts bundling this into Android and make it the default, I hope they will make it the default messaging app in Android.  Doesn't that give you this great starting point?  And then people's things like the instant replies from inbox are so useful in inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So good. It's crazy how much I use those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And wouldn't you want that in a texting app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, no, because you're all in the same room, what we're going to do is I'm going to I'm going to call on you.  So Jeff Jarvis and then Matt, you're next.  Takes away my usual obnoxious interrupting all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can interrupt. We'll just hear you in the distance.  I could filibuster now and just do that.  We can also cut you off.  Hey, hey, hey, I forgot what I was going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the instant replies in inbox, you're talking about it.  All you need is one wedge in an app like this to get people using it and then and then it can snowball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the thing. I said this a few weeks ago.  I was on the show or I said it on dot NYC.  What I imagine is going to happen is somebody is going to say, did you say that or did was that Google's reply?  Yeah, but they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, isn't this your experience?  It learns and it gives it gives replies that are uncannily like the ones you would be giving.  And they're you. They even said this.  They're unique to everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So they use a lot of points in my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder why, Jeff. Matt, have you been using this?  I mean, are they are they so testing this with Googlers or they usually do a lot of testing with Googlers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been trying to ramp down my dog food in a little bit to kind of get a regular person's experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, you don't want a regular person's experience.  Trust me. It's handy to sort of see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, what's you know, like, for example, last night I was Danny Sullivan's in town for Google I.O.  And so we were talking, but we were D.M. in on Twitter.  But was what was interesting to me is I was navigating to that hotel and it was the first time in six months that I remember like, whoa, the Google voice recognition didn't exactly nail when I was type, you know, saying a destination.  So I think if you think about what Google's good at, there's a lot of machine learning.  There's a lot of artificial intelligence.  There's a lot of voice recognition stuff.  And and then Google needs to figure out how to encapsulate that well, whether it's an agent, a bot, you know, an app.  That's a difficult problem.  But but I think it's heartening to me that Google is trying to figure out the right way to approach that.  And I do think that there's a lot of value to be added, just like with the smart replies in inbox, smart replies to chat smart.  You know, there's a there's a lot of just annoyance in the world that Google could really help with if we can find a way or if Google can find a way to balance all the constraints correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also think that and this was at the very end of the keynote, they threw this thing, the Android instant apps in.  And the idea is you don't have to have an app installed.  If you call on your phone to do something it doesn't know how to do, it will get the little piece of the appropriate app and it'll quickly know how to do it.  And I think that this ties this dovetails interestingly with Aloe and I think it makes what's going to start happening.  I think it's about time is instead of a bunch of siloed apps on your smartphone, then you have to know which app to run.  You have to install the app first and blah, blah, blah.  You're what basically becomes your spot.  Smartphone becomes more monolithic and I think Aloe has the option as the chance of becoming that kind of user interface.  Aloe plus the Google Assistant, aka OK Google, that your phone now is getting more and more like an assistant with multiple capabilities and the ability to learn more capabilities as you ask it to do.  We won't think about apps anymore.  We will just interact with our phone and I will just and that's where I think Aloe is going to be genius.  I'm going to say I need a reservation for dinner for two.  Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're right.  I think it's more than that.  It's Google doing what it does these days, which is strike blows for the open web.  And so I think that the instant apps pulls the pieces of an app out to make them useful without you having to install them, which is good for both sides.  It's good for the open web because the web can now get to earlier search could get to things in apps now and you could interact with apps.  Otherwise, now you can get to the pieces of app without installing them.  But also, if you like what you see when you're there, you might install it as well and become a user.  So it does become customer acquisition for apps in the play world.  So it works to me very well both ways.  But it really is, I think, an open web initiative.  I don't know what everybody else thinks or open platform because it's not just the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's if I say I want to go into the web, into the web, into the browser.  Well, yeah, yeah.  It means to me that the phone is less monolithic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it's Android only, though.  Right. I mean, this is as far as I understand, that's not going to work on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually am actually I was available on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was available.  But Android instant apps, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's going to be a little problem for Apple.  You know, what else is available on iOS is Gboard, the new Google keyboard, which already introduced some of these features.  And I was actually a little bereft when I tried it on iOS.  I said, I want this on Android.  They're moved. That's why they didn't make one for Android.  They're moving these capabilities into Android in a very interesting way.  You're an iOS user, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Me? Yeah, I have I have an iPod touch just to like try out stuff that is available on Android.  But I got to tell you, the instant apps announcement like that for me, that was the big like boom, mic drop.  Me too. Me too.  I was just like, what? How is this happening?  I mean, like as an Android developer, I was like, wait, what?  How is this happening? What is their downloading part of the app on the fly and displaying the collect?  So cool. So, so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And does it mean they implied that you would be your same app?  You'd have to modularize it more.  There must be some mechanism for saying, well, I need these resources if you want this part.  These are the parts of the app you could call on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I mean, you know, honestly, Android development has like been moving in that way, like fragments.  And like the way that you structure your app is are these kind of are is very modular.  And it has been for several iterations now.  So I can see I imagine that that modularization process, which I'm not sure what the details are, but I'm sure it's not that difficult to implement.  So, yeah, I still I'm still just like, how does that work?  Like how fast like how fast can perform in a real world situation if I want 4G or even 3G?  You know, like how does that work? I really want to see it.  But I was yeah, I was really impressed and excited about that as an Android developer from as you know, as a, you know, as just from point from from an acquisition point of view, user acquisition point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you feel like Aloe is kind of the the on phone analog of Google Home, the new physical hub that they announced?  It feels like really what Google is doing is putting Google everywhere.  Google, they've now coined the name. Is this new Matt calling it Google Assistant? Is that something new?  Or is it is new? OK, but they needed that because we didn't know what to call it.  We have Siri, we have Cortana, we have Alexa.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So so Google Assistant now.  And the idea is let's put it everywhere. It's on your phone. It's in your house. You talk to it.  It will respond. It seems like it will respond in a similar way, no matter what platform you use.  I think that's very compelling, man. I I I'll this is this is the science fiction dream that I had for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and if you think about it, a very good way to think about Google is Google cares about how people get to Google.  How do people typically get to a Google will get to a Google search. They get there via a browser.  OK, well, we need to have a browser. And in fact, it's called Chrome because it tries to get all the Chrome out of the way, you know.  And how else do people get to, you know, Google? Well, they'll use a mobile operating system.  Oh, OK, that's interesting. They'll use a laptop like a Chromebook. OK, well, that's interesting.  And so over and over again, you can see Google being very worried about people who can get in between users and Google and add barriers or obstacles.  And so I do think it's a pretty smart way to think about it as if you can do voice recognition, if you can do the machine learning, if you can be a useful assistant,  the mechanism of exactly how that gets delivered, whether it's a little hockey puck beside you or whether it's in your your Google Now or your Google Assistant.  I think Google is pretty agnostic about that, but they want people to be able to do that.  And thinking about how to get around those barriers so that users can do those searches with the minimal amount of friction is a pretty good way to think about what Google might or might not do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and speaking of which, neither Alain nor Duro require a Google account. They're both tied to your phone number, not your Google account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because there's so many people around the world who don't have Google accounts or, you know, that's just another element of friction.  And so I think, you know, maybe, you know, the phone number of your friend and you don't know their email address or something like that,  making it as easy as possible that you can have those interactions without worrying about join here, oh, off to whatever that kind of stuff just makes it a lot easier.  Is it the end of Hangouts?  I honestly I think I saw on Twitter, they need to clarify what's going on with Google Voice and Hangouts and all that sort of stuff.  And I think that's a fair knock because you can try to have a monolithic communication app or you can say, oh, no, it's actually better to break it into different ones like Facebook, split out messenger.  You know, and the right answer might evolve over time. But I do think Google needs to do a better job of saying, OK, here's what happens with Google Voice.  Here's what happens with Google Hangouts, because, you know, like you, you like Google Voice.  You've used it a lot in your past or Google Fi.  You know, I love Google Fi. I'm going to use it when I'm going abroad in a few weeks.  And that's very well supported. But how exactly all those pieces interact?  I think Google could do a better job of explaining what their future roadmap looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think, Jason? Is it the end of Hangouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't I don't know how they can exist at the same time, how Aloe and Duo can exist side by side with Hangouts,  because, yes, Aloe and Duo bring their own expanded functionality.  But I feel like Hangouts, I mean, it was it was basically like the next iteration of Hangouts was kind of how I saw it.  And they did a great job with it. I'm very excited to use it.  But I don't know, like like I was saying earlier, there's so much confusion already that when you have a messaging app and a smart messaging app,  you have a messaging app that has video chat and then you have a video chat app.  I don't know how they coexist without doing some sort of either elimination or convergence.  Or I don't I don't know how they treat that. But it feels a little messy as far as that's concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need more clarification. And they were quick to say that Aloe isn't available till summer and Duo is not available to summer.  What do you like? How do you like this thing, Jeffrey, the knock knock thing where when you call somebody, they see you before they answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So it really struck me as that's that's the end of Alexander Graham Bell.  It's the end of the bell. It's the end of the ring tone.  And all that idea is that is it. And it also means that you've now got to sell your call because nobody wants to talk on the phone.  Nobody wants to talk on the phone. Right. Nobody likes it anymore. So it's going to be crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to talk to me right now. Hi. Hi. Hi. Like like like his daughter.  Like hi. Hi. Hi. Daddy. Talk to me. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could you not talk to me? Oh, my God. Please. It's going to be a whole new way of calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if I wonder if we're going to get an unusual number of well, never mind, I won't I won't I won't go there.  Sexual matters. Yes. You know, you knew exactly where I was going.  I know you want to. That's your sexual pause. Well, yeah. Oh, yeah. You know me so well. Now, you know, my sexual pause. OK.  You know, this pause, this is the one where we go to commercial pause.  No, but I do think they're going to have to be controls in there because otherwise I'm going to get a disproportionate number of.  Knock knock jokes on my phone from strangers.  You know what I'm saying? Oh, yeah. Yeah.  And we need a safe word, don't we? We do. OK.  Hey, we're having fun. This is great. These guys are all well, except for Gina.  Gina's in her new office at her brand new job. It's nice that they let you do that.  Thank you. We appreciate that. And then the rest of them are all at the Googleplex.  And we want to thank a couple of people at Google for giving us the office space.  Chris to Bona immediately emailed. You remember, Chris was the host of Floss Weekly.  He's a manager of open source programs at what Jeff you trying to get my attention?  Hey, Richard, hey, we want to thank Richard, hey, for setting us up there.  There's Richard. Thank you, Richard. And and and thank you to Bals Bals are the conehead.  Over your head. Yeah. Yeah.  We're apparently in Conehead three, the Google conference room.  No, I really appreciate that. Chris reached out as soon as we said, hey, we want to be there.  We know how we're going to do this. And he helped us out. And then Richard and the team there at Google.  So thank you for putting us so great. Thank you. Really good job.  And thank you, Matt, for coming over. I bet you have a few other things you'd like to be doing.  We really appreciate it. If you want to cut out any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm delighted someone instant message me and they're like, can you come to building 1225?  I'd like for Twig. Yeah, like, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you. Always a thrill to have you. Yeah.  Our show today. We'll move through these ads pretty quickly because there's so much to talk about.  But I do want to thank our sponsors as well because they make this all possible.  It's not a cheap thing to do what we do here at Twig.  Boy, I love blue apron. I love when we come home and there's the blue apron box on the porch.  And I know I didn't have to shop today. I don't have to plan a meal because inside there is going to be something amazing.  And I'm going to have it ready in 40 minutes. The house smells great.  You're cooking stuff you never would have thought of.  And I owe it all to blue apron. Blue apron sends you all the ingredients for an amazing meal.  Not one thing extra, though. So you get exactly you know, if you need a clove of garlic, you get a clove of garlic.  So there's no waste. By the way, fabulous stuff.  Their mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone.  And because, you know, at this point, they're they're big.  They're like a big deliverer of food.  They want to make us more sustainable food system and set high standards for ingredients  and build a community of home chefs. And really, that's what's happening with blue apron.  All the seafood. Everything's fresh. The box is refrigerated, but there's nothing frozen.  Seafood is sourced sustainably. The beef is raised humanely. The chickens are free range.  It's stuff you want to feed your family. The pork is raised naturally.  The vegetables are all from local farms, regenerative farming practices.  So it's healthful stuff. And there's less waste because you're getting exactly what you need.  And I could tell you this. Every bite gets eaten because these are amazing meals.  Delicious. Whether it's Japanese ramen noodles, wild caught Alaska salmon, heirloom tomatoes.  You're getting the best food and they have plans for couples, but they also have family plans with kid friendly ingredients.  So it's a great way to cook together.  Research shows, I believe it or not, blue apron families cook only three times more often.  And the kids learn that it's fun to cook. It's great to cook.  It's the message you want to send. And it's less than $10 a meal.  So if you've been eating out, you know, you're tired. You get home.  Oh, let's just do order out or take out or let's eat out.  No, cook. And you will with amazing stuff.  And every meal comes with step by step, easy to follow recipe cards, pre-portioned ingredients.  And there's videos online to help you through it.  Cook meals like crispy cod and cabbage slaw tacos with pepita, pineapple, avocado, salsa.  My mouth always waters during these ads. It's just very hard to do them.  Look at that chicken steam buns with fresh breakfast radish. I don't even know what that is.  Cucumber, kimchi. That's the other thing.  You're going to use ingredients you've never used before, but you're going to get comfortable with them and you'll be using them again.  It makes you a better cook. Middle Eastern chicken and chickpea stew with pita croutons, crispy catfish and yuzu kosher udon.  I don't even know what that is, but it's good. I can tell.  Here's the deal. Go there. We've got two meals free for you.  Waiting for you. Blueapron.com slash twit.  They delivered 99% of the continental United States, surely to you.  Blueapron.com slash twit. Two meals free.  Waiting for you right now. We thank them for their support this week in Google.  So Aloe and Duo, two new apps we'll see sometime this summer with a lot of smarts built into Aloe.  I think it's a better way to do messaging bots, but it's not the only new thing.  I think the Google Home is very interesting too.  This is basically a speaker to take on the Amazon Echo.  And the fact that it works with Chromecast and Chromecast Audio means it's the answer to my dreams.  Gina, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm excited about it. You know, it's funny.  Anil, my co-founder, loves the Echo and would talk about how great the Echo was.  And it was around the time that I got my Google Watch, Google Wear Watch.  And I was like, I mean, it's the watch. It's in one place in your house.  He's like, no, no. And I was like, it's Google.  I mean, I'd love to see the Google version of this. And so now we have it.  And it's cute. It's small. When he walked out with it, I was like, oh, that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Much cuter than the Echo. Yeah.  The fact that you can, it becomes a multimedia center in your house that you could say, play on the living room TV.  That is huge.  That's what I, what the Echo doesn't do that I really wanted it to do.  It'll limit, you can make it do that with some extra hardware, but this just kind of happens.  It's Chromecast Audio support, Chromecast Video support.  Jason, how are you going to run out and get one? We don't know what the price is.  And we don't know when it'll be available sometime later this year is all they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, later this year is all we have right now.  Yeah, I mean, I've been so on the fence of getting the Echo very recently  because you just keep hearing about it. Everybody's so dang happy with their experience with the Echo.  So I've been on the fence, but I wanted to wait and see if Google had their own coming out.  So obviously they do. Yes, I'm on board.  One thing that we're not going to get from what I understand right out of the gate is multi-account capability.  So for a shared device, that could be a little bit of a challenge.  So it could be on my Google account. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be to a account. Oh, no.  The Echo lets me switch accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll open it up eventually, but they say that. So keep that in mind.  But yes, I'm looking forward to it. I really want this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, we've just broken Jeff's heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's going to happen. You know what's going to happen.  I'm going to want to use it on my apps account all along the line.  And no, no, when it comes out, it'll only be the damned Gmail account.  And then I can't switch anything because it knows me as this person, not as that person.  And it won't know anything about me. And Google, can't you fix this?  Can't you fix this? It'll be missing one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt! Matt!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man. New man!  I'm always going for my run while I listen to this thing on Google.  And with Jeff, you know, you just press the button because you know it's a completely fair criticism  about Google Apps accounts not being able to do everything that Google accounts can do.  And I'm like, oh, no, the next minute is not going to...  I should start doing intervals whenever I hear that.  You wouldn't think it would be that rocket science-y, but apparently it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are consumer products, too, really. Let's face it. They're not. These are not work products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's interesting to me because I have an Amazon Echo in my home, you know, and I use it.  I like to do, you know, what's the news and that sort of stuff.  But what really was interesting to me is I was visiting my sister-in-law and this was like a year ago  and her kids were asking the Echo to like tell jokes.  And I was like, oh, this is interesting.  This is connected in a way that a lot of different consumer products really didn't, you know, catch on.  And so I'm glad that Google now has this offering.  We'll see how well it works. I'm hoping that the voice recognition, everything works really, really well.  I like the LEDs, you know, so it's like recycling. That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the response for this one is, hey, Google versus OK Google.  She said, hey, Google on one of them.  She said, hey, Google, I think. Yeah, which is interesting.  The other thing that really struck me about home is that it is not mobile.  Right. Everything is mobile. Everything is going to be mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile.  And this is the thing that is explicitly not mobile, which I kind of like.  And it makes you think about a different use case around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what made the Echo interesting because I think the reason the Echo worked,  it wasn't as smart as Siri or Google or anything else, but the reason it worked for a couple of reasons.  But the main reason is because you're talking to your house.  There is no device. You just you're standing there stirring the stew and you say set timer for 20 minutes.  You talk to your house and it responds or you say I need new batteries and it says, oh, yeah, you ordered them before.  These ones. Yes, that is magical.  Even though its capabilities are much more limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It also makes you buy one for every room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have when this is my sad face because I have five of these things.  And that I guess I'll still need them for my audible books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I got to say, I watched that video for the product and I was like, I aspire to this being my family life and my home life someday.  It seemed like just a well-oiled machine.  I was like, oh, I wish my morning looked like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate those videos, though, because nothing can live up to that.  You know, they're just too good.  They're just too good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In my house, we forgot the costume for space day completely for.  Oh, yeah, that was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The kid comes and you look at this sad face and you forgot.  What's our next appointment at space day at the Hermes school?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My kid shows up and is like, Mom, you forgot.  We show up at school without the costume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only thing I thought was interesting was at the very end where he says goodbye, because I think there was a piece by Hunter Walk where he's like, Alexa is teaching my kids to be rude.  You know, and he's basically like they don't say please.  They don't say thank you.  And he wanted that sort of, you know, stuff to be built in.  And so for a second, I thought it was going to say, oh, goodbye, you know, a nicety.  And instead, it's like, oh, we'll turn you into auto away mode and all that sort of stuff.  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did have functionality.  The nest turned off and all of these things.  So I kind of like that.  It would be nice if these things would teach our kids to say please and thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, wouldn't execute the command.  And like, like, Alexis says, what's the secret?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the magic word?  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, if I can have a device.  Okay, Matt, make a note of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just pass it along to the team.  There should be a magic word mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will write that down.  And in fact, so Neil Stevenson, there was something like the diamond age.  It was like the young ladies primer or something.  And it basically was like an A.I. that would teach this, you know, young girl over, you know, over until she became a young woman.  And I just, man, if you could get to that mode where you're just like, you've got this kid, he loves ptarmigans and birds and stuff.  And he wants to know about dinosaurs.  And it could kind of like slip in a little educational stuff.  In addition to the please and thank you, I'm like, that would be much better than just watching, you know, videos or TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe you remember the episode of Silicon Valley where they have the artificial intelligence nanny scolding the child.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was so excited about this idea of not having to repeat stuff to my daughter 16 times.  But now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your mother told you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was terrible.  Yeah, it was painful.  It was painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but but you see how we are really moving in the direction of these artificial assistants.  Oh, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And again, because it knows how to respond as you.  That's we thought these agents would go off and get things for us.  Right.  But it but it learns to respond as me and says what I would say anyway.  And so it now will soon say it for me.  And then no one's going to know if they're dealing with me.  Or by the way, there is, you know, a new Facebook messenger.  But this is the use of my name that I approve of called Jarvis.  Right.  Right.  It's actually pretty good.  It's pretty neat.  You tell it to remind you.  Right.  So so by talking to Jarvis or Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  You're not going to know.  Well, Google has a huge advantage here because as we know, Apple is very reluctant to collate information or they say they are.  They say they are.  About how you use stuff.  Google has been always collecting that information and should be able to use that to make this stuff better and smarter.  And, you know, there's a kind of interesting because I think in some senses.  This encourages you.  It gives you a reason to give Google this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the thing that really struck me most this morning is that I've talked about mass media being over and mass treats you like all the same.  And I say to my people in media, Google is a personal services company.  It knows you as an individual and media does not know what I saw today more than ever is that Google is a personal company.  It knows you as an individual.  That's really powerful.  As long as the trust can stay up, which I have no problem with it.  I welcome my new master all as well.  It's good. Come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You and I are that way.  We don't mind.  We embrace this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think as long as you get value back, as long as the user gets value back, they're going to be fine with this.  And Google is demonstrating huge value for allowing this personal relationship to occur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, you know, I the value is there already for me.  This is it's so interesting because we've been looking at so many Google products like Google now and saying it's so it could be so useful and so great.  And all along, this is Google has been has been building this kind of informational utility.  And then there's this kind of criticality, this singularity, if you will, where it takes the stuff it's been learning.  And now it's really hideously valuable, really functional.  So now cards, while they were interesting, never really took off as a super valuable thing.  But but this could be our little Rosie the Riveter in our in our house.  Rosie the Riveter.  Well, it's like that little Rosie the robot in the in the Jetsons, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the Jetsons Rosie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little one of that.  But you put wheels on it and give it a duster feather duster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did Rosie the robot help help the children in the house cheat on their homework?  That was interesting, wasn't it?  Yeah, basically said, yeah, it'll totally help you with your homework.  It's Spanish for apples.  To know it's OK.  Yeah, she whispered it.  She whispered it.  She knew she knew she wasn't supposed to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So to Google, I think it would I think it would do that.  I think that why wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, certainly the story was somewhere, I think, in Asia about people who were taking a class or a test and they had cameras in their glasses, which then sent the you know, the the questions off to somebody else who then figured out the answer and sent the answer to the people's smartwatches.  And so they have the watch apps.  That's like the answer is C kind of thing.  And the future is going to get a little weird there.  You know, how do you do a standardized test if you're, you know, if you well, my bot will write the code for me.  Here you go.  You know, kind of stuff.  It could get a little strange.  We'll see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I have to I have to admit, I just started my new job here post like three weeks ago and I'm director of engineering and there's all these technologies here that I just don't have a lot of experience with.  So I've been in these meetings where they'll be like, oh, yeah, we're using this stack and it's this, you know, beanstalk and known and Jenga and I'm like, uh huh.  Yeah, no problem.  Then I go back to my desk.  I just start looking at everything.  And what do you do?  You immediately Google it right.  I'm sure that my Google search like search activity has spiked very high the last three weeks.  I've been reading and looking stuff up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a concert.  My Rosie, by the way, there's a concept in programming called cut and paste programmers.  And there's a kind of programmers that can paste programmer because they go to stack exchange, they cut and paste the code and they and they move on.  And you know, it works.  You can do it.  That's how I do it.  I don't know how to do anything.  I just cut and paste.  You can get yourself out of a jam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And sometimes Google has the answer in like within the results and literally you don't have to go to you don't have to go to stack exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just cut and paste from the knowledge graph.  By the way, big growth in the knowledge graph.  And this is where you really starting to see the value of that.  Then I do believe there's a critical mass where it just turns over.  Everybody says, fine, this is too good.  We're going to all use it.  And then everybody pours more information in there and gets smarter and smarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the end of the media brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting, isn't it?  Because you want the knowledge.  You don't want to care about the brand.  The same thing about siloing application, how application silos, it all goes away.  It all this becomes.  And for Google, that's a good thing because this becomes your entry point into the entire world of information.  All the world's information at your fingertips.  That's the end game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And just as you have to write applications modularly.  So in the future, should you write news articles and books modularly so that you can go in and grab the piece of it, which it doesn't necessarily fit our business model, but it fits the use case of somebody wanting to get just what they want.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were you pleased? Were you surprised to see Android Wear?  I did not think we would see anything about Android Wear.  That's shocking.  Gina, you used to wear your.  And I love Android Wear.  But you still wear your Android?  No.  There you go.  There's a Moto 360.  All the presenters, I should point out, were wearing Moto 360s.  Every one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the one thing that was kind of nice about Android Wear is they had the idea of watch faces where you can pull in data from any data source and automatically fold that into.  And I use a Garmin watch for running.  And it's kind of interesting because they now have custom watch faces, but a lot of them are really ugly.  And yet you're stuck with whatever that person designed that watch face for.  So the idea of like pulling in your step count for the day or something automatically and like not having to be a programmer do it.  That was kind of interesting.  I thought that was a smart way to add a little bit of value to the idea of Android Wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android Wear 2.0.  So you'll be able to have custom complications as Apple calls them.  I'll just call them widgets.  And they could pull from any app.  Any developer could put a complication on your watch face in Android Wear 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple calls them complications?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a horro...  Okay, get ready for the...  You know, when you enter the Apple world, you enter a whole new world.  The world of horology.  That's what horologists call them.  Watchmakers call them complications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You Google people wouldn't know about that.  But I think widgets is fine.  It just seems like an odd thing to name something a developer needs to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like...  Complication, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's just what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's what they do all the time, yeah.  It's a confusion of widgets.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they did mention it.  One of the things they did not mention is Chrome OS and Chromebook.  However, Hiroshi Lockheimer tweeted,  We'll have lots more to say about that at 11 tomorrow.  So there is going to be...  It's not, unfortunately, a keynote and it's not going to be streamed live,  but there will be more information.  So Matt Cutts, you could tell us more about that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure I'll maybe end up tweeting that.  You know, I've got my Chromebook Pixel 2.  I still love my Chromebook.  I do too, more and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is a full-time Chromebook user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I plan to go and hug Hiroshi Lockheimer tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But isn't Hiroshi the Android guy?  So why is he tweeting about Chromebooks?  What is that all about? Hmm?  And our Intrepid producers found an interesting listing  in the Google I.O. schedule.  Let me see if I can find it.  That says, as we announced...  This is for tomorrow. It's at 4 p.m. tomorrow.  As we announced earlier today,  Android developers can now put their apps in Chrome OS.  So there's a little hint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  The rumor sphere has been pointing to the possibility  of the Play Store opening up to include Chrome web apps,  number one, and then number two,  some sort of cross-compatibility of Android apps.  That's a further expansion of Android app compatibility  inside Chrome OS.  So we'll see.  Sounds like maybe they meant to do some sort of announcement today  and they had to push it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a rumor floating around.  I was told that they had planned something today  and they ran out of time  and they had to cut some things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A PR person told me that they did intend to say something about Chrome.  Whatever they're going to say at 11 o'clock tomorrow  was going to be part of the keynote today,  but they ran out of time, literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should we go back to the two days, back to back,  two hour keynotes to cover everything?  What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because I looked, I thought, oh great, there's going to be another keynote.  Everybody got ready tomorrow, 11 a.m., and no.  So they ran out of time.  You know what?  Google has its fingers in a lot of pies.  And by the way, we also had to mention this is not an Alphabet keynote.  So there's nothing about autonomous vehicles  because that's not a Google product.  There's nothing about Nest.  There was a little mention of Nest,  but I would expect that actually the home product will be,  will it be in the Nest division?  That's actually kind of interesting.  It's in the new hardware division.  Is Nest part of their hardware division?  I don't know.  Rick Osterloh is coming back from Motorola.  Remember, he was the guy at Motorola?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Google hardware is a separate from Nest.  Is it Google?  I'm not 100% sure, but I believe it is.  I think Nest is Alphabet and Google hardware is Google, but I'm not positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you can close your ears, Matt,  but that reading the tea leaves shows once again  that I think the Nest division and Tony Fidel's division  are a little bit on the outs at this point.  I think it's a search appliance, so maybe that makes sense.  I would love to see, I love Chrome OS.  I want to see Chrome OS continue.  Yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The interesting thing to me was now you've got these $499 Chromebooks,  which you talked about all the time.  The mid-range ones.  And you can get them up to $1,000 by the time you max out all the RAM and everything.  I hear that, and on one hand, that's great,  and on the other hand, I'm like, I love my Pixel.  I've got to have my Pixel.  Keep coming out with Pixel 3, 12 months, 18 months.  But that is such a nice machine.  How old is the Pixel 2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it came out last summer.  Was it at Google I.O. last summer? So it's exactly a year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they didn't say a word today, so this is concerning me greatly,  because I am addicted to it.  HP is not going to be the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and to be fair, I think the HP Chromebook will be really, really good.  It's just I love the cleanness of the colors and the lines,  and so maybe I should get over myself and go for the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's things they could do.  They could put Thunderbolt 3 on the USB-C.  They could put newer chips in there.  I'd like to see more storage, believe it or not,  because I'm actually running Crouton and Linux on there,  and I could use a little bit more storage.  It's a very powerful device.  We have in the studio with us four educators, four teachers,  who are all about Chromebooks.  They all use Chromebooks. They're from Sacramento area,  and they came for the Google keynote, and they've stayed for Twig.  But they're sold on Google for Education,  and we heard nothing about Google for Education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the keynote was still two hours.  I know. No, no, I understand.  So there's a finite amount of stuff you can fit in there,  and the whole rest of the three days is plenty of time  to tell people about the latest with Google for Education  and Chromebooks and Chrome OS.  I don't think that it's, oh, should we worry about Chrome OS,  because that is a real winner in the education market  and with people who don't want to do a lot of management,  maintenance, configuration.  So I'm not worried about that at all. I just want my Pixel.  I want that high-end machine. I love it.  But I wouldn't take the lack of mention of something in this keynote  as it's like, oh, it's on death's knell.  There's a lot of other stuff going on during the I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some challenges to putting Android apps,  just putting them on Chrome OS.  I mean, Gina, there's the developer issue,  but there's also the issue from a user's point of view.  Is it touch? We don't have touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm still unclear how that's going to happen.  Right, right.  Yeah, interested to hear more about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about you, Jason Howell?  Have you thought a little bit about what that would look like  to put Android on Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, we saw a little bit of this last year, right?  They rolled this out, I think, to a limited number of Android apps.  There were a certain small group of partners that they were doing this with.  And I think it was very much kind of like the windowed experience of an Android app.  Beyond that, I don't know personally.  I think it gets a little confusing if you have an app, for one thing,  that's Android running in Chrome OS versus the web app and a web page  and why you choose one over the other,  whether an Android app is ideal for, let's say, the laptop kind of environment,  and what form factor that's being brought in on.  Is it the tablet version or is it the phone version or whatever?  So I think there's a little bit of questions in there.  But if you've got access to all these things, we don't necessarily know  if this is their announcement from tomorrow.  But if you've got access to that, that kind of, however many, what is it,  a million plus apps from Android inside Chrome OS, I mean, certainly wouldn't hurt.  It certainly fills a lot of gaps and it's a nice addition.  I really want to kind of see how it responds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could do it the same way you do it with Android Studio.  It has an emulator window that looks like a pixel, I mean, a Nexus device.  It's just on the screen is a window and you could do your Android apps.  That'd be basic, but not what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't used the new Android Studio and it's supposed to be way faster,  but man, those emulators are slow.  Are they?  Slow, yes.  And again, I know it's supposed to get faster.  I was very excited about all the Android Studio, particularly speed announcements.  And I need to get into the, I think it's the beta channel and get the new one.  But yeah, no, those emulators are generally really slow.  So I don't know if that's the best way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They even said during the Android Studio talk that it was even faster  than if you were running it on your phone.  So would that be a change from what you've been experiencing in Android Studio today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, heck yeah.  I mean, the common knowledge amongst Android developers is you hook up a physical device  to your computer and you run, you just skip the emulator entirely.  You skip the emulator, you attach an Android device and you test and run on that.  Even that, you know, takes some time.  Look, it's, you know, it's a process.  It's a process.  And so I'm very excited.  I mean, you know, this stuff just takes time.  So I'm very excited to see the speed improvements.  I'm especially excited.  If the emulators become, you know, useful, that would be good too.  If they're fast enough to be useful, that would be great.  So I want to see that.  I want to see that in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we'll find out tomorrow what's going to happen with Android on Chrome OS  and what's going to happen with the Chromebooks in general.  I thought because there are all these nice mid-range Chromebooks due out any moment now.  I thought there would be a big announcement that would coincide with the release of the HP and the Dell and the Acer.  Or at least a free one under every chair.  I thought that too.  What did you get for free?  You got a durag and some sunglasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing, which I think we've talked about this in the past.  And we know nothing promised at the session.  Nothing, no email afterwards saying, oh, and you have a, you know, a key to a self-driving car waiting you.  And I think that's fine.  I think they had more developers here this year because they had the bigger venue.  This is for developers.  That's the business benefit to Google.  It's the benefit all around.  And yeah, there were probably some disappointed geeks, but more important candy is a fast emulator.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what they gave you, Jeff, you specifically, ways on Android Auto.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They announced that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Now, if I could only get a car that I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's buying a car that's an accessory for his Android Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just passed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true.  I just passed 200,000 miles on my beast because I can't find the right car.  I need four wheel drive.  I want a small little kind of minor SUV thing.  I want Android Auto.  I think a Honda CRX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's get him a Honda CRX.  Honda has Android Auto.  Matt, do you have Android Auto in your car?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I am like, Jeff, I'm kind of holding on.  I'm like, OK, I need one more car.  I'm like, my car is 12 years old.  Ready to go.  If I have one more car, then I can maybe make it through to self-driving cars after that.  So what's the one more car to get before that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is the last petrol car either guy of you guys is going to buy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I'm sorry, but like, you know, besides Volkswagen, it sounds like there's a lot of other car manufacturers that are suddenly like, yeah, we cheated on emissions test, too.  And so you can get an electric car quicker.  You know, that's great for everybody.  So, you know, I'm kind of waiting for the Android Auto and see what sort of stuff they've got available.  I think that'll be a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I already bought my last gas car.  I'm not.  That's the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got your Tesla coming.  Feels good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, who else got it?  Has a Tesla X Model X?  Bill Gates.  Oh, he posted a video of him interviewing Neil Stephenson about seven eves.  Bill Gates did a book review of Neil Stephenson's latest seven eves, which is hysterical.  And it's very Bill Gatesy.  And and he and then he posted a video of him driving in cars, basically stealing the Seinfeld idea.  But he did it. But OK, he did one better because he does it in 360 degrees.  So there's the most awkward moment ever.  Let me see if I can play this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The most awkward moment ever is when they're dancing.  That was pretty awkward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's here's Bill Gates meeting Neil Stephenson.  Bill's sitting on a bench waiting to meet Bill, ready to meet Neil.  Can you get the audio?  You're not hearing my audio.  Oh, it's the most awkward moment ever.  But a little later on, they get in Bill's car and towards it's a Model X that I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That I I a few times here, I say, no, no, I got to read fiction stuff and friends mention that this is me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All I can say is he's no Jerry Seinfeld.  By the way, look, as they're going by, how do I zoom in on this?  There's some people warping in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know where the seams are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What Neil Stephenson is into sword craft stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that was for Neil.  I thought, by the way, Seven Eves is an awesome hard sci fi book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just shipped a couple of nights ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this the strangest experience you've ever had?  That's just apparently on the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a time travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, now that you can hear me, I got to go back to the introduction of with Bill Gates sitting on a bench.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, if you outfit your Tesla with some cameras, then I can do this.  Right. That sucker off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good to see you. How's it going? Hey, I loved your book.  This is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like this is like a bad Scientology video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you clear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, we're going to take a break.  Great panel. You guys are in the Googleplex.  Well, some of you are anyway.  Gina Trapani is not. She's in New York City joining us from her brand new job.  Is there some way we can patronize or become clients of your new employer?

Then you can add a link to the AMP version inside your your markup.  And then you'll be ready for, you know, mobile on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google CDN, Gina.  Is the page that served from the Google CDN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't believe so.  I think it's served from our side.  I came in on this project really late a couple of days ago.  I got some code pushed in there, but good for you.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's it written in?  It is a well, there's a few layers to it.  The front end is a Django app and it uses actually the readability API to do some of the nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you back using Python?  Yes.  How nice.  That's awesome.  Good for you.  And this is just a freebie like to introduce people to post like, is that the idea or are you going to charge for it at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, we have a lot of our clients are dealing with issues that publishers have publishing is big here in New York and Paul has a lot of connections to the publishing community.  And we found that, you know, this is just what, you know, and amplifying your pages was just a problem.  People were, you know, small publishers didn't didn't have developers to get the work done.  And so publishers were taking time out of their schedule and was like, you know, this is this is a really pretty simple problem to solve.  Let's just, you know, yeah, let's provide a tool that can save you some dev time, particularly for a smaller publishing clients.  So and yeah, it's free for anybody to use.

That's so awesome.  And we hope to extend it to I don't know if I'm supposed to say this.  I'm going to say it anyway.  We hope to extend it to to support other formats.  Instant articles in the future, depending on on how people take up.  But we did we took on AMP first because it was the easiest and most straightforward thing that we could we could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What other formats could those be like instant art, instant articles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like Facebook, articles or Apple's.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did not tell us the name of nut roll Android and they did talk a lot about Android and Russia.  Lockheimer came on the stage, but they said we're going to let you name it.  Come on, Matt.  What happened?  They couldn't get the rights to Nutella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, my favorite conspiracy theory is that Sundar Pichai visited India and someone was like,  why don't you name it after this dish that starts with an N?  And he's like, well, this was like a year ago.  He's like, maybe we'll open it up to an online poll.  Maybe everyone in India will vote for it the next day or something like that.  And so, you know, who knows?  But I think at the very bottom in the fine print, it says we reserve the right to pick whatever we want.  This is for entertainment purposes only.  It won't be judged.  And I think they mean you won't get feedback when you say it ought to be called Nutella or not.  Not roll or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they specifically said it will not be maybe make nameface.  Maybe make nameface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They brought that right up.  Smart.  Android.  Nope.  The deadline is eleven fifty nine p.m. Pacific time, June 8th.  So I presume that by, you know, the next couple of weeks we'll learn.  You go to Android dot com slash N and you name Android and I love I guess this is a good way to go.  And I love I guess this is the Indian dish.  Nehap.  Nehapam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nehapam.  It seems like they're trying to slant that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android Nehapam.  Really?  I don't know if they napalm is really the name we should give.  Here's noodles and nectarines.  Nutmeg.  Oh, I like this one.  It had a post-it note.  It's Marshmallow.  Post the post-it note fell off.  See, they took Marshmallow, crossed off the M and put the N on there and then the post-it note fell off.  Navy bean.  That's not a dessert.  Nuts and nachos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If only nachos were desserts.  Alas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe what they're saying is it doesn't have to be a dessert anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nuchos.  What about nachos?  Nuts and nachos together.  Two great treats together at last.  And then there's a video about the naming.  I wish it were like this.  This is straight out of Silicon Valley, right?  I'm Jon Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm CEO of PNI, Professional Naming Incorporated.  Yes, we are working on something big.  The latest version of Android needs a name.  They want people everywhere to share their ideas, but I think it's a job for PNI.  They had Kit Kat a while ago.  Jelly bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lollipop.  Lollipop.  Marshmallow.  I was thinking maybe since we had marshmallow last time, maybe now we were going to have  Narshmallow.  I don't hate it.  Maybe like toasted marshmallow.  Chum, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You want to make sure that the N is inspired.  People in the streets, they wouldn't understand a lot of what we're doing.  There's a lot of mathematics and metrics in it, but it's really half science and half art.  It's both.  It's math and art.  It's like a baby.  When you give birth to a baby, it's science, but it's a baby and that has a soul.  And then you have to name it.  Nutshell.  Nutshell.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a nutshell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, nut, nut, nut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything is changing constantly.  It's a global world.  If you don't do it right away, it's already somebody else is putting it on a t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nashi pear, navel orange, just direct distinct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel really close to Narshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love noodles because it's got a length to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They say if a shark stops swimming, it's dying.  I don't know if it's dying if it stops swimming or if you're not out there like a shark naming things like a shark would.  I'm not sure if that's...  Okay, so let's bring it in, everybody.  We are names.  We are names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't need these guys, Reza Text.  We just need you.  What would you name?  Hashtag Android N.  I think that's actually, it's a lot of fun.  It's not going to get Bodhi McBoatface.  It's going to get something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Landoor Associates?  Yeah, that's what they do, right?  That's what they do.  Yeah.  I think they created Verizon.  They call it branding or nanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nanding.  Nanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did see a couple of sharp-worded tweets about how it was a little bit maybe of a bad idea to ask people to come up with.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't have to tell anybody what they heard.  Is there a prize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you don't want to ask for an explicit N-word.  Yeah.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  But nobody...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's nowhere no one's seeing it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone said clearly a white person came up with this, although if it was Sundar, then that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we live in a world now where we have to kind of not have fun because of trolls?  No.  If somebody's going to do that, they're going to do it, but it's not going to be public, right?  Are we seeing them?  I don't think we're seeing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we're not seeing them.  I don't believe we are.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless you take a screenshot of the submission before you send it, which I saw a lot of that.  As some people are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I may have come out of it myself.  You know, that's sad.  This is why we can't have nice things.  That's terrible.  Or nice contests, naming contests.  Oh, well.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe go in the direction of internet memes and go Android Nyan Cat.  Nyan Cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like yours, Jason.  Nom Nom.  Nom Nom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nom Nom.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nom Nom as well.  That goes to the core of what makes a dessert a dessert.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a meta dessert.  Yes, it's meta.  It's a meta dessert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We probably won't have a brand name, Matt, do you think?  Or do you think?  I mean, I don't know how Kit Kat happened.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it would be cool.  I think it would be cool to have a brand name.  Like maybe, you know, if not in, go for O or.  Nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about the nerds?  That's a brand name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nerds.  I think Mike Elgin was like, we should name it after the kind of people who come up with  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android nerds.  Android nerds would be just an awesome.  Nougat?  Nougat.  I like Nougat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then they have a hashtag, name Android N. So, noopsy nectar.  I feel like.  There's options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought Nutella was a dead lock, to be honest with you, but I think it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was not a lock the minute it was used as a joke early on.  I can't remember who it was, but I think the posting was we're not telling you what it  is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, Hiroshi Lockham.  Yeah, it was Hiroshi.  That's right.  We're not.  because they never tell you in advance.  You never know in advance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you excited about what you see with the new features of Android N?  And we've seen a lot of it.  The beta, official beta came out today.  In fact, it was pushed to the Pixel C today.  And I think the Nexus 6P, if you've registered it, you should get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you been running the old one on your Pixel C?  The old N?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And we got the update.  Oh, yeah.  The only negative is there are a few apps, like every time I launch Instagram, it says  you need a library update.  But it ran.  So I haven't.  Are there any?  Have you seen any serious crashes, Jason?  No.  It's just weird stuff not happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a little janky.  It's a little janky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bit.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, and for all intents and purposes, it's been alpha.  This is their first, you know, their quotes, actual beta version of it.  So this is the first one that I feel comfortable flashing onto my Nexus 6P, which I plan on  doing tonight and kind of living with it a little bit more than I have with it prior  because it's just been on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to flash it.  It's an over the air update.  All you have to do is go to the beta site and enroll your device and you will get an  OTA update.  That is mad.  That's so nice.  Really, really nice.  And you got it.  There he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's got it.  Yeah.  That was an incredible nod to Enthusiast.  I like that a lot.  You could get it over the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know the one.  OK, so what's your favorite feature?  My favorite feature is simply double tapping the recents button to go to the last app.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's awesome.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so I was listening to the keynote and over and over again, they kept saying we're  going to fold in this feature of Chrome OS.  And each time I was like, you know, direct boot and verified boot and all these security  things.  I love that.  Automatic updates.  Seriously, cool.  Yeah.  So like, you know, Android doesn't really have that much of a malware problem.  There's a lot of security companies that are like, look, we found a malware thing in the  Play Store.  But, you know, usually if you disallow third party apps, then you're usually OK.  But I love the idea that they're like, you know, if you take the best of Chrome, which  in a lot of cases is the security and all that kind of stuff and the oh my gosh, you  don't have to wait for 45 applications to apply.  Oh, that's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so sick of that.  That's fantastic.  Updating and updating, updating, updating forever.  Now, are they going to be able to do this Chromebook style background update and reboot  update on anything but Nexus phones?  That's the question, because don't they have to get Samsung and LG or whoever to update  their skin, get the radios updated from the third parties and all that stuff?  I could see them doing a Chromebook style update on Nexus devices, but I don't see it  happening on non Nexus devices or maybe.  It'd be a compelling reason to buy a Nexus device, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does seem like Google is always doing a better job of pressing people to stay up  to date with security updates and those sorts of things.  So maybe some of that comes into play with the new generation of the operating system.  But it is an open question.  I'll be curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But that's but the way they do it on Chromebook is so great.  It's too bad you have to do a reboot.  But nevertheless, it's transparent.  It happens in the background.  You get a little notification, you reboot and it's all updated.  And yes, now and by the way, forty six apps.  What are you talking about? I got two hundred forty five.  Now updating app two hundred and twenty three out of two hundred.  I just do it over night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need to be come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my my guess is the Galaxy S7 will you can say update, check for updates every night  and update in the middle of the night, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My nightmare is that it's going to happen to me like when I'm waiting in line  to get my boarding pass. Yeah.  Something. And you're just absolutely screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that I think that's probably half the point of the reboot.  I'm sure part of it is that you need to.  What so what they said, which I thought was really cool, is that there'll be  each phone will maintain two images, the current image and then an updated image.  So it's so it's transparent.  You just reboot and it says, oh, good, we got the new image boot to that instead.  I'm hoping it keeps the old image around for a little bit  so that you can always you can revert, which would be even more coolness.  That would be nice. Yeah.  If you ever had any problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awfully geeky.  Who would even know what revert means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd have a button said, you know, are you having, you know,  if you're having trouble, you can revert to your previous version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android safe mode. Yeah.  Oh, Android is safe mode actually for the longest time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I'm thinking like the windows. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you release safe in life is when that happens to you. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Android, Android at Google, I was definitely different this year  for the obvious reason that usually in years past, we hear about these things  and the new release first at I.O.  And we've been doing this kind of developer preview now for a couple of months.  So it was hard to do an announcement that really included much  that was very new beyond what we already knew.  But I mean, I think the biggest thing there that we haven't talked about is VR  and how VR is intertwined into Android coming up on Android.  And that was kind of their big announcement.  I think as far as Android is concerned, Daydream, they call it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is interesting because that's the name of the screen safer on Android.  But I know, right. They already own it. So no big deal.  This is not what RumorMill had said, which was a stand-alone Android VR.  This is actually much more like Galaxy Gear VR, where you have  you still need a phone, right. And you have a two devices.  The reference is a visor plus a remote control looking clicker.  Really nice remote. It did look good.  I like that reference design, but that's just a reference design,  which implies that Google is not going to manufacture this.  They're going to let third party like Nexus. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As a reference. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think VR?  I mean, let's ask you, Jason, how because you're the all about Android guy.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I was really curious.  We had heard a lot leading up to it that there was the possibility of VR  being built into the operating system.  And in my mind, I was trying to kind of figure out, like, what does that look like?  What does it look like when you've got a mobile OS that works in different form factors?  But now you're going to into a completely different world, almost quite literally.  And I like what I see. I mean, it definitely seems like, yes, it's Android for VR,  but it's really, you know, it's not Android in the sense that it does  every single thing that Android does. It's very tailored for the specific things.  You know, the apps, the games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This looks a little bit like Android TV, frankly, the interface, except it's three dimensional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Right. I'm excited to play around with it and see, you know,  I don't know what kind of traction it can get.  I think it's kind of a kind of an interesting thing to think about building  something like this into the core operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't I didn't read it that way.  I mean, would it surface on a phone?  Would you somehow see some sort of VR?  Or is it just that the operating system has this capability?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't. Yeah, no, no, no, it's it's definitely more of that.  But I don't know. I'm interested to see.  I also think that I like the way they're going about the kind of reference design approach.  They're allowing they're basically giving this reference design to everyone,  have it to have access to and create compatible, you know, daydream ready, as they say, hardware  so that, you know, the phones can kind of work with this right out of the gate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm excited to play around with all the stuff I saw today.  This one seemed like the most me to we don't really have anything original here.  This is just gear VR, basically.  Anybody want to argue with me? Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Android, that's not speaking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, I was just going to say, I do think that there's got to be some plumbing  to get the latency to work really well, because historically people have complained about,  you know, like audio apps on iOS versus Android.  And I know they don't want to work to try to falcon level library that.  Right. Yeah. Make that more professional.  So, you know, the fact that there's more in the substrate of Android that now makes things,  you know, that you can count on.  OK, you'll have this minimum frame rate or this this minimum latency sort of thing.  I think that is good because it gets everybody on the same page.  So that should help a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the way Samsung's handled that is by saying you have to have a Samsung phone,  a Galaxy S6 or S7 or a Galaxy Note.  I mean, VR is happening and it's it's it's everywhere.  This is not that this is more like cardboard or a Galaxy Gear VR than it is like an Oculus Rift or a Vive.  But it just feels like it feels like, yeah, we got that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wait, wait, wait. After Aloe, Home, Duo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was all about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think that Daydream was the biggest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aloe had some really cool, neat, new features.  Same with Google Home.  This doesn't have any. This is not anything new, in my opinion.  It just it looks exactly like every other lobby and every other VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it's the back end.  I think it's the developers conference.  And what they're trying to do is get people to develop to VR.  And they tried to say we're improving the functionality to that end.  I don't think it was a consumer facing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, we're going to build in libraries so you can do a better job with VR.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so one thing that's interesting to me is there's a lot of people who have gone,  for example, from Google for Work or Google Apps, that area over to Google VR.  And the cloud enterprise area of Google, where they're trying to do these really great things,  is, you know, is a pretty interesting area.  So to have these people go from there to Google VR, just as an outsider,  that would make me think, OK, what do they know or what's interesting to them as opposed to a me to kind of product?  Now, I think it still remains to be seen when experiences start to show up and hardware starts to show up.  But that's one thing that goes a little bit towards, OK, well, you know,  presumably these very smart people who are in charge of lots of people and had a lot of responsibility  and did important, interesting things, they see something or they're interested in, you know,  they see a potential there. It's not just a me to product.  I hope we'll find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Certainly, Google gets points for, you know, the cardboard is two years old.  It came out two years ago.  So they get points for really bringing the low cost VR really for anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, that was the coolest giveaway ever.  Absolutely. It was the cheapest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really was. It really was.  And it was just like, oh, yeah, here's this thing.  Ha ha ha. I mean, it was a real afterthought.  Yeah, it was really an afterthought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, OK, I agree with you.  Remains to be seen.  What I've seen so far is more like a checkbox, a checkmark in a box of features than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we got all these companies are saying is that VR matters to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody's in agreement there.  Where they are.  Google has some major horsepower.  I mean, they've got some big shots in the VR department.  So and they have a big investment in Magic Leap.  My my best guess is this isn't the end game at all, not even close to it.  And and when they really go into it, it's going to be more like an augmented reality thing.  And there'll be something much more significant there with a Magic Leap kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and just add one more data point.  So John Wiley, who was a big designer in the search area, he has also gone over to the art.  So presumably it puts some horses in there.  Right. So I think you're right, Leo.  And we'll have to see as time as time goes on how that how that works out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was other news in the world now swamped by Google.  I.O. Motorola has apparently killed the Moto X.  It's going to be the Moto G for G for play and G for.  Plus, you talked about this last night, I know, Jason Howell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, three different devices kind of.  I don't know what happened.  Odo X necessarily.  We've heard a little bit that they might actually come out with a Moto Z like the X to Z,  even though Sony went from the Z to the anyways.  Everybody's playing musical chairs with letters right now.  But yeah, three three different Moto G devices, kind of different scaled for different price points.  The play edition, I think, isn't even available quite yet.  It's the lowest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all for India and China, as far as I can tell.  I haven't heard. I'm sorry. South America and India, Brazil and India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really seems like like the Moto G plays is essentially the Moto E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now the Moto G's are inexpensive and we really like the G.  I like the G a lot.  It was a very impressive for a phone for 200 bucks.  I know it feels like remember Lenovo now owns them.  And it may be that Lenovo has decided that we're going to go after the low end of the market.  We're going to let we're going to let Samsung, LG and Google fight it out at the high end.  And HTC can't forget that HTC one other stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, what I can hear you mad at that talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, Matt. Oh, I was just going to say,  speaking of crazy hardware, I don't know if you guys saw some non I.O.  news, but some formal formal Google engineers, former Google engineers who are doing auto,  which is self-driving for trucks, auto eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, for 18 wheelers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that was very interesting.  We could see if we could pull up a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very cool there because they're not really focused on new big rigs.  It's all about kind of retrofitting into your existing big rig, the self-driving smarts  and and long term basically making it so that drivers of these these rigs can, you know,  go ahead and sleep in the cab.  We got this. We'll we'll continue driving.  That scares me.  Well, you take a rest because you need to rest, buddy.  So we got this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  There goes auto.  And if you think if you don't think it's scary to see a 13 ton vehicle  sparing down on you and nobody at the wheel, sounds like a Stephen King novel, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nobody to give the finger to.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there is the factor of being on the road and looking into the cab of the big rig  and realizing there's no one there yet.  You're driving right next to or in front of it.  That would be kind of frightening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And it's self-funded, apparently all the money you see funds.  They're just like, OK, we've earned enough money from our various encounters.  We're going to we're going to do it ourselves.  And that's the ultimate liberty and independence when you don't need to worry about what a VC guy says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, you know, they're crazier ideas.  I mean, this is this is one of the probably this great niche in this autonomous vehicle thing.  And probably the first place you'll see autonomous vehicles is one of the economic savings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're incredible.  But I don't want I don't want to go against the deepsters, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next, you can now add links and photos to your Twitter and it won't count against your 140 characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're so excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We waited five years for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. It's pretty funny.  Don't be immediately. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to say immediately somebody was like, so then in other words, you can just add infinite links  and go on forever and spam Twitter with pictures.  And so maybe they'll say the first link or the first picture doesn't count against you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't. Yeah, it doesn't solve the canoe problem, though.  They should not make at replies count either.  That's that should be free.  Handles should be free.  Don't be this guy.  Dad streams wife's birth on Facebook Live without telling her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So apparently what this is, I'm looking at it actually a little bit because we're going to talk about it a little bit on TNT here in a few,  is that he knew that he was recording or sharing it to his family and friends.  He didn't realize that he was broadcasting it out to Facebook Live.  So apparently there's some confusion there on what it means to live stream  when you think you're live streaming to a group versus the biggest group in the world, which is everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The video has now been viewed more than 100000 times.  And his wife, Sarah, said she definitely did not realize it at the time.  She was occupied. So she said she did, however, realize it afterwards.  Good news. Eight pound healthy baby boy.  And she did.  She was more mad about getting pregnant than she was about the video, I think she said.  Named named Zuck Zuck.  Name the baby Zuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How not to be a supportive partner in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, just crazy.  You didn't know, right?  Facebook did release I thought a very sweet 360 degree film made a Grand Central station using the first one,  using their $30000 surround 360 camera.  It's it's pretty cool.  I wonder, though, how much of it is staged and how much of it is real, because you see families kissing each other goodbye.  I mean, it's it's really kind of neat like this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure, it's staged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to think this guy's not really looking at anything.  There's there's a later. Yeah, this it feels like a lot of this was actors, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, when you watch it, you know, you're kind of looking around and then suddenly you hear a voice come in from from a different direction.  You turn around and what do you know?  They're standing perfectly, you know, a distance away from the camera.  Yeah, total conversation about something that you connect with.  But it moves away. But it's still very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It kind of shows you, though, the potential for drama.  Right. Here's the family.  They're going to say these are clearly actors are going to say goodbye to each other.  It's a kind of beautiful moment, but it gives you some idea of what this could be if you were trying to do a movie, a theater.  You know, this is not the New York I know.  Yeah, this doesn't happen.  Where's the bums?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, my parents used to drop me off outside and be like, get back to school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this. Now, honey, I want you to stay away from those bad men with the funny cigarettes.  OK, mom, mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, you know, there's a lot of overacting going on here.  There was a person taking a picture of the camera that seemed real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seemed real. Exactly. This guy.  You think that's real? Yeah, that's real.  No, I don't think it is. I honestly think this is all staged.  Here's a guy with a GoPro walking around, taking pictures of people without their knowledge.  There's a woman giving birth on Facebook Live.  It's all here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Apple Store.  Can you zoom in on the Apple Store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what's up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the Apple Store. Yeah, that's the Apple Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if I have the zooming, the zooming.  Can you look at the ceiling? Yeah.  Can you look at the ceiling? You know, it's beautiful.  And a lot of people don't know that constellations are up there.  So you should really.  Yeah, I'm getting nauseous.  You should look up there.  It's kind of pretty. I love Grand Central Station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's the actual troops protecting it with their automatic weapons.  Yeah, I feel like some of this is real.  Some of it not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, it's when we all become extras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're all extras in Mark Zuckerberg's life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the world's a stage and we're just extras in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Man also undergoes live cosmetic surgery on Facebook.  This Facebook Live thing is completely out of control.  Yes. I just want to say, and we're not going to show that video.  Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like it's periscope, right? But on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, but it's but it brings a social layer.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, 100000 people saw that burst.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What were the comments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the comments were locked into the family and friends that were watching.  So the comments were super positive, like, you got this, you're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're doing it, girl. You go, girl.  Breathe. Breathe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I made my my wife showing our family.  She would never have gone for that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I was told explicitly no cameras.  No, she knew. My wife knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I definitely.  It's definitely a conversation you have before the event.  You don't just decide on the.  I don't even. I don't even have to.  My friends and family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so it's honey. I live streamed the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Showtime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break. We'll get pics, tips, numbers, anything  you guys want to share as we wrap this up are very special this week in Google,  partly because it's on Google I.O. Day, but mostly because of the great panel  we have here, Jason Howell from TNT.  We don't usually get you on the show, and I'm thrilled to have you.  Oh, thanks for sitting right next to Jeff Jarvis, who is also at the Google Plex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The best panel ever. This is amazing.  Isn't it fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, we welcome back our dearest and oldest friend, Gina Trapani,  who we hope we'll see much more of going forward on the show.  But you know what?  You go from the frying pan to the fire.  Now you're like a big shot and you got lots to do for this digital media empire.  And I don't think I've only get her once in a while.  Probably always be around.  Yeah, we just adore you.  And of course, it wouldn't be this week in Google without the wonderful Mac cuts.  We just love having him on.  What's your 30 day challenge?  Are you on one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm kind of slacking on this one, but I'm trying to be grateful  for one, two to three things every day.  I'm not writing them down.  So it's kind of a week a month off, basically.  But, you know, I've been thankful, thankful a couple of times.  You need to be on twig counts for at least three days.  I'm thankful for being one with such a great panel.  I mean, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I actually had a bot.  A grateful bot.  Let me see if I can find that for you.  I could make that my tip of the week in the morning and night.  It sent me a text saying, what are you grateful for?  And then you enter it in what you're grateful for and it keeps track of it.  I want one that says, what are you grumpy for?  Keep your edge.  That was the first bot that I thought Poncho was driving me crazy.  Like I said, it was a stalker.  I had to block him.  But but the grateful bot, I mean, I turn it off.  But because after a while, it's like, OK, thanks.  I don't need to be needled.  But I'm grateful.  Being grateful is a very good thing.  I think that's one of the best things you could keep in your head.  Sure. Yeah.  Another good thing you could do for yourself and your loved ones to  headspace, headspace dot com slash twig.  It is the I love having a little hand.  It's probably not little, but I think of him as a little Andy putty comb in my head.  He did that great Ted talk on meditation.  Five and a half million views last time I checked.  He leads all the meditations.  You know, you know, he was a monk for a 10 year, I think 10 years.  But he also has this kind of great worldly way.  He's not there's nothing airy fairy about this.  It really is about relaxation, centering and focus.  You know, your mind can make you crazy with fear and anger and stress and anxiety.  Make it so hard to sleep, hard to get through your busy day.  Headspace can train your mind.  Think of it that way.  Ten minutes of guided meditation a day and you will feel better.  Your relationships will be better.  You'll be sleeping better.  The Take Ten program is free and it includes progress stats and a buddy feature.  So you can link up with friends to support the subscriptions to headspace,  include unlimited access to the complete headspace collection, guided  meditations for every purpose, including their SOS meditations.  Like I am really stressed right now.  I need some help.  And if you meditate for several days in a row, you get bonus gifts.  It is wonderful.  Over five million users now use headspace to bring mindfulness to their everyday  activities.  Yes, meditating is a thousands year old tradition, but it's also supported by  literally by thousands of scientific studies that show its positive effects.  It'll improve your focus.  I noticed I've been sleeping through the night.  I really was waking up at four in the morning, tense, anxious every night  for a while and I haven't done.  I just noticed that this morning.  I haven't done that in weeks.  Thank you.  Headspace, go to headspace.com slash twig.  It's free to get, take, you know, get started with a take ten program.  Ten days of guided meditation.  Uh, you know, I feel like they're really making the world a better place and  they're certainly making your mind a better place.  Ten days free headspace.com slash twig.  It's what I'm grateful for.  Um, Jason, I won't ask you for a pick because you've got, you've got all about  Android, you've got the Android app arena.  My God, you, you're, you're the last man standing when it comes to picks.  You got one.  All right.  Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Uh, we didn't talk about Google spaces at all, which is not announced at Google  IO, but it was announced a couple of days ago, which is yes, a messaging app of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sorts, uh, social app too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's like for small groups, essentially small group sharing.  Um, can you kind of get a bunch of people into a room of sorts and, uh, share on a  specific topic and I don't know, I've been playing around with it for a couple of  days, supposedly here at Google IO, each vent is going to have its own space that  attendees can kind of hop into and have kind of shared conversation around a  specific topic.  So I really, I'm hoping that that will, uh, through that experience, I'll  understand a little bit more about, you know, what situations in the future I  might opt to use spaces for.  Um, but again, we were talking earlier in the episode about Google kind of bringing  it search in all these places, search integrated into here.  So Google search inside the app instead of having to go outside of it, but also  YouTube, Chrome built in all that kind of stuff.  Um, interesting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Yeah.  Mike Elgin's got the, what he calls the largest space.  Uh, and I think he hit the limit of it says exactly 500 people.  That would be my guess that that's the limit that you can have in a space.  It feels like I can't quite figure out.  I think probably Google doesn't even know quite what it is.  Um, it could be personal, like just you and your spouse sharing stuff.  It could be a larger group.  It, it's got some of the Google plus feeling to it.  I, a little Google wave, a little wave in there.  Yeah.  Does this sound familiar?  Yeah.  And you know, I'm kind of, I don't know.  I'm, I'm hesitant to get, uh, too excited about it because gosh, I keep throwing  so much energy into different social networks with no benefit, but yeah,  this is very intriguing.  So we will see and it's free.  It's Android and iOS and web, which is nice.  Google spaces.google.com.  You can check it out.  Yeah.  Jeff, you got a number for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, well, I picked an odd one out, which is that, um, Google has had more access  to the white house since, uh, than any other lobbyists, uh, in, in the field  and the technology Joanna Shelton, Google's director of public policy visited  to the white house since Barack Obama took office 128 times.  Wow.  And the reason I mentioned that is because this is also the day when  Mark Zuckerberg out here in the Valley is supposedly meeting with a whole  bunch of conservatives to get over this kerfuffle over the land back.  When back he's meeting, Glenn back.  I put up a picture of Mark meeting with all the star Wars characters and I  thought Chewbacca was going back just to joke people don't get all mad at me.  Um, I didn't make a Bernie joke, so please stay easy, stay easy, calm down.  Um, so I, I, the, the, I'm fascinated right now with, with politics and our  alternative government out here in Mountain View and our, and our other,  the Valley and our other capital.  That was my number.  That was it.  Not very exciting, but then it's a very exciting day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's there's a lot to talk about and a short number is fine with me.  And I'm sure everybody, everybody else, Gina, I see you have a pick also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just have a really quick tip that this actually came out a couple of  weeks ago, but it was new to me.  Um, little tip in the, in the play store, you know, the play store is showing  you now if an app, uh, contains ads, it says it right up front, all right on the  10, um, you know, when you go to the play store, it would tell you if an app has  in-app purchases, well, now there's a little tag that says contain ads.  So, uh, so you can tell whether or not they're going to be ads in  the app that you download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As it should.  I love that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  A little bit, a little bit more transparency about what you're getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've, they did that with in-app purchases first and now they're  doing it with ads.  That's fantastic.  Yep.  Yep.  I'll give you Matt cuts.  If you want a chance to flog anything you want or tell people about  something you like or nothing, it's up to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  Uh, so I haven't mentioned it in a while, but if you type into Google,  Google webmaster blog, we have a blog with lots of useful resources.  So for example, there's something about a mobile friendly testing tool.  That's a brand new blog post that just went out a couple of days ago and you  can type in any URL like google.com and it will say, yes, this page is mobile  friendly.  Um, but that's just one blog post.  They've, they've, you know, if you look at the last thing that they're talking  about, something called rich cards, which is, uh, basically taking rich snippets  and making it so that you can do better things with structured data, which, uh,  some people have been asking us, you know, how do you, how do you feel about  structured data these days?  So this is, you know, a nice way to, to bolster the fact that we do care about  that.  And if you keep going, you'll find out things like how web spam, the web spam  team fought web spam in 2015, which is very interesting blog post to me at  least.  So, uh, yeah, the Google webmaster blog is there, lots of free resources to  help you make better websites and do better in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, I can't show you my pick because I don't have a Chromebook in front of me,  but those, you guys have Chromebooks in front of you and maybe Matt, you could  tell me how new this is.  I just discovered it one day.  I opened the files app in my Chromebook and I noticed I could add additional,  um, file systems to it, including Dropbox and SFTP.  So, and, and web dev.  So if you have a Dropbox account and you want the files on your Chromebook to  show up as part of your file system, you just add it and it's really easy to, I  know.  Do you know when they added this guys?  Cause this is the first time I just like what, whoa.  Uh, same as secure FTP, which is great.  So if you have a secure FTP server running somewhere, this would be a great  way to add additional storage, uh, for your Chromebook that a secure safe place  you could keep that stuff.  And it's part of the files hierarchy.  So it just shows up as another folder in your files hierarchy.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, yeah, now, Matt, you probably knew all about that, but I, I, I actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  didn't know about this.  So it says install new web services or, and you can, you can have Dropbox  windows, one drive SFTP, all sorts of great stuff.  Isn't that awesome?  That is quite cool.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Another reason to love Chrome OS and how, how common are Chromebooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  really with staff here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, with staff here, very popular.  I mean, it's basically whenever China hacked Google, there was a move away  from windows and interesting.  Oh, interesting.  It's usually Mac books or Chromebooks around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and Dave Schneider's crouton, which we've talked about before.  And I used, and I know Jeff, you use it to put Skype on your Chromebook.  Um, and I'd kind of pride.  Yeah.  I thought it was kind of a hacky thing when I used it a couple of years ago.  It's gotten better and better and better.  And you can now put Debian on there.  You could put other distributions.  They have all sorts of nice features in this.  He's really, uh, up the ante.  And then of course, contributors have up the ante because you can create  your own charute and, and you're you, what do you got there?  You got it?  You're downloading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we're getting the, we're getting the, uh, Android is  upgrading optimizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you're, they haven't gotten rid of it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason, maybe the last time, the last time it will never again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, what is it doing when it's doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be, well, they said, um, the just in time compiler made it  better with, uh, right.  Maybe, I mean, there's the Android runtime, the art stuff.  And so maybe it's recompiling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, you know, I remember reading at one point, was it symbol tables or something?  Do you remember Gina why it has to take all that time churning through every app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should have taken the time that I was waiting for it to be done to read.  I would have had, I would have had the time to do that, but it has to do with,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it has to do with Dalvik and art.  And, and, uh, I believe it's pre-compiling, uh, in some way.  Cause remember, uh, these are, these are JVMs that are, uh, being used on the  system, uh, can read byte code, but they also can read something a little bit more,  uh, close to the metal.  And I believe that that's what's going on.  That there's a, some sort of pre-compile step.  I read about this once and I don't, but anyway, it's a pain in the fricking button.  I'm so glad they're getting rid of it.  Thank you.  So this, do we have the new JIT now?  Is that once we do this update, is it, we say goodbye to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it's in this beta version, but it sounds like they're  shooting for it to be in it.  Oh, it'd be so nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
