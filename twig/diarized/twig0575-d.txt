Transcript:  Depressed today don't blame you don't blame Carson because I bookmarked those two and they're probably all stuff  I bookmarked as well. I bookmark them, but doesn't mean we have to talk about  Did you see that Herman Cain tweeted?  That's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's that gave me some levity during some dark times. Oh man gotta cut those burritos out so

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's weird is he tweeted an anti-biden video?  So who is doing the Cain gang obviously not Herman from hell  Wow, he's keeping up on the election though, you got to respect a guy  No, so I by the way he vote to you you're you're gonna hear this here first, but I think you're gonna hear  more of this  Twitter has apparently placed somewhat of a hold on  Banning trolls and things I've been getting emails, you know  I regularly go through the things and and requests stuff taken down and  I've been getting emails saying due to kovat  We're busy and never and then never hearing again  I've been checking with some other people services that do this and so forth and they're saying yes  I'm weird going on a Twitter for the last two weeks. No takedowns been more than two weeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've been seeing that for at least a month. Yeah, and then  this morning a very well known

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  rumor guy the walking cat  Who we've used for a long time or referred to a long time on  Windows weekly because he does a lot of Windows tweets  was banned he tweeted some information  From the Intel event which happened this morning right before the Intel event obviously a leak  not anything we hadn't heard before and boom his  His is his page is gone  That's weird. So they are banning something but they're banning something  That's weird, so they are banning something but apparently not taking requests  It's like that radio station  Where you call up and they know we don't take requests

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, so so it makes you wonder why would he be he or she be banned?  Is it just strictly because of rumor of it rumor mill or what? Well, but he's been saying he's been doing these kinds of leaks for

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Several years. He's very well known. He's one of the well-known leakers often very accurate  Does it that Intel has so much clout that they can call up?  Jack Dorsey saying and Jack and you can you help us out here and boom he's gone or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or the the algorithms going a little nutty. I think so Molly's young fast, right? Is that how I said? Yeah, I love her  Yeah, she's great and a friend of mine Kate Kloneck  Who's an expert in law and section 230 and Facebook and stuff?  She tweeted a scene where Molly was like on something and she said stop that or I'll kill you  Obviously to a kid or a dog and just quoted that and she got warned for her account being taken down

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think quoted I'll kill you. So it's clearly algorithm. I think everybody's gone home. We know that and the and it's just the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just the algorithms now, did you know about the Twitter account called VC Bragg's? Yeah  So it's gone now. It's not gone. It's stopped. Why it's a kid. It's a kid. It's a kind of a funny story  So there was speculation because if VCs evidently hate VC Bragg's  Yeah, because it's a it's a parody account, right?  and so they have VCs have no they have too much money and no sense of humor and so  VC Bragg's brags all the time about who's blocking them what major VCs are blocking them, right?  So one person who's was a VC and is now  Has a company and gets VC money  There was some joking rumor that it was him because everyone wonders who is this person and he played along for a day because  Clearly couldn't be him because he was a VC and that I know well then people actually thought it was him  And so it was getting too close for comfort. So whoever it is who runs VC Bragg's said, okay  This has been fun, but I'm gonna stop  Really?  That said the stories are but in that I went when I was doing my research this morning try to find happier topics like this  I  Found the example of I saw the work of VC Bragg's and  Professor cold takes is just brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Professor professor cold which I'll let you find is the new  VC Bragg's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, he's a subject of VC Bragg's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like Galloway, I think it's pretty fun  As long as I feel good, you know, I think I think it'll be worthwhile  I thought that'd be funnier

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's here's this is the official trailer for professor cold takes on the campus of New York Stern School of Business

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  comes a respected academic  successful entrepreneur  generous philanthropist  best-selling author and  devoted family man  He's living the American dream  But there's just one problem he just can't seem to get his business predictions, right

Transcript:  Tesla's gonna take a dive  Dropping below a hundred dollars a share in the next year. Yeah, why will it drop below a hundred missed on that one?

Transcript:  You know  Our spat between him and Calcannis

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Galloway and Calcannis. Oh, I don't know. I don't know who I root for in that one. Oh man. That's a hard one

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This it was entertaining  You know Galloway took it is is stalking if you will from Calcannis, but I think they were I think  Some of his previous

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  People getting fights on Twitter all the time and it's like please get off Twitter just don't it's you're not doing anybody  You're not doing yourself a favor. Just stop it. I learned my lesson years ago and  Getting in a fight with people like Calcannis

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo was reading something intently. I asked him. What are you reading? He's gonna laugh at me  I said go ahead tell me I'm gonna laugh at you and he said Twitter. He was engrossed in Twitter. He was enjoying  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Clear I was engrossed to Twitter because as usual with Twitter, I'm trying to understand  Am I having a stroke or does this tweet make no sense?  That's pretty much my reaction. It's like what are they talking about? I guess I'm just not part of the Twitter roti

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I gotta I still stand by you needing to better curate your Twitter experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I stand by my get get off of all so shit off of it  All-social media all of it except tick-tock stay on tick-tock. Oh, come on. We're waiting supposedly  Tick-tock  would be  They said it would be Tuesday the announcement and that who had acquired tick-tock  Microsoft in a consortium with Walmart and  Who else is involved in that one Microsoft Walmart and then there's the Oracle bid so there's at least two doors  But then I think  Actually, Mary Jo Foley nailed it earlier today on Windows Weekly when she said no  It's a big there's a long weekend coming up  Everything they're gonna we're gonna have the biggest news dump in the history of the world  4 p.m. Friday and and among all of the things that they'll announce is who bought tick-tock  What I'm really curious is how well compensated the US is gonna be the press  The president's phrase that the US better be well compensated  By whoever buys tick-tock understand how it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Acquisitions work

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He said he said okay president Donald. This is from Bloomberg  Donald Trump says he's told people involved in the sale of  bite-dances tick-tock the deal a must be struck by September 15th and B the federal government must be well  Compensated or this service will be shut down  It's like I don't even I I just can't what he's got the power right right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he doesn't actually he doesn't have the power to do this that's I said that tongue-in-cheek and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's looking out for the United States interests  Either we get well paid or we're gonna shut it down. Well, is it a security threat or not?  I don't understand. I don't get any of it. So I wrote a post about this yesterday. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and and I got really upset  Because it was about this and was about the Australians demanding  That's another money from right any money from Facebook, which we can talk about together  But but shutting down tick-tock should be a First Amendment issue because it is the press of the people  Even if it's owned by China, I don't care  It's the it's what people are using and and we have to grapple with that fact that we have a First Amendment  Well, then China can't make laws because

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  China does actually influence  China does influence who can post what people see on tick-tock. So if they can we can't by law, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay  That's the difference right and so if we choose to use it if the people of the America are abused as their press and they  Now have a press finally and that press gets taken away from them. I still argue that as a First Amendment violation

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's really an interest. I mean it I think it's very complicated. I think that's a legitimate point of view  I think also the the the theory people held by people like Amy Webb that  But it is also a political arm of the Chinese government and as a result we have to be very careful  About it because it could be used against us is also a legitimate point of view  I don't honestly know what the bright answer is on that one  Let's let's move on because there's many many other things that can cause Jeff's blood pressure to go up and I want to make

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  sure I was never will never know the right answer on that and that's what makes this story so  Difficult for us. I think as Americans because we're absolutists in ways and we believe there is a central truth  Oh, you will never know the central truth because  It's China in China. They don't have a central truth

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We deal with they do and we don't under under the president  that's one of the kind of central tenets of I believe his is a  strategy is  Confuse everything as much as possible so that you can't say with any certainty what's going on  That's actually a pretty good strategy  Well for me squirrel I just pay no attention after  You just give up so you're right and we don't like we don't like that. Do we Stacy?  We don't like living in that gray area between we we hate it. Yeah  Yeah  Do you think that's human or is that uniquely American? I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Think Americans tend to be uncomfortable with  Gray  We want to make definitive stations, I think you're right. I think you're right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's part of our national character because you know why because we believe in good and right and wrong good and evil  we believe in that and we believe ever you know, you can you can judge and  We get really stymied when there's something that is like, I don't know. Is it good or bad?  I don't know. It's is it k. It's chaotic neutral  We don't do well with that  We're chaotic neutral. Yeah, chaotic neutral. I don't know what that is  Google wants to build a new village. I would now would you like to live in Google town?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yo, I would live in Google Island. Remember we were gonna move there. No, because I don't want to stay in my RV 24-7

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is actually so this I think is specific and excuse me, it's not an RV

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a tiny house tiny house

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Will stop living in the parking lot  They want to build a village next to their campus and other Mount Mountain View tech hubs. It'll be called middle middle field park  Look look look little black children and little white children playing together in the in the water coming out of the ground

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, wait a minute. There's also they're taking showers because they can't have nobody can afford to have a home with a shower cafe  It's it's that's Ellis Plaza late. Is that is that a that's a self-driving bus in the background you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, that's the light rail that already exists. Oh, yeah  It would dramatically re sculpt a large area now dominated by old tech buildings and huge parking lots  That that is a really ugly ugly area  Those tilt ups and everything right  They it's 1600 homes  Between East Middlefield Road, that's where the name comes from and State Route 237. I know exactly where that is  Middlefield Park near Middlefield Road is  new housing  In fact both Apple and Google have both  Pledged a lot of hundreds of millions of dollars to fix the housing problem in Silicon Valley and Facebook too  I think all three. Yeah, because nobody can afford to live there  And they can't it's hard to attract employees now, I think one solution is to say well you don't have to I  Suspect that's gonna be a big part of the post-covid world as people working from off-site  Yep off way off site. My city's from there. Yeah  Google's development 37% open space 30% office space 24% residential only 6% parking  2% retail and 1% civic uses  It's an interesting idea I apparently  Mountain View wants to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The housing crisis is so awful, yeah  Would the tax base for this be better than those office buildings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If the office buildings are vacant, yes, and I suspect this is and at least at this time. This is probably a concern

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Or they just trying to get that are they underwriting like what role does Google have in this other than pushing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a good question. I'm reading through this

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just I'm trying to understand if this is going to be strictly a Google property for Google employees and guests  Or is this not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because nobody wants any we don't want company towns coming back. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Google is it does own this is building this maybe they even already own the  They were buying up a lot of land. Yeah, 12 acres of open space, which is pretty nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is where they can put their their smart cities thing and we can go and marvel at the true  Utopia dystopian future take that Toronto

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because I talked to a lot of  Tech industry utopians who have this vision of smart  Cities or smart villages or smart apartment buildings. This is a very common fantasy  In the in the in the Silicon Valley world  There's somebody's doing this in Vegas. You know, you're talking to the expert in it right there. Who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey are you the expert tea or she's smart homes  You know utopias what smart nobody has a smarter home that Stacey well  She would take over the I'm sure Seattle if she could but she starts with her own base  Nobody has a smarter home than Stacey. Well, she would take over the I'm sure Seattle if she could but she starts with her own base  Nobody has a smarter home than Stacey. I can bought them

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's actually not true right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I heard there's no windows in her house. That's what I heard the new ones not yet  So this is interesting it is it's a debate not I don't think it's been approved by the  Mountain View City Council yet, but you know, they love these guys  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But it's unclear like is Google gonna own if Google owns the land  You know, are they gonna pay to develop the housing or are they gonna work? There's a Canadian developer

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm sorry Australian developer that they're that they're working with  Lend lease a developer with global scope. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, then Lisa's big they're huge  And they've worked with Google on some other things. Okay, so they're working with them. They're gonna build the houses  Do people buy the houses or do people rent the houses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I imagine that  There also be a little bit of give-and-take with the City Council, you know  Usually what happens with city governments they say okay  We want 23 percent to be low-income housing which you know, we want certain amount to be for sale  We want a certain amount to be rent. I mean, I suspect that all of that is still to TBD  But I think this is very interesting  It is kind of it is a little bit of company town though, isn't it really I mean, that's kind of interesting  It's a very Larry page idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is it something like do you have to work at Google to be able to live there?  I don't know and if you do work there what happens when you get fired, right?  I mean, we already tire health insurance to our board. Do we want to tie our living arrangements? Hey, I like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I want a cradle to grave Google town

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Out there I'm there you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But what about that what about that what if you as a young family could move to  cradle to grave Google Google town and  Google takes care of you Google basically runs the local government because they're smarter than the average bear and they're used data and  The traffic lights are always just right and there's always exactly the right amount of pizza available and all of that  Yeah, there's gummy bears in every department, you know just  What if and then?  Then a guaranteed pension when you hit 65 and a half

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get Google retired. Oh and the and the death benefits of Google are amazing. Are they? Oh, yeah  Yeah, your family is really taking care of you get and then the funny thing is you move in and four years later

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Google's closes it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In typical Google fashion

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, we're gonna tear it all down. Yeah  Mountain View voice says it is a mix of rental and for sale housing units predominantly in the form of stacked flats that could maximize  The number of residential units in the area would include 20% affordable housing units. God knows how you define affordable on the valley  Yeah, depending upon how many units are built  would create  335 to 370 deed restricted units for low-income housing. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like that idea that all of that is mixed in but I have concerns on a personal level far as if I was  working for Google or whatever like  You know full-time employee at Google, I don't know if I necessarily want to live that close to work it's just  Personally, I need some a little bit more separation and you know, like where I live now here in Northern, California  I'm just enough to be far away from the studio to feel that I'm not at work, you know  It's comfortable that way. I've had people in my past at previous  Employers where they lived around the block and their phone always ringed and they were always at the office and I never thought that was  Healthy and nor did I think it was fair to do that as your toy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But on the other hand ant having a having had until March an hour and 45 minute each way commute  Being near work sounds like heaven to me and that's why I'm kind of yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right and then I did have some scenarios where I used to live an hour away and I hated being that far away  Yeah, I agree. There was a sweet spot, you know being just enough far away  But how long does it take you to get close where they can say?  Hey, can you come in and unplug and replug this thing in for us? You know, that's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, how long does it take you to get into the studio when you go there?  Pardon, how long does it take you to get to the studio when you actually used to go there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  15 minutes 20 minutes tops. Yeah, that sounds lovely to me. I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I've always basically had the five minute commute. So or two minute 30 second  I don't really know. Do we count like bedroom to coffee to desk? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have a trailer from the Google Village a concept  This is just an example of what it will be like when you wake up  in your stacked flat  in Google Town USA just peek out the window the perfectly manicured lawns

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Thought it was gonna be pleasant bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now are you too young to remember the prisoner Stacy I am too young to remember  One of the greatest shows of all time  He's no sense. It makes no sense. He's a secret agent who decides to get out  But it turns out when you leave the British Secret Service you end up being sent to the village  Which is full of kind of Stepford wife types and you can't escape  Every time you do it. I a giant ball tracks you down and brings you back

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you remember this and I know I've never heard of this  I need to watch it just for the hilarity. I am a free man. I am NOT a number

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is black mirror before there was black. Oh, it was the greatest it was the greatest it was great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when did it when did it premiere? We were probably too young for the premiere

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, we didn't know. Yeah, I don't think I would have gotten it  But I I definitely saw it soon after I was probably middle school. It was British. So we didn't see it in the US

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Public radio public TV. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Never seen Patrick McGoon who was great  And the funny part is and I was a big fan of secret agent  which was the show prior to that where he played a James Bond style secret agent and so there was a certain amount of  In inside joke when his next thing was the prisoner about a secret agent who leaves the Secret Service  And is trapped in the village. I  Always loved Patrick McGo and I think he was one of my favorite actors in the back in the day  Google is pulling or maybe pulling Fediverse  Apps now we have a Fediverse  mastodon incident instance called twit dot social  And one of the great things about the Fediverse it is a it's a competitor to Twitter  But it is decentralized  So if you go to twit dot social you'll sign up for a mastodon account and  Then we federate with other mastodon instances and there's software that you could put on iOS or Android that lets you join  the Fediverse  Google has warned it's going to pull many of these programs from the Play Store for and  This is interesting interesting problem inciting hate speech  Android titles like Fed a lab husky and subway tutor  Help you connect to twit social, but also help you connect to things like gab when gab  was shut down for being  home to  Neo-nazis and so forth they moved to a fork for mastodon  They became part of the Fediverse now every mastodon instance. I'm part of including our own  Blocks gab and other you know nazi sites certainly neo-nazis are a problem on Twitter  Interesting that Google wants to shut it down not by not by you know trying to shut down these Fed or Fediverse sites like gab  but by blocking the clients the apps as of  Couple of days ago are still on the Play Store according to a gadget  So maybe that maybe they thought better of it after getting some publicity  Interesting conundrum do you  This is what people to get try to do to Google right with the right to be forgotten  Well, we're not gonna pull down those sites that have articles. We don't like we'll just pull them from the search results  So you they they don't exist  Pull it on the Fediverse  Yeah, I think it's overreaching and it would hurt us. I mean twit social is I mean  It's not exactly the most vibrant place in the whole in the world  This is the problem with mastodon in general is that it's um  It's not well known I think  right  So I actually am NOT logged in on this machine that shows you how often but because it's not centralized  You can't say one thing or another  You can pull down any given server. I guess or complain about a given any given server, but but you can't  attribute any particular kind of content  To it to the Fediverse as a whole or can you I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is when a lawyer is needed  Yeah, maybe sounds like loophole city. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, don't know. I didn't I didn't know there was a Fediverse. I feel kind of ignorant with that social

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here it is. If you want to visit the Fediverse  Go go right on in there  Because you know it looks a lot like tweet deck right instead of tweeting you toot  because the  Sounds like you fart wait well the mascot is a mastodon. No beings needed. So it's an elephant

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  mastodon  like a  Conglomeration of mastodon servers is the Fediverse. Yeah, so Matt will mess up

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So mastodon is and there is mastodon dot social which is Eugene's home server  But what it really is is software and a protocol and so we set for instance  I set up a twit dot social server running on a different server, but if so my address is twit dot social  twit dot social at Leo and  If you are on mastodon dot social you can follow twit dot social at Leo. That's my fully  Qualified name and then my toots will show up in your stream  Yeah, I think I could do without your toots

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just like no don't eat them don't want them

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way, did you see the Washington Post story today about toilets and COVID?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well we knew that never go to the bathroom. We suspected it's worse. It's worse. Yeah, so the issue is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so the issue is  Well, we've said for they've said experts have said for a while that COVID can be spread  both through saliva and through poop and  The problem is if you go to public restroom and once you flush the toilet as you know that  You know kind of aerosol  It's a yes, by the way those Dyson hand dryers too. They're really good at that as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So yeah, but you know what usually when you put your hands under the Dyson you've washed them so  That's a little oh  Really? So you wash them first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That makes a lot more sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm like every time people are like freaking out about that. I'm like, but your hands are clean

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, but it also picks up whatever is in the air and  The problem with COVID is it I think really now it's kind of widely accepted. It's an aerosolized spread  That's the real problems not fomites. It's the air  Problems not fomites. It's the aerosol. That's at least what I read. You're the one who follows all these people on Twitter. Mm-hmm, but  There is actually a toilet or a Dyson is an excellent aerosolizer  And so you go into a public restroom there could be a you know  And these it once it's aerosolized it can last for many hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There could be just this floating cloud unless unless you change the air in the room like right you have to have an hour  You have to really ventilate  So by the way, what if there's put the seat down before you flush if you have a lid but many men's rooms do not

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have lids. Yeah, most public ones don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, but even in your home y'all like I sometimes see people public in their house and they've got their toothbrush in their bathroom  Thought of that Stacy. Oh, you need to like always shut that lid before you flush

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yep  Well, I think we've all learned something today  Maybe we should take a break for a commercial  To that Toto is not a sponsor any longer I would really love to do a Toto ad right now  The Toto washlet would be perfect here. We've they were a sponsor  Oh, I love them even more now. Oh, I have three of them  We every bathroom in our house has a Toto I got the first one. I had to convince Lisa  She said I don't you it's one of those Japanese bidet toilets. Yeah, and  You've used ours  No, she did I didn't she did. Oh she did. Okay, so I said Lisa we should get this to be really cool  Because I think we'd even use them in Japan and she said  so I said just we'll just try it so we put it in the master and  She said after a month or two we had him everywhere because it's like  Anyway, that's not our sponsor today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is twig not last we can Toto no we had Toto washlets were a sponsor for what I think it was actually a way a  Wayfair co-op so I think was actually a wayfarer ad or wherever they were. Yeah, I think they were selling through wayfarer  So who is today's sponsor Leo? Well, I'm glad you asked a see Higginbotham. It's last pass here  We are in the last pass studios. Oh, we're putting together a good last best event for you know, October is security  Next month is security month. So we're gonna do a couple of events all around security  We're gonna do a last pass event and I pitched this to them and I thank you last pass for going for it  we're gonna have red teams and blue teams we're gonna have hackers and  Defenders and the hacker team is gonna come up with an attack and they're gonna fire it at the defenders and then the defending  Team which will consist of a security experts will say well, here's how we would defend against that  I think it's gonna be a lot of fun and I think we'll learn an awful lot  So stay tuned for the details on that last pass event coming up. It's I think our third last pad event a past event of the year  We've really been having fun doing these, you know last passes, of course last pass is all about what they call in the biz  IAM  identity and  access  Management, I think a lot of people think of last pass as a password vault and it's sure it's that in fact  It's the best password vault ever I stored more than passwords in there my  Passports my driver's license social security numbers PGP keys anything that needs to be  Securely stored but available on all my devices last pass is the place to put it but it's so much more than just a vault  Normally you think of security. It's either security or convenience, you know one of the other you can't have both  But single sign as a perfect example something that's more secure better than passwords and it's more convenient  You just press yes on your phone and you're logged in you want your employees to use last pass  To protect them and you want to and your and not just them but your most vital resources your banking your databases  Customer records things like that, but you want it. It has to be convenient or they won't use it plus you want a  Centralized view of what they're doing. You always you need to know who has access to what from where?  Especially with employees at home, right? They're no longer coddled in the umbrella of the IT department  They're on their own networks which come and go they're up and down  You want to make sure that if it looks like Joe from accounting is logged into QuickBooks  It really is Joe from accounting not Demetri from so but Sebastopol. So it's really important  really important that you use last pass enterprise password management gives  Oversight a shadow IT and and enforceable policies for instance. We require two factor of all our employees  We have minimum master password requirements  Multi-factor authentication. This is so sweet. It's more than just fingerprint or face recognition  It's sure it uses biometrics, but also uses a contextual factors things like IP address and geolocation  It makes the process even easier for employees and it makes you more secure  And if you're sharing passwords, and you know all employees share passwords and they're at home  You don't want them texting or emailing passwords to their colleagues last pass makes it easy and safe for employees to share logins  Keeping access to your data safe. There's a completely secure channel within last pass for password sharing  Employees will always have their passwords with them. They can access  The the things they need to do to get the job done no matter where they're working from any device Android iOS Mac Windows Linux everything  Working remotely is actually more convenient not more frustrating and it you'll rest easy knowing your business is secure with last pass  We as ten years ago Steve Gibson was shown every bit of last pass the creator Joe Segrist gave him the tour  Steve was blown away a ES 256 bit encryption. They use PBK DF 2 which is the  Key derivative factor which makes it hard to brute force any password they use salted hashes  I mean they do it all right and Steve verified that said yep  This is it this is the way you should we should do it your data is decrypted and encrypted only at the device level  Your password is never sent to last pass  It's secret from everyone including from last pass the number one password manager, but a whole lot more last pass  Premium last pass for families. That's what Lisa and I use at home and at work  We use last pass enterprise let last pass securely manage your users identity  Letting your employees work efficiently without making your business vulnerable to cyber threats last pass comm slash twit  That's the address we use it you should use it and we are so grateful to last pass for not only keeping us  Secure but for supporting this week in Google and all of our efforts here at twit. They are the of course the  Naming rights sponsor for the twits last past studios, and we really appreciate it last past comm  slash  Twit I thought this was a very provocative and kind of interesting article. I know Jeff you're gonna laugh at it from  glad Edelman  Should this is in wired should Google's ad market be regulated like the stock market  Edelman is an expert in antitrust and his point is kind of interesting  He says  Actually, he's quoting  A  Antitrust scholar Dina Sreenivasan  Who has written a paper the antitrust case she wrote the antitrust case against Facebook last year  Now in the Stanford technology law review she review she has a new paper  In which she talks about how the Google ad market works, and I've always had a kind of vague idea a vague understanding of it  It's fairly complex. This is the auction. We've talked about before  Here's here's how Edelman describes it when you see an ad online  On a website for instance not on our podcast but on websites for instance the odds are very high  The advertiser used Google to buy the ad the website used Google to put the space up for sale  Google's exchange matched them together in other words Google runs both the largest exchange  Exchange and competes as the biggest buyer and seller on that exchange  It also on top of that owns YouTube one of the biggest suppliers of ad inventory  meaning it's competing against publishers on its own platform and  Sreenivasan argues this is exactly what antitrust law was created to protect against  But nobody even thinks twice about it there there apparently is no regulatory  Oversight of digital advertising  Well because if YouTube wasn't even hold on be a concern  Yes, absolutely, but go ahead Jeff. Oh go ahead. Go ahead. You guys are too polite

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was wondering if YouTube wasn't in the picture would this be a concern but also just what are the other options?  There was what was that Bing right?  It's not a man. It's not that is it that they're not able to capture more of them  More of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's both ends of a market that's the problem. It's the same problem as when the movie companies owned the movie theaters  And and it's a classic antitrust case they were forced to divest you can't own both  The the distribution and the product

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Car manufacturing right so two things about this  I've always said that where Google is most vulnerable is not search  It's advertising and it does have the power of God and advertising and and they needed to be more mindful of that as they went  however  The way these exchanges work if if I want to app Nexus which was bought by Oracle which is huge which actually invented  Programmatic advertising and that's where I do by it's still it's still interoperates with Google  So it's not as if Google is a closed world  The auctioning the bidding occurs across multiple trading floors  So that might be the problem is Google has the biggest on both sides yes, no question and by double-click and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  they compete against  Every other product because they own well  You're on their exchange, and they're selling ads on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the other thing to consider is right so if Google I've always talked about this if Google were an old-style  Media company they would have been a closed network  And they would have said Google has lots of traffic and lots of audience and we're gonna  We're like Yahoo or like the New York Times or Connie Nast we sell our audience  What the market will bear but of course Google didn't do that with ad sense  It said Google said we're gonna put ads across anybody who wants them  And so we're gonna send billions of dollars literally billions of dollars to media companies everywhere because our ads benefit  media everywhere and  So it's the models are so off  From what media used to be media used to be about scarcity and controlling scarcity Google is about  Advantage in abundance and so any law that exists is irrelevant for how this operates not because it's sneaky  but because it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's just taking advantage of a new reality if this sounds familiar you may remember when Senator Pichai was testifying in front of Congress  Pramila Jayapal from Washington actually cited the paper  She said the problem is Google controls all these entities, so it's running the marketplace  It's acting on the buy side. It's acting on the sell side at the same time which a major conflict of interest  It allows you to set rates very low as a buyer of ad space for newspapers  Which has hurt them rights to pride them of ad revenue and then well also sell high  at the same time as you're setting it low for the the  Newspaper you setting it high for the small businesses who depend on advertising on your platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So actually Leo no, this is where I've had this argument with people in the newspaper business  I'm I'm saying I'll tell you two sides of this  I've said to them why the fact when the New York Times when when Google announced ad sense  I was there that day and I'm not old  The New York Times was at the press conference at the event saying we're gonna do this and I turned to the vice president  Of the New York Times at the time who I knew well  It's why the hell you do I said I said why the hell are you doing this? Why you let Google in and  The argument I heard is not of the New York Times  But especially from smaller papers was I can expose my ad inventory to advertisers  I could never possibly ever in a million years sell to you  Yeah, but it ended up being a deal with the devil  Well it then right so then the next problem is of course it commodified them  Because what matters is the data about the user not the environment and it lowered the prices because it was that's what abundance does

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, I was at that's by the way event that was and I have to give credit to Adam Curry for for  Crystallizing this in my mind. I don't give Adam pretty much credit at all for anything, but I do give him credit for this  that's the key because  Display ads in a newspaper were a limited  Scarce commodity right digital ads are unlimited. There's no scarcity at all. What's some more? We'll make some more  So it's a very different environment and that what happens when something becomes a commodity as opposed to a scarce  Entity is the price falls right because it's a it's commoditized. Well. It's just just abundance alone now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we had an event at the school. It was under Chatham House rule  So I won't say who it was but I had a major executive not from Google. I'll say that  from the programmatic ad world and  This executive looked at the media people. I had I had top-level C level people media people in the room and he he he or she  Scolded them and said why the hell are you on programmatic programmatic was intended to get more inventory for direct response  It commodifies you you shouldn't be there. You should be selling directly. What the hell and  One of the executives in the room who was a digital  pure play executives said  Yes, but sorry bud  I gotta go where the ad dollars are and all the ad agencies and all the ad dollars are in programmatic  They think they get these great deals and so I throw I have to put my advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So what about the premise should Google's ad market be regulated like the stock market

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should it be regulated? Yes, like the stock market. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She writes that on the 13 US stock exchanges combined about 50 million trades happen every day on  Google's market alone  trade desk  tens of billions of transactions tens of billions of transactions every day because every little ad because an ad costs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five cents. Yeah  you know stock costs and stock is a scarcity by the way and  Costs dollars  Every time you open a page folks and in the time it takes for that ad to come onto the page  All of this auctioning is occurring in the background  And wait a minute. That's really important

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, the minute you hit a page and starts loading the auction begins  Yes, and it happens within the  milliseconds of loading time  Before that adds displayed to you there's been a bidding war and the highest bidder has won that ad yes. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow based on based on not on  Environmental data that is not on a boot ad on a boot page in GQ but based on  Cookie data. This is what may change right because of cookies and browsers and all that changing  But the the data about you is more vibrant the other part of this is so called retargeting or remarketing ads  You went to Amazon you looked at some boots those friggin boots follow you around for three months  Even though you bought the goddamn things which by the way is come on. What don't be so scared about the big  Efficiency, that's actually not good. Yeah, incredibly stupid. Yeah  But that that data point about you boot interested buyer  Consumer is more valuable than any environment  So you're looking at a weather site or a sports site or a food site the damn boots are there because that's how remarketing  Retargeting and programmatic work together you may remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That some months ago Google announced. Yeah, we've decided cookies are a privacy violation  We're gonna knock that off. The new Chrome browser will turn off third-party cookies  And everybody cheered Google's doing the you know, God's work to protect your privacy I am being the skeptic I am  Said well that must be because they've got some better system. In fact  Yesterday on security now Steve Gibson talked about the better system, which is essentially a perfect fingerprinting system  That any anybody, you know anybody can run if they have if you load their page that identifies you much better than cookies  did so  Google said well, you don't need them anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right everybody hated cookies once we discovered cookies were like, oh, I don't like cookies  Then we got super cookies and we're really against those and then now basically this is kind of like a super cookie. Isn't it? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  so  the title

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Come on now, come on get some Pepto or something. That's just  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you were talking about tooth

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The title of security now last yesterday is I know what you did last summer  It's the it's the end piece of it and he talks about  Fingerprinting it doesn't even need to be a cookie. They for instance  when you load a page that's the the page in the background can load another page with sites on it and  Can tell if you've been to those sites or not. They can actually read your in effect  Read your internet history  And by doing so it depends the more sites you visit the more accurately they can do this but by doing so they can  Uniquely identify you so here's so here's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fine. That's you know, that's so so I just put up something on on the rundown at the bottom under other Alex Stamos  Linked to Kevin Munger who linked to a new paper that found that  politically  targeted advertising  Basically doesn't do Jack and all the talk about  micro-targeting and it's gonna change people's brains and they're making a fortune and da da da and Alex is just joking that that  You know the salespeople at Google and Facebook  Yeah, because it out says the political advertising is a small part of the revenue  But if this if this goes to larger level micro targeting advertising what this study says is doesn't actually do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is this is  Steve was quoting a paper  That's kind of interesting  story is it was delivered at the 16th use NICS on usable privacy and security and  They duplicated a paper from eight years ago  the paper from 2012 was called why Johnny can't browse in peace on the uniqueness of web browsing history patterns and  This second paper said well, we're gonna go back and duplicate that methodology and see if it's gotten better or worse  They identified  919 distinct browsing profiles of which 99% are unique  High uniqueness holds even when histories are truncated to just 100 top sites  so  Basically, if they could just see the last hundred sites you visited they can pick you out  with 99% accuracy from from  50,000 other people I guess from an infinite number of other people that you are you you are absolutely unique  so yeah, so that's a  if  You know really interesting. This is from  three Mozilla  Researchers why we can't still browse in peace and this is why you know  Do not track and third-party cookies and all of that stuff just hand-waving at this point. Yeah, it has  Modern browsers can get so much information about you in all sorts of sneaky ways and they can clearly identify you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but it may not do nearly as much good as the ad industry is trying to tell people well

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Absolutely, I mean that that's the part of it that you referred to that doesn't work which is this you know this  Targeting  And I know I think that's probably because the back ends aren't very well done  You know its recommendation engines are notoriously awful look at Amazon look at Netflix. They just don't wait some

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is ever time I'm sorry to say this another show supported by advertising but  Especially when it gets out of that level how effective is it right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know you know I buy a lot of pretty good for me. Yeah Instagram ads they work

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Like I use YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I use YouTube quite a bit and  I'm always hitting like or dislike on things that I watch because I watch YouTube as if I'm watching regular TV and the  recommendations for the last several years have just been a  Dream for me because I I've said it I've said the algorithm and  it's not uncommon for me at the end of the day to go downstairs and turn on TV and fire up YouTube and watch hours of  random stand-up comics or  Something about photography or what it knows what I like and it does a good job, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right that worse ant. Do you see ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The ads you yeah, the ads is another story because I never see them I paid you pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Where do you get sucked in Stacy oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I you know I get sucked in  Because I've looked at something like maybe I've right now. I have a house right so I'm buying some crazy furniture  Things like that and being stopped. I'll be honest by like a piece of furniture or a rug  You're like, oh there it is again  It keeps a top of mind and you're and they're in the market. You're a golden and I'm in the market  Yeah, I'm beautiful for these people. They love me  They're like this woman has money to spend and floors to cover sure all the rugs

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't hard for them to figure that out about you. They didn't have to do any secret  manipulation of your history to know that you just bought a house that's public record and

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean they know and I just search for rugs and you like Google and rugs although I will say  Google in my news section then recommends what what's frustrating is like  Google right now if I go through my news it has stopped being so much about  IOT in like quantum computing and now it is like  Century-month record design elements how to look for a rug, right? You know, oh, yeah, they're smart. They know how to get to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's why I'm on Instagram. It's stupid. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's stupid because it's not advertising it's it's assuming the things I'm searching for to buy are also things  I'm interested in researching or knowing about from a  Content perspective and they're two very different things but Google's just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, throw it all at you. Yeah, I bet you in that content. There are a few ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Probably right isn't oh, yeah, they do they have sponsored ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't content somewhere sometimes just it's just it's just a jello mold to hold the ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, my stories are on there. No, and actually a lot of my  If I look down my newsfeed rate, I've got the verge telling me about Amazon survey  Surveilling its flex delivery to drivers. Do it  I've got the Guardian  Let's see, what else do I have it's a stupid story  I have a story about window what to plant in the fall because I googled peonies the other day  There you go. Not something I really want to think about for the rest of my life brought to you by your local garden store  No, it's an apartment therapy though, so it's it's it's a sponsor it's like  affiliated links, okay  And they do tell me that the best way to do it is not to go to my local garden store  But to go to these online stores that you know sell their stuff like  And why they happen to have some links for that?  Bye-bye garden store. Yeah, but now I'm going to my garden store. Those people are awesome. I love them

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you were talking about how smart these modern browsers are nowadays regardless of cookies  What can we do as consumers to sort of help protect ourselves other than VPN? Is there anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No VPN will protect you

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But that's about it as you know when you click a link in a browser  That click is marked visit that link is marked visited  It used to be in the old days of the internet would turn the link would be purple instead of blue  That most play I forget that remember that  But that mark visited not visited persists regardless of what color it is  So one trick that I think would completely have nothing that you could use a VPN doing matter is  They load a shadow page, which you don't see and then they can actually query the browser  For which links have been visited they just by doing that  They just grabbed your web history for whatever many sites they put on there right they said oh whoever this is I don't know  Who it is the IP address? I don't recognize because it's you're on a VPN, but look at of these hundred sites. I just fired up  This person is visited 29 of them on these dates. Oh, that's a improvement  Mm-hmm, and he's interested in boots. Oh, we know and he's damn. Yeah, we showed him those boots last time  Let's show him again. He still hasn't bought them  Or maybe he did we don't know we don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're gonna keep on showing the boots

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  From clearing your do you want your commerce data shared with Google I

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Mean because that's how they would know if you bought the boots or not extent. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And to answer your question aunt  If you clear your history yet, no, they wouldn't see that that's based on your history  But you do you want to clear your history? I guess every time you could most brownies  You could set it to do that. Yeah, I clear it periodically  Well, that'll help  You should probably clear it every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If you use a service like last pass clearing your

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Cash actually is not as painful. Right? Yeah, because you at least you've got the passwords. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that's the biggest that's the biggest complaint. I have whenever I clear my cash  I'm like, oh there go all the passwords so I can and I'm looking at Firefox

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I can delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed. I can check that box. The problem is  By the way, look how much cookies site data and cash on this system 1.7 gigabytes  She's and that this system was rebuilt by you know a few months ago  And I only use it for two shows a week three shows a week cookie a cookie is nothing. It's tiny  No, they're saving a lot of stuff. That's the cash. They're saving the cash  So I could have that cleared every time but I think basically that's like making your browser dumb every time. I can be three ads  Yeah, could be three ads 1.7 gigs. I don't let me just I'll clear that data right now and I can I'll clear it  So cookies and site data is only only  759 megabytes  Only cash web contents 1 gigabyte. So it's actually very close  So I'm gonna clear all that  Now my browser is like fresh and clean again, and every time I close it it's gonna do that  We'll see I'll keep it that way for a while. We'll see if it makes it harder. Just I don't think it'll affect me  Cookies might but like who uses cookies anymore, right?  So Facebook you mentioned this and we I dropped the ball I apologize  Facebook here it is an update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia Jeff give us the background on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Rupert so background is that there is Murdoch backed legislation in Australia that would make Facebook at all  Negotiate with a gun to their head with publishers for the right to link to the content  and  so this has happened in various other forms in Germany, it's the  Leistung schutzrecht in France the the in Spain rather the link tax in the EU

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is this is the light like shouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Show right so now I okay, you're getting better Stacy. You're getting better getting closer by about ten months. It's so hard  so  So this is this is this is the publishers saying to the government  Let us put our pocket our hands in Facebook's pocket  They took money from us because God gave us that money and and and and they should give it to us now Murdoch  Is basically saying give me government support, but nobody no conservative politician is gonna pay Murdoch  So what they're saying is take the money from Facebook and give it to us  Because there's some writers so Facebook has said and Google have said no we're sending you value. We're sending your audience  We're not gonna do that. No and  And Australia's been trying to act all tough we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna find a way to get money anyway  So Facebook came out with a statement two days ago and said if you do this  We are going to cut off anyone media companies or users from posting news to Facebook  now that's  Obviously a matter of negotiation in terms of what they're trying to do  They're trying to fire a shot against Australia's bow here, but you think about it Facebook  Very happy without news news causes trouble news is controversy. They don't make any money on news fine  You know be where be careful what you wish for Murdoch at all  The case of Murdoch is regulatory capture because let's say that Facebook does that no more news of any sort on Facebook  Murdoch owns the big brands the big brands  Are still gonna be okay because they have name recognition people will still go to them  But every little competitor of Murdoch's every startup trying to compete with Murdoch. They're all screwed

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So he's fine either way. He's happy right so here's what Facebook is threatening in  their post  Assuming this draft code becomes law we will reluctantly Oh so reluctantly  Stop allowing publishers and people and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram  Boom right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So  This is why I wrote about this in the context of tick-tock because I you know  We have a First Amendment, you know to go or Stacy's earlier point  We have a First Amendment in our country which has an impact Australia doesn't  But it's a matter to me of freedom of expression and human rights  because the platform that people use to discuss public policy and discuss government and discuss what's going on and to share the news that  Is behind that so one hopes they do it in an informed fashion gets cut off from under them  it's a violation of their human rights, this is the people's press and  I had never really said it that way before but but but it is before it's the first time in history  That everyone has truly had access to a press and now we see governments cutting it off  China was doing it already  But now the United States is doing it with tick-tock and Australia is doing it with Facebook and Facebook is full well within its rights  To say okay, no news just cats and party picks. That's it. That's all we got now  No news our life's gonna be a lot easier folks mates and  Actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Might be a lot better. I  Might be I might be a lot happier. I might go back to Facebook if they do this in the US no more news  That'd be great, but unfortunately  What you're gonna get is no more links to us  established  Approvable news organizations, but lots of links to Russian troll farms, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll take advantage of this right  Exactly  Exactly, but but again Murdoch is cynical and clever and is saying I win either way  I make my political point. I try to get some money out of them  I get paid off because Facebook was saying we are gonna put Facebook news in in Australia and we are gonna pay publishers and Facebook paid  News Corp in the US I sat in the event where literally a check was handed over from Mark Zuckerberg to to Robert Thompson  the head of News Corp and  but but but Murdoch is making this bigger point and and what gets me to is  That I'm angry at publishers because if you think about it, I thought about this with this post to  Facebook started never being about news. It was about hookups and parties Twitter never started me about news  It was about where am I drinking right now?  Google never started about news people wanted news. They added that right?  All of these cases the users brought the news to it the users said oh we want to use this thing on Facebook to share  News we want to use this Twitter thing to share what we witness out there and share news and talk about it  We want to search for news on Google. We want to share news and education all kinds of stuff on YouTube  It was the users that brought the students  Why because newspapers were too stuck in their ways to provide that functionality  To share what people knew and talk about it and so on with their users  So they lost those people and now they're acting as if God and Australia  Over them money and Facebook and Google owe them money back. No, it's their own damned fault. Sorry end of rain

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and it's concerning when you see stories like this Russia's most notorious troll farm reportedly used deep fakes  To push a fake news outlet on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook and so Twitter and they both got rid of it and Twitter now both

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Pulled them down. This was the Internet Research Agency. We've all heard so much  They never left  Yeah, but but I have to say okay, they pulled this one down  But if in absence of legitimate news sources, I suspect a lot of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll try every trick in the book. Yeah, I'm the only place

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it's gonna get harder and harder because deep fakes are getting easier and easier

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so it's a cynical effort at  Protectionism by my own dear industry and I hate them for it. Yeah  So that's the end of an event we can go on rent

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No brand. All right. Let's take another break change log coming up and then it's the silly season. We've got some  Some silly stories by the way, I have to say I already am hating it that I deleted my history and cookies because I just  Relogged into Google and relog into Twitter  Didn't take long before I realized why I didn't want to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yep, and Google is just thinking yes. We got him forever now. He'll never delete

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Again ha ha well, fortunately I use a YubiKey so  Logging in isn't too hard, but it's you know, I gotta do it  All right  I guess now every time I close my browser when I have every time I start a show I'm have to log in to everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's not go but that was wasn't at the premise of cookies from them from the get-go  Yeah better user experience

It's all there right there in front of you change the way you work  Online I'll tell you what don't take my word for it  We've got a free two-week trial for you go to Monday comm slash twit Monday  comm slash  Twit you'll really be up and running in minutes  So you can really get a sense of it, and I have a feeling you're gonna want to spend more and more time with it  You're gonna just really love it Monday  Comm slash twit. Thank you my day comm for your support of this week in Google helping us get the job  Done I want to mention you know we do as you all know we've done host read ads  That's what they call these things where I or our hosts aunt  Micah Jason howell will read an ad in the  Show but some of our shows during because of kovat have not been sold out and maybe some of you have noticed in fact  Maybe some of you have been shocked  By because I'm getting some emails people saying hey  I was listening to twig or one of our other shows because we're doing it on a number of shows now  Listen to twig and all of a sudden there was an ad for you know another podcast in there what who put that in there?  That is something we're trying out. It's called direct ad insertion  We use a company really I think a good company called megaphone  And they will sell ads and insert them some of them are host read  They might be me doing those ads some of them are not some of them  You know our sponsors you've not heard before  So don't be don't be shocked if you hear that that's normal  It's one of the ways we're trying to keep the lights on  During a difficult time because as I'm sure you know  Times are tough right now a lot of businesses are struggling  Advertising dollars off by I don't know 30 40 percent a significant amount. I don't know exactly what it is but  So it's costing us a little bit of money, but we want to try to keep the lights on as best we can so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a surprise  I'm gonna get this time  Maybe I should listen to the podcast again and again and again and see over ten times  What ads do I get that'd be a lot of fun and it'd be good for twitch right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It will not be in the video versions. It's not in the live versions obviously because it's done after the fact  It's only in the audio versions of the show  We try to do it in such a way and this is the trick for us  And I've been struggling with this a little bit so that I indicate there's a pause here  But for those of you watching video  We continue on it's not like what happened where?  so  Well, you'll see after the change log. I'll do another one and  And you'll see I'll say something like coming up next. It's our picks of the week  Pause and now Stacey was see I don't think it's I've been trying to talk to this really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you can have another way because when they're coming up next sounds like it's coming up to a commercial  You don't really have to say  Well, I can't wait to hear Stacey's picks pause  Stacey what are your picks? Okay, right. It's it works as a tease and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're struggling with it transitional statement because it has to be enough of a transitional statement so that people don't go  Whoa, I just got hit by an ad like I want to warn you right  I know but I don't want to warn you I don't want to I don't want to confuse you if there's no ad  So I don't know what the answer is on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's been my experience with other podcasts that I listen to that use a similar service  I don't know if they're particularly use a megaphone, but it would just be a jarring break with  Transition or anything at least you try to transition to to it somewhere within the show  but  Not everybody's as savvy as you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and and obviously it's not working completely because I'm getting  Email and our twit community people are mentioning it and they're like, I don't what happened  What the hell's going on somebody guy just posted I  Thought I suddenly got another podcast playing and partly that's because for 15 years  The only ads you've heard on Twitter are me reading those ads  So that's probably some of it  So that's why I'm even bringing it up  otherwise  I wouldn't but I just to prepare you to understand that just like on network television or radio  Where you know shows going along and then there's an ad that's has nothing to do with the show or the host or anything  And then it comes back. That's that's how media was sold for years  We did something we started with Twitter doing something very different  Which was every ad was kind of woven into the content and the hosts read it  And I would like to keep doing it that way, but but apparently it's indeed. It's not good  And we'll see this is an experiment if people really hate it  You know we can turn the lights off. I don't then you couldn't do yeah, you can turn lights off  Well, I don't think we'll ever do a paywall although did you see  so  We used to have a young couple lives up the road a piece come in they were had they were on YouTube  They were wonderful little group called pample amuse. They'd come in they'd play music  I just really loved them Jack Conte and his girlfriend. They were so good now wife their wife. Did they get married? All right  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and they were just adorable couple, and I loved their music and they'd come and perform for us  Yeah, and then I heard the Jack  Because he's a YouTube guy and actually they did I think that the thing that was an epiphany for him is they did a tour  A concert tour and they lost money like crazy. They it's what he wrote a post about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't go I think he kind of like broke even within a dollar or something. It was just clearly not worth it  Yeah, and everybody says this is how performers are gonna make money now  Not through selling records, but through touring and he said here's I'll give you the number. He was very transparent

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He said I'll give you all the numbers. Yeah, it was it was a medium post pample amuse  2014 tour profits  They finished a 28 day tour 24 shows 23 cities  Natalie his wife now wife who was just a wonderful singer and he's performing she is she crowd-surfed for the first time ever we sold  under a hundred thousand dollars in tickets  Of one thousand one hundred twenty nine tickets in San Francisco at the Fillmore  I'll never forget that knife night for the rest of my life one fan question fans repeatedly asked  What does it feel like to have made it as a band?  Here's the van  There was expenses  So they paid the band's week of salaries for musicians  Tour budget the tour and this thing up costing us remember what they made on the tour  $100,000 in tickets tour ending up costing us  147,802 dollars  So it was I think an epiphany for Jack he just you know what?  We are so thrilled we loved seeing our fans  This is an amazing event, but it's not is no way to make a living they lost 11,000 819 they lost 11 grand  But where they a great band so Jack thought  well  What if what if I did what if I made it possible for bands and others to kind of?  Raise money in another way and he found it some a little thing you you might have heard of  I  Heard of it called patreon  Patreon what's that?  Patreon just got its second round of funding I  Don't know if they make money actually, but I guess in this day and age doesn't matter if you make money  But they got their second round until a couple years after you IPO. Yeah  They are now worth one point two billion dollars  So yeah, they lost 11,000 dollars on that tour, but it was an expensive education  But you know what credit to Jack and Natalie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Jack the guy this is killing me  This is killing me because I brought Jack to New York for an event on membership and news  and one of the people I brought is now the president of WNYC in New York Golden Shake of Islam II and  So they met that way and she's on his board. I wanted to be on his board

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Well congratulations great  Because he wants to support creativity. That's what he cares about. Yeah, and it's been a great success

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So their second as your actually not second is their series e-funding of 90 million dollars values them at one point two billion  Dollars they have raised  for creators two billion dollars  six million patrons  So and many of our friends as a matter of fact are on patreon. So well done Jack. That's really great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really and the great thing is they both still do music  Yeah, Pamplemousse is going on. I think they're a studio. I think they kind of separated out  I think they live in San Francisco in their studios in LA or something like that  And they were they were separating out the two lives, but they still do that. Oh, that's too bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, they probably have a nice big mansion now. They used to live up there

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is when they need to ask what's it feel like to have made it. That's when yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean literally they lived like they were never feels like they made it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can you can lose that money anytime, right? So they've raised a total of 255 million to date. Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's good for them. That's good stuff. Yeah a big success story  And and nice nice people they it's so nice. I just love them. I just love them and I first discovered them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was actually was not this one exactly. It was another one  yeah, but the music was was was good and they're really cute and and fun and I just looked them up and  Let me play me. I'm always amused by people who act in commercials who are actually likeable and good and  Sometimes I look up who is that person and so I looked him up and found them and  So yeah, I started following him them long before well

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We should try to get I know I think we are trying to get them on one of the shows  Or at least Jack just to say congratulations here to give you a better idea because one of the things that  She's famous for is their covers. They do great covers  Here's a song you might know a pample moose cover from a few years ago  3.2 million views on this  And that's Jack Jack on the drums piano he does all the instruments  Natalie does the singing she plays some instruments to it  And the thing is they would do these out of their living room, I mean this was done in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, Jack told me the editing was hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did one with like a robot post is always the hard part. Yeah post is the worst

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually, I thought  They were the next big thing. I actually was shocked that they didn't become huge  But that's a little that's maybe more about the music industry than anything else  I think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway  Anyway, I didn't know that news. That's good news for them. Yeah, isn't that? Yeah, I hope I know this is last week's news

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But this still made me think about Spotify and Joe Bud and when you're talking about  This story here with them being in the music industry and how much money  They could have potentially made versus what they actually lost  when it comes to all of the hidden fees and hidden costs and expenses that tend to show up and  Last week on tech news weekly  We talked about Joe Bud in a pretty popular rapper from about ten years ago  Who is big in the entertainment industry now with podcasts and and so forth  but he learned a lot of lessons from being in music and  It pretty much has led to him saying, you know  We're done with Spotify being on their platform for our podcasts exclusively  Because I know what it takes and I know how much money is coming in. I understand my value  I understand the growth and all of that and Spotify is just just gonna take us and  Rip us apart and we're not gonna own the content  And I mean he's speaking as a heart at the heart of a creator not necessarily as a business person

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Also, he says Spotify promised us bonuses  When we got to a certain size and he says, you know his show exceeded Spotify's audience reach expectations  By nine hundred percent to the point that his listeners crashed the platform and he says but but we never got a bonus  The company wouldn't allow him and his team to take vacation days on Christmas and New Year's Joe  If you worked for us, you could take Christmas and New Year's  Because that would have required them to miss two episodes of the podcast  The company did give them Rolex's Joe. I'll give you a time X. It's just the same  It's just the same  But then it's even waterproof then it was worse because Joe and his team picked out Rolex's in the and the cup and Spotify said  No, those are too expensive  Then he said well Spotify give money to to our fans for Christmas instead of Rolex's and Spotify said no  He said this was the first time it dawned on me that Spotify is pillaging  You pillage the audience from the podcast and you've continued to pillage each step of the way without any regard for the fans  I  Wonder how much money Spotify gave him upfront  You know the rumor is they gave Joe Rogan a hundred million dollars over several years to go exclusively  Take a small audience and his podcast audience exclusively the Spotify  They have Michelle Obama that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the details with Rogan was that he was so adamant about was Rogan is still going to own the  Art that they're creating it's still going to be his Spotify is not going to have oh, yeah  All of it, you know, and I think that's the big piece that Joe Budden has been fighting  Is you know, they're doing all of this work and creating this content in Spotify and gimlet and those folks are like  Yeah, if you leave this is still ours, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I'm gonna defend because we would assert the same thing so if you you know, so it started with the nod  Brittany loose and Eric Eddings created the podcast for gimlet  And then gimlet was acquired by Spotify  And Brittany and Eric said well we built the show in the audience, but we don't own it  Well, I got to tell you aunt if you build a show in an audience on our network  And then you decide to leave you don't take the show with you unless we know no I get that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dad I get because like if something if I ended up leaving twit, I can't take hands-on photography

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, we own it because we put a lot of money in my rants. I thought I  And now to be fair with me to be fair every single time that's happened. We've said okay go ahead. I  Haven't been happy about it Chad Johnson did that great  Minecraft OMG craft podcast right on our network built a great YouTube audience  We built him a beautiful set and all that stuff and it went and at some point he said yeah  I I'm making a lot of money now. Can I just have it and do it my own and  Any other company in the world would have said no we own the IP the intellectual property to this you made this as an employee  But I am and you know, we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on it  But I'm not that guy so I said no go ahead and he's doing great. He's actually broke a million

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah subscribers just the other difference there though is Joe Budden already had

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, not did faint the nod didn't Joe Budden did right? So I don't know I don't  Know I know that happened with the nod. I don't know what the deal was with Joe Budden. Did he say?  You know, he I think he is taking it with him

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, he is yeah, you know, they're cutting ties and but  For to be on that platform. There were some other things that he wanted to happen the company wanted him to read ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He said no. Yeah, he was like no, I'm not reading ads making it one of the only shows not to be monetized on the platform  There are well again. There's a lot of people in the world for the monthly Spotify subscription

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  To not get ads  When you pay for Spotify premium, but you're still going to have ads inserted on those certain

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Exclusive and on the free tier you have ads because that's the only way it was like no, that's not cool  Well, okay. There are a lot of creatives in the world who think oh  You know, I mean I've been on both sides  I mean, I've made all these shows but yeah, so I've been on both sides, but I've always known  40 years in the business that when you create as an employee that company owns what you create  I don't own the screensavers. I don't own call for help and I would never even have thought in my head  Oh, I want to take that with me. You owe it to me or  I'm never doing ads because you understand. It's a business. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thought it was a thought is a fan now as it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  as a creator  I will say like when giga oh  went away  suddenly, I lost all of my  What was it all the IOT podcasts that Kevin and I had done on that one  So when I you were doing it for you you were doing it for giga oh, yeah  We were it was called the giga. Oh the giga. Oh my ot podcast  So after that failed about a week and a half or two weeks later  I was like Kevin you want to start it up again, you know, and we still didn't know what we're gonna do  Thank you for that  That's oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And we've done that with other shows when Scott Wilkinson we had a that show wasn't making a lot of money  We couldn't afford to do it anymore. I said Scott will give you the feed  We'll give you you know, you have the name whatever you want to do  If you want to do it, he went to a couple of publishers. Nobody else picked it up  we've done that almost every time when  time we would  We Tom Merritt used to do a show for us  He wanted a lot of money he hired an agent that was a mistake by the way  And the agent said I want I think he wanted a triple Tom's salary and he wants to do less  And so we just didn't renew the contract. We couldn't come to terms the guy said no  No, you got to give him three hundred fifty thousand dollars a year. I said I don't make that kind of  Sorry, I can't so we didn't renew his contract and but we but he but we left on good terms and he  Continued to the exact Daily Tech News  He didn't get TNT the name tech news today because that was ours and we continued to do that show  But he went and did the Daily Tech News show and we and you've been on it a lot of you could have you could have  Signed him to a non-compete you didn't we don't I've never done that partly cuz not correct  I know look at as a as a I have signed non-competes in my lifetime all of them unenforceable in California  But I've signed them many times and I see I come from both sides of the track  But at the same time that's like I understand you can't I'm not gonna take the call for help show with me  It's not mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I was gonna say that when Kevin when I went to fortune I actually offered them the show and  Because they wanted to do podcasts, but they didn't want to do my show  So  They were fine with me doing it  But they they didn't want it and then when they did want it they decided they wanted it  But then they wanted to own the licensing and I was like, oh, no, thank you  Come to think and that was just like a no-go for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The chat room is bringing up all these shows that we said, okay fine. Keep your show  I'm an idiot. What was I thinking? I  Just can't do that to somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're gonna do we were gonna do a show out of the school, right?  And we tried to figure out how to do a twit worthy show out of the school and they couldn't which is the same folks  It's hard. It's very hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the thing I think a lot of talent miss doesn't really understand  All of the  Money and time and effort we put into this stuff. Oh, yeah, and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is it I mean, oh  I was I was just like and it's not enough to be talent  You have to also have the brain and add smarts to which is tough to find in the same person

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's why honestly when when OMG craft when Chad did so well with it. I was thrilled for him  I was really thrilled for him. Yeah, and you know, it's great  We stopped doing the giz whiz with dick t Bartolo, but I said dick, please take it take the feed  Whatever you want and he and Chad got together and they still do that show. So I'm an idiot  No, but I understand Joe's point of view  But I also understand Spotify's point of view and it sounds like you know, he refused to my he refused to do ads  You know, and and it sounds like Spotify hasn't said okay Joe, but we're gonna keep the show they've  Spotify said they wanted to keep button on the platform as Joe referenced in his show  We made him a considerable offer one that was significantly larger  Many times the value of the existing agreement reflective of the current market and the size of his audience  Unfortunately, we couldn't come to terms and we respect his wishes to find a new home for his show  Yeah, I believe that the argument was

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The offer you're giving me right now is  Right now is is just not quite good enough because I know what my trajectory is  Well, I could see what my trajectory is based on my past  You know, we're continuing to pick up steam and we're going to continue to bring more to the table to the umbrella of Spotify  So, you know, he's saying hey, give me a little more cash and we're in and of course they just couldn't meet up  You know, I see just like you I see it on both sides. I thought it was a good discussion

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Fond of Joe  Doing it he was the first to do an exclusive deal with Spotify and I don't like these exclusive deals  I don't like what Joe Rogan's done either because uh-huh  I think it's giving Spotify a huge amount of power and what Spotify is trying to do is to kill RSS  podcasting  And to make podcasting be something that lives on an application so they can gather more information about you and we really don't I don't  Think that's the right thing to do. So in a way, I don't if Joe wants to leave that's fine  He made he kind of made a deal that I didn't really support to begin with same thing with Rogan  I hope both these guys cash in

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think there's more about the capitalistic side of it too, though

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you know and maybe let's see what let's see what Joe Budden does, you know, yeah  He had a thing is he brought a name. He was a success going into it, right? Right. So that's that's  That's that's what's here is it's not just some average person. Yeah going into these negotiations

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is someone that has some sort of establishment with them, but apparently did not have enough clout to convince Spotify

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  right  So that's always I don't know who he is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't know he was I'm not a I'm not a big hip-hop artist like I was umpteen years ago  But I knew of his name. I didn't listen to any of these  Artists he did a bunch of other different things beyond music  Far as being in a community and just doing things that business does something called calming rap

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Were you were you a hip-hop artist is that true? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Never I was really excited by this whole I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My name is ant and I'm here to say I  Came to spit and not to play  I'd like to do my rap for you like that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That would be no

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's ASMR rap it's a whole new thing it's a new category  Yeah, and sensual melodic rap according to chicken right right  So I think it's interesting to watch this when money comes into a business  Podcasting never was worth anything when money comes into a business it changes boy  Does it change you watch this thing happen and so Spotify has signed? Yes  Joe Rogan Michelle Leigh  Joe Rogan Michelle Obama Kim Kardashian, I mean they're trying to build this exclusive  Thing and I you know, they bought gimlet. They've spent more than half a billion dollars  And I'm just bitter because they didn't buy us. That's all I'm just I'll be honest with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Audible is now trying to pump up its podcast. Yes, you're right when money comes in it changes everything and when it leaves it changes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm waiting till it leaves. I'll be here to pick up the pieces  No, and that's interesting audible doesn't want any podcast with ads  It makes sense because their books don't have ads either right but that that leaves us out because  That's how we make money doing the show  You know, so what what else did podcasts do? Do they just have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, some people are happy. I'm just happy to be on audible  Yeah, I guess I don't know you have to make I mean, how do they put?  How do they feed their families that's it see that's the fundamental question

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  patreon and

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, my friend Pete because I'm not in this year's but I do want to feed my family yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well my friend Pete Dominic who was on Sirius who's a stand-up comedian who does political show  He did on Sirius for a long time build a channel for them basically  So he left Sirius and now he's in a shed  He's in a he shed in his backyard doing his podcast is going really well  And he's doing it mainly on patreon, yeah good for him that's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I've thought you know  If advertising I think you know, I think when I retire I'll do a patreon podcast. We can't I can't go to patreon  For shows that we've been giving away for free. You can't do that  Nobody you would get more support

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fan support  than  Your money on I don't know. I really know about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I really don't know about that  We put this show out along with all of our other gazillion shows we have on the network for free  We just insert our own personal ad reads into them here and there and people will bitch and  Complain about some of those ad reads even though they didn't pay a dime for the content

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, and I think that a lot of people say oh I'd pay five bucks a month  But but when push comes to shove, I don't know they don't  Yeah, I know  And that's why it's gonna be when I retire so that I it's not like well  I have to make a certain amount of money  I just want to keep talking and if it'd be nice if I can make a little money while I do it  People have been very generous with us  I have to say we sold a quarter million dollars worth of bricks to build the brick house  Somebody's reminded me that that was amazing  We when we started we asked for tips and we were routinely doing eight or nine thousand dollars a month in tips  and it's not to mention seven Bitcoin which  Some somewhere somewhere I will get it. And actually I think it's now technically I think Florence Ion owns my Bitcoin  But oh, that's right. That's right. She doesn't want it fair and square  Hey  By the way  We should mention even though we have debated back and forth about whether tick-tock and WeChat should be banned in the US  Of course as we know Twitter and Facebook are banned in China  India has now and added they banned tick-tock a while ago a lot of Chinese apps  They have now added a hundred and eighteen apps to that list including  The the game that is now taking fortnight's place on iOS pub G mobile  Band I didn't realize pub G mobile was owned by a Chinese company. I didn't know that either  Ten cent  You've heard of them there. They own they own pub G mobile  That's a it was according to many the most popular game in India prior to the ban  So that is a government Modi's government is says fine who cares we're banning it  Tick-tock one of the one of the most successful markets for tick-tock was India until it was banned in June  So  Do we want to be like India and just ban stuff? We don't like I don't think so. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, cuz we again

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  No, that's right. Let's yeah  Well, I don't know people there there are people say look how China is treating its weaker Muslim minority  That's a good reason not to have any Chinese commerce in this country, right? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If we apply the their jerks to some people  Argument to why we shouldn't have Chinese businesses here. We have got to clean our own house first  Yeah, we're putting kids in cages. Yeah, and we're shooting  black men on the streets and  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with  Those living in glass houses should refrain from casting molders  Let's do  Did we talk about Neuralink last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, we didn't. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Elon Musk  Which who's read a lot of science fiction as have I wants to live in a world where you can jack in a mind machine  Interface you got a little thing in the back of your head  You just connect the computer and you're in the metaverse and Neuralink is a company. He's funded to the tune of a hundred million dollars  to create this next generation brain machine interface and  Ladies and gentlemen, would you put your head in that thing?  Because that's what it involves. This is actually a concepts an automated surgeon  That well it drills a little hole in your skull just a little one just a little quarter you can drill

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holes in the ground you can roll your head same skill. It's the same boring machine  It's like economists are doing epidemiology, you know, it's not hard to pick up

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They place in your they so they take a little bit of the skull out. They'll put it back  Promise take a little bit of the skull out  Put like a cellophane like membrane in there and it has electrodes thousand electrodes  The diameter of a quarter of the diameter of a human hair very thin and it  plunges them into your brain at different depths and locations  Avoiding very important avoiding the blood cells because if you hit a blood cell well makes a mess  So so and the machine can do six threads with a hundred ninety two electrodes every minute  So it's like a little sewing machine for your brain. So it takes a little holding  puts those in there closes you up and  Now you have Neuralink in there and this is the best part you pair it to your smartphone via Bluetooth  Really? Yeah  Now  Let's be frank. This demo didn't in fact they didn't do it to humans and they haven't even built this machine  They did it to a pig. Actually they did it to a couple of pigs. They had I'm not sure why they had three  They had a control pig  They had the pig they did the surgery on and then they just had some third pig  Just hanging around to keep everybody else company. Here is the Neuralink  Reading the pigs brain activity and predicting its limb motions ahead of time. Isn't that amazing?  Isn't that mind-boggling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me ask you yes you asked if we would if we would  Connect ourselves to this device. I'm not gonna answer that  First with this would you do this in 2022 if this device no, no, no, no, but I would do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Ten years  Okay, I'll do it in 2030. So you're saying give it time to mature. Well, yeah, and also at that point  I'll be so old if it kills me. It's not the end of the world. Well, it's the end of my world  But I be you know be like, okay, I'm gonna take a chance. I'm gonna  Guys for science, it's like if you asked me will you go to Mars and there's no return trip I do that now  I've lived a good life, you know, I'll have some fun on Mars and  Did we get Stacy back we lost Stacy briefly I think her internet is just really  Crapping out it's supposed to cut saw does not the internet. I've always wanted see I am NOT happy with the VR  Glasses the VR helmet I have always wanted to get in the metaverse  I want to be so realistic that I think I'm there if they told me that we could do that tomorrow  But you got to do this procedure. I probably would do it  Don't you like that?  That should be on my tombstone he wouldn't be on Facebook but he would let it Elon Musk drill his brain. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I thought I thought it was gonna be are you knocking futz? But I think that might be on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Both of those either one of those  So Stacy, I'm glad we got you back because I think you probably of all of us  Have the best understanding of the brain machine interface. Well, Stacy's gonna turn herself into an IOT. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, so I would never do this although I  Don't think the risk versus the reward here is compelling and I say that because the ability to access  Information is going to become less valuable over time and that's basically what this is at giving you now  We all have you know, we all take a moment and keep our brain on Google  Like how many times have you talked about that, right?  So or how you know you you're talking to someone you're like, oh, what was the name of that?  Okay, that's not where the value is gonna come in so that's one so I think risk versus reward I do think  the process is interesting because deep neural stimulation is becoming such an interesting area in the medical world for things like  Parkinson's treatment and  migraine treatment actually there's some potential there but I  Really want to come from Elon Musk I guess so those are the things that I when I saw this I was like  This could be really compelling especially as a mechanism for delivering real health care into the brain. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But they're already and by the way  Quickly it was pointed out that Neuralink is not doing anything that a number of other research institutions are doing and in many cases  Doing better in a more advanced way and that is exactly  One of the benefits they talk about a tetrapolegic  Being able to type 40 words a minute just by thinking and it's that kind of empowering technology that would be amazing  Not so much me thinking I'm on the beach in Portofino  Because I have a thing in my head

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you saw that the guy who had lost his arm and and plugged a I don't know some  Booger raspberry pie into the socket and made music

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's nice, right? You can do that. So the BBC asked a number of scientists the UK's Science Media Center  They put out a press release quoting professor Andrew Jackson no relation from he's a professor of neural interfaces at Newcastle University  I don't think there was anything  Revolutionary in the presentation  He said but they are working through engineering challenges of placing multiple electrodes into the brain in terms of their technology  1024 channels is not that impressive these days  But the electronics to raise them ray relay them wirelessly is state-of-the-art and the robotic  Implantation is nice  The biggest that's what I said

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just like Stacy. I just don't have a British accent

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is solid engineering but mediocre neuroscience some said  Elon Musk's when asked why isn't this peer reviewed said well  Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We have takes time in Silicon Valley people. They don't go for that and we had a control

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no no no his answer was I have no peer. I have no peer who would review it  I'm the third richest man on earth. How the hell did that happen? Isn't that amazing, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing?  Scott Galloway's laughing

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We're crying big dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Elon Musk responded with a tweet, of course  it's unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas and  Underweight bringing them to fruition good point for example. Yes the idea of going to the moon  The idea is trivial, but going to the moon is hard  So, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He also some with them on that. I gotta give him credit for that cuz that's a  Fancy way of saying there's a whole lot of talkers and not a lot of doers. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  so  Elon's doing something. Look, I think I do hope I've always wanted  Something like this at some point and you're right Stacey  For simply for accessibility for empowering technology. This would be amazing  imagine Stephen Hawking instead of having to you know type into  Some sort of interface being able to tell you played the hawking card. Okay. All right, right, right? Yeah  Yeah, and I think it'd be nice to be able to you know, go to the beach  In my head but um, and I do think this will happen eventually. So these are the first steps  you know, we would have we would have mocked a lot of the first steps and  You know personal computing  I have to say Elon often often oversells things. Yeah, but you know, that's that's Elon. I think he's  I don't know  You know, he's a great huckster  But he's also done some really good stuff  He is the third richest man in the world how the hell did that happen stock splits my friend stock splits

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's funny money  It is it's just yes, it isn't paper gains

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you know to elon's credit he took all the money made in paypal, which was his initial fortune  Yeah, sunk it into arrested a crazy idea to do electric vehicles  Vehicles  Um, so and you know, he deserves whatever he gets. I think credit is deserved there  Yeah, he's worth more than than zuckerberg, which is  Wow  That's big money  111 billion dollars  But that's still almost just half what jeff bezos is worth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So jeff bezos delivers a lot more than Elon musketeers. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The center I have a tesla  Literally I had a tesla, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And you know, yeah, you're right and it is literal if jeff bezos does literally deliver. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually, no normally this time of the show we would do the changelog, but now we're going to do the moral panic log

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because oh no, i'm excited about some of the things on the changelog. Are we still going to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, of course we are  Okay, I was making a bad joke jeff has provided us with five  Fabulous stories on moral panic  Just for you stacy the we'll we'll cover these quick. I like that. That's instead of the horns

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, i'm happy to have you do as much as you want. Yes, please go

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now here from the conversation.com  Which is an academic site, let's be careful faculty's scientific reasoning  In our most recent publication in the journal conservation biology  We examine an error of reasoning that props up. I think they're australian  The moral panic over cats

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So does that mean we don't have to build our catio  We were going to build a catio an enclosed patio  So the cats could go outside without getting any birds

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm gonna need a drink

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wait a minute. I gotta read this study. It says that cats don't kill birds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although they kill birds  But but but that's the this whole notion that they contribute to the conservation of endangered birds by prey and and and so they just say  No, there's documented cases of coexistence between cats and native prey species and everything's okay. Just calm down

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's all about calming down. All right, i'm gonna i'm so I could still build the catio though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, you could I frankly did was you don't want the cat to run away and so around here  I got foxes and the fox would kill the cat right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I don't want that to happen we enjoy because we have a wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is that documented or is that just like myth that foxes kill cats coyotes and foxes will kill your small pets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It doesn't so I think that that's not moral panic  I think  Well, it is  So the qanon is moral panic. I see what you're saying. Yeah, absolutely.

They compared the cohorts  Kids starting kindergarten in 1998, which would have been roughly our kids age jeff  And another beginning kindergarten in 2010  To see if there are differences in social skills between this pre internet  Kindergarten class and this right smack dab in the middle of the internet kindergarten class  The researchers found no difference in social skills between the 1998 and 2010 cohorts  They both displayed similar development from kindergarten to fifth grade the only noticeable difference  Was a slight decrease decrease in social skills for children with very frequent use of online gaming and social media  But even that was a pretty small anyway. Yeah, maybe that yeah, what which came first the chicken exactly exactly. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so  So then finally there's a book which I just finished the section social media by two academics, which is very good  Is there sex in social media?  But it it talks about the societies that can form in social media people who who have been told that they're deviant  and and then can find  Their themselves other deviants online  Yeah, and then there was a moral panic around sexting which they go through they have a whole chapter on how that was a moral panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so it was that a moral panic that really wasn't as problematic as yes. Yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  So, uh, you may remember we talked a long time about the privacy implications of the apple google  api for covet tracing  As of the latest version of ios and soon the latest version of android you won't need an app anymore  to use the the covid  tracing api  state health agencies  Can use the information without creating a customized app. You'll be able to go in  To the app and enable it so up to now if you went to the app  It says you don't have an app if you went to the settings  It would say you don't have an app to do this. So you can't enable it, but you will be able to  enable  notifications for covet exposure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Partly because it never made any sense. They were going to have every city was going to have their own app  Yeah, nobody's doing every health department was going to have their own app. It made no sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it was every state only six states have actually built one so far  I think 25 were trying to make it happen. Yeah, so it does make sense, but the downside is you trade off data. So  This is a very realistic version of your ease of use versus privacy convenience versus security

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Transcript:  And i'm betting here's the cool stuff right imagine this take it fast forward like three  Three three years two years google now knows that I am parked in a spot, right? So when I leave  Or my time runs out it can send notifications and it can assume that spot is empty which it can help update its own parking  data like I  So that's that's data that could eventually become cool

Transcript:  I mean, I guess it could because it knows the location of my  It drives off but that maybe if I have to click on it and be like  That'd be really cared about us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's just a clock  Well, no, it's not it's a smart clock  It's a smart speaker  Yeah, yeah  It does oh and instead of an lcd it's using leds  So it's cheaper but and here's what we talked about on my show because this is these clocks are very important to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have a sony dream machine from like oh my god. Wow, you had when I was in high school  That was the square one. It's like a cube, right? No, it's actually mine's old. It's it's like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So  But I was  I'm frustrated because I don't know how low you can dim the leds and I would love for it them to have used red  Led because that's softer

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So come on lenovo, this is an update to their previous smart clock. This is called the smart clock essential. It's less  It's about 30 bucks less, which is nice  Um, it uh will hit the shelves sometime this month  Um, and it doesn't yeah see I have the I kind of like the nest  hub mini which doesn't have a camera so it's appropriate for the bedroom because it has a  A picture screen, but it also shows me the time if I want just time and I can talk to it  The best thing about the google alarms is you can yell stop  And it'll stop you don't have to wait. You don't have to say hey anybody or anything. You just say stop  It's very satisfying

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It is nice. I do that all the time. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The timer's work that way, too  finally  Google is adding local news to your assistant's audio  So see i'm getting that cookie announcement everywhere  uh  so  They last fall they launched their smart audio news playlist  But now your news update is coming to google podcasts  So if you're a podcast listener  You can open the podcast app navigate to the explore tab and subscribe to your news update  You'll get a mix of short news stories chosen in the moment  Based on your interest. I guess it's kind of like google news, but just for audio  And and it knows your location as well. So you you you will hear about  So for instance they give an example if you're a music fan living in los angeles  You might hear a local story about the governor's latest announcement then a review of the latest carrie pay  Katy perry album although  I do want to know what carrie paydee's up to these days followed by a deep dive of the upcoming election  So this is google trying to understand  Audio news like it understands text news and giving you something you want to hear i'm gonna turn that on  I think that sounds like a good feature that's available in the google podcasts app  And I presume if you've got that turned on you could also do it on your google assistant  If you said, uh, what is it? Hey google?  Play local news or hey google play news about petaluma  Unfortunately, they're still doing some of that text to speech stuff, which I really don't like it's too robotic  It'll get better and that  Is the google change law?

Transcript:  I think that was lovely, you know, you could just be like and now is the time  When we may or may not insert an ad I can just do that right? There's nothing wrong with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And now a word from a an advertiser  At this time we would like to play you this important message  Or not unless

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's like that's gonna not go down well if it's a gambling site and we're back

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That was easy. That was painless  Um, let us start with stacey's thing of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So y'all are gonna get mad at me, but I did actually just order a whole bunch of things  So i've got things for y'all coming  Um, and I will make a note of this one thing  It's not out yet, but lifex just announced lifex clean, which is a light bulb with uh  Hev lighting that says it will clean your  Counters things that the light hits everything the light touches  Right it is capable of it's safe for people but capable of killing germs such as e coli and  Strap the colo  Do I insert it in my body?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you should do not insert it in your body

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But you can open your mouth really wide when it and it only does this when it turns on for a certain amount of time  And then it puts a white light  So this might be something you put in your bathroom to kill your fecal plume off your toothbrush. Yes  Or  You could stick it on your kitchen counters. Um, it doesn't say that it kills listeria or salmonella, but you know  There's e coli still bad not yet on the lifex  Website, but um, it's gonna cost 70. They just announced it today

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are these I mean these are fairly expensive led bulbs. Are they good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The um, the lifex bulbs are actually really good. They used to be before philips hue upped its game. They used to be  brighter in better colors  The reason they're more expensive is because you don't need a hub their wi-fi. Oh, I like that. That's right. They have built-in wi-fi. Yeah  They're also um  What is it  No hub  I like the colors. They actually do a really nice turquoise, which is a tough color to do and they're a little bit brighter than philips hue  But they are expensive. They're like  50 bucks up old

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And a lot of them are sold out, which is a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes, and this doesn't go on sale until october. Okay, i'm just going to tell you that so you would get this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Uh, if you didn't want to kill your fecal plume, you might also get this for the kitchen

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm sure i'm probably not going to get this. Yeah, i'll be honest  Yeah, but but if you if I were going to get it, it would go smack into the bathroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right underneath no actually that makes a lot of sense  If it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If it I mean, I feel like there is a lot of research on these lights and we know uvc will kill bacteria

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  but it's also harmful to humans so

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the question is  How long does it need to be on how close does it need to be what percentage of the germs  You know, and those are a lot of variables and how well does that work in the real world? I mean even the  Wipey wipes if you look at them closely you need to have them like for a certain number of minutes  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You have to let it be wet for half a minute or a minute. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know by the way, you cannot get wipes to save your soul. What you just can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I've been waiting for six months  to get  A hand sanitizer. This is the one I use which is it smells like coconut and lemon. It's really good  It's from it's for everyone for everybody and they've been out of stock for six months  And I just got us. I just got a six of them. I couldn't believe it  So i'm willing to sell these for a mere hundred dollars each

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hand sanitizer this is coming back in but but wipes bleach alcohol can't buy alcohol anywhere. Yeah. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I have alcohol right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you did get a drink

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What kind of gin are you drinking today someone get that jiff

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think it's I I think it's  Uh a local gin or portland gin. I know that you're a great  Ginophile if that's a word. I do love a good gin. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll say the moral panics would lead her to drink. I knew it. I knew it. Yeah, it it worked

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  um, okay, but my my other thing that i'm really  I I gave you a thing because I feel bad about I keep not recommending you things  But this is really important and i'm reading it and I will really encourage everyone  Especially who has sons to read it?  Because I think it's really important. There's a book called boys and sex  It's by peggy orenstein who did the book girls and sex and this was a couple years ago  Yeah, I think I recommended it here, but it talked about  you know  how  How our kids are the messages they get and how it really?  Hurts them in a lot of ways and her first book was all about how it hurts girls and she was done  She's always done girls  but after that she realized that it's impossible to talk about like coercion and  The pressures that girls face without also saying  You know without also recognizing that boys play a huge part in this  Um, so she went and talked to I think over 200 boys in college and high school  Wow to to get their opinions and thoughts about  It's their sexual history. It's what they've learned from people and she backs us all up with both her research and then actual  research from you know  Social scientists and that sort of thing  And the book breaks my heart because  And I know this I have nephews. I don't have sons. I do have a daughter. Um  They're not getting no one's talking to them at all about sex and feelings and  they have no expectations around their emotions and it really  Yes, it can make them behave like entitled jerks, but it also  They don't it's like they don't have any other options and it really drives that home and it offers some really concrete things  And I think I really think if you have kids  You should read this and if you have sons you should read it  So you can actually talk to them because if you don't talk to them about these issues  You're setting them up to be basically incomplete humans in the sense that they don't know how to  engage with  People in a intimate manner both sexually and emotionally

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is something parents are really struggling with right now. I think  And it's a very it's a challenge  Because these kids are growing up in a world with a lot more information and a lot more  exposure to sex than we ever had  And uh, and I don't it's hard to know how it's affecting them and it's hard to know how to talk to them about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Girls are speaking up. Thank god and you know, how many  Some of these boys have had their own like me too moments where they realized but at the time they didn't realize they were being  They didn't realize they were literally destroying some young woman's life, right?  Right, and they didn't do it out of no, yes, yeah, that hurts me because like imagine  Imagine these kids when 10 years later they come to realize that that time  They might have really destroyed. So I mean most people don't want to be that good person. Right? So anyway, I it like  I'm clearly speaking to you from the heart, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Y'all should read this. It's good. I'm ordering it right now because we have a 17 year old at home and I think  I think it's important and it's challenging  Thank you for the recommendation. Yeah, good recommendation. It's called I don't think we've actually said the name it's boys and sex  young men on hookups love porn consent and navigating the new  Masculinity and it's by peggy ornstein

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  um  my pick of the week is I want to say  Thank you to chad  and  I mean chad bozeman  The whole chad wick bozeman still throws me off because I didn't know him by that name. I always knew him as chad  I um wanted to put this out there because I know a lot of listeners  Are from my hometown of anderson south carolina  And I felt that I should I owe it to them to bring this up and just to share just a few minutes of this of  What I know about chad  um  Where I grew up the house that my mother  Built the land that she built it on  Was owned by some a bozeman family  so my neighbors were bozeman's  and  There were two sisters that lived there that had another brother named chad that he didn't live with them  But he would come by from time to time and we would all hang out together play basketball  and just be  Teenagers, you know and just be kids and had a good time talked a lot of junk  had a lot of fun and  Chad was special. He was a hell of an athlete that went to another high school in the area  Not the same one that I went to  um  And just taught a lot of trash heck of a competitor really really good at the sports, you know  But beyond that he was an interesting kid because he wasn't like the rest of the kids that  You know  We all had the dreams and aspirations of going pro in this sport and going pro in that and whatever  But chad was different chad was into debate chad was into theater and he had the visions of  Being able to go to college to get into theater and most people in that area didn't think that way  and  He  You get ridiculed when you talk like that depending on the area that you're from if you know what I mean  And so he continued to go on and I wasn't in touch with him much but I was in touch with his sister  Because again, she they lived next door to us  and during this time of his passing I really feel  for her because she  Kept us abreast of his progress and let us know that what was going on with him and  I never really saw any of his his movies until  with him portraying  Jackie rommerson  But I heard about some of his stories of just being in new york and struggling just like all actors do  But he kept pushing forward and he also had the mission of saying you know what I actually want to make the story  I want to be in directing. I want to be in the writing the acting stuff just  Happened, you know, that wasn't even his main vision  His main vision was to just make the story and when he got that opportunity to  Jump into marvel and believe be the black panther  He just took that opportunity and just just absolutely crushed it considering all the things that he dealt with growing up considering  All the things that he was dealing with at the time  And it really resonated with me. I never go to the movie theaters  I hate the movie theater experience  The only time i've gone is for star wars and that was because of the connection I have with my late father  But I did go see black panther  because of chad  And when I went to see black panther  It warmed my heart to see that  This man was a superhero  and in our area  Superheroes didn't look like chad didn't look like me. They looked like this guy with the pompadour or just  There were no black superheroes like that  and to see  That he was able to bring that to life and my kids could see  You know, there are superheroes out there that looks like us  We can still go out there and strive to to do things beyond the basketball court and beyond the football field  We can go and write stories  We can go and make the story that we want to present and entertain millions around the world  And he put his guts into this. He was so serious about his craft  And he also wanted to make sure other people  Could prosper from his efforts as well, and I just wish that more people would could understand the backstory  Behind chad growing up in that tiny little town of anderson, south carolina  Where there's not much going on there other than clemson football  But he had a vision and he stuck with that vision through thick and thin getting more opportunities  Left and right that he had no control over it. There's the story of denzel washington  Helping him pay for his trip to go to oxford and study acting  Denzel freaking washington  Then he gets back and he's been told no a gazillion times on set because he didn't fit this this role at that role  Then there was another time in the soul proper where he was portrayed as a black man  But he didn't like how that role was being portrayed  Negatively, he spoke up about it and they took him off  But he said, you know what? It's okay. I still want to make the story. It's okay  I don't have to act I can just write and do my own stories  and then after that all of these other doors just continue to pop up for him and  Just keep pushing folks. Don't don't half-ass life. We we really do have a tremendous opportunity right now  Even though this is covet 19 and things are shutting down if you have a passion about something right now  Just keep going for it. Keep living it chad did it  Better than anybody that I can ever realize considering everything that he dealt with with  With with cancer  And people are complaining about wearing a damn mask  Walk in his shoes do what he did  And just be better  And I just wanted to say chad. Thank you so much man for representing our city representing our state  And representing our people  Resilience brother. I love you  And to your sister, i'm not going to say your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We knew we knew chad was different from  From a lot of the kids that we hung out with  Um, you know, he was likable and and you know could party and all of that stuff just like any other teenager  But there was something  different in that whole  theater theater life and the debate life it was  He wasn't like the rest of us and it showed and he just kept pushing along and it's

It's just it is what it is and I was never upset about that  but  I I really appreciated what he represented from the area because  Y'all know how it is in the south. You've heard the horror stories that i've told about the south  and  This being the so-called land of opportunity  It was great to see that he was able to take his opportunities and just really maximize it and then beyond that  give back  To everybody else and just say hey you can do this too  So get on out there do the work get slapped in the face a couple times  But just keep going at it and you know what you can be a freaking superhero  That we used to dream about and look at on the tv screens and movie screens when we were kids and I never  Would have assumed something like that would have happened  Until seeing that with my own eyes. It's kind of amazing. Yeah
